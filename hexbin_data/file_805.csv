Can the COVID-19 crisis help to promote an ideological shift towards a different type of capitalism? By conducting a quantitative content analysis of the international press on the COVID-19 bailout conditionality debate, this article documents the existence of three dominant narratives: the distributive justice, environmental justice, and Marxist-type anti-capitalistic narratives. Yet, only the distributive justice assumed greater prominence during the period of observation, signaling a small step towards an ideological shift in which the general public may become more open to scrutiny of companies’ dividend and bonus policies and more averse to acceptance of tax avoidance and the accumulation of excessive wealth by members of the corporate elite. The article concludes by recommending MNEs and their CEOs to be prepared for more distributive justice challenges in the future.","Giuliani, Elisa",J Int Bus Policy,805,22

CO2 absorbent usage remains poorly quantified. The goal of this study is to determine canister life of 8 commercially available CO2 absorbent prepacks with the Zeus®. Pre-packed CO2 canisters of 8 different brands were tested in vitro: Amsorb Plus, Spherasorb, LoFloSorb, LithoLyme, SpiraLith, SpheraSorb, Drägersorb 800+, Drägersorb Free, and CO2ntrol. CO2 (160 mL min- 1) flowed into the tip of a 2 L breathing bag that was ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, a respiratory rate of 10/min, and an I:E ratio of 1:1 using the controlled mechanical ventilation mode of the Zeus® (Dräger, Lubeck, Germany). In part I, canister life of 5 canisters each of 2 different lots of each brand was determined with a 350 mL min- 1 FGF. Canister life is the time it takes for the inspired CO2 concentration (FICO2) to rise to 0.5%. In part II, canister life was measured accross a FGF range of 0.25 to 4 L min- 1 for Drägersorb 800+ (2 lots) and SpiraLith (1 lot). In part III, the calculated canister life per 100 g fresh granule content of the different brands was compared between the Zeus and (previously published data for) the Aisys. In vitro canister life of prefilled CO2 absorber canisters differed between brands, and depended on the amount of CO2 absorbent and chemical composition. Canister life expressed as FCU0.5 (the fraction of the canister used per hour) was proportional to FGF over 0.2-2 L min-1 range only, but was non-linear with higher FGF: FCU0.5 was larger than expected with FGF > 2 L min-1, and even with FGF > minute ventilation FCU0.5 did not become zero, indicating some CO2 was being absorbed. Canister life on a per weight basis of the same brand is higher with the Zeus than the Aisys. Canister life of prefilled CO2 absorber canisters differs between brands. The FCU0.5-FGF relationship is not linear across the entire FGF range. Canister life of prepacks of the same brand for the Zeus and Aisys differs, the exact etiology of which is probably multifactorial, and may include differences in the absolute amount of absorbent and different rebreathing characteristics of the machines.","Omer, Mohab; Hendrickx, Jan F A; De Ridder, Simon; De Houwer, Alexander; Carette, Rik; De Cooman, Sofie; De Wolf, Andre M",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,805,20

In this work, three series of derivatives (compounds 3, 4, and 5) were designed, synthesized, and their biological activities were investigated as potential HpFabZ inhibitors in a two phased manner. First, we designed and synthesized two series of derivatives (3a-r and 4a-u) and evaluated the enzyme-based assay against HpFabZ. Five compounds (3i-k, 3m, and 3q) showed potential inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values less than 2 muM. Second, a focused combinatorial library containing 280 molecules was designed employing the LD1.0 program. Twelve compounds (5a-l) were selected and synthesized. The activity of the most potent compound 5h (IC(50) = 0.86 muM) was 46 times higher than that of the hit 1. The high hit rate and the potency of the new HpFabZ inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy for the focused library design and virtual screening.","He, Lingyan; Zhang, Liang; Liu, Xiaofeng; Li, Xianghua; Zheng, Mingyue; Li, Honglin; Yu, Kunqian; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang; Liu, Hong",Journal of medicinal chemistry,805,29

In patients with Type-2 mediated biology, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has a role in assessment and monitoring of adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. RECENT FINDINGS Asthmatic patients with elevated FeNO are at an increased risk of exacerbation. High FeNO is often secondary to suboptimal adherence to inhaled corticosteroid treatment, whether intentional or nonintentional. FENO-suppression can 'unmask' underlying adherence issues and is a useful test in the presence of Type-2 biology in the 'difficult-to-control' asthma population. Identification of nonadherence can improve asthma control and prevent inappropriate commencement of costly biologic therapies. SUMMARY Assessment of adherence and FeNO response to monitored inhaled corticosteroid in Type-2 biomarker high asthmatic individuals may prevent unnecessary escalation to biologic therapy. Establishing an 'optimised' FeNO may alert clinicians to the possibility of underlying nonadherence at future clinical assessments.","Butler, Claire A; Heaney, Liam G",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,805,1

StIm-AEM having an ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 0.54 mmol g-1 with a grafting degree (GD) of ∼18%, possesses practical conductivity (>50 mS cm-1) even with a very low water uptake (∼10%) and high stability over 600 h in a 1 M KOH solution at 80 °C. There exists a critical IEC (IECc) in the range of 0.7-0.8 mmol g-1 over which the membrane showed high water uptake, which resulted in pronounced susceptibility to hydrolysis. Using small-angle neutron scattering technique with a contrast variation method, we found the hydrophilic phase in StIm-AEMs with IECs lower and higher than IECc shows ""reverse-micelles"" with water domains dispersed in the polymer matrix and ""micelles"" with graft polymer aggregates dispersed in the water matrix, respectively. The further analysis of micelle structures using the hard-sphere liquid model and Porod limit analysis reveals that the interfacial structures of ionic groups are essential for the electrochemical properties and durability of StIm-AEMs. In addition, StIm-AEM with an IEC of 0.95 mmol g-1 and the maximum power density of 80 mW cm-2 in the hydrazine hydrate fuel cell test, exhibited long-term durability under constant current (8.0 mA) up to 455 h, which, thus far, is the best durability at 80 °C for platinum-free alkaline-type liquid fuel cells.","Zhao, Yue; Yoshimura, Kimio; Mahmoud, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed; Yu, Hwan-Chul; Okushima, Shun; Hiroki, Akihiro; Kishiyama, Yoshihiro; Shishitani, Hideyuki; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Tanaka, Hirohisa; Noda, Yohei; Koizumi, Satoshi; Radulescu, Aurel; Maekawa, Yasunari",Soft matter,805,17

Recent results integrate grasp analysis with arm motion planning to compute optimal smooth arm motions; however, computation times on the order of tens of seconds dominate motion times. Recent advances in deep learning allow neural networks to quickly compute these motions; however, they lack the precision required to produce kinematically and dynamically feasible motions. While infeasible, the network-computed motions approximate the optimized results. The proposed method warm starts the optimization process by using the approximate motions as a starting point from which the optimizing motion planner refines to an optimized and feasible motion with few iterations. In experiments, the proposed deep learning-based warm-started optimizing motion planner reduces compute and motion time when compared to a sampling-based asymptotically optimal motion planner and an optimizing motion planner. When applied to grasp-optimized motion planning, the results suggest that deep learning can reduce the computation time by two orders of magnitude (300×), from 29 s to 80 ms, making it practical for e-commerce warehouse picking.","Ichnowski, Jeffrey; Avigal, Yahav; Satish, Vishal; Goldberg, Ken",Science robotics,805,24

While rural health theory recognizes the importance of the social determinants of health, there is a lack of insight into public perspectives for improving rural health beyond the provision of health-care services. Gaining insight into perceived solutions, that include and go beyond health- care, can help to inform resource allocation decisions to improve rural health. OBJECTIVE To identify and describe shared perspectives within a remote-rural community on how to improve rural health. METHOD Using Q methodology, a set of 40 statements were developed representing different perceptions of how to improve rural health. Residents of one remote-rural island community ranked this statement set according to their level of agreement. Card-sorts were analysed using factor analysis to identify shared points of view and interpreted alongside post-sort qualitative interviews. RESULTS Sixty-two respondents participated in the study. Four shared perspectives were identified, labelled: Local economic activity; Protect and care for the community; Redistribution of resources; and Investing in people. Factors converged on the need to relieve poverty and ensure access to amenities and services. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Factors represent different elements of a multifaceted theory of rural health, indicating that 'lay' respondents are capable of comprehending various approaches to health improvement and perspectives are not homogenous within rural communities. Respondents diverged on the role of individuals, the public sector and 'empowered' community-based organizations in delivering these solutions, with implications for policy and practice.

Furthermore, there are no other BSL-4 laboratories in operation in Japan. The evidence indicates that infectious BSL-4 pathogens such as Ebola and Marburg viruses cannot be manipulated in Japan, making it impossible to study the BSL-4 pathogens using the infectious viruses. A large-scale outbreak of ebolavirus disease (EVD) has occurred in the western Africa such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Furthermore, the highly pathogenic pathogens' infectious diseases outbreaks such as SARS, Nipah encephalitis, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have emerged in the world. However, BSL-4 laboratories are not present in Japan, making it difficult to study these pathogens and infectious diseases. Because these emerging virus infections are caused by the zoonotic pathogens, the eradiation and the elimination of these infectious diseases are impossible. We need to develop the diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventive measures based on the studies of the highly pathogenic pathogens more in detail using the infectious microbes.

METHODS Four pigs were used in this study. After general anesthesia, six different trocars were randomly inserted at preselected locations in the porcine abdominal wall. The hydration status of the animals was monitored and maintained. A bag mounted on a FLIP was used to profile the geometry of the trocar holes during distension. After the FLIP study, the abdominal wall surrounding the trocar holes was harvested. The tissue was fixed in neutral 10% buffered formalin solution for more than 24 h. The samples contained control tissue (undamaged) and test tissue (damaged) through the entire rectangular tissue block. Approximately four to seven slides were cut parallel to the surface from each sample. Each slide was photographed, and the morphometry of the hole and damaged areas were measured and displayed three-dimensionally. The histologic sections were analyzed with regard to acute damage, bleeding, and acute inflammation of the skin, muscle, and fascia. RESULTS The FLIP study demonstrated differences between the six trocars. These were mainly due to differences between the Versaport Plus V2 bladed trocar with the smooth cannula, the Applied Medical Separator nonbladed access system with threaded cannula, and the VersaStep Plus trocar. The morphometry data showed the smallest hole and damage areas for the Versaport Plus V2 bladed trocar with the smooth cannula. The damaged area divided by the trocar hole area was smallest for the VersaStep plus trocar and the Ethicon Endopath bladed trocar with a stability cannula (p < 0.05). The histologic analysis showed that the VersaStep Plus trocar and the Ethicon Endopath bladed trocar with a stability cannula gave the least bleeding and inflammation (p < 0.05).

Artemisinin-induced dormancy, shown in vitro and in animal models, provides a plausible explanation. To date, direct evidence of artemisinin-induced dormancy in humans is lacking. METHODS Blood samples were collected from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7- or K13-infected participants before and 48-72 hours after single dose artesunate (AS) treatment. Parasite morphology, molecular signature of dormancy, capability and dynamics of seeding in vitro cultures, and genetic mutations in the K13 gene were investigated. RESULTS Dormant parasites were observed in post-AS blood samples of 3D7- and K13-infected participants. The molecular signature of dormancy, an up-regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, was detected in 3D7 and K13 samples post-AS, but not in pre-AS samples. Post-treatment samples successfully seeded in vitro cultures, with a significant delay in time to reach 2% parasitemia compared to pre-treatment samples. CONCLUSION This study provides strong evidence for the presence of artemisinin-induced dormant parasites in P. falciparum infections. These parasites are a likely reservoir for recrudescent infection following artemisinin monotherapy and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). Combination regimens that target dormant parasites or remain at therapeutic levels for a sufficient time to kill recovering parasites will likely improve efficacy of ACTs.","Peatey, Christopher; Chen, Nanhua; Gresty, Karryn; Anderson, Karen; Pickering, Paul; Watts, Rebecca; Gatton, Michelle L; McCarthy, James; Cheng, Qin",The Journal of infectious diseases,805,1

METHODS Data were retrieved from an institutional database of consecutive VATS lobectomies between January 1st 2007 and December 31st 2013. Patients were grouped into CL or SL. Patient characteristics, operative data, converted procedures, complications, and mortality was compared using Pearson Chi square, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS In total 80 CL and 958 SLs were performed. There were no significant differences in median operating time, median chest drain duration or median length of stay. Median operative bleeding was 100 mL (IQR 50-238) in the CL group compared to 75 mL (IQR 25-200) in the SL group (p = 0.01). There were no differences between groups in major or minor complications. Median time from VATS wedge resection to CL was 33 days (IQR 27-41). Conversion rate was 1.3% in the CL group and 2.6% in the SL group (p = 0.72). 30-day mortality was 0 vs. 1.1 % for the CL group and the SL group accordingly (p > 0.99). CONCLUSIONS This study comparing short-term surgical outcome and complications after surgical treatment of NSCLC indicates that VATS completion lobectomy after diagnostic wedge resection seems safe when looking at a relatively short time interval between the two procedures.","Holbek, Bo Laksáfoss; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,805,16

STUDY DESIGN This was a prospective observational study using near-infrared spectroscopy to evaluate changes in rpSO₂ and rcSO₂. These variables were measured during the first 15 minutes of life after elective cesarean delivery. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and heart rate were measured continuously by pulse oximetry, and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) was calculated. Two groups were compared based on their need for respiratory support: a respiratory support group and a normal transition group. Positive-pressure ventilation was delivered with a T-piece resuscitator, and oxygen was adjusted based on SpO₂ values. A Florian respiratory function monitor was used to record the ventilation variables. RESULTS There were 21 infants in the normal transition group and 21 infants in the respiratory support group. Changes in heart rate over time were similar in the 2 groups. SpO₂, rcSO₂, and rpSO₂ values were consistently higher in the normal transition group. In the respiratory support group, cFTOE values remained significantly elevated for a longer period. CONCLUSION This systematic analysis of rpSO₂, rcSO₂, and cFTOE in late preterm infants found significantly lower oxygen saturation values in infants who received respiratory support compared with a normal transition group. We hypothesize that the elevated cFTOE values in the respiratory support group represent compensation for lower oxygen delivery.","Binder, Corinna; Urlesberger, Berndt; Avian, Alexander; Pocivalnik, Mirjam; Müller, Wilhelm; Pichler, Gerhard",The Journal of pediatrics,805,31

From a commercial perspective, purchase of articulating instruments is advised. However, here we present our early experience with single-incision laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy with standard laparoscopic instrumentation. METHOD Between June 2010 and December 2011, 25 patients presenting with malignant disease underwent single-incision laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy. Four different ports (SILS™ port, Covidien; SSL(®) Access system, Ethicon; X-Cone/S-Portal(®) , Storz; and OCTO™ port, AFS Medical) were used. Patients were recruited prospectively and all data were processed retrospectively. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in our study (and their characteristics, described later in this paragraph, are expressed as median (range)). Four conversions to standard laparoscopy were performed. The age of patients was 69 (36-89) years, and they had a body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 (19.1-34.2). The duration of surgery was 110 (70-148) min with a healed skin incision length of 35 (20-60) mm. Hospital stay was 5 (2-15) days. In four patients discharge was delayed because of comorbidity. One patient suffered an overwhelming pneumonia. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopy using standard laparoscopic instruments appears to be a safe and feasible technique for malignant disease requiring right hemicolectomy. Randomized, prospective trials are ongoing to prove the benefits of this technique and to compare its oncological outcome measures with those of conventional laparoscopy. In our experience, a low-profile port with a wide intra-abdominal range of motion is most preferable.","Mufty, H; Hillewaere, S; Appeltans, B; Houben, B",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,805,7

The objectives of our study were to describe patterns of COVID-19 testing among LGBTQ+ people and to differentiate rates of COVID-19 testing and test results by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS Participants residing in the United States and US territories (N = 1090) aged ≥18 completed an internet-based survey from May through July 2020 that assessed COVID-19 testing and test results and sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We analyzed data on receipt and results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS Of the 1090 participants, 182 (16.7%) received a PCR test; of these, 16 (8.8%) had a positive test result. Of the 124 (11.4%) who received an antibody test, 45 (36.3%) had antibodies. Rates of PCR testing were higher among participants who were non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born (16.3%) and employed full-time or part-time (18.5%) versus unemployed (10.8%). Antibody testing rates were higher among gay cisgender men (17.2%) versus other SOGI groups, non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born participants, employed (12.6%) versus unemployed participants, and participants residing in the Northeast (20.0%) versus other regions. Among SOGI groups with sufficient cell sizes (n > 10), positive PCR results were highest among cisgender gay men (16.1%). CONCLUSIONS The differential patterns of testing and positivity, particularly among gay men in our sample, confirm the need to create COVID-19 public health messaging and programming that attend to the LGBTQ+ population.","Martino, Richard J; Krause, Kristen D; Griffin, Marybec; LoSchiavo, Caleb; Comer-Carruthers, Camilla; Karr, Anita G; Bullock, Allie F; Halkitis, Perry N",Public health reports,805,31

HBoV was first described in 2005 and has since been detected in respiratory tract secretions worldwide. Herein we review the literature on HBoV and discuss the biology and potential clinical impact of this virus. Most studies have been PCR based and performed on patients with acute respiratory symptoms, from whom HBoV was detected in 2 to 19% of the samples. HBoV-positive samples have been derived mainly from infants and young children. HBoV DNA has also been detected in the blood of patients with respiratory tract infection and in fecal samples of patients with diarrhea with or without concomitant respiratory symptoms. A characteristic feature of HBoV studies is the high frequency of coinciding detections, or codetections, with other viruses. Available data nevertheless indicate a statistical association between HBoV and acute respiratory tract disease. We present a model incorporating these somewhat contradictory findings and suggest that primary HBoV infection causes respiratory tract symptoms which can be followed by prolonged low-level virus shedding in the respiratory tract. Detection of the virus in this phase will be facilitated by other infections, either simply via increased sample cell count or via reactivation of HBoV, leading to an increased detection frequency of HBoV during other virus infections. We conclude that the majority of available HBoV studies are limited by the sole use of PCR diagnostics on respiratory tract secretions, addressing virus prevalence but not disease association. The ability to detect primary infection through the development of improved diagnostic methods will be of great importance for future studies seeking to assign a role for HBoV in causing respiratory illnesses.","Schildgen, Oliver; Müller, Andreas; Allander, Tobias; Mackay, Ian M; Völz, Sebastian; Kupfer, Bernd; Simon, Arne",Clinical microbiology reviews,805,1

These single-atom photocatalysts were successfully prepared with Ni2+, Pt2+ or Ru3+ by cation exchange, using poly(heptazine imides) (PHI) as the 2D layered platform. Differences in photocatalytic performance for these metals were assessed using rhodamine-B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) as model compounds for degradation. We have demonstrated that single atoms may either improve or impair the degradation of RhB and MO, depending on the proper matching of the net charge of these molecules and the surface potential of the catalyst, which in turn is responsive to the metal incorporated into the PHI nanostructures. Computer simulations demonstrated that even one transition metal cation caused dramatic changes in the electronic structure of PHI, especially regarding light absorption, which was extended all along the visible up to the near IR region. Besides introducing new quantum states, the metal atoms strongly polarized the molecular orbitals across the PHI and electrostatic fields arising from the electronic transitions became at least tenfold stronger. This simple proof of concept demonstrates that these new materials hold promise as tools for many important photocatalytic reactions that are strongly dependent on our ability to control surface charge and its polarization under illumination, such as H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and photooxidation in general.","Colombari, Felippe M; da Silva, Marcos A R; Homsi, Mauricio S; de Souza, Beatriz R L; Araujo, Milenny; Francisco, Juliana L; da Silva, Gelson T S T; Silva, Ingrid F; de Moura, André F; Teixeira, Ivo F",Faraday discussions,805,1

We propose that speech-language pathologists can use the widespread experience of social isolation as a learning catalyst in the effort to shift the LTC culture to one that more highly values a communicative environment that is accessible to all, thereby reducing risk of social isolation for those with communication disorders. Conclusions Many training paradigms for promoting an accessible communicative environment are available in the speech-language pathology literature, yet institutional barriers exist for their widespread implementation. Overcoming these barriers is a challenge that requires awareness and learning on the part of staff and administration regarding the impact of an unfriendly communicative environment on social isolation, and the resulting psychosocial consequences. Learning theory indicates that new learning in adults is motivated by connections between personal experiences and the material to be learned. Explicitly infusing established training programs with the experience of social isolation brought on by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic may be the key needed for changing the communicative environment in LTC.","Leaman, Marion C; Azios, Jamie H",American journal of speech-language pathology,805,17

To gain insight into this relationship, particularly with respect to immune responses, we utilized the rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two cohorts of eight older (16-23 years) and eight younger (3-5 years) rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Animals were evaluated using viral RNA quantification, clinical observations, thoracic radiographs, single-cell transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, cytokine detection, and lipidomics analysis at pre-defined timepoints in various tissues. Differences in clinical signs, pulmonary infiltrates, and virus replication dynamics were limited between age cohorts. Transcriptional signatures of inflammation-associated genes in cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 3 dpi revealed efficient mounting of innate immune defenses in both younger and older animals. These findings suggested that age did not substantially skew major facets of acute disease in this model. However, age-specific divergence of immune responses emerged during the post-acute phase of infection (7-21 dpi). Older animals exhibited sustained local inflammatory innate responses while local effector T-cell responses were induced earlier in the younger animals. Circulating lipid mediator and cytokine levels highlighted increased repair-associated signals in the younger animals, in contrast to persistent pro-inflammatory responses in the older animals. In summary, despite similar disease outcomes, multi-omics profiling in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques suggests that age may delay or impair the induction of anti-viral cellular immune responses and delay efficient return to immune homeostasis following acute infection.","Speranza, Emily; Purushotham, Jyothi N.; Port, Julia R.; Schwarz, Benjamin; Flagg, Meaghan; Williamson, Brandi N.; Feldmann, Friederike; Singh, Manmeet; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Sturdevant, Gail L.; Roberts, Lydia M.; Carmody, Aaron; Schulz, Jonathan E.; Doremalen, Neeltje van; Okumura, Atsushi; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W.; Shaia, Carl; Germain, Ronald N.; Best, Sonja M.; Munster, Vincent J.; Bosio, Catharine M.; de Wit, Emmie",bioRxiv,805,19

Potential mechanisms of immune activity were assessed using an adoptive transfer system. Mice deficient in recombinase-activating gene function (RAG1(-/-)), defective in B- and T-cell maturation, become persistently infected with MHV but do not develop demyelination. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from mice immunized to MHV into RAG1(-/-) mice infected with an attenuated strain of the virus results in the rapid and progressive development of demyelination. Most striking, adoptive transfer resulted, within 5 to 6 days, in extensive recruitment of activated macrophages/microglia to sites of demyelination within the spinal cord. Clearance of virus antigen occurred preferentially from the gray matter of the spinal cord. Apoptotic cells were identified in both the gray and white matter of the central nervous system (CNS) from RAG1(-/-) mice before and after adoptive transfer, with a moderate increase in number, but not distribution, of apoptotic cells following the development of demyelination. These results suggest that apoptosis following MHV-JHM infection of the murine CNS is not sufficient to cause demyelination. These results, showing that macrophage recruitment and myelin destruction occur rapidly after immune reconstitution of RAG(-/-) mice, suggest that this will be a useful system for investigating MHV-induced demyelination.","Wu, G F; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,805,16

METHOD: CAD scheme first applies two image preprocessing steps to remove the majority of diaphragm regions, process the original image using a histogram equalization algorithm, and a bilateral low-pass filter. Then, the original image and two filtered images are used to form a pseudo color image. This image is fed into three input channels of a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images into 3 classes of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, other community-acquired no-COVID-19 infected pneumonia, and normal (non-pneumonia) cases. To build and test the CNN model, a publicly available dataset involving 8474 chest X-ray images is used, which includes 415, 5179 and 2,880 cases in three classes, respectively. Dataset is randomly divided into 3 subsets namely, training, validation, and testing with respect to the same frequency of cases in each class to train and test the CNN model. RESULTS: The CNN-based CAD scheme yields an overall accuracy of 94.5 % (2404/2544) with a 95 % confidence interval of [0.93,0.96] in classifying 3 classes. CAD also yields 98.4 % sensitivity (124/126) and 98.0 % specificity (2371/2418) in classifying cases with and without COVID-19 infection. However, without using two preprocessing steps, CAD yields a lower classification accuracy of 88.0 % (2239/2544). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that adding two image preprocessing steps and generating a pseudo color image plays an important role in developing a deep learning CAD scheme of chest X-ray images to improve accuracy in detecting COVID-19 infected pneumonia.","Heidari, Morteza; Mirniaharikandehei, Seyedehnafiseh; Khuzani, Abolfazl Zargari; Danala, Gopichandh; Qiu, Yuchen; Zheng, Bin",Int J Med Inform,805,1

Ageing is associated with progressive changes in muscle metabolism and a decline in functional capacity, leading to a loss of independence. Muscle metabolic changes associated with ageing have been linked to alterations in muscle architecture and declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. However, the biological features often attributed to muscle ageing are also seen in controlled studies of physical inactivity (e.g. reduced step-count and bed-rest), and it is currently unclear how many of these ageing features are due to ageing per se or sedentarism. This is particularly relevant at a time of home confinements reducing physical activity levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. Current knowledge gaps include the relative contribution that physical inactivity plays in the development of many of the negative features associated with muscle decline in older age. Similarly, data demonstrating positive effects of government recommended physical activity guidelines on muscle health are largely non-existent. It is imperative therefore that research examining interactions between ageing, physical activity and muscle mass and metabolic health is prioritised so that it can inform on the ""normal"" muscle ageing process and on strategies for improving health span and well-being. This review will focus on important changes in muscle architecture and metabolism that accompany ageing and highlight the likely contribution of physical inactivity to these changes.","Shur, N F; Creedon, L; Skirrow, S; Atherton, P J; MacDonald, I A; Lund, J; Greenhaff, P L",Ageing Res Rev,805,6

However, little is known about its impact on gaze-mediated attentional orienting in the context of its interplay with strategic top-down control. Here, we aimed at investigating how the social component of eye contact interacts with the top-down strategic control. To this end, we designed a gaze cuing paradigm with the iCub humanoid robot, in which iCub either established eye contact with the participants before averting its gaze or avoided their eyes. Across four experiments, we manipulated gaze cue validity to either elicit strategic top-down inhibitory activity (25% validity) or to allow for relaxing the control mechanisms (50% validity). Also, we manipulated the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) to examine the dynamics of the top-down modulatory effects. Our results showed that eye contact influenced the gaze cuing effect when the strategic control was not required, by prolonging the prioritized processing of the gazed-at locations. Thus, the effect was observed only when the measurement was taken after a sufficient amount of time (1,000 ms SOA). However, when inhibitory control was necessary (25% validity), the social component was not potent enough to exert influence over the gaze cuing effect independently. Overall, we propose that strategic top-down control is the primary driving force over the gaze cuing effect and that the social aspect plays a modulatory effect by prolonging prioritized processing of gazed-at locations.

By contrast, subjects with antibodies had an excess risk for sick leave in the weeks prior to testing [adjusted OR in multivariate analysis: 3.34 (2.98-3.74)]. Thus, presence of viral antibodies marks past disease and protection against excess risk of future disease.

However, there is little information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Latin America. The present study evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs in Mexico. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study that included 164 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to 10 ICUs in Mexico, from April 1 to April 30, 2020. Demographic data, comorbid conditions, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. The date of final follow-up was June 4, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients with severe COVID-19 were included in this study. The mean age of patients was 57.3 years (SD 13.7), 114 (69.5%) were men, and 6.0% were healthcare workers. Comorbid conditions were common in patients with critical COVID-19: 38.4% of patients had hypertension and 32.3% had diabetes. Compared to survivors, nonsurvivors were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension or other conditions. Patients presented to the hospital a median of 7 days (IQR 4.5-9) after symptom onset. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath, fever, dry cough, and myalgias. One hundred percent of patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median time of 11 days (IQR 6-14). A total of 139 of 164 patients (89.4%) received vasopressors, and 24 patients (14.6%) received renal replacement therapy during hospitalization. Eighty-five (51.8%) patients died at or before 30 days, with a median survival of 25 days. Age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; p<0.001) and C-reactive protein levels upon ICU admission (1.008; 95% CI, 1.003-1.012; p<0.001) were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. ICU length of stay was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality risk (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU in Mexico demonstrated that age and C-reactive protein level upon ICU admission were associated with in-hospital mortality, and the overall hospital mortality rate was high.

A total of 36 patients had hypoxemic pneumonia (23.1%) due to COVID-19. Thirty of these cases (83.3%) were imported by travelers returning mainly from metropolitan France and Spain. Patients were screened for co-infection with other pathogens at admission: 31 (86.1%) by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16 (44.4%) by cytobacteriological examination of sputum culture. Five patients (13.9%) were found to have co-infection: 1 with influenza virus A H1N1 (pdm09) associated with Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 with Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with Haemophilus influenzae, 1 with Human Coronavirus 229E, 1 with Rhinovirus, and 1 with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with co-infection had higher D-dimer levels than those without co-infection (1.36 [1.34-2.36] µg/mL vs 0.63 [0.51-1.12] µg/mL, Pâ=â.05).The incidence of co-infection in our cohort was higher than expected (13.9%). Three co-infections (with influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus) required specific treatment. Patients with hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19 should be screened for co-infection using respiratory cultures or multiplex PCR. Whilst our study has a number of limitations, the results from our study suggest that in the absence of screening, patients should be commenced on treatment for co-infection in the presence of an elevated D-dimer.","Allou, Nicolas; Larsen, Kevin; Dubernet, Arthur; Traversier, Nicolas; Masse, Laurie; Foch, Emilie; Bruneau, Léa; Maillot, Adrien; André, Michel; Lagrange-Xelot, Marie; Allyn, Jérôme; Thomas, Vincent; Coolen-Allou, Nathalie",Medicine (Baltimore),805,21

It is mostly caused by untreated hydatid cyst, liver abscess, iatrogenic stenosis, and, rarely, trauma. CASE PRESENTATION: We experienced an extremely rare case of bronchobiliary fistula after motor vehicle accident. A 15-year-old Persian boy visited our clinic with chief complaints of persistent pleuritic chest pain, productive cough, weight loss, and fever for 2 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test was negative. Chest X-ray revealed hazy opacification of right lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage for acid-fast bacillus came back negative. Thoracoabdominal computed tomography scan revealed a collection in segment VIII of the liver communicating with another 13 × 5 cm multiloculated collection in the lower lobe of the right lung, with air foci within the collection. Right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed with the impression of bronchobiliary fistula. Drainage of hepatic collection with debridement, diaphragmatic repair, and open decortication of lung followed by resection of the involved segment of the right lung was performed. Histopathologic evaluations revealed abscess formation in pulmonary tissue, and many multinucleated giant cells were seen that appear to be due to foreign body remnants after previous laparotomy surgery. The foreign body seemed to be the remnants of Surgicel absorbable hemostat. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report an extremely rare case of a posttraumatic bronchobiliary fistula caused by remnants of Surgicel hemostatic agent. Bronchobiliary fistula is mainly caused by untreated hydatid cyst, liver abscess, iatrogenic stenosis, and, rarely, trauma. Migration and erosion of oxidized regenerated cellulose through the diaphragm seems to be the causative factor of bronchobiliary fistula in this patient.","Seyed-Alagheband, Seyed-Ahmad; Shahmoradi, Mohammad-Kazem; Shekouhi, Ramin",J Med Case Rep,805,16

Participants were asked to compare the pandemic with an animal and with a color, and to provide contextual sensemaking about their metaphors. A metaphor analysis revealed four convergent mental models of participants' pandemic experiences (i.e., uncertainty, danger, grotesque, and misery) as well as four primary emotions associated with those mental models (i.e., grief, disgust, anger, and fear). Through metaphor, participants were able to articulate deeply felt, implicit emotions about their pandemic experiences that were otherwise obscured and undiscussable. Theoretical and practical implications of these collective mental models and associated collective emotions related to the unprecedented collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Stanley, B Liahnna; Zanin, Alaina C; Avalos, Brianna L; Tracy, Sarah J; Town, Sophia",Qual Health Res,805,10

NA therapy was stopped in 12 (12%) patients (preventive group), and in 16 (53%) patients (on-demand group). After the cessation of NA therapy, the cumulative rates of relapse were 36% and 39% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. High levels of HBsAg both at baseline and at the cessation of NA therapy were related to the occurrence of relapse. Relapse did not occur in patients with HBsAg levels <20 IU/ml (preventive group). HBV relapse occurred in five (33%) patients in the on-demand group. Relapse occurred only in anti-HBs-negative patients at the cessation of NA therapy. There were no cases of hepatitis flare after the cessation of NA therapy. HBsAg predicted HBV relapse after the cessation of NA therapy in HBsAg-positive patients.

Methods The clinical manifestations and treatment of 62 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hainan Province People's Hospital during the period from January 21 to February 10, 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The COVID-19 patients were classified into 3 groups: general, severe and critical types according to the disease severity and the white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were compared between the 3 groups. The 62 patients were given symptomatic and supportive, antiviral, hormonal and Chinese herbal treatment. Results 79.03% (49/62) of patients had a history of traveling or living in Wuhan. The incubation period was (6.85±4.45) d. The clinical features including fever (80.65%), dry cough (62.9%), fatigue (25.81%), shortness of breath (19.35%), and dyspnea (14.52%), sore throat (9.68%), nasal congestion and runny nose (9.68%), muscle soreness (8.06%), diarrhea, vomiting (3.23%), and nausea (4.84%). 95.16% (59/62) of patients had normal or relatively low white blood cell counts. There were statistically significant differences in the counts of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes between the 3 groups of the patients (P&lt;0.05). 77.78% (7/9) of the critically ill patients with lymphocyte counts below 0.8×109/L. 90.32% (56/62) of patients typically presented with single or multiple lung lobes/ segments showing ground glass shadow. The average time for CT and CR showing progress and starting to improve and absorb was (9.05±3.75) d and (14.94±7.32) d, respectively. The total course of disease among the 57 discharged patients was 9-38 d, with an average of (21.05±7.17) d. The length of hospital stay was 8-34 d, with an average hospital stay of (15.32±6.49) d. After treatment, the time of the negative mutation of the novel coronavirus was (11.56±6.56) d. Obvious dyspnea occurred in 9 critically ill patients, among them 7 patients needed invasive ventilator support and 2 non-invasive ventilator support. Conclusions In the early clinical stage of COVID-19, fever is the main manifestation. Individual patients are asymptomatic. CT is characterized by ground glass-like changes. Critical patients have significant dyspnea, which can be accompanied by kidney damage. If lung imaging suggests a rapid progress of inflammatory exudation, CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) and respiratory support therapy can be given on an individual basis.","Zhong, Shao-Hua; Lin, Feng; Shi, Li",Med.

Precise analysis of complex neural circuits requires high-density integration of multiple cellular-size light sources and recording electrodes. However, high-density integration inevitably introduces stimulation artifact. We present minimal-stimulation-artifact (miniSTAR) µLED optoelectrodes that enable effective elimination of stimulation artifact. A multi-metal-layer structure with a shielding layer effectively suppresses capacitive coupling of stimulation signals. A heavily boron-doped silicon substrate silences the photovoltaic effect induced from LED illumination. With transient stimulation pulse shaping, we reduced stimulation artifact on miniSTAR µLED optoelectrodes to below 50 µVpp, much smaller than a typical spike detection threshold, at optical stimulation of >50 mW mm-2 irradiance. We demonstrated high-temporal resolution (<1 ms) opto-electrophysiology without any artifact-induced signal quality degradation during in vivo experiments. MiniSTAR µLED optoelectrodes will facilitate functional mapping of local circuits and discoveries in the brain.","Kim, Kanghwan; Vöröslakos, Mihály; Seymour, John P; Wise, Kensall D; Buzsáki, György; Yoon, Euisik",Nat Commun,805,1
371809,371809,371809,Use of Bookwalter Retractor to Create a Working Space for Tracheostomy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic-Reply,21.604214,10.05519,2020,"This study has two goals. The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 that is generating a high level of deaths. The second is to suggest a strategy to cope with future epidemic threats similar to COVID-19 having an accelerated viral infectivity in society. Using data on sample of N = 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 µm or less in diameter) or ozone. In particular, hinterland cities with average high number of days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (and also having a low wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean is about 2200 infected individuals, with average polluted days greater than 80 days per year), whereas coastal cities also having days exceeding the limits set for PM10 or ozone but with high wind speed have about 944.70 average infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days per year; moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM10), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution per year, they have a lower average number of infected people (about 1014 individuals). The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals or similar industrialized cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days. Moreover, results here reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities seems to be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion of viral infectivity (on 17th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p < 0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p < 0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b'1 = 0.81, p < 0.001) also because of the indirect effect of lockdown, whereas regression coefficient of transmission based on interpersonal contacts has a stable level (b'2 = 0.31, p < 0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of ""air pollution-to-human transmission"" (airborne viral infectivity) rather than ""human-to-human transmission"". Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region and/or city (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study here suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is also to apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities- (having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and number of fog days) -that seem to have an environment that foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, medicine, healthcare and health sector.","Coccia, Mario",Sci Total Environ,805,1

High hospitalization levels due to the pandemic outbreak have caused the intensive care units to work above capacity. PURPOSE: A data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling approach was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of regions (i.e. city, country or clinical commissioning groups) against the pandemic outbreak. The objective is to enable related authorities better manage the struggle against the outbreak and put in place the emergency action plans immediately. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DEA method was used to measure the efficiency scores of countries. Super efficiency DEA method was also applied to countries based on the level of efficiencies they have achieved. Sixteen countries were selected that have been facing with Covid19 pandemic outbreak for at least 5 consecutive weeks after their 100th confirmed case. RESULTS: A total of 80 DEA models were developed, that is, 16 DEA models for each week. The percentage of efficient countries decreased dramatically over time, from 43.75% in the first week to 25% in the fifth week. Unlike most European countries, China and South Korea increased their effectiveness after first week of implementing all the necessary measures. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light into better understanding the effectiveness of policies adopted by countries and their management strategy in dealing with Covid19 pandemic. Our model will enable political leaders to identify inadequate policies as quickly as possible and learn from their peers for more effective decisions.","Ordu, Muhammed; Kirli Akin, Hediye; Demir, Eren",Int. j. health plann. manage,805,23

In this study, we used molecular docking strategies to analyze 2.5-diaminobenzophenone compounds against Malaria and to compare results with the Nelfinavir as a FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitor recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. These efforts identified the potential compounds against SAR-COV-2 Mpro with the docking scores ranges from -6.1 to -7.75 kcal/mol, which exhibited better interactions than the Nelfinavir. Among thirty-six studied, compounds 20c, 24c, 30c, 34c, 35c and 36c showed the highest affinity and involved in forming hydrophobic interactions with Glu166, Thr24, Thr25, and Thr26 residues and forming H-bonding interactions with Gln189, Cys145, and His41residues. Pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity (ADMET) were also determined for identified compounds. This study result in the identification of two compounds 35 and 36 having high binding affinity, good pharmacokinetics properties and lowest toxicity. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds within the active site of 3CLpro was also examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the two complexes remain stable during the entire duration of simulation. We have shown that these two lead molecules would have the potential to act as promising drug-candidates and would be of interest as starting point for designing compounds against the SARS-CoV-2.","Ouassaf, Mebarka; Belaidi, Salah; Mogren Al Mogren, Muneerah; Chtita, Samir; Ullah Khan, Shafi; Thet Htar, Thet",J King Saud Univ Sci,805,16

Cost-effective containment strategies rely on efficiently identifying infected individuals, making the best possible use of the available testing resources. Therefore, quickly identifying the optimal testing strategy is of critical importance. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning can be used to identify which individuals are most beneficial to test, automatically and dynamically adapting the testing strategy to the characteristics of the disease outbreak. Specifically, we simulate an outbreak using the archetypal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model and we use data about the first confirmed cases to train a neural network that learns to make predictions about the rest of the population. Using these prediction, we manage to contain the outbreak more effectively and more quickly than with standard approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used also when there is a possibility of reinfection (SIRS model) to efficiently eradicate an endemic disease.","Natali, Laura; Helgadottir, Saga; Marago, Onofrio M.; Volpe, Giovanni",,805,1

Recently, we discovered a subset of murine ETPs that expresses the IL-4R&#945;/IL-13R&#945;1 heteroreceptor (HR) and commits only to the myeloid lineage. This is because IL-4/IL-13 signaling through the HR inhibits their T cell potential and enacts commitment of HR+ETPs to thymic resident CD11c+CD8&#945;+ dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we discovered that HR+-ETP-derived DCs function as APCs in the thymus and promote deletion of myelin-reactive T cells. Furthermore, this negative T cell selection function of HR+-ETP-derived DCs sustains protection against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for human multiple sclerosis. These findings, while shedding light on the intricacies underlying ETP lineage commitment, reveal a novel, to our knowledge, function by which IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines condition thymic microenvironment to rheostat T cell selection and fine-tune central tolerance.","Barik, Subhasis; Cattin-Roy, Alexis N; Ukah, Tobechukwu K; Miller, Mindy M; Teixeiro, Emma; Zaghouani, Habib",J. immunol,805,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze characteristics of adults with type 1 diabetes for associations with COVID-19 hospitalization. DESIGN: An observational multi-site cross-sectional study was performed. Diabetes providers answered a 33-item questionnaire regarding demographics, symptoms, and diabetes- and COVID-19-related care and outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population, and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between HbA1c, age, and comorbidities and hospitalization. SETTING: Cases were submitted from 52 US sites between March and August 2020. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Adults over the age of 19 with type 1 diabetes and confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 113 cases were analyzed. Fifty-eight patients were hospitalized, and five patients died. Patients who were hospitalized were more likely to be older, to identify as non-Hispanic Black, to use public insurance, or to have hypertension, and less likely to use continuous glucose monitoring or insulin pumps.

These efforts have used various coding frameworks, but many have relied on coding methodologies that may not adequately describe the gradient in social distancing policies as states ""re-open."" METHODS: We developed a COVID-19 social distancing intensity framework that is sufficiently specific and sensitive to capture this gradient. Based on a review of policies from a 12 U.S. state sample, we developed a social distancing intensity framework consisting of 16 domains and intensity scales of 0-5 for each domain. RESULTS: We found that the states with the highest average daily intensity from our sample were Pennsylvania, Washington, Colorado, California, and New Jersey, with Georgia, Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas having the lowest. While some domains (such as restaurants and movie theaters) showed bimodal policy intensity distributions compatible with binary (yes/no) coding, others (such as childcare and religious gatherings) showed broader variability that would be missed without more granular coding. CONCLUSION: This detailed intensity framework reveals the granularity and nuance between social distancing policy responses. Developing standardized approaches for constructing policy taxonomies and coding processes may facilitate more rigorous policy analysis and improve disease modeling efforts.","Lane, Jeff; Garrison, Michelle M; Kelley, James; Sarma, Priya; Katz, Aaron",BMC Med Res Methodol,805,16

The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill-defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists) to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for four inter-related approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: 1) multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency; 2) studies evaluating immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; 3) studies evaluating the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis; and 4) clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19.","Haidar, Ghady; Mellors, John W",Clin. infect. dis,805,16

This study aims to determine the commitment and willingness of medical and nursing students in Sarawak in treating patients with COVID- 19 and its associated factors. METHODS: - It was a cross-sectional study using online questionnaire, carried out in a public university in Sarawak, Malaysia. All medical and nursing students were invited to participate in this study. Data was entered and analysed using IBM SPSS version 22. RESULT: - A total of 304 respondents participated in the study, with 81.6% female and 69.4% medical students. Majority of the respondents were most willing to take a medical history, do a physical examination, throat swabbing, draw blood and perform IV drip insertion. There was a high commitment among respondents to treat COVID-19 patients regardless of personal risks. Majority of the respondents also agreed that medical staff who are involved in treating COVID-19 patients should be receiving a salary increase and compensation should be given to affected healthcare families, and all non-medical staff should be involved in treating COVID-19 patients. About 71% agreed about a law mandating medical staffs to treat patient. CONCLUSION: - The willingness and commitment of medical and nursing students to treat COVID-19 patients was high, indicating their potential work force as healthcare providers.","Lian, Cheah Whye; Wing, Caroline Bungan Francis; Zahari, Arni Nazera Binti; Idris, Atiqah Safawati Binti; Maksul, Nur Aqilah Azra Binti; Yusman, Nurul Ammiera Lyieanna Binti; John, Wanda",Ethics Med Public Health,805,16

In addition to the direct impact of Covid-19 on health, the following recession will have an impact on people's health outcomes. This paper reviews economic literature on the longer run health impacts of business cycle fluctuations and recessions. Previous studies show that an economic downturn, which affects people through increased unemployment, lower incomes and increased uncertainty, will have significant consequences on people's health outcomes both in the short and longer term. The health effects caused by these adverse macroeconomic conditions will be complex, and will differ across generations, regions and socioeconomic groups. Groups that are vulnerable to poor health are likely to be hit hardest even if the crisis hit all individuals equally, and we already see that some groups such as young workers and women are worse hit by the recession than others.

Recently, vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), has been introduced as more effective treatment option. The purpose of this study was to clarify the adverse events associated with vonoprazan compared to PPIs using a spontaneous reporting system database. We performed a retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Adverse event reports submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency between 2004 and 2017 were analyzed, and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each adverse event were calculated. The database comprised 11,433 reports associated with PPIs, and 636 reports with vonoprazan. Hepatic and skin disorders were commonly detected in both PPIs and vonoprazan. There was a significant association of interstitial lung disease with PPIs as a class (ROR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.47-1.77), but not with vonoprazan. Vonoprazan was strongly associated with haemorrhagic enterocolitis (ROR, 86.5; 95%CI, 59.7125). Among the PPIs, the signal score of microscopic colitis was noteworthy in the case of lansoprazole (ROR, 405; 95%CI, 348-472). It is suggested that there is a diversity in the strength of the association between PPIs and vonoprazan with adverse events. Our results may provide useful information for the treatment of acid-related disorders, but further research with more data is needed to finally clarify this.","Kambara, H; Hosohata, K; Nakatsuji, T; Ueno, S; Oyama, S; Inada, A; Niinomi, I; Wakabayashi, T; Iwanaga, K",Pharmazie,805,16

The number of cases has increased rapidly but the auscultatory characteristics of affected patients and how to use it to predict who is most likely to survive or die are not available. This study aims to describe the auscultatory characteristics and its clinical relativity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by using a wireless stethoscope. Material and methods: A cross-sectional, observational, single-center case series of 30 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled from March 9 to April 5, 2020. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and lung auscultation were collected and analyzed. Lung auscultation was acquired by a wireless electronic stethoscope. Auscultatory characteristics of the moderate, severe, and critically ill patients were compared. Results: Kinds of crackles including fine crackles and wheezing were heard and recorded in these patients. Velcro crackles were heard in most critically ill patients (6/10). Besides, patients with Velcro crackles were all dead (6/6). There was no positive lung auscultatory finding in the moderate group and little positive lung auscultatory findings (4/10) in the severe group. Conclusion: Velcro crackles can be auscultated by this newly designed electronic wireless stethoscope in most critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and predicts a poor prognosis. Moderate and severe patients without positive auscultatory findings may have a better prognosis.","Zhang, Pengyu; Wang, Bingjian; Liu, Yan; Fan, Muge; Ji, Yong; Xu, Hao; Xu, Mengdan; Chen, Songwen; Li, Qing; Zhang, Zhi",Int J Med Sci,805,29

Despite the available reviews that summarized its autoimmune/rheumatic manifestations, a systematic approach is still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review in order to give an overview upon these rare but clinically significant manifestations. Methods: We performed a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE as of October 9, 2020. All articles relevant to either systemic or organ-specific autoimmune and rheumatic manifestations potentially associated with COVID-19 were collected. The reviewed literature were limited to adults ≥18 years. Results: Although most of the existing evidence was based on case reports or case series without a long-term follow-up, a variety of autoimmune/rheumatic manifestations were associated with COVID-19. The manifestations that have a consistent association with COVID-19 include autoimmune cytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Such association is conflicting as regards to antiphospholipid syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and myasthenia gravis.

Several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them, with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters. However, the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries. Nevertheless, a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries, which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions. In this paper, infection rate of COVID-19 is modelled globally at a 0.5(∘) resolution, using a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate. The model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical (surface air temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and human-related characteristics (CO(2) and population density). It was trained by facilitating data from Italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from World countries’ reports. Based on this model, a risk index was calculated to identify the potential World countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment. The distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real-world disease outbreaks have occurred, e.g. the Hubei province in China, and reports a high risk of disease increment in most World countries which have reported significant outbreaks (e.g. Western U.S.A.). Overall, the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of COVID-19 among human populations, particularly in Europe. The model and the data were distributed through Open-science Web services to maximise opportunities for re-usability regarding new data and new diseases, and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results.","Coro, Gianpaolo",Ecol Modell,805,20

We also sought to assess improvement in contact tracing timeliness associated with sending SMS-linked surveys. STUDY DESIGN: During December 4–15, 2020, persons identified as COVID-19 cases whose data was entered into Marin County’s contact tracing database on even days received a SMS-linked survey and persons whose data was entered on odd days did not; all were called for case investigation and contact tracing. Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare demographic data. Chi-square test was used to contrast categorical outcomes, and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test was used for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Among 350 SMS-linked survey recipients, 85 (24%) responded and 4 (1%) reported contacts using the survey; an additional 303 contacts were reported during phone interviews. Without phone interviews, 99% of reported contacts would have been missed. There was no meaningful difference between study arms in the proportion of contacts notified within 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This SMS-linked survey had low participation and was not useful for identifying contacts. Phone interviews remained crucial for COVID-19 contact tracing.","Janssen, Julia M.; McGrath, Alana; Rochelle, Ereman; Moonan, Patrick K.; Oeltmann, John E.; Willis, Matt; McCurdy, Stephen A.",Public Health Pract (Oxf),805,21

In infected cells, we detected the actual existence of nsp1α and nsp1β. Cleavage sites between nsp1α/nsp1β and nsp1β/nsp2 were identified by protein microsequencing analysis. Time course study showed that nsp1α and nsp1β mainly localize into the cell nucleus after 10 h post infection. Further analysis revealed that both proteins dramatically inhibited IFN-β expression. The nsp1β was observed to significantly inhibit expression from an interferon-stimulated response element promoter after Sendai virus infection or interferon treatment. It was further determined to inhibit nuclear translocation of STAT1 in the JAK–STAT signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that nsp1β has ability to inhibit both interferon synthesis and signaling, while nsp1α alone strongly inhibits interferon synthesis. These findings provide important insights into mechanisms of nsp1 in PRRSV pathogenesis and its impact in vaccine development.","Chen, Z.; Lawson, S.; Sun, Z.; Zhou, X.; Guan, X.; Christopher-Hennings, J.; Nelson, E.A.; Fang, Y.",Virology,805,22

At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic no population data on calcium levels in patients affected were available and in April 2020 a first case of severe acute hypocalcemia in an Italian patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported. Subsequently, several studies reported hypocalcemia as a highly prevalent biochemical abnormality in COVID-19 patients with a marked negative influence on disease severity, biochemical inflammation and thrombotic markers, and mortality. Also a high prevalence of vertebral fractures with worse respiratory impairment in patients affected and a widespread vitamin D deficiency have been frequently observed, suggesting an emerging “Osteo-Metabolic Phenotype” in COVID-19. To date, several potential pathophysiological factors have been hypothesized to play a role in determining hypocalcemia in COVID-19 including calcium dependent viral mechanisms of action, high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in general population, chronic and acute malnutrition during critical illness and high levels of unbound and unsaturated fatty acids in inflammatory responses. Since hypocalcemia is a frequent biochemical finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients possibly predicting worse outcomes and leading to acute cardiovascular and neurological complications if severe, it is reasonable to assess, monitor and, if indicated, replace calcium at first patient hospital evaluation and during hospitalization.","di Filippo, Luigi; Doga, Mauro; Frara, Stefano; Giustina, Andrea",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,805,1

The objective of this study was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal care and breastfeeding support practices offered by the Spanish maternity hospitals committed to the UNICEF Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), to women with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Implementation of perinatal practices was assessed by a cross-sectional survey conducted in May 2020 using an online questionnaire. Comparison with pre-pandemic situation and level of commitment to BFHI practices was performed. RESULTS: Response rate was 50% (58/116). Mothers with COVID-19 suffered greater restrictions in the practices compared to women without COVID-19, with lower rates of companion of choice during labour (84% vs 100%; p = 0.003), skin-to-skin contact (32% vs 52%; p = 0.04), rooming-in (74% vs 98%; p < 0.001), companion of choice during hospital stay (68% vs 90%; p = 0.006), and breastfeeding support (78% vs 94%; p = 0.02). Practices were significantly less prevalent in COVID-19 mothers compared to pre-pandemic situation. A lower accompaniment rate was observed in non-COVID-19 group during delivery (24% vs 47.9%; p < 0.01). Hospitals with higher commitment to BFHI practices reported higher rates of skin-to-skin contact (45.2% vs 10.5%; p = 0.01) and rooming-in (83.9% vs 57.9%; p < 0.05) in COVID mothers. Fewer restrictions were observed in hospitals located in the regions where the pandemic hit harder. In these regions there was a significantly higher level of BFHI commitment of the hospitals, but no significant differences were observed in the average size of the hospital. All the practices suffered even more restrictions during the first weeks of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: All mothers suffered restrictions in perinatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women with COVID-19 infection suffered more restrictions in perinatal practices than women without infection. The degree of commitment to WHO-UNICEF perinatal quality standards, integrated into the BFHI, was associated with maintenance of good clinical practices.","Muñoz-Amat, Barbara; Pallás-Alonso, Carmen Rosa; Hernández-Aguilar, María-Teresa",Int Breastfeed J,805,20

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. METHODS: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. RESULTS: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 99.67% and 99.77%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS (Dried Blood Spot) matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. CONCLUSION: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.","Krishnamurthy, Hari Krishnan; Jayaraman, Vasanth; Krishna, Karthik; Rajasekaran, Karenah E.; Wang, Tianhao; Bei, Kang; Rajasekaran, John J.; Yaskin, Inna; Rai, Alex J.; Choung, Rok Seon; Murray, Joseph A.",PLoS One,805,16

The first step in the production process is virus inactivation with β-propiolactone (BPL) or formaldehyde (FA). Recommendations for production of inactivated vaccines merely define the maximal concentration for both reagents, leaving the optimization of the process to the manufacturers. We assessed the effect of inactivation with BPL and FA on 5 different influenza virus strains. The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.","Herrera-Rodriguez, José; Signorazzi, Aurora; Holtrop, Marijke; de Vries-Idema, Jacqueline; Huckriede, Anke",Vaccine,805,1

However, more research is needed to apply and develop systematic methods to interpret the true SARS-CoV-2 signal from noise introduced in wastewater samples (e.g., from sewer conditions, sampling and extraction methods, etc.). In this study, raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded COVID-19 clinical testing data. SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected (95% positivity) in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new COVID-19 cases were 2.4 or more per 100,000 people. To adjust for variation in sample fecal content, four normalization biomarkers were evaluated: crAssphage, pepper mild mottle virus, Bacteroides ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and human 18S rRNA. Of these, crAssphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability. Both unnormalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal and signal normalized to crAssphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data (Kendall's Tau-b (τ)=0.43 and 0.38, respectively), but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data. Locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends, and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date (versus the result date) was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data. This study supports that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in COVID-19 disease occurrence and presents tools that could be applied to make wastewater signal more interpretable and comparable across studies.","Greenwald, Hannah D.; Kennedy, Lauren C.; Hinkle, Adrian; Whitney, Oscar N.; Fan, Vinson B.; Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Harris-Lovett, Sasha; Flamholz, Avi I.; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Liao, Lauren D.; Beyers, Matt; Brown, Daniel; Chakrabarti, Alicia R.; Dow, Jason; Frost, Dan; Koekemoer, Mark; Lynch, Chris; Sarkar, Payal; White, Eileen; Kantor, Rose; Nelson, Kara L.",Water Res X,805,16

These drastic measures were successful in “flattening the curve” and maintaining the prior rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths. To date, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuro-trauma has not been reported. Methods We retrospectively analyzed hospital admissions from Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, during the months of March and April from 2016-2020. Specifically, we identified all patients who had cranial neuro trauma consisting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or skull fractures, as well as spinal neuro trauma consisting of vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injury (SCI). We then performed chart review to determine mechanism of injury and if emergent surgical intervention was required. Results Compared to previous years, we saw a significant decline in the number of neuro-traumas during the pandemic, with a 62% decline after the lockdown began. The number of emergent neuro-trauma surgical cases also significantly decreased by 84% in the month of April. Interestingly, while the number of vehicular traumas decreased by 77%, there was a significant 100% increase in the number of gunshot wounds. Conclusions Population seclusion had a direct effect on the frequency of neuro-trauma, while the change in relative proportion of certain mechanisms may be associated with the psychosocial effects of social distancing and quarantine.","Figueroa, Javier M.; Boddu, James; Kader, Michael; Berry, Katherine; Kumar, Vignessh; Ayala, Veronica; Vanni, Steven; Jagid, Jonathan",World Neurosurg,805,1

The objectives of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics using normal rats and toxicity of nasal cilia as well as immunomodulating effects using immunosuppression rats after intranasal delivery of thymopentin with or without an absorption enhancer. The absorption extent of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled TP 5 via nasal delivery at a single dose is significantly improved by incorporating sodium deoxycholate, Brij 35 and chitosan, respectively. FITC-TP 5 can also be absorbed to such an extent ranging from 15 to 28% after intranasal administration of FITC-TP 5 alone, FITC-TP 5 with sodium caprylate, or with bacitracin, respectively. After seven consecutive days multiple dosing, TP 5 formulation with sodium deoxycholate or Brij 35 caused apparently injury to nasal cilia, indicating these two enhancers would not be appropriate for nasal delivery. Results from superoxide dismutase activity, maleic dialdehyde, T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) analyses suggest that all the selected enhancers improve the modulating effects of TP 5 in the immunosuppression rats.

Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the parasite that causes acute sleeping sickness in humans, is transmitted by tsetse flies and co-exists in non-human animal reservoirs. Uganda by Act of Parliament in 1992 decided to handle the complex approach to control of sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis by establishing the Uganda Trypanosomiasis Control Council (UTCC) and its secretariat the Coordinating Office for the Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU). The Institutional arrangement aimed to promote engagement with key stakeholders across nine key ministries and the community, all vital for control of zoonotic sleeping sickness, creating a One Health platform, long before such practice was common. From 2006, approaches by the Public Private Partnership, Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness (SOS) have required involvement of stakeholders in the promotion of insecticide treated cattle as live tsetse baits, targeting elimination of zoonotic sleeping sickness. Experiences in promoting sustainability of these interventions have been captured in this study as part of the Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa (TIBA) partnership.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8(+) T cells or CD4(+) T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/μL, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/μL may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","Diao, Bo; Wang, Chenhui; Tan, Yingjun; Chen, Xiewan; Liu, Ying; Ning, Lifen; Chen, Li; Li, Min; Liu, Yueping; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Feng, Zeqing; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Front Immunol,805,21

PARTICIPANTS: Total of 705 adults (M = 64.57 years, SD = 8.82, range = 50–94) who reported at least one chronic condition. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic and health characteristics, physical activity, media use, pandemic-related stress, social resources, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted regression models, people who reported more worry about COVID-19 infection, more financial strain, and greater loneliness reported significantly greater pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify factors that may heighten risk of sleep problems since the COVID-19 pandemic in an especially vulnerable subgroup of older adults.","Polenick, Courtney A.; Daniel, Nikita R.; Perbix, Emily A.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,805,1

Measurements of the fluorescence and light scattering from single particles in a microfluidic channel are used to determine the total particle number concentration and the microorganism number concentration in real-time. The system performance is examined by evaluating standard particle measurements with various sample flow rates and the ratios of fluorescent to non-fluorescent particles. To apply this method to real-time detection of airborne microorganisms, airborne Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were introduced into the micro-optofluidic platform via bioaerosol generation, and a liquid-type particle collection setup was used. We demonstrate successful discrimination of SYTO82-dyed fluorescent bacterial cells from other residue particles in a continuous and real-time manner. In comparison with traditional microscopy cell counting and colony culture methods, this micro-optofluidic platform is not only more accurate in terms of the detection efficiency for airborne microorganisms but it also provides additional information on the total particle number concentration.","Choi, Jeongan; Kang, Miran; Jung, Jae Hee",Sci Rep,805,22

This prospective study aimed to define headache characteristics, associated clinical and laboratory factors, and treatment response in COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional study enrolled 287 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized on a regular ward during the pandemic. All patients were examined face to face and followed by a neurologist during their stay in the hospital. The characteristics, concomitant symptoms, treatment responses, and laboratory findings of COVID-19-associated headaches were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-three COVID-19 patients reported headache (28.9%), in which 85.5% had no prior headaches. Mean age was 48.40 ± 15.90 and 58% was men. Compared to COVID-19 patients without headache (n = 204), patients with headache showed significantly higher frequency of pulmonary involvement (76%) and increased D-dimer levels. Fifty-nine percent of headaches responded iv paracetamol 1000 mg, and 85% of the paracetamol unresponsive headaches were relieved by greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. Latent class cluster analysis identified 2 distinct class of bilateral, frontal, throbbing headaches: severe (VAS > 84), longer (> 14 h), frequent (> 7 headache days), paracetamol unresponsive-GON responsive headaches (85%), with pulmonary involvement (100%), and higher IL-6 levels (> 90 pg/mL) were classified in cluster 1. Cluster 2 included moderately affected patients (VAS > 54, > 6 h, > 4 days, 60% pulmonary involvement, > 20 pg/mL IL-6) and paracetamol responsive headaches (96%). VAS scores showed positive linear correlation with IL-6 levels (p < 0.001; r = 0.567). CONCLUSION: The intensity, duration, frequency, bilateral frontal location, and treatment response of COVID-19 headache was related to pulmonary involvement and IL-6 levels, which indicated a role of inflammation in determining the headache manifestations in moderately affected hospitalized patients. ROC curve cutoff values pointed that VAS > 70 severity, > 9 h duration, > 5 headache days, and IL-6 > 43 pg/mL levels can be diagnostic for COVID-19 headache. GON blocks can effectively abort headache when patients are unresponsive to paracetamol, and other NSAIDs are avoided during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Karadaş, Ömer; Öztürk, Bilgin; Sonkaya, Ali Rıza; Taşdelen, Bahar; Özge, Aynur; Bolay, Hayrunnisa",Neurol Sci,805,24

Usually, it is detected in outbreaks of respiratory disease, most often during the winter period. During the middle of October 2018, a serious outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in a cattle farm comprising about 300 heads located in Central Italy. The herd was affected by a severe flu‐like syndrome unresponsive to any antibiotic treatment. Within 3 weeks, 39 adult animals died, and 12 abortions occurred. Direct and indirect laboratory tests were performed to detect the main pathogens causing the respiratory disease of the affected cattle. The results of laboratory investigations provided evidence of an acute and severe BRSV syndrome characterized by unusual mortality. In order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of this syndrome, phylogenetic analysis of the BRSV strain detected from the outbreak was carried out. The sequence analysis showed that the strain was genetically divergent from BRSV strains previously identified in Italy, as it showed high sequence similarity of more than 97% with strains isolated during a major BRSV epizootic that occurred in Sweden, Norway and Denmark during 2010–2011. The infection of the herd in Italy with this BRSV strain was likely due to the introduction of animals imported into Italy from abroad.","Giammarioli, Monica; Mangili, Piermario; Nanni, Alex; Pierini, Ilaria; Petrini, Stefano; Pirani, Silvia; Gobbi, Paola; De Mia, Gian Mario",Vet Med Sci,805,1

Based on the theory of psychological capital and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study discusses the mechanism of the psychological characteristics of MHO staff on their emergency preparedness behavioral intention (EPBI). To verify the research model, we conducted a web-based questionnaire survey among 243 MHO staff from China and analyzed the data using the structural equation modeling software, AMOS 24.0 (IBM, New York, United States). The empirical results reveal that psychological capital significantly affected cognitive processes theorized by TPB. This study suggests that the positive psychological capital of MHO staff should be developed and managed to improve their EPBI.","Wang, Huihui; Zhao, Jiaqing; Wang, Ying; Hong, Yuxiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,805,20

Aim This study was aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of VTE in hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. Materials and Methods PubMed was searched up to November 13, 2020, and updated in December 12, 2020. We included studies that evaluated the epidemiology of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in patients with COVID-19. Results A total of 91 studies reporting on 35,017 patients with COVID-19 was included. The overall frequency of VTE in all patients, ICU and non-ICU, was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.103–14.605), 24.1% (95% CI: 20.070–28.280), and 7.7% (95% CI: 5.956–9.700), respectively. PE occurred in 8.5% (95% CI: 6.911–10.208), and proximal DVT occurred in 8.2% (95% CI: 6.675–9.874) of all hospitalized patients. The relative risk for VTE associated with ICU admission was 2.99 (95% CI: 2.301–3.887, p <0.001). DVT and PE estimated in studies that adopted some form of systematic screening were higher compared with studies with symptom-triggered screening. Analysis restricted to studies in the 5th quintile of sample size reported significantly lower VTE estimates. Conclusion This study confirmed a high risk of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially those admitted to the ICU. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis suggests that previously reported frequencies of VTE in COVID-19 might have been overestimated.","Mansory, Eman M.; Srigunapalan, Suthan; Lazo-Langner, Alejandro",TH Open,805,16

We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48%-92% over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7%-55% over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13% excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34% excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.","Brown, P.

The developed sensor combines the high chemical sensitivity of MXene and the continuity of large-area high-quality graphene to form an ultra-sensitive virus-sensing transduction material (VSTM). Through polymer linking, we are able to utilize antibody–antigen binding to achieve electrochemical signal transduction when viruses are deposited onto the VSTM surface. The MXene–graphene VSTM was integrated into a microfluidic channel that can directly receive viruses in solution. The developed sensor was tested with various concentrations of antigens from two viruses: inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus ranging from 125 to 250,000 copies/mL and a recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein ranging from 1 fg/mL to 10 pg/mL. The average response time was about ∼50 ms, which is significantly faster than the existing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (>3 h). The low limit of detection (125 copies/mL for the influenza virus and 1 fg/mL for the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein) has demonstrated the sensitivity of the MXene–graphene VSTM on the FET platform to virus sensing. Especially, the high signal-to-viral load ratio (∼10% change in source-drain current and gate voltage) also demonstrates the ultra-sensitivity of the developed MXene–graphene FET sensor. In addition, the specificity of the sensor was also demonstrated by depositing the inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus and the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein onto microfluidic channels with opposite antibodies, producing signal differences that are about 10 times lower. Thus, we have successfully fabricated a relatively low-cost, ultrasensitive, fast-responding, and specific inactivated influenza A (H1N1) and 2019-nCoV sensor with the MXene–graphene VSTM.","Li, Yanxiao; Peng, Zhekun; Holl, Natalie J.; Hassan, Md.

However, the immunogenicity of the vector itself decreases its effectiveness as a boosting vaccine due to the induction of strong anti-vector neutralizing immunity. Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5–PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route, but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5–PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilizing adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.","Flynn, Olivia; Dillane, Kate; Lanza, Juliane Sousa; Marshall, Jennifer M.; Jin, Jing; Silk, Sarah E.; Draper, Simon J.; Moore, Anne C.",Vaccines (Basel),805,16
