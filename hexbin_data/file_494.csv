Treatment modalities like inhalational ribavirin, use of bronchodilators and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success. All children (age: 1–43 months) were ventilated for 6.6 (1–17) days with FiO(2) = 1.0 and a mean airway pressure of 16.4 (10–24) cm H(2)O. Mean arterial blood gases were 49 (paO(2)) and 41 (pCO(2)) mm Hg, the OI was 33.4. By inhalational NO in combination with IPPV or HFOV 4 patients could be stabilized, in the other 6 ECMO became necessary. Two of them died in spite of several weeks on ECMO; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months. Even in very severe cases of RSV infection treatment modalities like NO, HFOV and ECMO can be used successfully. The use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible; in those cases a pre-existing BPD is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support.","Varnholt, V.; Lasch, P.; Suske, G.; Koelfen, W.; Kachel, W.",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,494,1

During this period she was examined thoroughly and diagnosed to have chronic idiopathic neutropenia (also known as chronic benign neutropenia). Her iron deficiency was attributed to nutritional factors and she was non-compliant with her oral iron supplements. The patient fully received her iron supplement medication by nursing staff for two and a half months during an unexpected prolonged hospital stay after her suffering an acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident. An astonishing outcome was that in addition to having her iron deficiency anemia treated, her long-term unexplained neutropenia was also corrected. Conclusion Some patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic neutropenia and clinically present as having unexplained chronic neutropenia might actually be suffering from a form of not yet described iron deficiency induced neutropenia.","Abuirmeileh, Ayman; Bahnassi, Anas; Abuirmeileh, Amjad",Int J Clin Pharm,494,1

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric retransplantation from living donor at a single center. METHODS: Between December 1998 to August 2015, retransplantation from a living donor was performed for 14 children (<18 years of age) at Kumamoto University Hospital. The characteristics of the retransplantation recipient and the clinicopathological factors between primary transplantation and retransplantation were analyzed to detect the prognostic factors. RESULTS: In retransplantation, the operative time was longer and the amount of blood loss was greater in comparison to primary transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates from the date of retransplantation were 85.7, 85.7, and 78.6%, respectively. The rates of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation, bile leakage and postoperative bleeding after retransplantation were higher than after primary transplantation. Among the three patients who died after retransplantation, the operative time, the rate of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation and the incidence of gastrointestinal complications were higher in comparison to the surviving patients. CONCLUSION: Pediatric retransplantation from a living donor is an acceptable procedure that could save the lives of recipients with failing allografts when organs from deceased donors are scarce. To ensure good results, it is essential to make an appropriate assessment of the cardiopulmonary function and the infectious state of the patients before Re-LDLT.","Miura, Kohei; Sakamoto, Seisuke; Shimata, Keita; Honda, Masaki; Kobayashi, Takashi; Wakai, Toshifumi; Sugawara, Yasuhiko; Inomata, Yukihiro",Surg Today,494,1

However, the key UDP‐dependent glucuronosyltransferases (UGATs) involved in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin remain unknown. To discover unknown UGATs, we fully annotated potential UGATs from Glycyrrhiza uralensis using deep transcriptome sequencing. The catalytic functions of candidate UGATs were determined by an in vitro enzyme assay. Systematically screening 434 potential UGATs, we unexpectedly found one unique GuUGAT that was able to catalyse the glucuronosylation of glycyrrhetinic acid to directly yield glycyrrhizin via continuous two‐step glucuronosylation. Expression analysis further confirmed the key role of GuUGAT in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin. Site‐directed mutagenesis revealed that Gln‐352 may be important for the initial step of glucuronosylation, and His‐22, Trp‐370, Glu‐375 and Gln‐392 may be important residues for the second step of glucuronosylation. Notably, the ability of GuUGAT to catalyse a continuous two‐step glucuronosylation reaction was determined to be unprecedented among known glycosyltransferases of bioactive plant natural products. Our findings increase the understanding of traditional glycosyltransferases and pave the way for the complete biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin.","Xu, Guojie; Cai, Wei; Gao, Wei; Liu, Chunsheng",New Phytol,494,17

In most cases, an antimicrobial agent is advocated to lessen morbidity and prevent serious clinical sequelae. Use of antimicrobial agents for AECB, however, is controversial, as it is difficult to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial AECB, and only marginal benefits have been reported. Antimicrobial agents, however, have reduced relapse rates, prolonged the time between exacerbations, shortened the duration of symptoms, and reduced the need for hospitalization. Microbiologic resistance and individual patient characteristics play important roles in determining the most appropriate antimicrobial agent for patients with AECB. More research on the effect of resistant bacteria on antimicrobial response rates will enable physicians to prescribe economically rational antimicrobial therapy for this common infection.","Destache, Christopher J.",Pharmacotherapy,494,1

Reduction of various contaminating bacteriae, viruses and parasites by few to several log steps and efficiency to prevent GVHD has been shown. Aim To evaluate and compare advantages and disadvantages of PRT available for practical application in platelets. Materials and Methods PRT for the treatment of platelets is currently offered by two formats: Amotosalen (INTERCEPT, Cerus, Concord, CA, USA) and vitamin B2 (Mirasol, Caridian, Denver, USA). Results from different studies and our own experiences with the two techniques are compared and discussed. Results and Discussion For both technologies, different groups of investigators have shown acceptable in‐vitro results with respect to functional and storage data for platelets stored for up to 5 days after production and before transfusion. Initial clinical studies showed no inferiority of the treated platelets in comparison to untreated controls in thrombocytopenic patients. However for both techniques a tendency towards lower CCI has been reported, which may be more pronounced in the platelets treated with the Intercept process. For introduction of PRT many countries require not only CE mark but licensing with the respective authorities since treatment for pathogen reduction is regarded as creating a ‘new’ blood product. With respect to a platelet loss during pathogen reduction it seems recommendable to increase the lower limit of platelet content of the product to 2.5 × 10(11). Particularly for the Intercept system, where a considerable amount of platelets is lost in the purification of the product from Amotosalen, a change in the production process to increase the platelet yield may be necessary. Data from our group show a tendency for improved functional and storage parameters for platelets treated with the Mirasol process. Compared to conventional manufacturing of platelets by apheresis or pooling of buffy coats, pathogen reduction requires additional labour, space, and quality control. Shelf life of platelets is limited in most countries because of the risk of bacterial contamination (in Germany presently to 4 days). A prolongation to 5 or more days after pathogen reduction seems feasible but remains a topic for future studies. Conclusion Results of in vitro and clinical studies of pathogen reduced platelets are promising. Larger clinical trials will help to determine whether PRT proves to be beneficial (reduction of transmission of infections, less alloimmunisation) and overall cost effective (bearing in mind that additional costs may be compensated for by omission of gamma irradiation and potential longer shelf life).","Gathof, B.

The ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern Ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001. Pond I (∼1 ha) held water for 98 days, whereas Pond II (∼0.25 ha) held water for 34 days. Populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated. 2. In the natural pond water, total ciliate abundance in Pond II rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7. In contrast, total abundance in Pond I began at the same level as in Pond II but increased much more slowly, reached a plateau of around 500 individuals L(−1), and increased again late in the hydroperiod. 3. Despite being only 500 m apart, the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition. Pond I contained 50 species compared with 70 species for Pond II, with only 24 species shared. Additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species; 88 from Pond I, 104 from Pond II, with 47 species (30%) in common. Pond II contained more mid‐sized ciliates (50–200 μm), whereas Pond I was dominated by smaller ciliates, especially in mid‐May and early June. In Pond I, cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 ± 4 species), followed by the partial‐predator exclusion enclosures (50 ± 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 ± 2) and in the pondwater controls (39 ± 0). Differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures (perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed, Lemna, outside), and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond. 4. The physicochemical environment influenced species richness, total abundance and the number of rare species (27 in Pond II versus 13 in Pond I). Variation in ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the number of days after filling (39%) and enclosure treatment (23%). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively). Sixty‐five per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters: number of days after filling 27%, pH 19%, and nitrate levels 12%. Fifty‐two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters, of which pH was the most influential. Species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed. 5. Addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds – suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition.","Andrushchyshyn, Oksana; Magnusson, A.

Until now, the primary antiviral function of IFN-λs has been proposed to be at anatomical barrier sites. Here, we examine the regulation of IFN-λR1 expression and measure the downstream effects of IFN-λ3 stimulation in primary human blood immune cells, compared with lung or liver epithelial cells. IFN-λ3 directly bound and upregulated IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in freshly purified human B cells and CD8(+) T cells, but not monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and CD4(+) T cells. Despite similar IFNLR1 transcript levels in B cells and lung epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells bound more IFN-λ3, which resulted in a 50-fold greater ISG induction when compared to B cells. The reduced response of B cells could be explained by higher expression of the soluble variant of IFN-λR1 (sIFN-λR1), which significantly reduced ISG induction when added with IFN-λ3 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or liver epithelial cells. T-cell receptor stimulation potently, and specifically, upregulated membrane-bound IFNLR1 expression in CD4(+) T cells, leading to greater antiviral gene induction, and inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Collectively, our data demonstrate IFN-λ3 directly interacts with the human adaptive immune system, unlike what has been previously shown in published mouse models, and that type III IFNs could be potentially utilized to suppress both mucosal and blood-borne viral infections.","Santer, Deanna M.; Minty, Gillian E.

Thus, to identify key prospective malaria antigens for vaccine development, there is the need to evaluate the associations between malaria antibodies and antibody dependent host factors with more rigorous statistical methods. In this study, different statistical models were used to evaluate the predictive performance of malaria-specific antibodies and host gene polymorphisms on P. falciparum infection in a longitudinal cohort study involving Ghanaian children. METHODS: Models with different functional forms were built using known predictors (age, sickle cell status, blood group status, parasite density, and mosquito bed net use) and malaria antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgG subclasses and FCGR3B polymorphisms shown to mediate antibody-dependent cellular functions. Malaria antigens studied were Merozoite surface proteins (MSP-1 and MSP-3), Glutamate Rich Protein (GLURP)-R0, R2, and the Apical Membrane Antigen (AMA-1). The models were evaluated through visualization and assessment of differences between the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Brier Score estimated by suitable internal cross-validation designs. RESULTS: This study found that the FCGR3B-c.233C>A genotype and IgG against AMA1 were relatively better compared to the other antibodies and FCGR3B genotypes studied in classifying or predicting malaria risk among children. CONCLUSIONS: The data supports the P. falciparum, AMA1 as an important malaria vaccine antigen, while FCGR3B-c.233C>A under the additive and dominant models of inheritance could be an important modifier of the effect of malaria protective antibodies.","Dwomoh, Duah; Adu, Bright; Dodoo, Daniel; Theisen, Michael; Iddi, Samuel; Gerds, Thomas A.",Malar J,494,1

Despite substantial progress in cell therapy for the treatment of IVD degeneration, significant challenges remain for clinical application. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of hyaluronan–methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogels loaded with Wharton’s Jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (WJ-MSCs) in vitro and in a rat coccygeal IVD degeneration model. Following induction of injury-induced IVD degeneration, female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups to undergo a single intradiscal injection of the following: (1) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle, (2) HAMC, (3) WJ-MSCs (2 × 10(4) cells), and (4) WJ-MSCs-loaded HAMC (WJ-MSCs/HAMC) (n = 10/each group). Coccygeal discs were removed following sacrifice 6 weeks after implantation for radiologic and histologic analysis. We confirmed previous findings that encapsulation in HAMC increases the viability of WJ-MSCs for disc repair. The HAMC gel maintained significant cell viability in vitro. In addition, combined implantation of WJ-MSCs and HAMC significantly promoted degenerative disc repair compared to WJ-MSCs alone, presumably by improving nucleus pulposus cells viability and decreasing extracellular matrix degradation. Our results suggest that WJ-MSCs-loaded HAMC promotes IVD repair more effectively than cell injection alone and supports the potential clinical use of HAMC for cell delivery to arrest IVD degeneration or to promote IVD regeneration.","Choi, Un Yong; Joshi, Hari Prasad; Payne, Samantha; Kim, Kyoung Tae; Kyung, Jae Won; Choi, Hyemin; Cooke, Michael J.; Kwon, Su Yeon; Roh, Eun Ji; Sohn, Seil; Shoichet, Molly S.; Han, Inbo",Int J Mol Sci,494,1

It combined monthly UCTs (approximately US$8.40 /month) with a package of community activities (including behavior change communication [BCC] sessions, home visits, and integrated community case management of childhood illnesses and acute malnutrition [ICCM-Nut]) delivered to mother–child pairs during the first “1,000 days” of life. We primarily investigated program impact at population level on children’s height-for-age z-scores (HAZs) and secondarily on stunting (HAZ < −2) and intermediary outcomes including household’s food insecurity, mother–child pairs’ diet and health, delivery in a health facility and low birth weight (LBW), women’s knowledge, and physical intimate partner violence (IPV). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We implemented a parallel-cluster–randomized controlled trial, in which 162 villages were randomized into either an intervention arm (UCTs + package of community activities, n = 82) or a control arm (package of community activities only, n = 80). Two different representative samples of children aged 6–29 months and their mothers were surveyed in each arm, one before the intervention in 2014 (control: n = 1,301, intervention: n = 1,357), the other 2 years afterwards in 2016 (control: n = 996, intervention: n = 1,035). Difference-in-differences (DD) estimates of impact were calculated, adjusting for clustering. Children’s average age was 17.4 (± 0.24 SE) months in the control arm and 17.6 (± 0.19 SE) months in the intervention arm at baseline. UCTs had a protective effect on HAZ (DD = +0.25 z-scores, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01–0.50, p = 0.039), which deteriorated in the control arm while remaining stable in the intervention arm, but had no impact on stunting (DD = −6.2 percentage points [pp], relative odds ratio [ROR]: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51–1.06, p = 0.097). UCTs positively impacted both mothers’ and children’s (18–23 months) consumption of animal source foods (ASFs) (respectively, DD = +4.5 pp, ROR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.09–4.61, p = 0.029 and DD = +9.1 pp, ROR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.01–6.98, p = 0.048) and household food insecurity (DD = −10.7 pp, ROR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43–0.91, p = 0.016). UCTs did not impact on reported child morbidity 2 week’s prior to report (DD = −3.5 pp, ROR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.56–1.14, p = 0.214) but reduced the financial barrier to seeking healthcare for sick children (DD = −26.4 pp, ROR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08–0.66, p = 0.006). Women who received cash had higher odds of delivering in a health facility (DD = +10.6 pp, ROR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.10–2.13, p = 0.012) and lower odds of giving birth to babies with birth weights (BWs) <2,500 g (DD = −11.8, ROR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.82, p = 0.020). Positive effects were also found on women’s knowledge (DD = +14.8, ROR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.32–2.62, p < 0.001) and physical IPV (DD = −7.9 pp, ROR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36–0.99, p = 0.048). Study limitations included the short evaluation period (24 months) and the low coverage of UCTs, which might have reduced the program’s impact. CONCLUSIONS: UCTs targeting the first “1,000 days” had a protective effect on child’s linear growth in rural areas of Togo. Their simultaneous positive effects on various immediate, underlying, and basic causes of malnutrition certainly contributed to this ultimate impact. The positive impacts observed on pregnancy- and birth-related outcomes call for further attention to the conception period in nutrition-sensitive programs.

The charge-transfer (CT) interaction of LFB is important in studying its receptor binding mechanisms and useful in the development of a reliable CT-based spectrophotometric assay for LFB in its pharmaceutical formulation to assure its therapeutic benefits. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the CT reaction of LFB with 2,3-dichloro-3,5-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and its application in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. METHODS: The reaction was investigated, its conditions were optimized, the physicochemical and constants of the CT complex and stoichiometric ratio of the complex were determined. The solid-state LFB-DDQ complex was synthesized and its structure was analyzed by UV-visible, FT-IR, and (1)H-NMR spectroscopic techniques, and also by the computational molecular modeling. The reaction was employed in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. RESULTS: The reaction resulted in the formation of a red-colored product, and the spectrophotometric investigations confirmed that the reaction had a CT nature. The molar absorptivity of the complex was linearly correlated with the dielectric constant and polarity index of the solvent; the correlation coefficients were 0.9526 and 0.9459, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio of LFB:DDQ was 1:2. The spectroscopic and computational data confirmed the sites of interaction on the LFB molecule, and accordingly, the reaction mechanism was postulated. The reaction was utilized in the development of the first 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 1.31 and 3.96 μg/well, respectively. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of LFB in its bulk and tablets with high accuracy and precision. CONCLUSION: The assay is simple, rapid, accurate, eco-friendly as it consumes low volumes of organic solvent, and has high analysis throughput.","Darwish, Ibrahim A; Khalil, Nasr Y; Alsaif, Nawaf A; Herqash, Rashed N; Sayed, Ahmed Y A; Abdel-Rahman, Hamdy M",Drug Des Devel Ther,494,1

This epidemic of “Application Fever” is expensive for applicants, burdensome for programs, and ultimately does not improve overall Match outcomes. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of Application Fever, with a focus on contributing factors and costs of this behavior. Application Fever has its origins in the early 1990s. At that time, the number of residency applicants began to outpace the number of available positions. Because an applicant who applies to more residency programs has a greater probability of securing a residency position than an otherwise equivalent applicant who applies to fewer, ""overapplication"" became a dominant strategy and residency applicants began to apply to more residency programs each year. This trend was enhanced and enabled by the introduction of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Although Application Fever is a rational decision for applicants, it imposes a substantial evaluative burden on program directors and necessitates the use of convenience screening metrics. We then briefly review potential solutions, including informational strategies, application limits, and marketplace incentives to reduce application numbers. Although a fixed cap on applications would reduce application numbers and facilitate a holistic selection process, greater transparency from residency programs regarding their selection criteria would be required to help applicants choose where to apply. To improve the residency application process for programs and applicants alike, we call upon the medical community to further study Application Fever and carefully consider solutions, including fixed application caps.","Carmody, J.

Although it has been investigated as a cause of neurodegenerative disease due to its neurotoxicity, whether small molecules derived from natural products attenuate these side effects remains elusive. 6,7,4′-trihydroxyflavanone (THF) is a flavanone family that possesses various pharmacological activities, including anti-rheumatic, anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoclastogenic, and protective effects against METH-induced deactivation of T cells. However, little is known about whether THF protects neuronal cells from METH-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we investigated the protective effects of THF on neurotoxicity induced by METH exposure by enhancing the Nrf2/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in SH-SY5y cells. Treatment with THF did not lead to cytotoxicity, but attenuated METH-induced neurotoxicity by modulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, METH-induced oxidative stress, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR phosphorylation in METH-exposed SH-SY5y cells. Moreover, we found THF induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression. An inhibitor assay confirmed that the induction of HO-1 by THF attenuates METH-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, we suggest that THF preserves neuronal cells from METH-induced neurotoxicity by upregulating HO-1 expression through the Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Thus, THF has therapeutic potential for use in the treatment of METH-addicts suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.","Lee, Hyun-Su; Jeong, Gil-Saeng",Molecules,494,1

However, it remains unclear how B cell memory is shaped by recurrent annual vaccination over the course of multiple seasons, especially in high-risk elderly populations. Here, we systematically profiled the B cell response in young adult (18–34 year old) and elderly (65+ year old) vaccine recipients that received annual split inactivated influenza virus vaccination for 3 consecutive seasons. Specifically, the antibody serological and memory B-cell compartments were profiled for reactivity against current and historical influenza A virus strains. Moreover, multiparametric analysis and antibody landscape profiling revealed a transient increase in strain-specific antibodies in the elderly, but with an impaired recall response of pre-existing memory B-cells, plasmablast (PB) differentiation and long-lasting serological changes.

Understanding the mechanisms by which this process occurs could lead to new therapeutic approaches to limit the detrimental effects of inflammation. The lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin are particularly prone to infection. Specialized immune cells protect these organs from tissue damage by eliminating phagocytes from inflamed tissues by recognizing signals produced by the phagocytes. One such signal is heat shock proteins (HSP) expressed on the cell surface of phagocytes. These HSP closely resemble their microbial equivalents, and therefore phagocytes that are labeled by HSP are recognized as target cells. T lymphocytes bearing γδT cell receptor (TCR) elicit fast responses to invading pathogens. Since the γδTCR has limited germline-encoded diversity, HSP are an ideal target for recognition by these cells. γδT cells exert cytotoxic actions towards macrophages and neutrophils that express Hsp60 or Hsp70, respectively, on their cell surface.

Indeed, many bat species can be defined as synanthropic, i.e., they have a strong ecological association with humans. Bats have been observed using buildings as roosting and foraging sites, temporary shelters, for reproduction and hibernation. A synanthropic lifestyle may result in direct fitness benefits owing to energetic advantages in warmer roosts, which may ultimately lead to more rapid gestation and faster development of juveniles, or by being less exposed to natural predators in urban environments. All these benefits may allow bats to use buildings as stepping stones to exploit habitats otherwise devoid of roosting structures and may even lead to the expansion of geographic ranges. Yet, the coexistence with humans also comes with some risks. Bats may be exposed to chemical pollutants, particularly preservation chemicals used on lumber or during pest control measures. Bats may also be at risk of direct persecution or they may die accidently if trapped within buildings. In general, eviction of bats from buildings should follow the general rule of avoidance–mitigation–compensation. When considering conservation measures for synanthropic bats, it is most important to assess the role of the building for different life stages of bats. Construction work at buildings should be conducted in a manner that minimizes disturbance of bats. Artificial roosts can replace lost roosts, yet bats will often not accept alternative roosts. Demographic changes in human populations may lead to the abandonment of buildings, for example, in rural areas and to increased conflicts in urban areas when old buildings are replaced by new buildings or when previously unoccupied space in buildings is renovated. We advocate maintenance and enhancement of roosts for synanthropic bats, in addition to outreach and education campaigns, to improve the tolerance of humans for synanthropic bats.","Voigt, Christian C.; Phelps, Kendra L.; Aguirre, Luis F.; Corrie Schoeman, M.; Vanitharani, Juliet; Zubaid, Akbar",Bats in the Anthropocene: Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,494,1

This attack, e.g. the planned killing by means of deadly microorganisms (Bacillus anthracis) caused enormous public concern, because, numerous other deadly agents, now known as “select agents”, occur in nature and are available for misuse. The anthrax attack coincided with the first report in 2002 of the de novo synthesis in the test tube of a pathogenic human virus, poliovirus, that was equally shocking because it indicated that dangerous infectious agents could be produced in laboratories outside of government control.

This speed of production comes because of 50 years of hard work by virologists worldwide in pharma groups, research laboratories, and government licensing units. The present chapter presents the background framework of influenza vaccine production and its evolution over 50 years. Isolation of the causative virus of influenza in 1933, followed by the discovery of embryonated hen eggs as a substrate, quickly led to the formulation of vaccines. Virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin. The phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus HA was soon recognized and as WHO began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance, it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus. Influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly, but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including M2e and NP as “universal” vaccines covering all virus subtypes.

Impaired function of the immune system might lead to serious diseases which are often treated by immunomodulators. This chapter briefly explores the physiology of an important part of the lymphatic system, the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Currently used strategies for targeting GALT by immunomodulators for enhanced activity and/or decreased side effects are discussed. Strategies range from simple oral co-administration of immunomodulators with lipids to more advanced lipid-based formulations, polymer-based nanoparticle formulations and prodrugs. These targeting approaches successfully increase the concentration of immunomodulators achieved in the GALT and, more importantly, enhance immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, targeting immunomodulators to GALT represent a promising approach in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is actively involved.","Zgair, Atheer; Wong, Jonathan Chi Man; Gershkovich, Pavel",Neuro-Immuno-Gastroenterology,494,1

Like siRNAs, shRNAs show promise as potential therapeutic agents due to their high level of specificity and potency, although effective delivery to target tissues remains a challenge. Algorithms used to predict siRNA performance are frequently used to design shRNAs as well. However, the differences between these two kinds of RNAi mediators indicate that the factors affecting target gene silencing will not be the same for siRNAs and shRNAs. Stem and loop lengths, structures of the termini, the identity of nucleotides adjacent to and near the loop, and the position of the guide (antisense) strand all affect the efficacy of shRNAs. In addition, shRNAs with 19-bp or shorter stem lengths are processed and function differently than those with longer stems. In this review, we describe studies of targeting the hepatitis C virus that have provided guidelines for an optimal design for short (19 bp) shRNAs (sshRNAs) that are highly potent, stable in biological fluids, and have minimal immunostimulatory properties.","Johnston, Brian H.; Ge, Qing",From Nucleic Acids Sequences to Molecular Medicine,494,1

This phenomenon is understood as “concentration of healthcare frames.” We conducted in-depth interviews with 19 news reporters to identify institutional rules that might influence the formation of news frames. In-depth interviews revealed that similar types of frames resulted from institutional rules (e.g., journalist’s autonomy, news value, newspaper’s mission statement, and characteristics of readers). The findings suggest that health journalists follow institutional rules that govern the creation of news frames. To provide diverse perspectives on healthcare policy issues, newspapers need to reconsider their institutional rules.","Park, Kisoo; Lim, Jeongsub",,494,1

Conventional recommendation methods, designed for other recommendation domains, give low performance because of these peculiarities of news articles. In this paper, we propose PGT (News Recommendation Coalescing Personal and Global Temporal Preferences), an accurate news recommendation method designed with consideration of the above characteristics of news articles. PGT extracts latent features from both personal and global temporal preferences to sufficiently reflect users’ behaviors. Furthermore, we propose an attention based architecture to extract adequate coalesced features from both of the preferences.

Traditionally, this ecology theory based outlook focuses on the risks of mortality, treating the make-up of an organization’s architecture as uniform and thus relatively inconsequential for understanding this hazard. Renewing recent debates on inertia and on structure, in this paper we examine the specifics of the make-up of structural inertia in the context of failure hazards—the measurable survival risks associated with failure. Developing a classification of structural inertia, we test a sample of 755 firms listed on the Taiwanese Security Exchange across 52 industries to develop a convention on organizational structure, ratifying that structural inertia differs by type in incorporating failure hazards. Findings differentiate between and elaborate the validating environmental and resource conditions for these different categories, detailing the extent to which failure hazards are related to the specifics of each type. This variation is helpful in explaining better why, despite conditions leading to failure, inert organizations continue to thrive over time. Discussing this logic addresses the narrow representation of structural inertia and limitations to its theoretical development over several decades. It also shows that traditional organizational ecology measures can be legitimately underplayed in organizations dealing with increased failure hazards in favor of the characteristics of different structural inertia types.","Schwarz, Gavin M.; Yang, Kuo-Pin; Chou, Christine; Chiu, Yu-Jen",Asia Pac J Manag,494,1

It charts the evolution of global health policy and governance in the post-World War II international order to the current post-2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals era. In order to respond adequately existing and emerging health and development challenges across developing regions, the paper argues that global health governance and related structures and institutions must adapt to changing socio-economic circumstances at all levels of decision-making. Against the background of a changing world order characterised by the decline of US-led Western international liberalism and the rise of the emerging nations in the developing world, it identifies the ‘Rising Powers’ (RPs) among the emerging economies and their soft power diplomacy and international development cooperation strategy as important tools for responding to post-2015 global health challenges. Based on analysis of illustrative examples from the ‘BRICS’, a group of large emerging economies—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—the paper develops suggestions and recommendations for the RPs with respect to: (1) stimulating innovation in global health governance and (2) strengthening health systems and health security at country and regional levels. Observing that current deliberations on global health focus largely, but rather narrowly, on what resource inputs are needed to achieve the SDG health targets, this paper goes further and highlights the importance of the ‘how’ in terms of a leadership and driving role for the RPs: How can the RPs champion global governance reform and innovation aimed at producing strong, resilient and equitable global systems? How can the RPs use soft power diplomacy to enhance disease surveillance and detection capacities and to promote improved regional and international coordination in response to health threats?

As one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the affected brain area. Microglia are the major regulators of neuroinflammation in the brain, and neuroinflammation has become recognized as the core pathophysiological process of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a dual role in AD development. For one thing, they degrade amyloid β (Aβ) to resist its deposition; for another, microglia release pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors, contributing to neuroinflammation as well as the spreading of Aβ and tau pathology. Wnt pathways are important regulators of cell fate and cell activities. The dysregulation of Wnt pathways is responsible for both abnormal tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss in AD. Recent studies have also confirmed the regulatory effect of Wnt signaling on microglial inflammation. Thus, the study of microglia, Wnt pathways, and their possible interactions may open up a new direction for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in AD. In this review, we summarize the functions of microglia and Wnt pathways and their roles in AD in order to provide new ideas for understanding the pathogenesis of AD.","Yang, Yunying; Zhang, Zhentao",Front Aging Neurosci,494,1

We present the mapping for translating iUML-B constructs to UTA. The novel aspect is the use of a multi-process trigger-response pattern to address the modelling and verification of reachability properties of complex systems with concurrent processes. The approach is demonstrated on an airport control system, where timing, fairness, as well as liveness properties play a vital role in proving safety requirements.","Shokri-Manninen, Fatima; Tsiopoulos, Leonidas; Vain, Jüri; Waldén, Marina",Rigorous State-Based Methods,494,1

At its core is the need to connect physical devices with their digital representations which essentially means establishing a digital twin. Currently, the technological development of digital twins has gathered much attention while the organizational and business aspects are less investigated. In response, the suitability of enterprise modeling and capability management for the purpose of developing and management of business-driven digital twins has been analyzed. A number of requirements from literature are summarized and two industrial cases have been analyzed for the purpose of investigating how the digital twin initiatives emerge and what forces drive the start of their implementation projects. The findings are discussed with respect to how Enterprise Modeling and the Capability-Driven Development method are able to support the business motivation, design and runtime management of digital twins.","Sandkuhl, Kurt; Stirna, Janis","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",494,1

Main challenges. Software quality correlates with the success of requirements engineering (RE) sessions. RE sessions demand software analysts to collect all relevant material usually specified on written notes, flip charts, pictures, etc. Afterwards comprehensible requirements need to be specified for software implementation and testing. These activities are mostly performed manually, which causes process delays and software quality attributes like reliability, usability, comprehensibility, etc., are diminished causing software devaluation. Innovative aspects. This research idea paper proposes a framework for automating the tasks of requirements specification. The proposed framework involves computational mechanisms to enable the automatic generation of software design while requirements are discussed. The innovative aspect of this research comes from digitally transforming the software development life cycle (SDLC) where requirements are generated “on the fly” and virtual reality systems are in place. Potential to make change. The proposed framework has the potential to renovate the role of software analysts, which can experience substantial reduction of manual tasks, more efficient communication, dedication to more analytical tasks, and assurance of software quality from conception phases.

Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S(2) domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in S(D) domain) and G1124V (in S(2) subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed.

The findings surprisingly reveal that ICT infrastructures and governance quality have no significant positive effect on the overall tax revenue collections.

It shows that the organisation of medical virus research was inextricably linked to the pandemic before the actual discovery of flu virus in 1933.

In federal emergencies, reuse of PPE after disinfection can occur by processes, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. We identified a vacant animal holding facility at our institution to repurpose into a regional VHP decontamination center. METHODS: The facility is a multiroom, 20 000 ft(2) building with control of HVAC to adjust to VHP conditional requirements. H(2)O(2) was delivered to rooms using robotic HaloFoggers, dispersing H(2)O(2) vapor and increasingly concentrated microdroplets as a fog for a timed period based on cubic footage of rooms. RESULTS: Fogging cycles eliminated 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus up to 7 days postcycle. Functional efficacy of treated N95s was confirmed by fit tests of institutional personnel. Signage, process flow mapping, and training materials facilitated ease of workflow and adherence to safety expectations within the building. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study determined that a variety of N95 respirator types and sizes were able to be cleared of potential bacterial and viral agents using VHP in a controlled fog/dwell/exhaust cycle. This repurposed animal facility has the capacity to decontaminate up to 6700 respirators daily, which will address the predicted surge of COVID-19 cases in the state, and ultimately allow each respirator to be reused multiple times. There is no other public site in the region with our capacity to offset the continued supply chain issues for PPE needs.","Hankenson, F.

PURPOSE: To examine pharmacological management strategies designed to prevent and/or treat IWS from opioids and/or benzodiazepines in critically ill neonates, children and adults. METHODS: We included non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting on interventions to prevent or manage IWS in critically ill neonatal, paediatric and adult patients. Database searching included: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane databases, TRIP, CMA Infobase and NICE evidence. Additional grey literature was examined. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Data collected included: population, definition of opioid, benzodiazepine or mixed IWS, its assessment and management (drug or strategy, route of administration, dosage and titration), previous drug exposures and outcomes measures. Methodological quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for NRSI. A qualitative synthesis of the results is provided. For the subset of studies evaluating multifaceted protocolised care, we meta-analysed results for 4 outcomes and examined the quality of evidence using GRADE post hoc. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible, including 10 NRSI and 3 RCTs; 11 of these included neonatal and paediatric patients exclusively. Eight studies evaluated multifaceted protocolised interventions, while 5 evaluated individual components of IWS management (e.g. clonidine or methadone at varying dosages, routes of administration and duration of tapering). IWS was measured using an appropriate tool in 6 studies. Ten studies reported upon occurrence of IWS, showing significant reductions (n = 4) or no differences (n = 6). Interventions failed to impact duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and adverse effects. Impact on opioid and/or benzodiazepine total doses and duration showed no differences in 4 studies, while 3 showed opioid and benzodiazepine cumulative doses were significantly reduced by 20–35% and 32–66%, and treatment durations by 1.5–11 and 19 days, respectively. Variable effects on intervention drug exposures were found. Weaning durations were reduced by 6–12 days (n = 4) for opioids and/or methadone and by 13 days (n = 1) for benzodiazepines. In contrast, two studies using interventions centred on transition to enteral routes or longer tapering durations found significant increases in intervention drug exposures. Interventions had overall non-significant effects on additional drug requirements (except for one study). Included studies were at high risk of bias, relating to selection, detection and reporting bias. CONCLUSION: Interventions for IWS management fail to impact duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay, while effect on occurrence of IWS and drug exposures is inconsistent. Heterogeneity in the interventions used and methodological issues, including inappropriate and/or subjective identification of IWS and bias due to study design, limited the conclusions.

This article looks back at reviews of the Australian government's economic stimulus measures introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), in anticipation of reviews of responses to the COVID‐19 emergency, noting similarities and differences between the two crises. We examine 10 independent reviews of the Australian government's response to the GFC with a particular focus on their nature and the context in which they occurred. As a result, we identify five themes: when and how often reviews are conducted; recognition of context; the need for clear program objectives; explicit design principles; and governance. We develop a typology of independent reviews that has three key and interrelated dimensions: purpose, timing, and reviewer. We observe that there was patchwork coverage of the GFC measures, with no single report providing a holistic assessment of what was achieved or lessons learnt. We contend that, notwithstanding differences between crises, the typology will aid understanding of the role, key issues, and contributions of reviews that have already been, or will be, commissioned into COVID‐19 and future emergency economic stimulus measures.","Wilkins, Peter; Gilchrist, David; Phillimore, John",,494,1

However, traditional methods of breast ultrasound tumor recognition often use manually extracted features to gradually realize ROI region location and tumor classification with low accuracy, poor robustness and weak universality. Deep learning is limited to the location of tumor ROI region or the classification of a given tumor ROI region. In this paper, YOLOV3 algorithm is used for breast ultrasound tumor recognition, which could realize ROI localization and tumor classification at the same time. In addition, K-Means is optimized by K-Means++ and K-Mediods algorithm to generate anchor boxes of YOLOV3, and based on the Darknet-53 network structure of YOLOV3, ResNet and DenseNet are combined to design ResNet-DenseNet_Darknet-53.

Laboratory-based surveillance of MDROs in LTCFs is aimed at providing useful epidemiological information to healthcare providers operating in the facility, but it is only effective if the collected data are used for infection prevention and control purposes, targeting the peculiar aspects of LTCFs.","Aschbacher, Richard; Pagani, Leonardo; Migliavacca, Roberta; Pagani, Laura",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,494,1

The following chapter is designed to give a basic concise overview of TCM principles and practices, in relation to clinical pharmacology, and focuses on mutually relevant areas of interest. Much as society learned to harness electrical currents to empower machinery, TCM theories of energetic patterns help to empower the functionality of the human body. The major theories include the vital life force, known as Qi, Yin and Yang, Five Elements, herbal medicine, multivariate diagnostics, syndrome differentiation, and acupuncture, among others. In TCM, there is a direct relationship to the energy of nature and the energetic patterns within the human body and the human consciousness. This comprehensive approach is gaining momentum in clinical and network pharmacology, as new technologies emerge regarding TCM collaborative compounds versus singular chemical constituents in treatment modalities. Of major importance to clinical pharmacology are recent TCM evidenced-based empirical studies, correlations, and interactions between herbs and pharmaceuticals, updated data on toxicity, adverse reactions, quality assurance, and herbal medicine standardization. Global concerns over antimicrobial resistance to drugs have put a spotlight on TCM herbal medicines as alternatives with greatly reduced resistance factors. From ancient archives to the Nobel Prize to a formal endorsement by the World Health Organization as a global healthcare system, TCM has widened the lens of modern science. It offers the wisdom and experience of millennia to inspire the think tank of today’s medicine and pharmacology and tomorrow’s generations of integrative healthcare advancements.","Marshall, Anita Chen",Drug Discovery and Evaluation: Methods in Clinical Pharmacology,494,1

METHODS: Preterm neonates were randomized to receive positive pressure ventilation with either self-inflating bag or T-piece resuscitator during administration of first dose of surfactant. Arterial blood gases were obtained at baseline and 1 h after the intervention. Primary outcome was the mean change in PaCO(2) levels 1 h after the intervention. RESULTS: Eighty neonates were enrolled (40 in each group). The drop in PaCO(2) at 1 h was significantly greater in the self inflating bag group as compared to the T-piece resuscitator group [8.96 ± 9.06 mmHg vs. 1.37 ± 9.06 mmHg, Mean difference = 7.58 mmHg, (95% CI: 3.78 to 11.4); P < 0.01].

As genetic differentiation due to population fragmentation results in increased rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity, detecting and alleviating the reasons of population fragmentation can provide effective tools for the maintenance of healthy dog breeds. RESULTS: Using a genome-wide SNP array, we detected genetic differentiation to subpopulations in six breeds, Belgian Shepherd, English Greyhound, Finnish Lapphund, Italian Greyhound, Labrador Retriever and Shetland Sheepdog, either due to geographical isolation or as a result of differential breeding strategies. The subpopulation differentiation was strongest in show dog lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Besides geographical differentiation caused by founder effect and lack of gene flow, selection on champion looks or restricted pedigrees is a strong driver of population fragmentation. Artificial barriers for gene flow between the different subpopulations should be recognized, their necessity evaluated critically and perhaps abolished in order to maintain genetic diversity within a breed. Subpopulation differentiation might also result in false positive signals in genome-wide association studies of different traits. LAY SUMMARY: Purebred dogs are, by definition, reproductively isolated from other breeds. However, similar isolation can also occur within a breed due to conflicting breeder ideals and geographic distances between the dog populations. We show here that both of these examples can contribute to breed division, with subsequent loss of genetic variation in the resulting breed lineages. Breeders should avoid creating unnecessary boundaries between breed lineages and facilitate the exchange of dogs between countries.","Lampi, Sara; Donner, Jonas; Anderson, Heidi; Pohjoismäki, Jaakko",Canine Med Genet,494,1

The human estrogen receptor α contains a ligand binding domain that enforces dimerization and nuclear import upon binding of the inducer 17β-estradiol. In this study, we tested the potential of this ligand binding domain to be used in filamentous fungi as an auto-regulatory domain in a synthetic transcription factor. RESULTS: We constructed the synthetic transcription factor SynX by fusing the DNA-binding domain of Xyr1 (Xylanase Regulator 1), the transactivation domain of Ypr1 (Yellow Pigment Regulator 1), and the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor α. SynX is able to strongly induce the gene expression of xylanases and an aldose reductase by addition of 17β-estradiol, but SynX does not induce gene expression of cellulases. Importantly, the induction of xylanase activities is mostly carbon source independent and can be fine-tuned by controlling the concentration of 17β-estradiol. CONCLUSION: The ability of SynX to induce gene expression of xylanase encoding genes by addition of 17β-estradiol demonstrates that the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor α works in filamentous fungi, and that it can be combined with a transactivation domain other than the commonly used transactivation domain of herpes simplex virion protein VP16.","Derntl, Christian; Mach, Robert; Mach-Aigner, Astrid",Fungal Biol Biotechnol,494,1

Through multivariable logistic regression, an association between SI and all-cause mortality was found (adjusted OR: 1.48; 95% CI 1.08, 2.01). These findings emphasize the need to mitigate effects of social isolation among PLHIV.

The increase in daily confirmed cases accelerated significantly from ~ 5 additional new cases (ANC)/day during early March up to ~ 249 ANC/day during early June. An abrupt change in this temporal pattern was noticed during mid-April, from which can be inferred a much reduced impact of the nationwide lockdown in India. Daily maximum (T(Max)), minimum (T(Min)), mean (T(Mean)) and dew point temperature (T(Dew)), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and diurnal range in temperature and relative humidity during March 01 to June 04, 2020 over 9 major affected cities are analyzed to look into the impact of daily weather on COVID-19 infections on that day and 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before those cases were detected (i.e., on the likely transmission days). Spearman’s correlation exhibits significantly lower association with WS, T(Max), T(Min), T(Mean), T(Dew), but is comparatively better with a lag of 14 days. Support Vector regression successfully estimated the count of confirmed cases (R(2) > 0.8) at a lag of 12–16 days, thus reflecting a probable incubation period of 14 ± 02 days in India. Approximately 75% of total cases were registered when T(Max), T(Mean), T(Min), T(Dew), and WS at 12–16 days previously were varying within the range of 33.6–41.3 °C, 29.8–36.5 °C, 24.8–30.4 °C, 18.7–23.6 °C, and 4.2–5.75 m/s, respectively. Thus, we conclude that coronavirus transmission is not well correlated (linearly) with any individual weather parameter; rather, transmission is susceptible to a certain weather pattern.

We need to examine with which level of sensitivity and how quickly they can detect an outbreak or recognize a bioterrorism attack. Knowing the error rate of a system can help make decisions regarding how much effort is needed to investigate an alarm. The performance of the algorithms for outbreak characterization determines the amount of information they provide (e.g., sets of affected individuals, the outbreak size, and disease spreading rate), which provide important input for response planning. Substantial costs can be incurred when developing or managing syndromic surveillance systems and investigating possible outbreaks based on the outputs of these systems (Reingold, 2003). For example, as reported in (Doroshenko et al., 2005), the annual cost of the NHS Direct Syndromic Surveillance System is about $280,000 and the usefulness of surveillance systems for early detection and response is yet to be established. Assessing the performance of surveillance systems is of significant importance for improving the efficacy of the investment in system development and management (Buehler et al., 2004).","Chen, Hsinchun; Zeng, Daniel; Yan, Ping",Infectious Disease Informatics,494,1

Given that nitrites have been implicated in pathways associated with lung disease, we hypothesized that nitrite levels would be altered in the airways of premature infants diagnosed with BPD. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of extremely low birth infants (< 28 weeks’ gestation) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Nitrite levels from tracheal aspirates (TAs) were compared between intubated and ventilated infants with BPD and gestation matched full term (FT) controls. TA derived nitrite levels from day one after birth were also compared between preterm infants who did and did not develop BPD. RESULTS: Infants with BPD were found to have significantly elevated nitrite levels in their tracheal aspirates compared to gestation matched FT controls (p < 0.05). There was a trend for increased nitrite levels on postnatal day one in infants that developed BPD compared to infants that did not develop BPD (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, nitrite levels are significantly increased in airways of infants with BPD. Data from a larger cohort are needed to further support the utility of nitrite for BPD prediction.

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 (th), 2020. Although the global number of COVID-19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive assessment of sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have contributed to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak so far. As a group of early career scientists and the next generation of African scientific leaders with experience of working in medical and diverse health research fields in both SSA and resource-rich countries, we present a unique perspective on the current public health interventions to fight COVID-19 in Africa. Our perspective is based on extensive review of the available scientific publications, official technical reports and announcements released by governmental and non-governmental health organizations as well as from our personal experiences as workers on the COVID-19 battlefield in SSA. We documented public health interventions implemented in seven SSA countries including Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, the existing gaps and the important components of disease control that may strengthen SSA response to future outbreaks.","Umviligihozo, Gisele; Mupfumi, Lucy; Sonela, Nelson; Naicker, Delon; Obuku, Ekwaro A.; Koofhethile, Catherine; Mogashoa, Tuelo; Kapaata, Anne; Ombati, Geoffrey; Michelo, Clive M.; Makobu, Kimani; Todowede, Olamide; Balinda, Sheila N.",Wellcome Open Res,494,1

But due to the complexity of the construction processes, this new methodology for the evaluation of occupational risks, called Level of Preventive Action, develops a new parameter for evaluating preventive action based on documentary environment that reflects the complexity of the work units, location and interdependence, construction environment referred to construction and protection systems, and social environment relative to the perception of the environment and the workers’ emotional states. The evaluation criteria of the new method are established by developing the William T. Fine methodology and incorporating concepts such as risk tolerance, the importance of work and personal satisfaction, which justify the degree of correction of preventive actions. This methodology determines the amount of preventive action control that is required during the construction process. This research proposes a risk assessment protocol adapted to construction sites based on specialized technical observation with a psychosocial survey on site. Some results of the implementation of the method in real work are shown. In conclusion, the determining parameter towards optimal control of preventive action is the direct and active participation of workers in safety matters.","Carpio-de los Pinos, Antonio José; González-García, María de las Nieves",Int J Environ Res Public Health,494,1

These approaches can also be extended to molecular imaging to report on disease diagnosis and management. The stimuli used for activation are based on differences between the environment of the diseased or targeted sites, and normal tissues. Endogenous stimuli include pH, redox reactions, enzymatic activity, temperature and others. Exogenous site-specific stimuli include the use of magnetic fields, light, ultrasound and others. These endogenous or exogenous stimuli lead to structural changes or cleavage of the cargo carrier, leading to release of the API. A wide variety of stimulus-responsive systems have been developed—responsive to both a single stimulus or multiple stimuli—and represent a theranostic tool for disease treatment. In this review, stimuli commonly used in the development of theranostic nanoplatforms are enumerated. An emphasis on chemical structure and property relationships is provided, aiming to focus on insights for the design of stimulus-responsive delivery systems.

This piece offers a reflective assessment of this regime-strengthening exercise – the key milestones of which have been the New York Declaration, the Global Compact on Refugees, and the first Global Refugee Forum – and assesses what has been achieved and what challenges still lie ahead. The Global Compact on Refugees is presented as the product of a ‘States plus’ approach to multilateralism that brought together a wide range of States, other stakeholders, and – importantly – refugees to fill a crucial gap in the international refugee protection regime. It seeks to do this by bolstering international cooperation with a view to enhancing protection and expanding access to solutions, building on existing and emerging trends, and laying the ground for future cooperation. The first Global Refugee Forum in December 2019 was an important and positive first step in the Compact’s implementation, but much more remains to be done before success can be declared. In postscript, the authors reflect on the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the international refugee response regime, and the role for the Global Compact on Refugees in the response.","Triggs, Gillian D; Wall, Patrick C J",,494,1

The purpose of this study is to explain the requirements of similar health systems in facing epidemics such as COVID-19 as well as sharing experiences of Iran. METHODS: The present study was a qualitative study using content analysis of the Iranian Ministry of Health website (behdasht.gov.ir) during the official onset of COVID-19 in Iran (February 20) to March 7, 2020. To Integrate data, interviews with experts were used. In this regard, 4 national health policymakers and 5 provincial health managers were interviewed. After implementation using 8-step content analysis method, data were analyzed using MAXQDA software by research team members who had no conflict of interest. RESULTS: The findings show that the disease began on February 20, 2020, with two cases of death from COVID-19 in Qom province in central Iran and within two weeks it has widely affected 31 provinces, with 4747 approved cases and 124 deaths. According to the results, the Islamic Republic of Iran's health system faced five major challenges to confronting with COVID-19: 1- Medical consumables supply 2- Hospital beds allocation and intensive care units (ICU) equipment 3-The lack of a comprehensive COVID-19 protocol in the country 4- the lack of a single command authority to deal with the crisis 5- Insufficient public health literacy and information as a result of social anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of this case indicate that health systems require policy action to prevent and control diseases rather than other implementations. In this regard, training should be given to children and adolescents, at-risk persons and health system staff. In addition, to confront with COVID-19, an integrated policy implementation team should be established in collaboration with the health sector and other relevant bodies. KEY MESSAGES: It seems obvious that policy implementation requires to prepare the country for future contingencies. A comprehensive National Prevention Protocol needs to be developed.","Ghanbarzadegan, A; Bastani, P; Emadi, F; Mohammadpour, M; Pourmohammadi, K; Javanmardi, S",Eur J Public Health,494,1

India enacted such measures early on for effective mitigation and suppression to reduce community transmission, including an onerous national lockdown. The impact of the health system governance is quite apparent among all stakeholders including the public in such emergency contexts. METHODS: We compiled the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries and deaths from January 30th until June 16th, 2020. Different stages were categorized from post PHEIC declaration (pre-lockdown) phase to lockdown phases and unlocking phase as implemented. The several measures adopted by the national government were structured in four broad categories as Governance and socioeconomic, travel restrictions, lockdown and public health measures. These measures were compared during each phase. RESULTS: It was revealed that while the cases are rising the phased restrictions has helped in delaying the peak and remarkably interrupted the rate of transmission. The national average doubling rate was 3 days at the beginning which improved to 22 days. The basic reproduction number remained close to 1 during the last week of lockdown. However, the initial interruption of needed aid and technical support had negative social and economic impacts on the affected population. CONCLUSIONS: As the situation abates following the measures adopted by the government, an articulate strategy of unlocking through increased testing and prompt isolation needs to be developed for more effective reduction and protecting the livelihoods allowing to further relax the lockdown measures. KEY MESSAGES: There is need for the local government to consider a strategic easing of the lockdown for protecting the rights of the most affected population. As the transmission rates are low, the easing of lockdown can be benefited from improved testing and prompt isolation.","Singh, R; Sharma, K",Eur J Public Health,494,1

Today, there is a global epidemic of misinformation, spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets, posing a critical threat for public health due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, it threatens the possibility of slowing down the progression of the virus. The fight against such misinformation requires continuous provision of the most reliable and recent information. DESCRIPTION: A global study was conducted by IFMSA, in collaboration with the WHO, composed of a survey to get data about all the organizations, institutions, NGOs, and other entities that focus on fact-checking and correcting misinformation about COVID-19. The survey was filled by medical students from end of April to end of May who reported name, type, scope of work, languages, primary funding source, type and source of information shared by the organization. RESULTS: We discovered 182 initiatives from 62 countries worldwide that verified information in 48 languages. Social media, internet, radio, SMS, printed media and hearsay were identified as the main sources of misinformation. Video podcasts with experts, regular social media updates and newsletters, were described as best practices, in addition to debunking myths on a regular basis and verifying statements by public figures. Also quality of fact-checking differed between initiatives. LESSONS: Data showed that myths and false information are spreading through different means from public figures to daily social media outlets. Fighting misinformation should use innovative and accessible approaches. There is urgent need for national initiatives and political engagement for myth-busting. IFMSA and WHO are following up by designing a platform to share fact-checking initiatives and recommendations openly, and by creating an AI system with Amazon to analyze articles in social media. KEY MESSAGES: Fact-checking and myth-busting are essential to limit the COVID-19 related infodemic spreading through different media and social media platforms, famous figures and others. Initiatives worldwide are doing fact-checking. Yet, the quality and quantity of available fact-checking differ between countries and there is a need for more universal good quality fact-checking.","Uakkas, S; El Omrani, O",Eur J Public Health,494,1

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of early position intervention on non-invasively ventilated severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective observational study in consecutive severe COVID-19 patients managed in a provisional ICU at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University during January 31(st) to February 15(th), 2020. Patients with chest CT showing exudation or consolidation in bilateral peripheral and posterior part of the lungs were included. Early position intervention (prone or lateral) was commenced for > 4 hours daily for 10 days, while others had standard care. RESULTS: The baseline parameters were comparable between position intervention group (n = 17) and standard care group (n = 35). Position intervention was well-tolerated and increased cumulative adjusted mean difference of SpO(2)/FiO(2) (409, 95% CI 86 to 733) and ROX index (26, 95% CI 9 to 43) with decreased Borg scale (−9, 95 CI −15 to −3) during first 7 days. It also facilitated absorption of lung lesions and reduced patients of high National Early Warning Score 2 (≥ 7) on days 7 and 14 with a trend toward fastened clinical improvement.

This article puts these challenges in historical context through a systematic analysis of rhetorical challenges towards both the order per se and specific global economic institutions. Drawing on Albert Hirschman’s classic typology of exit, voice and loyalty, we coded leaders’ speeches in the General Debate at the UN General Assembly between 1970 and 2018 as articulating intentions to abandon elements of the order, challenges or calls for reform, unequivocal support, or factual mentions of cooperation. Surprisingly, we find that explicit criticisms towards the liberal order are at an all-time low and that exit threats remain rare. An analysis of the historical evolution of criticisms to global economic institutions reveals a move away from the Cold War insider-outsider conflict towards insider contestation. For example, we find that as countries’ economies become more open, their leaders expressed more support for global economic institutions during the Cold War but less support since. Finally, we demonstrate consistency between the public policy positions leaders announce in UNGA General Debate speeches and their government positions on consequential reform debates on debt relief.

METHODS & RESULTS: We reviewed the journey of the journal by focusing on the effort it took to take the journal to a global standard, and discussed the future direction of progress of JKACAP, based on the opinions raised at the Editor-in-Chiefs’ reunion. CONCLUSION: JKACAP has just stepped on the path to globalization by being indexed in Emerging Sources Citation Index, PubMed Central, and Scopus. It is time to progress to another dimension, by acknowledging and overcoming more complicated issues, such as augmenting impact of the journal, expanding domains of interdisciplinary collaboration, and more global cooperation.","Yoo, Hee Jeong; Park, Min-Hyeon; Yoo, Jae Hyun; Hong, Minha; Bahn, Geon Ho",Soa Chongsonyon Chongsin Uihak,494,1

Without proper temperature regulation, the rapid degradation of analytical targets in the specimen may compromise the accuracy and reliability of the testing results. In this study, we develop porous superabsorbent polymer (PSAP) beads for fast and self-driven “microfiltration” of biofluid samples. This treatment effectively separates small analytical targets (e.g., glucose, catalase, and bacteriophage) and large undesired components (e.g., bacteria and blood cells) in the biofluids by capturing the former inside and excluding the latter outside the PSAP beads. We have successfully demonstrated that this treatment can reduce sample volume, self-aliquot the liquid sample, avoid microbial contamination, separate plasma from blood cells, stabilize target species inside the beads, and enable long-term storage at room temperature. Potential practical applications of this technology can provide an alternative sample collection and storage approach for medically underserved areas.","Chen, Wensi; Wang, Ting; Dou, Zeou; Xie, Xing",ACS Mater Lett,494,1

CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was a previously medically fit 16-year-old of Caucasian origin who tested positive for COVID-19 in late March 2020. She developed with a 4-day illness with fever, cough, and myalgia from which she made a full and uncomplicated recovery. Ten days later she developed a new erythematous itchy rash on her legs, trunk, and face and a progressive polyarthralgia affecting her MCPs, wrists, shoulders, hips, and knees. The rash typically lasted for 2 days at one site and was non-scarring. This was associated with a low-grade fever. There were no associated mouth ulcers, photosensitivity, alopecia, Raynaud’s, GI disturbance or respiratory symptoms. She had no relevant family history of autoimmunity, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease or travel history and had been prescribed no new medications. On examination, she had an erythematous rash on the face in a non malar distribution. She had multiple tender joints without definite synovitis. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastroenterology and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Investigations revealed a normal full blood count and CRP<1 with normal liver and renal function tests. Her urinalysis was unremarkable. Immunology was negative for ANA, ANCA and rheumatoid factor. Immunoglobulins were normal. Two weeks later her symptoms were fully resolved. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with nearly 30 strains recognised to infect humans. They induce both an innate and adaptive immune system response. It is hypothesised that a dysregulated innate system response, leading to a prolonged adaptive response triggers damaging inflammation and a potential cytokine storm. This is associated with poor outcome during primary viral infection. Variations in this immune response, with different underlying HLA genotypes could lead to other post infectious immune mediated phenomena, such as Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome - Temporally associated with COVID-19. There is a European registry collating data about patients with known rheumatic diseases who are admitted with COVID-19. There is emerging data regarding Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). There is a growing suggestion that a subgroup of patients is developing a COVID-19 associated post viral fatigue syndrome. We suggest that a registry to collect information on de novo autoimmune diseases presenting post COVID-19 is also commenced. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 infection is associated with a wide variety of sequalae, including rheumatological ones. Classic post viral Reactive arthritis has been seen. A registry to collect information on de novo autoimmune presentations would be highly informative.","Waller, Rosemary; Price, Elizabeth; Carty, Sara; Ahmed, Azeem; Collins, David",Rheumatol Adv Pract,494,1

So, the design and implementation of COVID-19 testing kits remain an open research problem. Several findings attained using radio-imaging approaches recommend that the images comprise important data related to coronaviruses. The application of recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, integrated with radiological imaging, is helpful in the precise diagnosis and classification of the disease. In this view, the current research paper presents a novel fusion model hand-crafted with deep learning features called FM-HCF-DLF model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model comprises three major processes, namely Gaussian filtering-based preprocessing, FM for feature extraction and classification. FM model incorporates the fusion of handcrafted features with the help of local binary patterns (LBP) and deep learning (DL) features and it also utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Inception v3 technique. To further improve the performance of Inception v3 model, the learning rate scheduler using Adam optimizer is applied. At last, multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to carry out the classification process. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model was experimentally validated using chest X-ray dataset. The experimental outcomes inferred that the proposed model yielded superior performance with maximum sensitivity of 93.61%, specificity of 94.56%, precision of 94.85%, accuracy of 94.08%, F score of 93.2% and kappa value of 93.5%.","Shankar, K.; Perumal, Eswaran",Complex Intell,494,1

It is argued that different factors contributed to the development of the particular features that Brazilian Communication Studies present nowadays. They include: the late development of Brazilian universities, in comparison to the western societies, but also to other Latin American countries; the relatively early development of Communication programs, beginning from the late 1940s, following the example of the United States; state interventionism in the universities’ curricula, and the influence exerted by other non-academic social actors, such as journalists’ unions. As the result of the influence of these factors, Communication Studies organized according to two entirely different logics: undergraduate studies focus on specialized professional fields (such as Journalism, Advertising, Public Relations, Cinema) and adopt a practical approach with respect to them; otherwise, graduate studies employ a much more general and academic approach focusing on Communication as a whole. The article also discusses the challenges faced by Communication Studies at present, resulting both from the changes in the media landscape and a hostile political scenario, associated with the rise of Jair Bolsonaro, an ultra-rightist politician who openly disdains science (and human sciences in particular).","de Albuquerque, Afonso; Tavares, Camilla Quesada",Publizistik,494,22

Therefore, a new method for detecting CAM-resistant H. pylori using a minimally invasive technique is strongly desired. We aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of our newly developed nested polymerase chain reaction-quenching probe (Nested PCR-QP) method using stool specimens. METHODS: We first evaluated our method using a residual solution of the H. pylori stool antigen test for adolescents. Then, we evaluated our method using culture testing for adults. RESULTS: Among 57 middle school students with H. pylori, the Nested PCR-QP test results of 53 (90.3%) were able to be analyzed. A total of 28 students had CAM resistance mutations. We found a genetic mutation in 28 students and no mutation in 23 students, and these results were consistent with those of PCR-direct sequencing. In the 23 adults who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection using the rapid urease test and culture testing, we were able to use Nested PCR-QP for analyzing 21 adults who tested positive in the stool H. pylori antigen test. The results obtained for all 21 adults were consistent with those obtained via the drug susceptibility test. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method could be useful for non-invasively detecting CAM resistance mutations in H. pylori. This may help select a drug to reduce eradication failure rates against H. pylori.

In addition to time and safety constraints, we identified access to design spaces with biochemistry, computing, electronic, computing, and manufacturing tools, and team-based learning as major challenges to distance learning in BME design courses. To this end, we mapped and translated various course and design activities to an online environment using a combination of customized at-home laboratory kits and distributed team structures.

At the end of 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a previously unknown respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The world health organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in the second week of March 2020. Simultaneous deep learning detection and classification of COVID-19 based on the full resolution of digital X-ray images is the key to efficiently assisting patients by enabling physicians to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis decision. In this paper, a simultaneous deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the YOLO predictor is proposed that can detect and diagnose COVID-19, differentiating it from eight other respiratory diseases: atelectasis, infiltration, pneumothorax, masses, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and nodules. The proposed CAD system was assessed via five-fold tests for the multi-class prediction problem using two different databases of chest X-ray images: COVID-19 and ChestX-ray8. The proposed CAD system was trained with an annotated training set of 50,490 chest X-ray images. The regions on the entire X-ray images with lesions suspected of being due to COVID-19 were simultaneously detected and classified end-to-end via the proposed CAD predictor, achieving overall detection and classification accuracies of 96.31% and 97.40%, respectively. Most test images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases were correctly predicted, achieving average intersection over union (IoU) greater than 90%. Applying deep learning regularizers of data balancing and augmentation improved the COVID-19 diagnostic performance by 6.64% and 12.17% in terms of the overall accuracy and the F1-score, respectively. It is feasible to achieve a diagnosis based on individual chest X-ray images with the proposed CAD system within 0.0093 s. Thus, the CAD system presented in this paper can make a prediction at the rate of 108 frames/s (FPS), which is close to real-time. The proposed deep learning CAD system can reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases. The proposed deep learning model seems to be a reliable tool that can be used to practically assist health care systems, patients, and physicians.","Al-antari, Mugahed A.; Hua, Cam-Hao; Bang, Jaehun; Lee, Sungyoung",Appl Intell,494,1

Injury and damage to neurons of the brain are the prime causes of neuroAIDS, which happens due to the ingress of HIV by direct permeation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or else via peripherally infected macrophage into the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB performs as a stringent barricade for the delivery of therapeutics drugs. The intranasal route of drug administration exhibits as a non-invasive technique to bypass the BBB for the delivery of antiretroviral drugs and other active pharmaceutical ingredients inside the brain and CNS. This method is fruitful for the drugs that are unable to invade the BBB to show its action in the CNS and thus erase the demand of systemic delivery and thereby shrink systemic side effects. Drug delivery from the nose to the brain/CNS takes very less time through both olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Intranasal delivery does not require the involvement of any receptor as it occurs by an extracellular route. Nose to brain delivery also involves nasal associated lymphatic tissues (NALT) and deep cervical lymph nodes. However, very little research has been done to explore the utility of nose to brain delivery of antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of neuroAIDS. This review focuses on the potential of nasal route for the effective delivery of antiretroviral nanoformulations directly from nose to the brain.","Sarma, Anupam; Das, Malay K.",Mol Biomed,494,1

After first taking power and in accordance with its concerns about attaining domestic and international legitimacy, AKP launched a democratization process by implementing several reforms leading toward EU membership. During this process, the boundaries of politics were broadened, enabling political discussion of certain taboo topics. However, this trend was reversed after AKP’s authoritarian populist tendencies strengthened. The party’s growing anti-intellectualist stance has also made scholars the target of the government’s populist discourse. These circumstances make it critical to examine the challenges Turkey’s political scientists experience since their discipline is directly influenced by the boundaries of what is political. This study therefore explores these challenges through ten in-depth interviews conducted with political scientists. It finds that political scientists mostly engage in self-censorship to protect themselves under Turkey’s populist authoritarian atmosphere, which has narrowed down in-class discussion and research agendas leading to the impoverishment of the discipline in Turkey.

Co-infections are among many factors associated with immune dysfunction and sub-optimal vaccination outcomes. Chronic, asymptomatic viral infections can contribute to the modulation of vaccine efficacy through various mechanisms. Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) persists in immune cells thereby potentially modulating immune responses. We investigated whether Pegivirus infection influences vaccine-induced responses and protection in African volunteers undergoing whole P. falciparum sporozoites-based malaria vaccination and controlled human malaria infections (CHMI). METHODS: HPgV-1 prevalence was quantified by RT-qPCR in plasma samples of 96 individuals before, post vaccination with PfSPZ Vaccine and after CHMI in cohorts from Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea. The impact of HPgV-1 infection was evaluated on (1) systemic cytokine and chemokine levels measured by Luminex, (2) PfCSP-specific antibody titers quantified by ELISA, (3) asexual blood-stage parasitemia pre-patent periods and parasite multiplication rates, (4) HPgV-1 RNA levels upon asexual blood-stage parasitemia induced by CHMI. RESULTS: The prevalence of HPgV-1 was 29.2% (28/96) and sequence analysis of the 5′ UTR and E2 regions revealed the predominance of genotypes 1, 2 and 5. HPgV-1 infection was associated with elevated systemic levels of IL-2 and IL-17A. Comparable vaccine-induced anti-PfCSP antibody titers, asexual blood-stage multiplication rates and pre-patent periods were observed in HPgV-1 positive and negative individuals. However, a tendency for higher protection levels was detected in the HPgV-1 positive group (62.5%) compared to the negative one (51.6%) following CHMI. HPgV-1 viremia levels were not significantly altered after CHMI. CONCLUSIONS: HPgV-1 infection did not alter PfSPZ Vaccine elicited levels of PfCSP-specific antibody responses and parasite multiplication rates. Ongoing HPgV-1 infection appears to improve to some degree protection against CHMI in PfSPZ-vaccinated individuals. This is likely through modulation of immune system activation and systemic cytokines as higher levels of IL-2 and IL17A were observed in HPgV-1 infected individuals. CHMI is safe and well tolerated in HPgV-1 infected individuals. Identification of cell types and mechanisms of both silent and productive infection in individuals will help to unravel the biology of this widely present but largely under-researched virus.","Tumbo, Anneth-Mwasi; Schindler, Tobias; Dangy, Jean-Pierre; Orlova-Fink, Nina; Bieri, Jose Raso; Mpina, Maximillian; Milando, Florence A.; Juma, Omar; Hamad, Ali; Nyakarungu, Elizabeth; Chemba, Mwajuma; Mtoro, Ali; Ramadhan, Kamaka; Olotu, Ally; Makweba, Damas; Mgaya, Stephen; Stuart, Kenneth; Perreau, Matthieu; Stapleton, Jack T.; Jongo, Said; Hoffman, Stephen L.; Tanner, Marcel; Abdulla, Salim; Daubenberger, Claudia",Virol J,494,1

In response to observations that “lack of time” underlies reduced PA among older adults, recent work suggests even short bouts of PA can improve health and fitness. In addition, because they are frequently visited by older adults, an important conduit for PA promotion could be the primary care physician (PCP). However, most PCPs receive little training related to PA, rendering it difficult for them to offer meaningful counseling. Therefore, we explored the feasibility and impact of a PCP-prescribed one-minute daily functional exercise program, consisting of 30 s each of bodyweight push-ups and squats, among 24 patients 60 years of age or older. 42% of patients who were contacted started the exercise prescription and, over 24-weeks, completed approximately 114 sessions, while 75% completed at least half of the possible daily exercise sessions. As a group, the patients demonstrated increases in both maximal push-up and squat performance, though these increases plateaued following week-12. These preliminary results suggest that a PCP prescription of one-minute of daily functional exercise among older adult patients was feasible, acceptable, and effective for improving functional physical fitness. Given these findings, formal controlled research with recruitment from multiple clinics, random assignment to treatment conditions, and blinded assessments of objective functional physical performance should be pursued.","Sciamanna, Christopher N.; Ladwig, Matthew A.; Conroy, David E.; Schmitz, Kathryn H.; Silvis, Matthew L.; Ballentine, Noel H.; Auer, Brandon J.; Danilovich, Margaret K.",Prev Med Rep,494,1

In this study, transcriptome analysis was used to infer mechanisms activated during barrage formation in vic3-incompatible strains of Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus. Pronounced differential expression occurred in barraging strains of genes involved in mating pheromone (mf2-1, mf2-2), secondary metabolite production, detoxification (including oxidative stress), apoptosis-related, RNA interference, and HET-domain genes. Evidence for secondary metabolite production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation is supported through UPLC-HRMS analysis and cytological staining, respectively. Differential expression of mating-related genes and HET-domain genes was further examined by RT-qPCR of incompatible interactions involving each of the six vegetative incompatibility (vic) loci in C. parasitica and revealed distinct recognition process networks. We infer that vegetative incompatibility in C. parasitica activates defence reactions that involve secondary metabolism, resulting in increased toxicity of the extra- and intracellular environment. Accumulation of ROS (and other potential toxins) may result in detoxification failure and activation of apoptosis, sporulation, and the expression of associated pheromone genes. The incompatible reaction leaves abundant traces of a process-specific metabolome as conidiation is initiated.","Belov, Anatoly A; Witte, Thomas E; Overy, David P; Smith, Myron L",G3 (Bethesda),494,1

For instance, in news aggregator websites apart from readers, one can consider magazines (news agencies) or authors as other stakeholders. A multi-stakeholder recommender system generates a ranked list of items taking into account the preferences of multiple stakeholders. In this study, news recommendation is handled as a hypergraph ranking task, where relations between multiple types of objects and stakeholders are modeled in a unified hypergraph. The obtained results indicate that ranking on hypergraphs can be utilized as a natural multi-stakeholder recommender system that is able to adapt recommendations based on the importance of stakeholders.","Gharahighehi, Alireza; Vens, Celine; Pliakos, Konstantinos",ECML PKDD 2020 Workshops,494,1

The current methods have been focused on one-stage designs. In this article, we propose optimal two-stage designs for a single-arm study with the smallest expected sample size. We compare the performance of the new optimal two-stage designs with the existing one-stage design with regards to the expected sample size and the expected total study length. The simulation results indicate that the new two-stage designs can save the expected sample size substantially as compared to the one-stage design. We use a non-small cell lung cancer trial to illustrate the application of the proposed designs. The proposed optimal two-stage designs are recommended for use when time for patient accrual is longer than the pre-specified follow-up time.","Shan, Guogen",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,494,1

The Monod–Haldane functional response is considered for nonmonotonic behavior of both incidence rate and treatment rate. The model analysis shows that the model has two equilibria which are named as disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The stability analysis has been performed for the local and global behavior of the DFE and EE. With the help of the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , we investigate that DFE is locally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] and unstable when [Formula: see text] . The local stability of DFE at [Formula: see text] has been analyzed, and it is obtained that DFE exhibits a forward transcritical bifurcation. Further, we identify conditions for the existence of EE and show the local stability of EE under certain conditions. Moreover, the global stability behavior of DFE and EE has been investigated.

For IoT, many smart objects are interconnected and communicate through infrastructure of internet that is the base of a global network. The major challenge of IoT automation is to inter-connect heterogeneous devices, sensors and real-time application. Research has demonstrated recent development for a varied scope of solutions and devices of IoT eco-system. However, each interoperable technology provides its proprietary infrastructure and mechanism to communicate, which leads to IoT interoperability issue. Many research organizations, IoT industry and standardization institutes are working for empowering interoperability of resources between autonomous IoT devices. These efforts are categorized according to its implementation and usage considerations. The interoperable communication mechanism also depends on communication protocols and its communication models used at application layer. Major devices use MQTT, CoAP, RestAPI, AMQP and HTTP protocols at application layer for communication. This paper is intended to describe interoperability types and its impact on seamless communication. As a solution of interoperability issue, message bridge can be implemented between application layer protocols of request-response and publish-subscribe communication models. This paper demonstrate message bridge approach based on Ponte, which is open source IoT project designed by Eclipse for intercommunication between application layer protocols.

Process or code injection is one such technique to evade the detection of malware. Various process injection techniques are employed by malware to gain more stealth and to bypass security products. Detection of process injection attack is achieved with little effort on a physical machine as compared to a virtual machine. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect malware based on API function calls. API function call information has the ability to trace malware behavior.

METHODS: According to the screening of coronary angiography and quality control of blood samples, eight intermediate coronary lesion patients were selected, then eight patients with acute myocardial infarction, and eight patients with normal coronary angiography were matched by age and gender. Transcriptomics sequencing was conducted for the peripheral blood monocytes of these 24 samples by using the Illumina HiSeq high-throughput platform. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were applied to annotate the potential functions of DEGs. RESULTS: Compared with the normal coronary angiography group, we identified a total of 169 DEGs in the intermediate coronary lesion group, which were significantly enriched in 59 GO terms and 17 KEGG pathways. Compared with the normal coronary angiography group, we found a total of 2,028 DEGs, which were significantly enriched in 311 GO terms and 20 KEGG pathways in the acute myocardial infarction group. The cross-comparison between normal versus intermediate coronary lesion group, and normal versus acute myocardial infarction group included 98 differential genes with 65 up regulated and 33 down regulated genes, which were significantly enriched in 46 GO terms and 10 KEGG pathways. During the progression of CAD, there was a significant up-regulated expression of CSF3, IL-1A, CCR7, and IL-18, and down-regulated expression of MAPK14. Besides GO items such as inflammatory response was significantly enriched, KEGG analysis showed the most remarkable enrichments in IL-17 signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomics profiles vary in patients with different severity of CAD. CSF3, IL-1A, CCR7, IL-18, and MAPK14, as well as IL-17 signaling pathway and cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway related with inflammatory response might be the potential biomarker and targets for the treatment of coronary artery disease.","Wang, Chunyue; Song, Chenxi; Liu, Qianqian; Zhang, Rui; Fu, Rui; Wang, Hao; Yin, Dong; Song, Weihua; Zhang, Haitao; Dou, Kefei",Front Genet,494,1

We aimed to explore the incidence of stroke and thrombotic events within our local population with COVID-19 infection who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 57 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection admitted to Barnet General Hospital ICU between 6th March and 26th April 2020. Cases were reviewed to establish whether there had been imaging (CT or MRI) confirmed ischaemic stroke, intra-cerebral haemorrhage (ICH), venous sinus thrombosis (VST) or other thrombotic event, including pulmonary embolism (PE). Data was collected on baseline characteristics and blood tests including D-Dimer levels. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed t-test and Fischer’s exact test (FET). Findings: Nineteen patients (33%) were age 65 years or older (mean age 69, range 65 to 74 years) and of these 2 patients (10.5%) had imaging confirmed acute ischaemic stroke. In those under 65 (mean age 54, range 29–64 years) there was one confirmed ICH and one VST. The incidence of PE was 21% in both groups. Survival was significantly lower in the age 65 or older group (26.3% versus 63.2%, p = 0.0119 (FET)). Peak recorded D-Dimer levels also appeared to be significantly higher in the age 65 or older group (p = 0.0003, 95% CI 13068.89 to 39858.68). CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS: These findings highlight the importance of awareness of risk of thrombotic events, including acute stroke, in older adults with severe Covid-19 infection. It is possible that the incidence of stroke was underestimated, including due to challenges identifying clinical signs of acute stroke and safely obtaining imaging in this population. Further, ideally prospective, studies are required to more clearly elucidate the degree of association between COVID-19 infection and stroke and VST.","Hickmott, L; Jeyarajah, C; Logarajah, S; Webber, A; Epstein, D; Qureshi, S; Penge, J",Age Ageing,494,1

The post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among those surviving the disease were under evaluated. This study aimed to identify and compare PTSS and associated correlates among COVID-19 survivors and control subjects. A cross-sectional design with a convenience sampling included a total of 85 adults who survived COVID-19 virus infection and 85 control subjects (matched for age, sex, education, and socioeconomic level) who were recruited from Zagazig University Hospitals, Sharkia Province, Egypt. The participants were interviewed using a semistructured demographic and clinical checklist, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders (SCID-5), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Approximately, 72% of COVID-19 survivors experienced moderate-to-severe PTSS (compared to 53% of control subjects). Individuals who survived the COVID-19 virus infection were more likely to have intensified hyperarousal symptoms (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.7–4.4), with higher total IES-R scoring (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05). Among COVID-19 survivors, those who reported moderate-to-severe PTSS were likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms during their illness (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.4–11.9). CONCLUSIONS: PTSS was prevalent among COVID-19 survivors in Egypt. The hyperarousal symptoms were the most experienced ones.

The present study screened blood donor samples for anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). The prevalence of HEV infection was assessed on a total of 1,003 archived serum samples obtained from the National Blood Centre, Malaysia. The samples were collected from healthy blood donor from Klang Valley between 2017 and 2018. All samples were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to HEV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). HEV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 31/1003 (3.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1%–4.4%) and IgM in 9/1003 (0.9%; 95% CI 0.4%–1.7%) samples. In bivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG with respect to gender and district of origin. Although not statistically significant, males had higher odds of having anti-HEV IgG than females (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86; 95% CI 0.95–8.64). All anti-HEV IgG positive individuals were people of Chinese descent. Anti-HEV IgG increased significantly with age, from 0.6% (95% CI 0.1%–2.6%) of 18–30-year-old donors to 7.4% (95% CI 2.7%–17.0%) of donors older than 50 years and was highest among non-professional workers (5.3%; 95% CI 2.5%–10.5%). Increasing age and a non-professional occupation remained significant predictors for anti-HEV IgG in the multivariable analysis. Screening of blood donations for HEV in Malaysia is important to safeguard the health of transfusion recipients. The higher rates of HEV infection in blood from older donors and donors who are non-professional workers may provide insights into targeted groups for blood screening.","Wong, Li Ping; Lee, Hai Yen; Khor, Chee Sieng; Abdul-Jamil, Juraina; Alias, Haridah; Abu-Amin, Noryati; Mat-Radzi, Murniwati; Rohimi, Nurul Ashila; Mokhtardin, Hana Najian; AbuBakar, Sazaly; Zheng, Zizheng; Wu, Ting; Zhao, Qinjian; Xia, Ningshao",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,494,1

Our goal was to demonstrate the utility of frequentist, Bayesian, and fiducial statistical methods for evaluating the robustness of effects in identifying factors that contribute to cognitive engagement for older adults experiencing cognitive decline. We collected a total of 504 observations across two longitudinal waves of data from 28 cognitively impaired older adults. Participants’ systolic blood pressure responsivity, an index of cognitive engagement, was continuously sampled during cognitive testing. Participants reported on physical and mental health challenges and provided hair samples to assess chronic stress at each wave. Using the three statistical paradigms, we compared results from six model testing levels and longitudinal changes in health and stress predicting changes in cognitive engagement. Findings were mostly consistent across the three paradigms, providing additional confidence in determining effects. We extend selective engagement theory to cognitive impairment, noting that health challenges and stress appear to be important moderators. Further, we emphasize the utility of the Bayesian and fiducial paradigms for use with relatively small sample sizes because they are not based on asymptotic distributions. In particular, the fiducial paradigm is a useful tool because it provides more information than p values without the need to specify prior distributions, which may unduly influence the results based on a small sample.

There have been concerns regarding Covid-19 risk and infection to patients and healthcare workers, during major complex open surgical intervention, especially with minimally invasive surgery. This study examines the COVID-19 related risks to patients and healthcare workers following the re-introduction of major oesophago-gastric (OG) surgery. METHODS: This was an international, multi-centre, cohort study of open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy and gastrectomy procedures in specialist Upper GI centres, over a consecutive period of two months. Patients were recruited from nine European centres serving regions with a high population incidence of COVID-19 infections. 30-day operative morbidity and mortality data was collected for patients. All staff involved in the operative care of patients, were invited to complete a health-related survey. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were included in the study (71 oesophagectomy, 82 gastrectomy), of which 87 patients (57%) underwent minimally invasive surgery (59 esophagectomy, 28 gastrectomy). A total of 403 staff were eligible for inclusion of which 313 (78%) completed the health survey. Non- standardised precautions to minimise against the risks of COVID for patients and staff were implemented at the centres. There were no cases of Covid-19 among patients in the post-operative period, however, two healthcare workers developed self-limiting COVID infection. CONCLUSION: Precautions to minimise COVID-19 infection risk to healthcare staff and patients, have allowed the safe and successful reintroduction of major open and minimally invasive OG surgery.","Alasmar, Mohamed; Kausar, Afsana; Borgstein, Alexander; Moons, Johnny; Doran, Sophie; de Pascale, Stefano; Restrepo, Rafael; Verrengia, Apollonia; Alloggio, Mariella; Delgado, Ana Moro; del Val, Ismael Díez; Kumar, Sacheen; Giocapuzzi, Simone; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; de Vega Irañeta, Marta; Salcedo, Gabriel; Vorwald, Peter; Romario, Uberto Fumagalli; Nafteux, Philippe; Gisbertz, Suzanne; Chaudry, Asif; Alkhaffaf, Bilal; Kausar, Afsana",BJS Open,494,24

This study focuses on the relationship between WFH and small business performance during the pandemic. We built a theoretical framework based on firm profit maximization, compiled an up-to-date (March through November) real-time daily and weekly multifaceted data set, and empirically estimated fixed-effect panel data, fractional logit, and multilevel mixed effects models to test our hypotheses. We find that in states with higher WFH rates, small businesses performed better overall with industry variations, controlling for the local pandemic, economic, demographic, and policy factors. We also find that WFH rates increased even after stay-at-home orders (SHOs) were rescinded. With the ready technology and practice of WFH in the pandemic, our robust empirics confirm our theory and hypotheses and demonstrate WFH as a potential force that may expedite “creative destruction” instance and permanently impact industrial structure and peoples’ work lives. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The Rise of Working from Home (WFH) as a Silver Lining and “Creative Destruction” in the Pandemic: WFH Helps Small Businesses Perform Better with Industry Variations and Continues to Shine after Stay-at-Home Orders Ended. This study focuses on the role of working from home (WFH) for small business performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a theoretical framework based on firm profit maximization and identified WFH as a rational business choice. We then compiled a real-time multifaceted data set, estimated panel fixed-effect, fractional logit, and multilevel mixed effects models, and find that (1) small businesses in states with higher WFH rates performed better with industry variations, controlling for local pandemic and socioeconomic factors; and (2) WFH rates increased after stay-at-home orders were rescinded. Our study demonstrates WFH as a potential “creative destruction” force that may expedite our technologically ready WFH adoption and permanently impact industrial structure and peoples’ work lives.","Zhang, Ting; Gerlowski, Dan; Acs, Zoltan",Small Bus Econ,494,5

Vocal cord paralysis is a rare presenting symptom of hypocalcemia, especially without signs of overt tetany or seizures. Clinical case: 18 year old man with history of iron deficiency anemia and dyslipidemia presented with aphasia, right sided upper and lower extremity weakness and facial tingling for 3 days. Physical exam was notable for aphasia, pallor, positive Chvostek and Trousseau sign. Admission labs showed BUN 127 mg/dL (n 8–26 mg/dL), creatinine 12.74 mg/dL (n 0.8–2.00 mg/dL), calcium 5.2 mg/dL (n 8.5–10.5 mg/dL), magnesium (1.8–2.4 mg/dL), phosphorus 10.3 (2.4–4.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 126 (8–120 U/L), albumin 3.3 g/dL (n 3.0–5.0 g/dL), 25 OH VitD(3) 9.1 ng/mL (n 30–80 ng/mL), PTH 594 pg/mL (n 15–65 pg.mL), COVID 19 PCR negative. Aphasia resolved with 1 gram calcium gluconate infusion. Patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. He was placed on calcium carbonate 1500 mg oral three times daily, calcitriol 1 mcg oral twice daily, ergocalciferol 50,000 IU weekly, sevelamer carbonate 1600 mg tablet three times daily. Kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative pattern glomerulonephritis with C3 deposits. He was discharged on hemodialysis and referred to a transplant center. Conclusion: Vocal cord paralysis is rare in adults and mostly seen in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism caused by hypomagnesaemia.(2,3) Identifying vocal cord paralysis as an atypical presentation of hypocalcemia secondary to acute kidney failure requires prompt recognition and treatment.

This study aims to investigate in-hospital mortality, its clinical risk factors and the accuracy of the existing scoring system in predicting in-hospital mortality. METHODS: An observational prospective cohort study involving PTB patients with ARF in tertiary hospital, between January 2017 and December 2018, was conducted. The in-hospital mortality was predicted using the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and CRB-65. Regression models were run to analyze the clinical risk factors for in-hospital Mortality. Sensitivity and specificity of scoring systems were calculated using a Wilson score interval. RESULTS: A total of 111 subjects were included. Most of subjects were hypoxemic type respiratory failure (68.5%), advanced lesions (62.2%), new cases (70.3%) and pneumonia co-infection (72.1%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was utilized for 29.73% of cases. There were 53 (47.75%) in-hospital mortality cases and its risk factors were intensive phase treatment (3.34 OR; CI95% 1.27–8.78), P/F ratio < 100 (OR 4.30; CI 95% 1.75–10.59) and renal insufficiency (4.09 OR; CI95% 1.46–11.49). The sensitivity and specificity of NEWS2 ≥ 6, qSOFA ≥ 2 and CRB-65 ≥ 2 were 62.26% and 67.24%; 60.38% and 72.41%; 41.51% and 84.48% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most of PTB with ARF were new cases, advanced lesion and hypoxemic type respiratory failure. Intensive phase treatment, severe hypoxemia and renal insufficiency are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in PTB patients with ARF. NEWS2, qSOFA and CRB-65 scores were poor to predict the in-hospital mortality.","Elhidsi, Mia; Rasmin, Menaldi; Prasenohadi",J Clin Tuberc Other Mycobact Dis,494,1

These events were followed by 4 aftershocks of magnitude M(w) ≤ 3.0. We carried out morphotectonic (high stream length-gradient index) and static Coulomb stress failure analyses to delineate the hidden causative fault(s) in the region. In the study, ASTER DEM data of 30 m resolution and Survey of India (SoI) toposheets on 1:50,000 scales were used for morphotectonic analysis. The analysis depicted a very high stream length-gradient (SL) and fall in elevation in the epicentral area, suggesting the area to be tectonically active with a NE-SW trending fault line. In addition, the nature of static Coulomb failure stress contours for both the main events, M(w) 3.5 and M(w) 3.4, suggests an NNE-SSW trending high Coulomb stress regime. Such a high coulomb stress regime is obvious at the location where a high SL index and fall in elevation were marked, which clearly indicates the presence of NNE-SSW trending a causative fault, named ‘Khanpur-Japti fault’.","Bansal, Brijesh K.; Mohan, Kapil; Ul Haq, Ahsan; Verma, Mithila; Prajapati, S.

Many were serious injuries requiring hospitalisation and some requiring surgery. We investigated whether the lockdown led to a legitimate increase in incidence of cycling related injuries, resulting in a higher number of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). This would assess whether the guidance on exercise during lockdown was appropriate, shaping future regulation in the case of cyclical lockdowns. METHOD: Records were screened retrospectively for cycling related injuries between April 1st and May 12th (lockdown) 2020 and for same period in 2019 as a control group. Injury severity, distribution and number of surgical procedures resulting from these were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of injuries due to cycling rose threefold (n = 55) during the COVID-19 lockdown. Injuries included fractures, soft tissue injuries and mixed injuries. An increase in the number of operative procedures (n = 13) and AGPs was also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Vague guidance and allowance of one form of outdoor exercise per day may have unintentionally contributed to rise in cycling injuries as many took to cycling for recreation. To make the guidance appropriate, usual forms of exercise should be encouraged, risk taking behaviours discouraged and safe cycling practices endorsed.","Ansari, S A; Al-Jader, B; Khan, N; Younis, F",Br J Surg,494,1

The use of the neutrophil-derived Heparin-binding protein (HBP) as a biomarker for pneumonia was investigated in this exploratory case–control study in two intensive care units at a tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: Patients with clinical signs of pneumonia were recruited and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or bronchial wash (BW) samples were collected. Mechanically ventilated and lung healthy subjects were recruited as controls. HBP was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: BALF was collected from 14 patients with pneumonia and 14 healthy controls. Median HBP in BALF pneumonia samples was 14,690 ng/ml and controls 16.2 ng/ml (p < 0.0001). BW was collected from 10 pneumonia patients and 10 mechanically ventilated controls. Median HBP in BW pneumonia was 9002 ng/ml and controls 7.6 ng/ml (p < 0.0001).

However, the concept of stress was cross-utilized to refer to different elements of the stress system including stressful stimulus, stressor, stress response, and stress effect. Here, we summarized the evolution of the concept of stress and the framework of the stress system. We find although the concept of stress is developed from Selye's “general adaptation syndrome”, it has now expanded and evolved significantly. Stress is now defined as a state of homeostasis being challenged, including both system stress and local stress. A specific stressor may potentially bring about specific local stress, while the intensity of stress beyond a threshold may commonly activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and result in a systematic stress response. The framework of the stress system indicates that stress includes three types: sustress (inadequate stress), eustress (good stress), and distress (bad stress). Both sustress and distress might impair normal physiological functions and even lead to pathological conditions, while eustress might benefit health through hormesis-induced optimization of homeostasis. Therefore, an optimal stress level is essential for building biological shields to guarantee normal life processes.","Lu, Siyu; Wei, Fang; Li, Guolin",,494,4

Mobile health (mHealth) apps can optimize processes and facilitate access to health information by combining treatment methods with attractive solutions. In this study, we aimed at verifying the influence of using an mHealth app on patients’ adherence to hypertension treatment, also examining how user experience toward the app influenced the outcomes. A total of 49 participants completed the study, men and women, diagnosed with hypertension and ongoing medical treatment. For 12 weeks, the control group continued with conventional monitoring, while the experimental group used an mHealth app. From the experimental group, at baseline, 8% were non-adherent, 64% were partial adherents and 28% were adherent to the treatment. Baseline in the control group indicated 4.2% non-adherents, 58.3% partial adherents, and 37.5% adherents. After follow-up, the experimental group had an increase to 92% adherent, 8% partially adherent, and 0% non-adherent (P < 0.001). In the control group, adherence after follow-up remained virtually the same (P ≥ 0.999). Results of user experience were substantially positive and indicate that the participants in the experimental group had a satisfactory perception of the app. In conclusion, this study suggests that using an mHealth app can empower patients to manage their own health and increase adherence to hypertension treatment, especially when the app provides a positive user experience.","Volpi, Simiane Salete; Biduski, Daiana; Bellei, Ericles Andrei; Tefili, Danieli; McCleary, Lynn; Alves, Ana Luisa Sant’Anna; De Marchi, Ana Carolina Bertoletti",PeerJ,494,1

On one side, the alkoxy chain length varies from 8 to 16 carbon atoms. On the other side, terminal small compact groups substituting aniline with various polarities are used. Hydrogen-bonding interaction was elucidated by FTIR spectroscopy. The mesomorphic thermal and optical characteristics of the samples were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). All samples exhibit enantiotropic mesophases. Experimental results obtained for the induced mesophases were correlated with density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. The results revealed that both the polar compact groups’ polarity and the alkoxy chain lengths contribute strongly to mesomorphic characteristics and thermal stabilities of the mesophases. Surprisingly, the observed values of enthalpy changes associated with the crystalline mesomorphic transitions lie in the range of 2.2–12.5 kJ/mol.

All prepared complexes were prepared from 4-n-alkoxybenzoic acid (An) and N-4-cyanobenzylidene-4-n-(hexyloxy)benzenamine (I). FT-IR, temperature gradient NMR, Mass Spectrometer and Chromatography spectroscopy were carried out to confirm the -CN and −COOH H-bonded complexation by observing their Fermi-bands and the effects of the 1H-NMR signals as well as its elution signal from HPLC. Moreover, binary phase diagrams were established for further confirmation. All formed complexes (I/An) were studied by the use of differential scanning calorimetry and their phase properties were validated through the use of polarized optical microscopy Results of mesomorphic characterization revealed that all presented complexes exhibited enantiotropic mesophases and their type was dependent on the terminal lengths of alkoxy chains. Also, the mesomorphic temperature ranges decreased in the order I/A6 > I/A8 > I/A10 > I/A16 with linear dependency on the chain length. Finally, the density functional theory computational modeling has been carried out to explain the experimental findings. The relation between the dimensional parameters was established to show the effect of the aspect ratio on the mesophase range and stability. The normalized entropy of the clearing transitions (∆S/R) was calculated to illustrate the molecular interaction enhancements with the chain lengths.","Hagar, Mohamed; Ahmed, Hoda A.; Alnoman, Rua B.; Jaremko, Mariusz; Emwas, Abdul-Hamid; Sioud, Salim; Abu Al-Ola, Khulood A.",Front Chem,494,1

They are abundant in bio-fluids and harbor specific molecular constituents from their parental cells. Due to these characteristics, EXOs have a great potential in cancer diagnostics for liquid biopsy and personalized medicine. Despite this unique potential, EXOs are not yet widely applied in clinical settings, with two main factors hindering their translational process in diagnostics. Firstly, conventional extraction methods are time-consuming, require large sample volumes and expensive equipment, and often do not provide high-purity samples. Secondly, characterization methods have some limitations, because they are often qualitative, need extensive labeling or complex sampling procedures that can induce artifacts. In this context, novel label-free approaches are rapidly emerging, and are holding potential to revolutionize EXO diagnostics. These methods include the use of nanodevices for EXO purification, and vibrational spectroscopies, scattering, and nanoindentation for characterization. In this progress report, we summarize recent key advances in label-free techniques for EXO purification and characterization. We point out that these methods contribute to reducing costs and processing times, provide complementary information compared to the conventional characterization techniques, and enhance flexibility, thus favoring the discovery of novel and unexplored EXO-based biomarkers. In this process, the impact of nanotechnology is systematically highlighted, showing how the effectiveness of these techniques can be enhanced using nanomaterials, such as plasmonic nanoparticles and nanostructured surfaces, which enable the exploitation of advanced physical phenomena occurring at the nanoscale level.","Di Santo, Riccardo; Romanò, Sabrina; Mazzini, Alberto; Jovanović, Svetlana; Nocca, Giuseppina; Campi, Gaetano; Papi, Massimiliano; De Spirito, Marco; Di Giacinto, Flavio; Ciasca, Gabriele",Nanomaterials (Basel),494,1

The purpose of this study was to determine how the use of digital teaching resources in gross anatomy education changed from before to during Covid‐19. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were obtained from an IRB‐approved survey distributed to professional associations and listservs targeting anatomy educators from June to November 2020. Respondents were asked to select the digital resources they used before and during Covid‐19. Data were analyzed during the early and latter parts of the pandemic as May‐August (T1) and August‐December (T2), as well as overall (T3). T2 data were classified into five categories: 2D illustrations, dissection media, interactive software, in‐house, and open access. Total usage for each timepoint, the proportions of digital resources, and the 5 categories before and during Covid‐19 were compared using McNemar's test with alpha<5%. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (‐value). RESULTS: 60 and 208 responses were received for T1 and T2, respectively. The total number of digital resources used for anatomy education increased from before to during COVID‐19 as seen in the data analysis from T1 (+47%), T2 (+41%), and T3 (+43%) (P≤0.003). In T1, the use of BlueLink (+122%) and Complete Anatomy (+140%) software increased (P<0.04), while Acland's Anatomy (+68%), Anatomy.TV (+1300%), Complete Anatomy (+89%), and BlueLink (+148%) increased in T2 (P≤0.03). During T3, the usage of Acland's Anatomy (+60%), Anatomy.TV (+750%), Complete Anatomy (+102%), BlueLink (+143%), and VisibleBody (+100%) increased (P≤0.03). All other digital resources did not change (P>0.05). When data for T2 were categorized, dissection media (+44%), interactive software (+87%), and open‐access (+100%) content increased (P≤0.008), while 2D illustrations (‐3%) and in‐house content (‐23%) decreased (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates sustained increases in digital resource usage for gross anatomy education during Covid‐19. This was particularly pronounced for interactive software, open access resources and dissection media that allowed educators to mimic features of a dissection lab. SIGNIFICANCE: These rapid shifts in both commercial and free digital resources are likely to drive innovation in anatomy education for years to come. It remains unknown if the current findings are transient Covid‐19‐related changes or if they will persist long‐term.","Goldman, Haviva; Attardi, Stefanie; Barremkala, Malli; Bentley, Danielle; Brown, Kirsten; Dennis, Jennifer; Farkas, Gary; Harrell, Kelly; Klein, Barbie; Ramnanan, Christopher; Harmon, Derek",FASEB J,494,1

Prosection and model‐based courses, online and virtual reality approaches have been introduced over time, due to reduction in teaching time, and due to economic reasons with decreasing budget. In 2020, we were challenged by the pandemic of SARS‐CoV‐2 and corresponding COVID‐19 public health measures. We had to change and adapt several times anatomy teaching and learning over the two semesters for the cohort of 112 first/second year undergraduate medical students. With the experience of this student cohort with various anatomy learning approaches, we wanted to know what anatomy teaching method was best perceived by the students. METHODS: 112 medical students were asked about their learning experience with various anatomy teaching approaches for 2020, including 1) dissection‐based learning, 2) prosections and models‐based demonstrations, 3) structured self‐directed learning using written instructions and corresponding anatomical material, 4) structured self‐directed learning using online instructions via Moodle and an online anatomy program (https://e‐learn.anatomy.uzh.ch/Anatomy/Anatomy.html; German version). All students agreed to participate in the study. The questionnaire was administered by https://www.surveymonkey.com and done anonymously. To date 66/112 (59%) students replied. RESULTS: The majority of the students (92%) preferred the dissection course as their main anatomy learning method, 80% of students were happy with a demonstration course using prosections and anatomical models. Only a minority liked to have structured self‐directed learning with either anatomical specimens and models (42%) or with online material (36%). Rather few students preferred learning with an online course (18%) or through unstructured self‐directed learning using their own resources (12%). For the dissection course the students appreciated the 3 dimensional aspect (92%), the real size appearance of the structures (90%), the active explorative approach (81%), the topographical relationship of the structures (81%) and anatomical variability (72%). During complete lock‐down of the COVID‐19 measures when the students had to stay isolated at home for several weeks, the majority of students thought that the offered online structured self‐directed course was most adequate under those circumstances (55%), but would otherwise not be the preferred replacement of a dissection course (55%). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of student experience with a variety of anatomy learning methods clearly indicate that a structured dissection‐based course with additional anatomical demonstration would be preferred by the majority of our students. Online material would be beneficial as additional learning support. However, the majority of students agreed that, under strict COVID‐19 stay‐at‐home measures, the structured self‐directed online course was the best way to learn anatomy. When going back to normal, we will offer the newly developed online material for guided self‐directed learning, in addition to the established dissection course.","Filgueira, Luis; Larionov, Alexey; Lannes, Nils; Yotovski, Peter",FASEB J,494,1

The aim of this study was gaining an understanding of journalists’ changing role perceptions in health crisis coverage, and moreover to examine potential differences between general and specialist reporters. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with reporters with experience in health crisis reporting in Germany and Finland. Findings suggest that journalists’ roles shift when covering health crises (versus non-crises), towards a role as public mobilizers, towards classifying risks and from a watchdog to a more co-operative role. Furthermore, professional characteristics matter in journalists’ understanding and performance of their roles. Specialist reporters appear better equipped to deal with the challenges of health crisis coverage, such as balancing remaining critical with co-operation with authorities in their efforts to contain crises. Specialist reporters are also less likely to get swayed by the panic often accompanying health crises than general reporters are.","Klemm, Celine; Das, Enny; Hartmann, Tilo",Journalism (Lond),494,1

Yet, in response to the pandemic, the Federal Government has indefinitely suspended Australian children’s television quotas, the regulatory framework that sets minimum hours of local children’s content for commercial television broadcasters. In response to government imposed budgetary restraints, public broadcaster, the ABC, has also made redundances in its children’s content department. Such changes have occurred at a critical juncture in which the sector’s long-standing contributions to the education of Australian children and pedagogy of local teachers, caregivers and parents have been brought to the fore.

METHODS: Firstly, ingredients in FXF with pharmacological activities, together with specific targets, were identified based on the BATMA-TCM and TCMSP databases. Then, targets associated with pulmonary fibrosis, which included pathogenic targets as well as those known therapeutic targets, were screened against the CTD, TTD, GeneCards, and DisGeNet databases. Later, Cytoscape was employed to construct a candidate component-target network of FXF for treating pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, for nodes within the as-constructed network, topological parameters were calculated using CytoHubba plug-in, and the degree value (twice as high as the median degree value for all the nodes) was adopted to select core components as well as core targets of FXF for treating pulmonary fibrosis, which were subsequently utilized for constructing the core network. Furthermore, molecular docking study was carried out on those core active ingredients together with the core targets using AutoDock Vina for verifying results of network pharmacology analysis. At last, OmicShare was employed for enrichment analysis of the core targets. RESULTS: Altogether 12 active ingredients along with 13 core targets were identified from our constructed core component-target network of FXF for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. As revealed by enrichment analysis, the 13 core targets mostly concentrated in regulating biological functions, like response to external stimulus (from oxidative stress, radiation, UV, chemical substances, and virus infection), apoptosis, cell cycle, aging, immune process, and protein metabolism. In addition, several pathways, like IL-17, AGE-RAGE, TNF, HIF-1, PI3K-AKT, NOD-like receptor, T/B cell receptor, and virus infection-related pathways, exerted vital parts in FXF in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: FXF can treat pulmonary fibrosis through a “multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway” mean. Findings in this work lay foundation for further exploration of the FXF mechanism in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.","Chen, Xiao-Li; Tang, Cheng; Xiao, Qing-Ling; Pang, Zhong-Hua; Zhou, Dan-Dan; Xu, Jin; Wang, Qi; Zhao, Ya-xi; Zhu, Qi-Yong",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,494,27

Yet children and youth also have the capacity to be resilient and act as powerful catalysts for change in their own lives and wider communities following disaster. Specific factors that contribute to resilience in children and youth, however, remain relatively unexplored. This article examines factors associated with high levels of resilience in 100 children and youth aged 5- to 18-years old who experienced the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta wildfire. A mixed-methods design was employed combining quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data was obtained from the Children and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) which measured individual, caregiver, and context factors influencing resilience processes among the participants. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews to gain further insight into the disaster experiences of children and youth. Quantitative findings reveal higher than average levels of resilience among the participants compared to normative scores. Qualitative findings suggest high levels of resilience were associated with both caregiver factors (specifically physical caregiving), and individual factors (primarily peer support). We discuss how physical caregiving and peer support during and after the wildfire helped mitigate the negative effects of disaster, thus bolstering children and youth's resilience. Implications for understanding the specific social-ecological factors that facilitate and support resiliency processes and overall recovery of children and youth following disaster are also discussed.","McDonald-Harker, Caroline; Drolet, Julie L.; Sehgal, Anika; Brown, Matthew R.

METHOD: Seventy-five patients with aneurysmal SAH who underwent aneurysm clipping were retrospectively analyzed and were divided into two groups according to the different postoperative drainage methods. The lumbar spine group received lumbar puncture drainage, and the lumbar cistern group received lumbar pool continuous drainage to compare the efficacy. RESULT: The time to normalize intracranial pressure and headache relief after drainage treatment in the lumbar cistern group was shorter than that in the lumbar spine group. The GOS score was higher than that in the lumbar spine group, and the cerebral artery flow velocity and NIHSS score were significantly lower than those in the lumbar spine group (P < 0.05). The total effective rate of drainage treatment was 76.32% in the lumbar cistern group, which was higher than that in the lumbar spine group (54.05%) (P < 0.05). The total complication rate was 18.42% in the lumbar cistern group, which was lower than that in the lumbar spine group (40.54%) (P < 0.05).

The impact of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (CRS) is even greater than that of treatment resistance in terms of severe and persistent symptoms, relapses and hospitalizations, poorer quality of life, and healthcare costs. Such serious consequences often compel clinicians to try different augmentation strategies to enhance the inadequate clozapine response in CRS. Unfortunately, a large body of evidence has shown that antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, electroconvulsive therapy, and cognitive-behavioural therapy are mostly ineffective in augmenting clozapine response. When beneficial effects of augmentation have been found, they are usually small and of doubtful clinical significance or based on low-quality evidence. Therefore, newer treatment approaches that go beyond the evidence are needed. The options proposed include developing a clinical consensus about the augmentation strategies that are most likely to be effective and using them sequentially in patients with CRS. Secondly, newer approaches such as augmentation with long-acting antipsychotic injections or multi-component psychosocial interventions could be considered. Lastly, perhaps the most effective way to deal with CRS would be to optimize clozapine treatment, which might prevent clozapine resistance from developing. Personalized dosing, adequate treatment durations, management of side effects and non-adherence, collaboration with patients and caregivers, and addressing clinician barriers to clozapine use are the principal ways of ensuring optimal clozapine treatment. At present, these three options could the best way to manage CRS until research provides more firm directions about the effective options for augmenting clozapine response.","Chakrabarti, Subho",World J Psychiatry,494,1

Previous studies reported that CDC20 is involved in the occurrence and progression of a variety of malignant tumors. So, whether CDC20 will affect the development of HCC, we have conducted in-depth research on this. Methods: We selected Hep3B and HepG2 for cell culture, and performed siRNA transfection, lentiviral infection, western blot, MTS determination, cell cycle determination, apoptosis test, immunodeficiency test, clone survival test and subcutaneous parthenogenesis in nude mice. Results: Knockdown of CDC20 greatly enhanced the radiation efficacy on the growth retardation in HepG2, and protein level of CDC20 was decreased for the activation of P53 by radiation. Downregulation of CDC20 combined with radiation can inhibit proliferation, aggravate DNA damage, increase G2/M arrest, and promote apoptosis of HCC cells to a greater extent, and the relative survival fraction of HCC cells was gradually reduced with radiation dose increased in P53 mutated Hep3B cells. After knocking down CDC20 in HCC, Bcl-2 was down-regulated and Bax expression increased. Down-regulation of CDC20 can inhibit further invasion by promoting the radiosensitivity of HCC. Conclusion: In this study, we found that that CDC20 was highly expressed in HCC and participated in radio resistance of HCC cells with P53 mutation Bcl-2/Bax via signaling pathway. This study is the first to present evidence that CDC20 may play a role in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy in HCC.","Zhao, Shuai; Zhang, Yichi; Lu, Xiuqin; Ding, Han; Han, Bing; Song, Xiaoling; Miao, Huijie; Cui, Xuya; Wei, Shiyin; Liu, Wangrui; Chen, Shuxian; Wang, Jian",Int J Biol Sci,494,17

A feature list was thus obtained. Then, the incremental feature selection (IFS) method adopted such list to extract essential mutation features related to 27 cancer types, find out 207 mutation rules and construct efficient classifiers. The top 37 mutation features corresponding to different cancer types were discussed. All the qualitatively analyzed gene mutation features contribute to the distinction of different types of cancers, and most of such mutation rules are supported by recent literature.

In view of expected disruption duration, price rise, and inventory holding cost, three types of stockpiling behavior are analytically provided for the customers: non-stockpiling, gradual stockpiling, and instantaneous stockpiling. Next, a model is formulated to optimize the joint decision of contingent sourcing time and quantity, with the objective of maximizing profit expectation.

However, the crystal structure of Mtb EF-G1 is not yet available, and this has limited the design of inhibitors. Here, we report the crystal structure of Mtb EF-G1 in complex with GDP. The unique crystal form of the Mtb EF-G1-GDP complex provides an excellent platform for fragment-based screening using a crystallographic approach. Our findings provide a structure-based explanation for GDP recognition, and facilitate the identification of EF-G1 inhibitors with potential interest in the context of drug discovery.","Gao, Xiaopan; Yu, Xia; Zhu, Kaixiang; Qin, Bo; Wang, Wei; Han, Pu; Aleksandra Wojdyla, Justyna; Wang, Meitian; Cui, Sheng",Front Mol Biosci,494,16

Determining the evacuation routes and safe areas is equally important in tsunami evacuation planning. It can be established from least cost distance (LCD) anisotropic model. We use the coastal of Drini, Gunungkidul, Java, Indonesia, as the study area, which is located in a tropical coastal karst region, with a typical karst cone formation. The topographic condition of the karst cone could be an ideal location for tsunami vertical evacuation (TVE). High-resolution orthomosaic images and digital elevation model (DEM) generated from the structure from motion (SfM) process were used as the main data. The tsunami inundation model was calculated based on neighboring operations using raster calculator from the elevation value in the DEM. Land cover identification from high-scale orthomosaic images showed the variation in speed conservation values (SCVs). The slope value was also used as a surface cost that will affect the travel time to the TVE shelters. The results of the model show that TVE is the main alternative in tsunami evacuation planning beside horizontal evacuation. They provide an evaluation of the location of the assembly points and evacuation routes provided by the government, which have been considered ineffective because of the inappropriate model. The results of the study provide an overview of determining the evacuation routes and shelters. Optimum locations can minimize travel time, provide adequate capacity, and be safe from inundation.","Marfai, Muh Aris; Khakim, Nurul; Fatchurohman, Hendy; Salma, Annisa Dzikra",Arab J Geosci,494,1

Current management strategies have been unable to keep pace with forest insect population outbreaks, and therefore novel and aggressive management strategies are urgently required to manage forest insects. RNA interference (RNAi), a Noble Prize-winning discovery, is an emerging approach that can be used for forest protection. The RNAi pathway is triggered by dsRNA molecules, which, in turn, silences genes and disrupts protein function, ultimately causing the death of the targeted insect. RNAi is very effective against pest insects; however, its proficiency varies significantly among insect species, tissues, and genes. The coleopteran forest insects are susceptible to RNAi and can be the initial target, but we lack practical means of delivery, particularly in systems with long-lived, endophagous insects such as the Emerald ash borer, Asian longhorn beetles, and bark beetles. The widespread use of RNAi in forest pest management has major challenges, including its efficiency, target gene selection, dsRNA design, lack of reliable dsRNA delivery methods, non-target and off-target effects, and potential resistance development in wood-boring pest populations. This review focuses on recent innovations in RNAi delivery that can be deployed against forest pests, such as cationic liposome-assisted (lipids), nanoparticle-enabled (polymers or peptides), symbiont-mediated (fungi, bacteria, and viruses), and plant-mediated deliveries (trunk injection, root absorption). Our findings guide future risk analysis of dsRNA-based forest protection products (FPPs) and risk assessment frameworks incorporating sequence complementarity-based analysis for off-target predictions. This review also points out barriers to further developing RNAi for forest pest management and suggests future directions of research that will build the future use of RNAi against wood-boring coleopterans.","Joga, Mallikarjuna Reddy; Mogilicherla, Kanakachari; Smagghe, Guy; Roy, Amit",Front Plant Sci,494,22

Among US Veterans with HK, this retrospective, observational cohort study evaluated patiromer utilization, RAASi continuation, and K+ concentration change following patiromer initiation.Methods: Using data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, Veterans with HK (K+ ≥5.1 mmol/L) were included upon patiromer initiation (index date) during the study period (1/2016-8/2018). All patients had heart failure (HF), diabetes, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with end-stage renal disease were excluded. The following outcomes were assessed within 6-months post-patiromer initiation: patiromer utilization (using proportion of days covered); K+ concentration change (pre- vs post-initiation); and RAASi continuation.Results: 288 Veterans with HK were included. Baseline characteristics were: median age 70 years, African-American race 24%, diabetes 83%, HF 32%, CKD 95%, and median K+ concentration 5.7 mmol/L. At 1, 3, and 6 months post-index, the median patiromer PDC was 100%, 66%, and 44%, respectively. K+ concentration reductions post-patiromer initiation were, on average, - 1.0 mmol/L (P < 0.001). At 3-6 months, 71% of patiromer initiators had K+ <5.1 mmol/L and 95% had K+ <5.5 mmol/L. RAASi therapy was continued in >80%-90% of patiromer-treated patients.Conclusions: The real-world utilization results suggest patiromer is used for the chronic management of HK. Clinically relevant K+ concentration reductions were observed at all study time points. The successful management of HK may have contributed to the observed high rate of RAASi therapy continuation. Further research is warranted to corroborate and extend these findings.","Kovesdy, Csaba P; Gosmanova, Elvira O; Woods, Steven D; Fogli, Jeanene J; Rowan, Christopher G; Hansen, Jared L; Sauer, Brian C",Postgraduate medicine,494,24

There is a need for establishing an animal model that would facilitate experimental research on the technique. The aim of the present study was to describe a safe and efficient laparoscopic technique of 70% partial hepatectomy in the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four male Wistar rats underwent either laparoscopic (group LAP-HEP) or open resection of the median and left lateral hepatic lobes (group HEP). In group LAP-HEP, a 5-mm Hg pneumoperitoneum was established. Three 5-mm trocars were introduced in the abdominal cavity. A self-made pretied ligature loop was used to ligate en bloc the pedicles of the hepatic lobes to be resected. A self-made sterile elastic specimen retrieval bag facilitated extraction of the resected liver tissue. In group HEP, the same liver lobes were resected by ligation of their pedicles after midline laparotomy. RESULTS The percentage of resected liver parenchyma did not differ between groups. All animals returned to normal feeding activity by 48 h postoperation and had no complications. CONCLUSIONS A simple, cost-effective, safe, and efficient laparoscopic technique for 70% partial hepatectomy in the rat was described.","Ypsilantis, Petros; Simopoulos, Constantinos",The Journal of surgical research,494,7

A previous meta-analysis of ACT trials in psychosis reported a large effect size of ACT against overall psychotic symptomatology. However, there were critical methodological issues in the review that justify replication. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing ACT vs. any comparator condition in a sample of adults with psychosis. The outcome of interest was overall psychotic symptomatology. RESULTS The search identified seven published and eight unpublished trials (of which we were able to obtain data from one). Data on symptomatology were extracted from six trials that involved 274 participants. The summary effect size (Hedge's G) for overall symptomatology was small and not significant (-0.21, 95%CI -0.60-0.18). Trials were generally rated as having a high risk of bias. Safety reporting was inadequate across included trials. CONCLUSIONS Our observed effect size contrasted with that reported in a previous meta-analysis; differences were likely explained by errors in data extraction. The findings of this review suggest that there is currently inadequate evidence to conclude that ACT is a safe and effective treatment against psychotic symptomatology.

The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence and spectrum of infections in patients with NHL receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy and the impact on survival. Materials and Methods From January 2011 to December 2012, all patients diagnosed with NHL who received at least one dose of rituximab were included. Results During the study period, 265 patients received rituximab; 108 (40.8%) males; the mean age was 60 ± 15 years. There were 177 infections in 85 patients, being the most common febrile neutropenia (n = 38; 21.5%) and mucosal barrier injury-related infections (n = 28; 15.8%). In 88 events (49%), there was a microbiologic diagnosis, being bacterial infection the most frequent (39.6%), but tuberculosis (TB) was developed in 4 cases (1.5%; incidence rate 721/100,000 person-year). During follow-up, 71 patients died (27%); in 35 cases, it was related to infection. There were no differences in follow-up between those who died due to infection versus those who died from another cause (p = 0.188). Multivariate analysis for mortality showed that age >60 years, failure to achieve a complete response, and development of an infectious complication increased the risk of death. Conclusions It is important to perform a screening test for TB in all patients who will receive rituximab and maintain a constant monitoring to detect an infectious process and begin treatment as soon as possible.","Meza-Meneses, Patricia; Cornejo-Juárez, Patricia; Vilar-Compte, Diana; Volkow-Fernández, Patricia",Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,494,1

Bariatric surgery can provide durable weight loss, but little is known about the later development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery. AIM To determine whether bariatric surgery reduces the risk of HCC. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search of major databases (from inception to November 2020) to identify studies which assess the incidence and risk of HCC following bariatric surgery. Pooled data were assessed using a random-effects model expressed in terms of odds ratio (OR), incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Nine studies (two abstracts and seven full texts) were included for meta-analysis which involved 19 514 750 patients (18 423 546 controls and 1 091 204 bariatric patients). Pooled unadjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28-0.57) which favoured bariatric surgery, though with high heterogeneity (I2 : 79%). Using an adjusted model derived from matched cohorts (five studies) yielded an OR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 : 38%). The pooled rate/1000 person-years was 0.05 (95% CI: 0.02-0.07) in bariatric surgery patients and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20-0.49) in the control group with an incidence rate ratio of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.18-0.42).

We studied metabolomic profiles of heart and liver of R. amurensis exposed to 17 days of extreme hypoxia. Without oxygen, the studied tissues experience considerable stress with a drastic decrease of ATP, phosphocreatine, and NAD+ concentrations, and concomitant increase of AMP, creatine, and NADH. Heart and liver switch to different pathways of glycolysis with differential accumulation of lactate, alanine, succinate, as well as 2,3-butanediol (previously not reported for vertebrates as an end product of glycolysis) and depletion of aspartate. We also observed statistically significant changes in concentrations of certain osmolytes and choline-related compounds.

A decade of research on the ecology and evolution of WNV includes three findings that provide insight into the outcome of future pathogen introductions. First, WNV transmission in North America is highest in urbanized and agricultural habitats, in part because the hosts and vectors of WNV are abundant in human-modified areas. Second, after its introduction, the virus quickly adapted to infect local mosquito vectors more efficiently than the originally introduced strain. Third, highly focused feeding patterns of the mosquito vectors of WNV result in unexpected host species being important for transmission.

To date, GCRV's strategy for evading the fish IFN response is still unknown. Here, we report that GCRV VP41 inhibits fish IFN production by suppressing the phosphorylation of mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (MITA). First, the activation of the IFN promoter (IFNpro) stimulated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and MITA was decreased by the overexpression of VP41, whereas such activation induced by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was not affected. Second, VP41 was colocalized in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated with MITA. Furthermore, as a phosphorylation substrate of TBK1, VP41 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of MITA. Truncation assays indicated that the transmembrane (TM) region of VP41 was indispensable for the suppression of IFNpro activity. Finally, after infection with GCRV, VP41 blunted the transcription of host IFN and facilitated viral RNA synthesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that GCRV VP41 prevents the fish IFN response by attenuating the phosphorylation of MITA for viral evasion.IMPORTANCE MITA is thought to act as an adaptor protein to facilitate the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1 upon viral infection, and it plays a critical role in innate antiviral responses. Here, we report that GCRV VP41 colocalizes with MITA at the ER and reduces MITA phosphorylation by acting as a decoy substrate of TBK1, thus inhibiting IFN production. These findings reveal GCRV's strategy for evading the host IFN response for the first time.","Lu, Long-Feng; Li, Shun; Wang, Zhao-Xi; Du, Si-Qi; Chen, Dan-Dan; Nie, Pin; Zhang, Yong-An",Journal of virology,494,1

For this purpose, soil was spiked with Pb concentrations (0, 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 mg kg1) and amended with EDTA and DIPA at dosage levels (0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7.5, 10 mmol kg-1) for plantation of Pelargonium hortorum. Soil samples were extracted with MgCl2, plant samples were acid digested and analyzed for metal content. Biomass and root/shoot length of Pelargonium hortorum was decreased with increase in concentration of Pb and chelating agents. Phytoavailability of Pb at 1500 mg kg-1 with EDTA 10 mmol kg-1 was 0.3-folds in comparison to DIPA at the same dosage. Pelargonium hortorum plants amended with EDTA and DIPA at 10 mmol kg-1 with Pb 1000 mg kg-1 were found to uptake Pb 5.3-fold and 2.5-folds, respectively in comparison to Pb 1000 mg kg-1 alone.

Reinforcement technique was applied in random order to 3 segments of the staple-line on each specimen: continuous Lembert's sutures, continuous through-and-through sutures, and no reinforcement. Bursting pressure was determined by injection of methylene blue solution into lumen of resected stomach and recording pressure at which leakage occurs. Location of leak, intragastric pressure, and volume at first leak were recorded. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of patients were similar in randomized groups for order of reinforcement technique. Mean ischemia time of specimens was 17.4 ± 10.4 min. No leaks were observed in segments reinforced with Lembert's oversewing technique. The through-and-through reinforcement segments were first to leak in 21 out of 30 cases (70 %) with mean leak pressure of 570 mmHg and mean leak volume of 399 ml. Leakage occurred in 9 segments (30 %) with no reinforcement with a leak pressure of 329 mmHg and volume of 380 ml. CONCLUSIONS In vitro, Lembert's suture reinforcement technique on stapled human stomach is associated with less leakage rate in comparison to through-and-through reinforcement and non-reinforced staple-line.","Rogula, Tomasz; Khorgami, Zhamak; Bazan, Martin; Mamolea, Cristina; Acquafresca, Pablo; El-Shazly, Omar; Aminian, Ali; Schauer, Philip",Obesity surgery,494,7

This multi-center, prospective study evaluated the clinical experiences of 69 patients who received an alternative treatment: endoscopic anterior fundoplication with a video- and ultrasound-guided transoral surgical stapler. METHODS Patients with well-categorized GERD were enrolled at six international sites. Efficacy data was compared at baseline and at 6 months post-procedure. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50 % improvement in GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) score. Secondary endpoints were elimination or ≥ 50 % reduction in dose of PPI medication and reduction of total acid exposure on esophageal pH probe monitoring. A safety evaluation was performed at time 0 and weeks 1, 4, 12, and 6 months. RESULTS 66 patients completed follow-up. Six months after the procedure, the GERD-HRQL score improved by >50 % off PPI in 73 % (48/66) of patients (95 % CI 60-83 %). Forty-two patients (64.6 %) were no longer using daily PPI medication. Of the 23 patients who continued to take PPI following the procedure, 13 (56.5 %) reported a ≥ 50 % reduction in dose. The mean percent of total time with esophageal pH <4.0 decreased from baseline to 6 months (P < 0.001). Common adverse events were peri-operative chest discomfort and sore throat. Two severe adverse events requiring intervention occurred in the first 24 subjects, no further esophageal injury or leaks were reported in the remaining 48 enrolled subjects. CONCLUSIONS The initial 6-month data reported in this study demonstrate safety and efficacy of this endoscopic plication device. Early experience with the device necessitated procedure and device changes to improve safety, with improved results in the later portion of the study. Continued assessment of durability and safety are ongoing in a three-year follow-up study of this patient group.","Zacherl, Johannes; Roy-Shapira, Aviel; Bonavina, Luigi; Bapaye, Amol; Kiesslich, Ralf; Schoppmann, Sebastian F; Kessler, William R; Selzer, Don J; Broderick, Ryan C; Lehman, Glen A; Horgan, Santiago",Surgical endoscopy,494,17

Also, prognostic factors except for tumor staging have not been established. We aimed to identify prognostic and predictive markers for gastric cancer adjuvant therapy from large randomized controlled trials with standard lymph node dissection. METHODS Three studies: ACTS-GC, CLASSIC, and SAMIT were found and selected for a pooled analysis, following PRISMA guideline. The integrity of individual participant data (IPD) was verified in the eligible 3527 patients registered, and fixed-effect model was used. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS Age was a significant prognostic factor in addition to tumor stages both in ""surgery alone"" and ""adjuvant"" groups. Adjuvant therapy was effective for every TN stage; however, it tended to be more effective in T1-2 than in T3-4. Also, it was more effective in low- or middle-BMI than in high-BMI group with Hazard ratio [HR]s: 0.58, 0.58, and 1.05, respectively. Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) was more effective than S-1 for T1-2, N2-3, and differentiated type with HRs between 0.59 and 0.70, but with no difference among TNM stages. Combining histology to TN; the HRs in differentiated T1-2 N1-3 groups were between 0.29 and 0.45. For T3-4 N0-1 group, S-1 was likely to be effective, not significant. CONCLUSIONS Age is a significant prognostic factor both in surgery alone and adjuvant group.

A total of 99 cases of primary endometrial carcinoma were investigated for survivin expression by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the association between concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression, and clinicopathological parameters was examined. Immunopositivity for survivin was identified in 88% of cases. Concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression (staining scores and intensity) was observed in 60% of endometrial adenocarcinomas. A significant association was identified between the sum of staining intensity and scores of survivin immunopositive cells, and patient age (P=0.028), histological grade (P<0.001), clinical stage (P=0.018) and fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.039). A negative tendency for correlation was observed between surivin and PTEN immunostaining scores (P=0.062; ρ=-0.238). Specimens with high scores of survivin expression tended to show decreased scores of PTEN immunostaining, and vice versa. However, in circumstances with an increased co-expression of survivin and PTEN, a statistically significant association with histological types was observed (P=0.020). A statistically significant positive correlation was identified between survivin and p53 sum co-expression (P=0.008; ρ=0.300). Furthermore, a significant association was identified between survivin and p53 concomitant sum expression and age of patients (P=0.001), histological type (P=0.020), clinical stage (P=0.037), histological differentiation (P=0.001) and presence of fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.026). The present findings suggested that survivin may be an indicator of unfavorable outcome in older patients with endometrial carcinoma, in specific circumstances that are dependent on different concomitant genetic alterations and different combinations of molecular signaling pathways. Increased expression levels of survivin and PTEN may serve a role in the development of more aggressive endometrial carcinoma during their interaction. In addition, protein expression levels of survivin and p53 are positively correlated and may share a common molecular pathway to promote endometrial carcinogenesis. These findings provided evidence that survivin and p53 combined may be useful markers for the prediction of tumor behavior and prognosis.","Stavropoulos, Aggelis; Varras, Michail; Vasilakaki, Thivi; Varra, Viktoria-Konstantina; Varra, Fani-Niki; Tsavari, Aikaterini; Nonni, Aphrodite; Kavantzas, Nikolaos; Lazaris, Andreas C",Oncology letters,494,1

However, investigations of the extent to which these measures actually affect the progression of a pandemic have been limited. OBJECTIVE To examine correlations between the incidence of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza in Alberta, Canada, in 2009 and school closures or weather changes, and to estimate the effects of school closures and weather changes on pH1N1 transmission. DESIGN Mathematical transmission models were fit to data that compared the pattern of confirmed pH1N1 cases with the school calendar and weather patterns. SETTING Alberta, Canada, from 19 April 2009 to 2 January 2010. DATA SOURCES 2009 virologic test results, 2006 census data, 2009 daily temperature and humidity data, and 2009 school calendars. MEASUREMENTS Age-specific daily counts of positive results for pH1N1 from the complete database of 35 510 specimens submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health for virologic testing from 19 April 2009 to 2 January 2010. RESULTS The ending and restarting of school terms had a major effect in attenuating the first wave and starting the second wave of pandemic influenza cases. Mathematical models suggested that school closure reduced transmission among school-age children by more than 50% and that this was a key factor in interrupting transmission. The models also indicated that seasonal changes in weather had a significant effect on the temporal pattern of the epidemic. LIMITATIONS Data probably represent a small sample of all viral infections. The mathematical models make simplifying assumptions in order to make simulations and analysis feasible. CONCLUSION Analysis of data from unrestricted virologic testing during an influenza pandemic provides compelling evidence that closing schools can have dramatic effects on transmission of pandemic influenza. School closure seems to be an effective strategy for slowing the spread of pandemic influenza in countries with social contact networks similar to those in Canada.

Holograms of individual spheres are analyzed by fitting to a generative model based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering. Each fit yields an estimate of a probe bead's diameter and refractive index with sufficient precision to watch a population of beads grow as molecules bind. Rather than modeling the molecular-scale coating, however, these fits use effective medium theory, treating the coated sphere as if it were homogeneous. This effective-sphere analysis is rapid and numerically robust and so is useful for practical implementations of label-free immunoassays. Here, we assess how measured effective-sphere properties reflect the actual properties of molecular-scale coatings by modeling coated spheres with the discrete-dipole approximation and analyzing their holograms with the effective-sphere model.","Altman, Lauren E; Grier, David G",Biomedical optics express,494,1

This procedure, which entails the combined use of laparoscopy and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), would enable primary repair without cervical and thoracic incisions and prevent postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS Nonsurvival experiments were conducted in 9 pigs to study the technical feasibility. The procedure comprised the following: (1) creation of the disease model by laparoscopic resection of the lower esophagus; (2) laparoscopic fundoplication, complete mobilization of the stomach, and enlargement of the esophageal hiatus; (3) formation of a peroral transesophageal entry site into either the postmediastinum or the right thoracic cavity followed by fashioning a tunnel to the peritoneal cavity; (4) gastric pull-up by using both laparoscopy and NOTES; (5) esophagoesophageal anastomosis using BraceBar™, a prototype of the double T-bar suturing device (Olympus Medical Systems Co., Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS Laparoscopic procedures were performed without complications. The postmediastinal tunnel was successfully created three times with a complication of pleural injury. However, gastric pull-up via this route could not be completed due to porcine anatomical reasons. Gastric pull-up through the right thoracic route was achieved five times in six attempts. Two disorientations and a hemorrhagic death occurred during the procedures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that combined use of laparoscopy and NOTES enabled gastric pull-up without cervical and thoracic incisions. Our method has the potential of lowering the incidence of GERD and enabling primary repair of this disease.","Ishimaru, Tetsuya; Iwanaka, Tadashi; Kawashima, Hiroshi; Terawaki, Kan; Kodaka, Tetsuro; Suzuki, Kan; Takahashi, Masataka",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Due to the risk of cross-infections, the number of visits and injections was dramatically reduced in the last months, and the time between visits has been rescheduled from every 15 to 45 min, significantly impairing the total number of available visits. Although continuity of care has been allowed, a series of measures to diminish the risk of contamination need to be adopted until the end of this pandemic outbreak, which may persist until the development of an effective vaccine. For these reasons, we have introduced a new treatment regimen that is aimed at reducing the number of in-person visits and achieving continuity of treatment. This regimen is named ""Triple and Plan"" (TriPla). The main advantage of the TriPla regimen is to reduce the number of visits of patients in comparison to the pro re nata and treat and extend regimen. Using the TriPla regimen, the risk of contamination would be reduced. Furthermore, by reducing the number of scheduled visits, physicians could guarantee an adequate number of examinations for each patient, lengthening the interval between visits, and reducing the risk of cross-infections.","Sacconi, Riccardo; Borrelli, Enrico; Vella, Giovanna; Querques, Lea; Prascina, Francesco; Zucchiatti, Ilaria; Bandello, Francesco; Querques, Giuseppe",European journal of ophthalmology,494,17

DESIGN Prospective, observational. SETTING Cardiac operating room and cardiac ICU. PATIENTS Neonates and infants without history of kidney injury or anatomic renal abnormality. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Renal regional tissue oximetry was measured intraoperatively and for 48 hours postoperatively. Urinary levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 together with insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 were measured preoperatively, 2, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Patients were categorized as no acute kidney injury, stage 1, or Stage 2-3 acute kidney injury using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria with 43 of 70 (61%) meeting criteria for any stage acute kidney injury. Stage 2-3 acute kidney injury patients had higher tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 at 2 hours (0.3 vs 0.14 for stage 1 acute kidney injury and 0.05 for no acute kidney injury; p = 0.052) and 24 hours postoperatively (1.71 vs 0.27 for stage 1 acute kidney injury and 0.19 for no acute kidney injury, p = 0.027) and higher neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels at 24 hours postoperatively (10.3 vs 3.4 for stage 1 acute kidney injury and 6.2 for no acute kidney injury, p = 0.019). Stage 2-3 acute kidney injury patients had lower mean cardiac ICU renal regional tissue oximetry (66% vs 79% for stage 1 acute kidney injury and 84% for no acute kidney injury, p = 0.038). Regression analyses showed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 at 2 hours postoperatively and nadir intraoperative renal regional tissue oximetry to be independent predictors of postoperative kidney damage as measured by urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. CONCLUSIONS We observed modest differences in perioperative renal regional tissue oximetry and urinary biomarker levels compared between acute kidney injury groups classified by creatinine-dependent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria, but there were significant correlations between renal regional tissue oximetry, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, and postoperative neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels.

Ongoing monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation and control of adequate levels of oxygen, pressures, and volumes can decrease the incidence of such adverse outcomes. Use of pulse oximetry became a standard of care for titrating oxygen delivery, but continuous noninvasive monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) is not routinely used in NICUs. Continuous monitoring of CO2 level may be crucial because hypocarbia and hypercarbia in extremely preterm infants are associated with lung and brain morbidities, specifically bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and cystic periventricular leukomalacia. It is shown that continuous monitoring of CO2 levels helps in maintaining stable CO2 values within an accepted target range. Continuous monitoring of CO2 levels can be used in the delivery room, during transport, and in infants receiving invasive or noninvasive respiratory support in the NICU. It is logical to hypothesize that this will result in better outcome for extremely preterm infants.

This paper extends our previous work by examining the predictive utility of the SSBA to identify self-attributed addiction problems. Method Participants (N = 6,000) were recruited in Canada using quota sampling methods. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs) analyses were conducted, and thresholds established for each target behavior's subscale to predict self-attributed problems with these substances and behaviors. For each substance and behavior, regression models compared overall classification accuracy and model fit when lay epidemiologic indicators assessed using the SSBA were compared with validated screening measures to predict selfattributed problems. Results ROC analyses indicted moderate to high diagnostic accuracy (Area under the curves (AUCs) 0.73-0.94) across SSBA subscales. Thresholds for identifying self-attributed problems were 3 for six of the subscales (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, shopping, and gaming), and 2 for the remaining four behaviors (gambling, eating, sexual activity, and working). Compared to other instruments assessing addiction problems, models using the SSBA provided equivalent or better model fit, and overall had higher classification accuracy in the prediction of self-attributed problems. Discussion and conclusions The SSBA is a viable screening tool for problematic engagement across ten potentially addictive behaviors. Where longer screening tools are not appropriate, the SSBA may be used to identify individuals who would benefit from further assessment.","Schluter, Magdalen G; Hodgins, David C; KonkolŸ Thege, Barna; Wild, T Cameron",Journal of behavioral addictions,494,20

However, there is uncertainty whether long-latency TMS-evoked potentials reflect functioning of the targeted cortical area. It has been suggested that components such as the TMS-evoked N100 are stereotypical and related to nonspecific sensory processes rather than transcranial effects of the changing magnetic field. In contrast, TEPs that vary according to the targeted brain region and are systematically lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere can be considered to reflect activity in the stimulated brain region resulting from transcranial electromagnetic induction. Methods TMS with concurrent 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was sequentially performed in homologous areas of both hemispheres. One sample of healthy adults received TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; another sample received TMS to the temporo-occipital cortex. We analyzed late negative TEP deflections corresponding to the N100 component in motor cortex stimulation. Results TEP topography varied according to the stimulation target site. Long-latency negative TEP deflections were systematically lateralized (higher in ipsilateral compared to contralateral electrodes) in electrodes over the stimulated brain region. A calculation that removes evoked components that are not systematically lateralized relative to the stimulated hemisphere revealed negative maxima located around the respective target sites. Conclusion TEPs contain long-latency negative components that are lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere and have their topographic maxima at the respective stimulation sites. They can be differentiated from co-occurring components that are invariable across different stimulation sites (probably reflecting coactivation of peripheral sensory afferences) according to their spatiotemporal patterns. Lateralized long-latency TEP components located at the stimulation site likely reflect activity evoked in the targeted cortex region by direct transcranial effects and are therefore suitable for assessing cortical functions.","Jarczok, Tomasz A; Roebruck, Friederike; Pokorny, Lena; Biermann, Lea; Roessner, Veit; Klein, Christoph; Bender, Stephan",Frontiers in neuroscience,494,31

Recent studies have shown that imagery is linked to differences in perception in the healthy population, and clinical work has found a connection between imagery and hallucinatory experiences in neurological disorders. However, whether imagery ability is associated with anomalous perception-including hallucinations-in the general population remains unclear. In the current study, we explored the relationship between imagery ability and the anomalous perception of pseudo-hallucinations (PH) using rhythmic flicker stimulation (""Ganzflicker""). Specifically, we investigated whether the ability to generate voluntary imagery is associated with susceptibility to flicker-induced PH. We additionally explored individual differences in observed features of PH. We recruited a sample of people with aphantasia (aphants) and imagery (imagers) to view a constant red-and-black flicker for approximately 10 min. We found that imagers were more susceptible to PH, and saw more complex and vivid PH, compared to aphants. This study provides the first evidence that the ability to generate visual imagery increases the likelihood of experiencing complex and vivid anomalous percepts.","Königsmark, Varg T; Bergmann, Johanna; Reeder, Reshanne R",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,494,29

It has created an urgent need to develop antimicrobial agents with novel structures and mechanisms of action. With this aim, a series of novel 1,3,4-oxadiazoles bearing 3,4-dihydropyrimidine heterocyclic motifs 4a-l were designed and synthesized. One-pot Biginelli synthesis is pivotal due to the use of readily available chemicals, shorter reaction time, and ecofriendly synthesis with a good yield. The structures of the synthesized molecules were characterized and confirmed by infrared, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13 C NMR, and mass spectroscopic techniques. The title compounds were screened against Gram-positive and -negative strains of bacteria and fungi using the Mueller-Hinton broth method. Compound 4d was found to be the most promising against Escherichia coli (12.5 µg/ml), whereas the same compound showed good activity against Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 50 µg/ml. Other compounds of the same series, 4c and 4h, displayed moderate activity against Streptococcus pyogenes at a concentration of 50 µg/ml. Furthermore, results of the antifungal activity tests revealed that compound 4i showed promising activity against all the strains of fungi, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus clavatus, at concentrations of 100, 50, and 100 µg/ml, respectively. Molecular docking also showed that these compounds had a significant binding affinity (Glide docking score: -7.74 to -6.531) for DNA gyrase, engaging in a series of bonded and nonbonded interactions with residues lining the active site. The results of molecular docking study validated the experimental findings, thereby providing an initiation mark to optimize this motif using a structure-based drug design approach.","Desai, Nisheeth C; Vaghani, Hasit V; Jethawa, Aratiba M; Khedkar, Vijay M",Archiv der Pharmazie,494,1

METHODS Fifty-nine primary total ankle arthroplasties utilizing INBONE I or II implants were performed in fifty-nine patients (thirty-one men and twenty-eight women; mean age, 57.2 years) from 2008 to 2012. The AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) ankle-hindfoot score and VAS (visual analog scale) pain score were recorded preoperatively and at the time of the latest follow-up. Weight-bearing radiographs were used to determine ankle motion and assess component alignment and subsidence. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, reoperations, and failures were evaluated. RESULTS All fifty-nine patients were available for follow-up at least two years after surgery; the mean follow-up duration was 35.0 ± 11.9 months. The estimated survival rate at two years was 96.6% in the entire cohort (91.3% in the INBONE I group and 100% in the INBONE II group) when revision of the tibial and/or the talar component was used as the end point. The mean AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved from 44.1 to 87.3 at the time of the latest follow-up (p < 0.01), and the mean VAS pain score improved from 8.1 to 1.6 (p < 0.01). Mean total ankle motion improved from 29.0° to 38.0° (p < 0.01). Fourteen patients (24%) required a reoperation because of a postoperative complication. Five of these patients (four with INBONE I implants and one with INBONE II implants; 8% of the entire cohort) required revision surgery at a mean of 32.4 months (range, fifteen to fifty-eight months) because of symptomatic talar subsidence. Talar revisions utilized an INBONE II implant with a pegged talar sulcus for definitive management. The patients who underwent revision surgery had mean total ankle motion of 41.6°, neutral alignment, and no further reoperations at the time of the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Early results of INBONE intramedullary-fixation total ankle arthroplasty demonstrated improved patient-reported outcomes and increased ankle motion at a minimum follow-up of two years. Arthrofibrosis and talar subsidence were the main postoperative complications that required revision, and these predominantly affected the first-generation INBONE I implants.","Hsu, Andrew R; Haddad, Steven L",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Substantial literature suggests a relationship between emotion regulation and cardiac physiology; specifically, heart rate changes in response to positive or negative emotion-eliciting stimuli. METHOD This systematic review and meta-analysis provide an in-depth examination of research that has measured physiological responding during emotional-evoking tasks in children from birth to 4 years of age. RESULTS The review had three main findings. First, meta-regressions resulted in an age-related decrease in baseline and task-related heart rate (HR) and increases in baseline and task-related respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Second, meta-analyses suggest task-related increases in HR and decreases in RSA and heart rate variability (HRV), regardless of emotional valence of the task. Third, associations between physiological responding and observed behavioral regulation are not consistently present in children aged 4 and younger. The review also provides a summary of the various methodology used to measure physiological reactions to emotional-evoking tasks, including number of sensors used and placement, various baseline and emotional-evoking tasks used, methods for extracting RSA, as well as percentage of loss and reasons for loss for each study. CONCLUSION Characterizing the physiological reactivity of typically developing children is important to understanding the role emotional regulation plays in typical and atypical development.","Sacrey, Lori-Ann R; Raza, Sarah; Armstrong, Vickie; Brian, Jessica A; Kushki, Azadeh; Smith, Isabel M; Zwaigenbaum, Lonnie",Brain and behavior,494,9

Upon sensing double-stranded RNA, OAS produces 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A), which activate RNase L. Murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) nonstructural protein 2 (ns2) is a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2-5A, thereby antagonizing RNase L activation. PDE activity is required for robust replication in myeloid cells, as a mutant of MHV (ns2(H126R)) encoding an inactive PDE fails to antagonize RNase L activation and replicates poorly in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM), while ns2(H126R) replicates to high titer in several types of nonmyeloid cells, as well as in IFN receptor-deficient (Ifnar1(-/-)) BMM. We reported previously that myeloid cells express significantly higher basal levels of OAS transcripts than nonmyeloid cells. Here, we investigated the contributions of Oas gene expression, basal IFN signaling, and virus-induced IFN to RNase L activation. Infection with ns2(H126R) activated RNase L in Ifih1(-/-) BMM to a similar extent as in wild-type (WT) BMM, despite the lack of IFN induction in the absence of MDA5 expression. However, ns2(H126R) failed to induce RNase L activation in BMM treated with IFNAR1-blocking antibody, as well as in Ifnar1(-/-) BMM, both expressing low basal levels of Oas genes. Thus, activation of RNase L does not require virus-induced IFN but rather correlates with adequate levels of basal Oas gene expression, maintained by basal IFN signaling. Finally, overexpression of RNase L is not sufficient to compensate for inadequate basal OAS levels. IMPORTANCE The oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway is a potent antiviral activity. Activation of RNase L during murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) infection of myeloid cells correlates with high basal Oas gene expression and is independent of virus-induced interferon secretion. Thus, our data suggest that cells with high basal Oas gene expression levels can activate RNase L and thereby inhibit virus replication early in infection upon exposure to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) before the induction of interferon and prior to transcription of interferon-stimulated antiviral genes. These findings challenge the notion that activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway requires virus to induce type I IFN, which in turn upregulates OAS gene expression, as well as to provide dsRNA to activate OAS. Our data further suggest that myeloid cells may serve as sentinels to restrict viral replication, thus protecting other cell types from infection.","Birdwell, L Dillon; Zalinger, Zachary B; Li, Yize; Wright, Patrick W; Elliott, Ruth; Rose, Kristine M; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,494,16

Forty-one eligible studies were identified. RESULTS Findings suggest that the people with disabilities' choice to seek healthcare services or not, as well as the quality of intervention provided by primary healthcare providers, are influenced by three types of barriers: cultural beliefs or attitudinal barriers, informational barriers, and practical or logistical barriers. CONCLUSION In order to achieve full health coverage at acceptable quality for people with disabilities, it is necessary not only to consider the different barriers, but also their combined effect on people with disabilities and their households. It is only then that more nuanced and effective interventions to improve access to primary healthcare, systematically addressing barriers, can be designed and implemented. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION People with disabilities in both high income and low- and middle-income country settings are more likely to experience poorer general health than people without disabilities. Barriers to accessing primary healthcare services for people with disabilities result from a complex and dynamic interacting system between attitudinal and belief system barriers, informational barriers, and practical and logistical barriers. Given primary healthcare is often the initial point of contact for referral to specialty care and rehabilitation services, it is crucial for people with disabilities to access primary healthcare services in order to get appropriate referrals for such services, specifically rehabilitation as appropriate. To achieve full health coverage at acceptable quality for people with disabilities, starting with primary healthcare, it is necessary for healthcare stakeholders, including rehabilitation professionals, to consider the combined and cumulative effects of the various barriers to healthcare on people with disabilities and their families and develop an understanding of how healthcare decisions are made by people with disabilities at the personal and the household level.","Hashemi, Goli; Wickenden, Mary; Bright, Tess; Kuper, Hannah",Disability and rehabilitation,494,31

Yet, as new data resources and citizen/patient-led science movements offer sites of innovation, segments of the population with the lowest health status are least likely to engage in BD research either as intentional data contributors or as 'citizen/community scientists'. Progress is being made to include a more diverse spectrum of research participants in datasets and to encourage inclusive and collaborative engagement in research through community-based participatory research approaches, citizen/patient-led research pilots and incremental research policy changes. However, additional evidence-based policies are needed at the organisational, community and national levels to strengthen capacity-building and widespread adoption of these approaches to ensure that the translation of research is effectively used to improve health and health equity. The aims of this study are to capture uses of BD ('use cases') from the perspectives of community leaders and to identify needs and barriers for enabling community-led BD science. METHODS We conducted a qualitative content analysis of semi-structured key informant interviews with 16 community leaders. RESULTS Based on our analysis findings, we developed a BD Engagement Model illustrating the pathways and various forces for and against community engagement in BD research. CONCLUSIONS The goal of our Model is to promote concrete, transparent dialogue between communities and researchers about barriers and facilitators of authentic community-engaged BD research. Findings from this study will inform the subsequent phases of a multi-phased project with the ultimate aims of organising fundable frameworks and identifying policy options to support BD projects within community settings.","Grayson, Shira; Doerr, Megan; Yu, Joon-Ho",Health research policy and systems,494,1

Human clinical pain models are central tools, in the investigation of basic physiologic pain responses, and can be applied in patients as well as in healthy volunteers. Each clinical pain model investigates different aspects of the human pain response. Brief thermal sensitization induces a mild burn injury, resulting in development of primary hyperalgesia at the site of stimulation, and secondary hyperalgesia surrounding the site of stimulation. Central sensitization is believed to play an important role in the development of secondary hyperalgesia; however, a possible association of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization and other heat pain models remains unknown. Our aim with this study is to investigate how close the heat pain detection threshold is associated with the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia induced by the clinical heat pain model: Brief thermal sensitization. METHODS AND DESIGN We aim to include 120 healthy participants. The participants will be tested on two separate study days with the following procedures: i) Brief thermal sensitization, ii) heat pain detection threshold and iii) pain during thermal stimulation. Additionally, the participants will be tested with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires. We conducted statistical simulations based on data from our previous study, to estimate an empirical power of 99.9 % with α of 0.05. We define that an R(2) < 0.25 and predictive intervals larger than +/-150 cm(2) are indications of a weak association. DISCUSSION The area of secondary hyperalgesia may serve as a quantitative measure of the central sensitization induced by cutaneous heat stimulation, and thus may be a biomarker of an individual's pain sensitivity. The number of studies investigating secondary hyperalgesia is growing; however basic knowledge of the physiologic aspects of secondary hyperalgesia in humans is still incomplete. We therefore find it interesting to investigate if HPDT, a known quantitative sensory test, is associated with areas of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02527395 ).

We used a meta-epidemiological approach, comparing effect estimates between blinded and nonblinded randomized controlled trials for the same research question. DATA SOURCES Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials evaluating a therapeutic intervention on mortality in critical care, published between January 2009 and March 2019 in high impact factor general medical or critical care journals and by Cochrane. DATA EXTRACTION For each randomized controlled trial included in eligible meta-analyses, we evaluated whether the trial was blinded (i.e., double-blinded and/or reporting adequate methods) or not (i.e., open-label, single-blinded, or unclear). We collected risk of bias evaluated by the review authors and extracted trial results. DATA SYNTHESIS Within each meta-analysis, we compared intervention effect estimates between blinded and nonblinded randomized controlled trials by using a ratio of odds ratio (< 1 indicates larger estimates in nonblinded than blinded randomized controlled trials). We then combined ratio of odds ratios across meta-analyses to obtain the average relative difference between nonblinded and blinded trials. Among 467 randomized controlled trials included in 36 meta-analyses, 267 (57%) were considered blinded and 200 (43%) nonblinded. Intervention effect estimates were statistically significantly larger in nonblinded than blinded trials (combined ratio of odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99). We found no heterogeneity across meta-analyses (p = 0.72; I2 = 0%; τ2 = 0). Sensitivity analyses adjusting the main analysis on risk of bias items yielded consistent results. CONCLUSIONS Intervention effect estimates of mortality were slightly larger in nonblinded than blinded randomized controlled trials conducted in critical care, but confounding cannot be excluded. Blinding of both patients and personnel is important to consider when possible in critical care trials, even when evaluating mortality.","Martin, Guillaume L; Trioux, Theo; Gaudry, Stephane; Tubach, Florence; Hajage, David; Dechartres, Agnes",Critical care medicine,494,2

Vacuum-assisted wound closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) is a widely used approach for temporary abdominal closure to close the abdominal wall. However, this method is associated with a high incidence of re-operations in short term and late sequelae such as incisional hernia. The current study aims to compare the results of surgical strategies of OA with versus without permanent mesh augmentation. METHODS Patients with OA treatment undergoing vacuum-assisted wound closure and an intraperitoneal onlay mesh (VAC-IPOM) implantation were compared to VAWCM with direct fascial closure which represents the current standard of care. Outcomes of patients from two tertiary referral centers that performed the different strategies for abdominal closure after OA treatment were compared in univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 139 patients were included in the study. Of these, 50 (36.0%) patients underwent VAC-IPOM and 89 (64.0%) patients VAWCM. VAC-IPOM was associated with reduced re-operations (adjusted incidence risk ratio 0.48 per 10-person days; CI 95% = 0.39-0.58, p < 0.001), reduced duration of stay on intensive care unit (ICU) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.53; CI 95% = 0.36-0.79, p = 0.002] and reduced hospital stay (aHR 0.61; CI 95% = 0.040-0.94; p = 0.024). In-hospital mortality [22.5 vs 18.0%, risk difference - 4.5; confidence interval (CI) 95% = - 18.2 to 9.3; p = 0.665] and the incidence of intestinal fistula (18.0 vs 22.0%, risk difference 4.0; CI 95% = -10.0 to 18.0; p = 0.656) did not differ between the two groups. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, hernia-free survival was significantly increased after VAC-IPOM (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing OA treatment, intraperitoneal mesh augmentation is associated with a significantly decreased number of re-operations, duration of hospital and ICU stay and incidence of incisional hernias when compared to VAWCM.","Jakob, M O; Schwarz, C; Haltmeier, T; Zindel, J; Pinworasarn, T; Candinas, D; Starlinger, P; Beldi, G",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,494,1

We investigated whether women with dysmenorrhoea, compared with controls, have increased sensitivity to experimentally induced deep-tissue muscle ischaemia in a body area distant from that of referred menstrual pain. METHODS The sub-maximal effort tourniquet test was used to induce forearm ischaemia in 11 women with severe dysmenorrhoea and in nine control women both during menstruation and in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Von Frey hair assessments confirmed the presence of experimental ischaemia. Women rated the intensity of menstrual and ischaemic pain on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. RESULTS Women with dysmenorrhoea [mean (SD): 68 (20) mm] reported significantly greater menstrual pain compared with controls [mean (SD): 2 (6) mm; p = 0.0001] during the menstruation phase. They also rated their forearm ischaemic pain as significantly greater than the controls during the menstruation [dysmenorrhoeics vs. controls mean (SD): 58 (19) mm vs. 31 (21) mm, p < 0.01] and follicular [dysmenorrhoeics vs. controls mean (SD): 60 (18) mm vs. 40 (14) mm, p < 0.01] phases of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS These data show that compared with controls, women who experience severe recurrent dysmenorrhoea have deep-tissue hyperalgesia to ischaemic pain in muscles outside of the referred area of menstrual pain both during the painful menstruation phase and pain-free follicular phase. These findings suggest the presence of long-lasting changes in muscle pain sensitivity in women with dysmenorrhoea. Our findings that dysmenorrhoeic women are hyperalgesic to a clinically relevant, deep-muscle ischaemic pain in areas outside of referred menstrual pain confirm other studies showing long-lasting changes in pain sensitivity outside of the painful period during menstruation.","Iacovides, S; Avidon, I; Baker, F C",European journal of pain,494,8

However, reported postoperative outcomes vary, with notable differences between Western and Asian series. We aimed to determine morbidity and mortality rates after major hepatectomy in patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and assess differences in outcome regarding geographic location and hospital volume. METHODS A systematic review was performed by searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through November 20, 2017. Risk of bias was assessed and meta-analysis and metaregression were performed using a random effects model. RESULTS A total of 51 studies were included, representing 4,634 patients. Pooled 30-day and 90-day mortality were 5% (95% CI 3%-6%) and 9% (95% CI 6%-12%), respectively. Pooled overall morbidity and severe morbidity were 57% (95% CI 50%-64%) and 40% (95% CI 34%-47%), respectively. Western studies compared with Asian studies had a significantly higher 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and overall morbidity: 8% versus 2% (P < .001), 12% versus 3% (P < .001), and 63% versus 54% (P = .048), respectively. This effect on mortality remained significant after correcting for hospital volume. Univariate metaregression analysis showed no influence of hospital volume on mortality or morbidity, but when corrected for geographic location, higher hospital volume was associated with higher severe morbidity (P = .039). CONCLUSION Morbidity and mortality rates after major hepatectomy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma are high. The Western series showed a higher mortality compared with the Asian series, even when corrected for hospital volume. Standardized reporting of outcomes is necessary. Underlying causes for differences in outcomes between Asian and Western centers, such as differences in treatment strategies, should be further analyzed.","Franken, Lotte C; Schreuder, Anne Marthe; Roos, Eva; van Dieren, Susan; Busch, Olivier R; Besselink, Marc G; van Gulik, Thomas M",Surgery,494,1

Similarly, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on day 3 (4.3 [95% CI, 3.1-5.5]; p = 0.029) and day 7 (5.9 [95% CI, 4.8-6.9], n = 19 and 6.2 [95% CI, 4.7-7.8], n = 17, respectively) significantly improved in the sirolimus group. The liberation from a mechanical ventilator at 3 months was also better in the sirolimus combined with corticosteroids treatment. Similarly, the duration of ventilator use was significantly shorter in the sirolimus group (median, 7 vs 15 d; p = 0.03 by log-rank test). In the sirolimus combined with corticosteroids treatment group, a rapid clearance of virus also occurred after 7 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS In patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia, early adjuvant treatment with corticosteroids and an mTOR inhibitor was associated with improvement in outcomes, such as hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, virus clearance, and shortened liberation of ventilator and ventilator days.","Wang, Chun-Hua; Chung, Fu-Tsai; Lin, Shu-Min; Huang, Shu-Yi; Chou, Chun-Liang; Lee, Kang-Yun; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Kuo, Han-Pin",Critical care medicine,494,1

Long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals are vital in the care of CCI patients, but their role for patients post COVID-19 infection is not known. Barlow Respiratory Hospital (BRH) is a 105-bed, LTAC hospital network serving ventilator-dependent and medically-complex patients transferred from the ICUs of hospitals in southern California. We report patient characteristics of our first series of COVID-19 survivors admitted to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Methods: Single-center observational descriptive report of patients recovering from acute infectious complications of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring long-term respiratory support. Results: From 28 April to 7 September 2020, 41 patients were admitted to BRH for continued recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. The length of stay at the transferring hospital was twice that of non-COVID patients admitted during the same time period. Median age: 68 [44-94] years, 61% male, 80.5% with tracheostomy, 51.2% on invasive mechanical ventilation, 22% receiving hemodialysis. All mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis interventions were initiated at the transferring hospital. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize CCI and medically complex COVID-19 patients transferred to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Patients on average spent over six weeks in the transferring hospital mostly in the ICU, are largely elderly, carry the known risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and experienced respiratory failure necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Our findings suggest that these patients will continue to require considerable medical interventions and treatments, including weaning from mechanical ventilation, owing to the numerous sequelae of the infection and the burden of acute-on-chronic diseases. As ICU survival rates improve, this research further emphasizes the important role of the LTAC hospital in responding to the COVID-19 crisis.","Hassenpflug, Meg Stearn; Jun, Dale; Nelson, David R; Dolinay, Tamas",F1000Research,494,1

METHOD AND MATERIALS 49 ablations were performed on 15 pigs under general anesthesia using 15G monopolar CO2-cooled RF applicators, 17G monopolar water-cooled RF applicators and 15G internally CO2-cooled microwave devices. The power of the MW device was 45W, the current of the gas-cooled RF device was 1200-1600mA. At the water-cooled RF probe, maximum power of 200W was set. Ablation time was 15min. The short and long axes of the ablation zone were measured. Histological analyses and NADH-staining were performed. The diameters and the ablation volumes were compared using an analysis of variance. RESULTS No spots of untreated tissue were observed close to the cooled needle track in any of the ablation zones. The largest short axis diameter was 3.4±0.5cm achieved with the gas-cooled monopolar applicator. With the water-cooled applicators, short axis diameter was significantly smaller, reaching 2.5±0.4cm. Gas-cooled MW probes achieved 2.9±1.0cm. The largest ablation volume was 31.5±12ml (gas-cooled RF), and the smallest was 12.7±4ml (water-cooled RF). Short/long axis ratio was largest for gas-cooled RF probes with 0.73±0.08 versus 0.64±0.04 for the water-cooled probes and 0.49±0.25 for the microwave applicator. CONCLUSION Gas-cooled RF applicators may have a higher potential for effective destruction of liver lesions than comparable water-cooled RF systems, and may be an alternative to standard RF and MW ablation devices.","Rempp, Hansjörg; Voigtländer, Matthias; Schenk, Martin; Enderle, Markus D; Scharpf, Marcus; Greiner, Tim O; Neugebauer, Alexander; Hoffmann, Rüdiger; Claussen, Claus D; Clasen, Stephan",European journal of radiology,494,16

Moreover, hospital admissions are an important contributor to health care costs and overpopulation in various hospitals. The aim of this research is to obtain a deeper insight into the phenomenon of frequent flyer hospital admissions. Our objectives were to understand the patients' perspectives on the cause of their frequent hospital admissions and to identify the perceived consequences of the frequent flyer status. METHODS This qualitative study took place at the University Hospital of Leuven. The COREQ guidelines were followed to provide rigor to the study. Patients were included when they had at least four overnight admissions in the past 12 months, an age above 65 years and hospital admission at the time of the study. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and encoded in NVivo. RESULTS Thirteen interviews were collected. A total of 17 perceived causes for frequent hospital admission were identified, which could be divided into the following six themes: patient, drugs, primary care, secondary care, home and family. Most of the causes were preventable or modifiable. The perceived consequences of being a frequent flyer were divided into the following six themes: body, daily life functioning, social participation, mental status and spiritual dimension. Negative experiences were linked to frequent flying and could be situated mainly in the categories of social participation, mental status and spiritual dimensions. CONCLUSIONS Frequent hospital admissions may be conceived as an indicator, i.e., a 'red flag', of patients' situations characterized by physical, mental, spiritual and social deprivation in their home situation.","Huang, Miaolin; van der Borght, Carolien; Leithaus, Merel; Flamaing, Johan; Goderis, Geert",BMC geriatrics,494,1

This review surveys the results of lung transcriptome profiling studies in murine models that directly compare susceptible versus resistant hosts challenged with identical influenza infections. The potential contributions and limitations of these studies are discussed. To amplify their power, the studies are subjected to a meta-analysis, which helps identify frequently dysregulated pathways and potentially novel areas for investigation. Using connectivity map-based tools (LINCS), transcriptome signatures linked to susceptibility can identify candidate drugs that merit testing for in vivo efficacy.","Kobzik, Lester",Journal of innate immunity,494,1

METHODS A stratified cluster sample of 3702 children in total was randomly selected and examined clinically for caries (ICDAS II criteria). Caries experience was outlined by adapting ICDAS0-6 criteria to the d/D component of the WHO dmf/DMF index configuration. Percentages (%) of caries experience-free children, of children with initial caries (ICDAS1-2), and the mean d1-2t/D1-2T, d3-6mft/D3-6MFT and d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices were calculated. The probability of presenting with d1-2t/D1-2T ≥ 1 was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis, whereas negative binomial regression models examined the effect of socio-demographic parameters on d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices (level of significance: p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS 60.1%, 48.1%, and 34.7% of the 5, 12, and 15-year-old children, respectively, had no caries experience at the defect level (d3-6mft/D3-6MFT = 0). Initial lesions (ICDAS1-2) were detected in 17.7%, 19.3% and 17.4% of the 5, 12 and 15-year-olds, accordingly. Mean d1-2t/D1-2T was 0.93, 1.70, and 2.51, whereas mean d3-6mft/D3-6MFT was 1.48, 1.61, and 2.46 for the 5, 12, and 15-year-olds, respectively. Children with higher educated parents and 15-year-old urban residents exhibited significantly less caries experience at the defect level. Initial caries lesions presented a significantly higher probability of being detected in urban-residing 5- and 15-year-olds, while no consistent trend could be identified for parental education level. Caries prevalence and experience levels declined for all age groups in ten years.

SHM is essential in generating high affinity antibodies. Here we show that when coexpressed with GANP (germinal center-associated nuclear protein) in COS-7 cells, AID is transported from the cytoplasm and concentrated in the nucleus. GANP forms a complex with AID in cotransfected cells in vivo and in vitro. We have isolated AID mutants that bind with reduced affinity to GANP compared with wild type AID. One of these mutants, AID (D143A) binds GANP with a 10-fold lower affinity compared with wild type AID yet retains substantial C-deamination activity in vitro. Mutant AID (D143A) remains localized predominantly in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with GANP. Exogenous expression of GANP in Ramos B-cells promotes binding of AID to IgV DNA and mRNA and increases SHM frequency. These data suggest that GANP may serve as an essential link required to transport AID to B-cell nuclei and to target AID to actively transcribed IgV regions.","Maeda, Kazuhiko; Singh, Shailendra Kumar; Eda, Kazufumi; Kitabatake, Masahiro; Pham, Phuong; Goodman, Myron F; Sakaguchi, Nobuo",The Journal of biological chemistry,494,16

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this analysis was to compare the HESI scores based on a traditional pedagogy with the HESI scores following implementation of virtual pedagogy during Spring 2020. METHODS Student (n = 115; 81% female; mean age = 25.71 years) HESI scores were compared after each eight-week session using the Mann Whitney U test, permutation test and Wilcoxon rank test. Logistic regression was used to identify students achieving at least 850. Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between pedagogy and students meeting 850 HESI scores. Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were also compared with Spring 2020 Exit HESI scores. RESULTS Students from diverse backgrounds (53.9% White; 27.8% Hispanic; 10.4% Asian; 5.2% Black; 1% Unknown) increased (p = 0.022) MHESI scores following virtual pedagogy in Fundamentals, although no difference was found in Maternity (p = 0.311), Psychiatric (p = 0.129) or Medical Surgical Nursing (p = 0.692). Wilcoxon rank test revealed significant differences in MHESI scores in same cohort of students between traditional (Psychiatric) and virtual strategies (Medical-Surgical) (p < 0.01); and traditional (Medical-Surgical) and virtual (Psychiatric) strategies (p = 0.023). White students' MHESI scores were higher than Asian students', as revealed by Logistic regression with no differences based on gender. Spring 2020 and Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were comparable (p = 0.499). Chi-square analysis revealed no relationship between pedagogy and achieving at least 850 on HESI (χ2 = 0.027, p = 0.871). CONCLUSIONS Based on the exit HESI scores, virtual pedagogy was as effective as traditional pedagogy for maintaining student competency in a community college associate degree nursing program. Future analyses of the effectiveness of virtual pedagogy in meeting curricular outcomes is warranted, regardless of exit degree option.","Moxley, Elizabeth; Saravanan, Anitha; Habtezgi, Desale; Dixon, Larinda; Miller, Janice; Waller, Maureen",Nurse education today,494,1

Surgeons rely on preoperative imaging to guide their resection; however, large tissue deformations occur during trans-oral procedures due to placement of necessary retractors and laryngoscopes which hinders the surgeon's ability to accurately assess tumor extent and location of critical structures. We propose an image-guided framework utilizing intraoperative imaging and deformation modeling to improve surgeon accuracy and confidence. A CT-compatible laryngoscopy system previously developed was evaluated in this framework. Intraoperative images were acquired during laryngoscopy; force-sensing capabilities were enabled in the laryngoscope; and tracking of the scope and anatomic features was trialed. Tissue deformation and displacement were quantified and determined to be extensive, with values <; 4.6 cm in the tongue, <; 1.8 cm in bony structures, and <; 108.9 cm3 in airway volume change.

A variety of techniques have been described to treat URFs, and the laparoscopic approach has been approved as an efficient tool for even some complex fistulas. We aimed to report our laparoscopic experience for complex URF repair with special emphasis on salvage prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included four men (59-75 years), with laparoscopic repair for complex URFs. URF developed after transurethral resection of the prostate in patients 2 and 3 and after radical prostatectomy in patient 4. Patient 1 had received combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the rectal carcinoma; a prostatic abscess developed that resulted at the end in URF. Laparoscopic salvage prostatectomy was performed for patients 1 and 2. A transvesical laparoscopic approach was performed for patient 3, and a transperitoneal transvesical technique was performed for patient 4. A tunica vaginalis flap was used for patient 1, and peritoneal interposition flaps were developed in patients 2 and 4 mL, and no patients needed intraoperative blood transfusion. Postoperative hospital stay was 12 to 34 days. The urethral catheter was removed on postoperative day 11 to 32, and cystography showed no leakage of contrast except in patient 1.

However, there is a gap in data regarding the impacts of digestion protocols on fibers integrity. This work focuses on the impact of five commonly used digestion protocols on the seven most produced fibers in traditional textile: three synthetics (polyamide 6.6 (PA 6.6), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyacrylonitrile (acrylic)), one artificial (viscose), two vegetal natural (cotton and flax) and one animal natural (wool). The protocols to be tested were selected based on the literature: 10% KOH at 40 °C for 24 h; 10% KOH at 60 °C for 24 h; diluted NaClO at room temperature (~20 °C) for 15 h; 30% H2O2 at 40 °C for 48 h; Fenton's reagent with 30% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature (~20 °C). The fibers were characterized before and after digestion. The effects of those protocols on fibers integrity have been assessed using several of their performance parameters. High degradations were observed for PET with 10% KOH 60 °C whereas almost no impact was observed at 40 °C. H2O2 digestion affects mechanical properties of different fibers, particularly PA 6.6. Both protocols should be avoided for synthetic fibers analyses. NaClO digestion mainly affected flax and viscose. Diluted NaClO at room temperature for 15 h, 10% KOH at 40 °C for 24 h and Fenton's reagent are more appropriate to maintain fibers integrity.","Treilles, Robin; Cayla, Aurélie; Gaspéri, Johnny; Strich, Bénédicte; Ausset, Patrick; Tassin, Bruno",The Science of the total environment,494,16

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, encased in a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane and consists of four structural proteins (S, M, E and N), plus a haemagglutinin-sterase. The binding of the S protein to the ECA2 receptor allows the entry of the virus into the host cell and is a potential therapeutic target. 81% of patients develop mild symptoms, 14% have severe symptoms and 5% require intensive care management. Fever is the most frequent symptom, followed by cough and dyspnea. Most patients do not present leukocytosis, but they do present lymphopenia with sputum cultures that do not show other pathogens. In lung biopsies of severe patients, the most noticeable finding is diffuse alveolar damage. Radiologically, ground glass and alveolar patterns are observed; the lesions being predominantly basal, subpleural, and posterior, with a multifocal peripheral distribution, more affecting the right lower lobe.

Nevertheless, it is preventable through vaccination. Concerning the paediatric population, the recommendation of influenza vaccination is under-represented in many European countries. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal childhood vaccination against influenza in Europe. AREAS COVERED : We conducted a systematic review of original article assessing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination by searching PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases for studies in English, starting from January 1st, 2010 up to October 21st, 2020. EXPERT OPINION Our literature review showed that all studies identified highlight that paediatric vaccinations using a live vaccine, especially in the quadrivalent formulation, are cost-effective compared to current vaccinations (elderly and at-risk groups) with TIV or no vaccination. A significant contribution to this positive economic profile is due to the indirect protection. Already many clinical data report the relevant direct and indirect impact of vaccination against influenza for younger subjects. The recent studies collected in this review showed also that the paediatric vaccination is also cost-effective. Therefore, decision-makers should now consider this new favourable evidence.","Boccalini, Sara; Bechini, Angela; Moscadelli, Andrea; Paoli, Sonia; Schirripa, Annamaria; Bonanni, Paolo",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,494,11

Patients with both COVID-19 and heart failure share similar risk factors, which result in magnification of pathological outcomes. These include a common inflammatory pathology and related coagulopathy. Both illnesses pose a risk of arrhythmia. Polypharmacy further complicates safe drug administration and worsens the risk of medication-induced arrhythmia. Additionally, both conditions present challenges regarding attaining and maintaining an appropriate nutritional state. Exploration of the interplay between these factors demonstrates the gravity of the co-existence of these conditions and helps understand the difficulties faced when caring for this patient group.

This review aimed to identify and synthesise factors (barriers and facilitators) that influence the sustainment of interventions (policies, practices, or programmes) in schools and childcare services that address the leading risk factors of chronic disease. METHODS Seven electronic databases and relevant reference lists were searched for articles, of any design, published in English, from inception to March 2020. Articles were included if they qualitatively and/or quantitatively reported on school or childcare stakeholders' (including teachers, principals, administrators, or managers) perceived barriers or facilitators to the sustainment of interventions addressing poor diet/nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco smoking, or harmful alcohol use. Two independent reviewers screened texts, and extracted and coded data guided by the Integrated Sustainability Framework, an existing multi-level sustainability-specific framework that assesses factors of sustainment. RESULTS Of the 13,158 articles identified, 31 articles met the inclusion criteria (8 quantitative, 12 qualitative, 10 mixed-methods, and 1 summary article). Overall, 29 articles were undertaken in schools (elementary n=17, middle n=3, secondary n=4, or a combination n=5) and two in childcare settings. The main health behaviours targeted included physical activity (n=9), diet (n=3), both diet and physical activity (n=15), and smoking (n=4), either independently (n=1) or combined with other health behaviours (n=3). Findings suggest that the majority of the 59 barriers and 74 facilitators identified to impact on intervention sustainment were similar across school and childcare settings. Factors predominantly relating to the 'inner contextual factors' of the organisation including: availability of facilities or equipment, continued executive or leadership support present, and team cohesion, support, or teamwork were perceived by stakeholders as influential to intervention sustainment. CONCLUSIONS Identifying strategies to improve the sustainment of health behaviour interventions in these settings requires a comprehensive understanding of factors that may impede or promote their ongoing delivery. This review identified multi-level factors that can be addressed by strategies to improve the sustainment of such interventions, and suggests how future research might address gaps in the evidence base.

To investigate the results of LU in severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed a single-institution study to evaluate the related lung lesions and variations, and prophylactic strategies, in a large referral and treatment center. METHODS We included 91 adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19, namely 62 males and 29 females, with an average age of 59 ± 11 years, who underwent LU. We collected the following patient information: sex, age, days in hospital, and days in ICU. In the ultrasound examinations, we recorded the presence of discrete B lines, confluent B lines, consolidation, pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax (PTX). RESULTS Among the 91 severe and critical patients, 59 cases had scattered B lines, 56 cases had confluent B lines, 58 cases had alveolar-interstitial syndrome (AIS), 48 cases had lung consolidation, six cases had pleural thickening, 39 cases had pleural effusion (average depth of the pleural effusion: 1.0 ± 1.5 cm), and 20 patients developed PTX. In the Cox multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in age, hospitalization days, ICU days, and lung consolidation. CONCLUSION Lung ultrasonography performed at the bedside can detect lung diseases, such as B lines, PTX, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, pleural effusion, and variations of these findings. Our findings support the use of LU and measurements for estimating factors, and monitoring response to therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.","Li, Shuo; Qu, Ya-Li; Tu, Mu-Qin; Guo, Li-Yan; Zhang, Qi-Li; Lv, Chao-Yang; Guo, Rui-Jun",Echocardiography,494,16

METHODS In total, 7,706 pancreatoduodenectomies performed at 18 international institutions composing the Pancreas Fistula Study Group were examined (2003-2020). High estimated blood loss (>700 mL) was defined as twice the median. Propensity score matching (1:1 exact-match) was employed to adjust for variables associated with high estimated blood loss and clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurrence. The study was powered to detect a 33% clinically relevant pancreatic fistula increase in the high estimated blood loss group, with α = 0.05 and β = 0.2. RESULTS The propensity score model included 966 patients with high estimated blood loss and 966 patients with lower estimated blood loss; all covariate imbalantces were solved. Patients with high estimated blood loss patients experienced higher clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rates (19.4 vs 12.6%, odds ratio 1.66; P < .001), as well as higher severe complication rates (27.8 vs 15.6%), transfusions (50.1 vs 14.3%), reoperations (9.2 vs 4.0%), intensive care unit transfers (9.9 vs 4.8%) and 90-day mortality (4.7 vs 2.0%, all P < .001). High estimated blood loss was an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.37-2.32), as were prophylactic Octreotide administration (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.61) and soft pancreatic texture (odds ratio 5.32, 95% confidence interval 3.74-5.57; all P < .001). Moreover, a second model including 1,126 pancreatoduodenectomies was derived including vascular resections as additional confounder (14.0% vascular resections performed in each group). On multivariable regression, high estimated blood loss was confirmed an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.32-2.44; P < .001), whereas vascular resection was not (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.88; P = .156). CONCLUSION This study better establishes the relationship between estimated blood loss and outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. Despite inherent contributions to blood loss, its minimization is an actionable opportunity for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction and performance optimization in pancreatoduodenectomy. Accordingly, practical insights are offered to achieve this goal.","Casciani, Fabio; Trudeau, Maxwell T; Asbun, Horacio J; Ball, Chad G; Bassi, Claudio; Behrman, Stephen W; Berger, Adam C; Bloomston, Mark P; Callery, Mark P; Christein, John D; Falconi, Massimo; Fernandez-Del Castillo, Carlos; Dillhoff, Mary E; Dickson, Euan J; Dixon, Elijah; Fisher, William E; House, Michael G; Hughes, Steven J; Kent, Tara S; Kunstman, John W; Malleo, Giuseppe; Partelli, Stefano; Wolfgang, Christopher L; Zureikat, Amer H; Vollmer, Charles M",Surgery,494,19

Consequently, older adults experience increased risk of infectious diseases, particularly pneumonia, and its leading bacterial cause, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococcal vaccine recommendations are often limited to adults with specific medical conditions despite similar disease risks among older adults due to immunosenescence. AREAS COVERED This article reviews epidemiologic, biologic, and clinical evidence supporting the consideration of older age due to immunosenescence as an immunocompromising condition for the purpose of pneumococcal vaccine policy and the role vaccination can play in healthy aging. EXPERT OPINION Epidemiologic and biologic evidence suggest that pneumococcal disease risk increases with age and is comparable for healthy older adults and younger adults with immunocompromising conditions. Because immunocompromising conditions are already indicated for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), a comprehensive public health strategy would also recognize immunosenescence. Moreover, older persons should be vaccinated before reaching the highest risk ages, consistent with the approach for other immunocompromising conditions. To facilitate PCV use among older adults, vaccine technical committees (VTCs) could classify older age as an immunocompromising condition based on the process of immunosenescence. With global aging, VTCs will need to consider immunosenescence and vaccine use during healthy aging.","Grant, Lindsay R; Slack, Mary P E; Yan, Qi; Trzciński, Krzysztof; Barratt, Jane; Sobczyk, Elizabeth; Appleby, James; Cané, Alejandro; Jodar, Luis; Isturiz, Raul E; Gessner, Bradford D",Expert review of vaccines,494,1

Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions) and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n = 1,232,986/n = 12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n = 1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n = 165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n = 345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n = 722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n = 323,789/n = 1232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n = 20,652), 32.8% (n = 106,186), and 60.8% (n = 196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n = 2496/n = 3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions. More study is needed to better understand how best to maximize ICU capacity for pandemics requiring heavy use of critical care resources.","Poeran, Jashvant; Zhong, Haoyan; Wilson, Lauren; Liu, Jiabin; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Anesthesia and analgesia,494,16

In this study, a novel enterovirus (enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic sample from a neonatal pig diarrhea case and identified by using metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypic EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Remarkably, a 582-nucleotide insertion, flanked by 3Cpro cleavage sites at the 5' and 3' ends, was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insertion encodes a predicted protease with 54 to 68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and a catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to those of core catalytic domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removing) enzymes on host cell substrates. Importantly, the recombinant ToV-PLP protein derived from this novel enterovirus also showed strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to suppress IFN-β expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to the wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; enterovirus G may therefore gain fitness through the acquisition of ToV-PLP from a recombination event.IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses comprise a highly diversified group of viruses. Genetic recombination has been considered a driving force for viral evolution; however, recombination between viruses from two different orders is a rare event. In this study, we identified a special case of cross-order recombination between enterovirus G (order Picornavirales) and torovirus (order Nidovirales). This naturally occurring recombination event may have broad implications for other picornaviral and/or nidoviral species. Importantly, we demonstrated that the exogenous ToV-PLP gene that was inserted into the EVG genome encodes a deubiquitinase/deISGylase and potentially suppresses host cellular innate immune responses. Our results provide insights into how a gain of function through genetic recombination, in particular cross-order recombination, may improve the ability of a virus to evade host immunity.","Shang, Pengcheng; Misra, Saurav; Hause, Ben; Fang, Ying",Journal of virology,494,6

Children (n=105) from two Argentinian cities (Salta in the northwest and 9 de Julio in the Pampean region), reported the fruits and vegetables they consumed, with the Free Listing and the new Free Drawing methods. Contingency tables were built and cognitive saliency indexes (CSI) were calculated. Children evoked 57 fruits and 54 vegetables by both methods, which were then grouped into 31 fruit and 27 vegetable categories. The advantages and limitations of the methods are discussed. Throughout Free Drawing, each food was defined by its name, shape and colour, which allowed better discrimination between varieties. Children from Salta reported consuming more fruits (63.7%) and vegetables (68.6%) than those from 9 de Julio (p<0.05). Differences between cultural groups were found in 10 fruits and 7 vegetables, mentioned more frequently in Salta, where regional crops arose principally by Free Listing. The CSI did not depend on the method used but, for vegetables, they were affected by the cultural group. The fruits with the greatest CSI were banana and apples followed by orange (CSI≥0.19).

Using the developed system, human chondrocytes could be seeded throughout large 50 mm diameter scaffolds with a uniform distribution. Following two weeks culture, tissues grown in the bioreactor were viable and homogeneously cartilaginous, with biomechanical properties approaching those of native cartilage. In contrast, tissues generated by conventional manual production procedures were highly inhomogeneous and contained large necrotic regions. The unprecedented engineering of human cartilage tissues in this large-scale opens the practical perspective of grafting functional biological substitutes for the clinical treatment for extensive cartilage defects, possibly in combination with surgical or pharmacological therapies to support durability of the implant. Ongoing efforts are aimed at integrating the up-scaled bioreactor based processes within a fully automated and closed manufacturing system for safe, standardized, and GMP compliant production of large-scale cartilage grafts.","Santoro, Rosaria; Olivares, Andy L; Brans, Gerben; Wirz, Dieter; Longinotti, Cristina; Lacroix, Damien; Martin, Ivan; Wendt, David",Biomaterials,494,7

International guidelines recommend that alcohol-based combinations be used, however, the optimal combination remains uncertain. This study compares the effectiveness of alcohol-based chlorhexidine and alcohol-based iodophor for surgical site skin preparation for prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs). (2) Methods: Randomised controlled trials comparing alcohol-based interventions for surgical site skin preparation were included. The proportion of SSIs was compared using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The meta-analysis was performed with a fixed effect model using Mantel-Haenszel methods. As an a priori subgroup analysis SSI risk was examined according to different surgical procedural groups. (3) Results: Thirteen studies were included (n = 6023 participants). The use of chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with a reduction in risk of SSIs compared with iodophor-alcohol (RR 0.790; 95% CI 0.669, 0.932). On sub-group analysis, chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with a reduction in SSIs in caesarean surgery (RR 0.614; 95% CI 0.453, 0.831) however, chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with an increased risk of SSI in bone and joint surgery (RR 2.667; 95% CI 1.051, 6.765). When excluding studies at high risk of bias on sensitivity analysis, this difference in alcohol-based combinations for bone and joint surgery was no longer observed (RR 2.636; 95% CI 0.995, 6.983). (4) Conclusions: The use of chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparations was associated with a reduced risk of SSI compared to iodophor-alcohol agents. However, the efficacy of alcohol-based preparation agents may differ according to the surgical procedure group. This difference must be interpreted with caution given the low number of studies and potential for bias, however, it warrants further investigation into the potential biological and clinical validity of these findings.","Peel, Trisha N; Watson, Eliza; Lee, Sue J",Journal of clinical medicine,494,1

A contact investigation revealed multiple exposures for each person. We investigated whether the intensity of exposure might contribute to this extraordinary risk of disease.We carried out a case-control study using a public health database. Among those with a new infection, 34 had culture-confirmed TB (cases) and 118 did not progress to disease (controls). 17 patients with probable disease were excluded. Contact investigation data were utilised to tabulate the number of potential sources (total exposures). Generalised estimating equations with a logit link were used to identify associations between exposures and progression, and to investigate other potential risk factors.The median (interquartile range) number of total exposures was 15 (3-23) for cases and 3 (2-12) for controls (p=0.001). The adjusted OR for disease was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16) per additional exposure, corresponding to an OR of 3.4 for disease when comparing the medians of 15 versus 3 total exposures. This association increased when restricting to tuberculin skin test conversions.Increased exposure could be a marker of greater risk of progression to TB disease.

However, treatment failures can appear several months after SG. Additional malabsorptive surgery is generally recommended in such cases. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of repeat SG (re-SG) relative to first-line SG. This was a retrospective study included 15 patients underwent re-SG after failure of first-line SG (i.e. University Hospital, France; Public Practice). These patients were matched (for age, gender, body mass index and comorbidities) 1:2 with 30 patients having undergone first-line SG. The efficacy criteria comprised intra-operative data and postoperative data. The overall study population comprised 45 patients. The re-SG and first-line SG groups did not differ significantly in terms of median age (p = NS). The median BMI was similar in the two groups (43 kg/m(2) vs. 42.3 kg/m(2), p = NS). The two groups were similar in terms of the prevalence of comorbidities. The mean operating time was longer in the re-SG group (116 vs. 86 min; p ≤ 0.01). The postoperative complication rate was twice as high in the re-SG group (p = 0.31). Two patients in the re-SG group developed a gastric fistula (p = 0.25) and one of the latter died. At 12 months, the Excess Weight Loss was 66% (re-SG group) and 77% (first-line SG group) (p = 0.05). Re-SG is feasible but appears to be associated with a greater risk of complications. Nevertheless, re-SG can produce results (in terms of weight loss), equivalent to those obtained after first-line SG.","Rebibo, Lionel; Fuks, David; Verhaeghe, Pierre; Deguines, Jean-Baptiste; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Obesity surgery,494,1

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1). That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC). To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths. As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3). Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death. Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).

The effect of organic modifiers (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol), column temperature and back pressure were evaluated for their selective separation. A consistent elution order, RZ(+) > SZ(-) > RE(+) > SE(-) was observed in all the modifiers. Amongst the three modifiers, the best result in terms of selectivity, resolution and analysis time was obtained with isopropanol. Analytical separation (Rs > 1.5) of RZ(+) and SZ(-) & RE(+) and SE(-) pairs was achieved with a mobile phase consisting of CO2: isopropanol (80: 20, v/v) within 5.0 min. The retention of isomers increased with increase in temperature and decreased with increase in pressure, which was more prominent for RE(+) and SE(-) isomers. The van't Hoff plots revealed that the chiral separation process was essentially entropy driven. Molecular docking was performed to understand the type of chiral recognition between the stereoisomers and the chiral stationary phase and to understand their elution orders under optimized conditions. The results suggested hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions, as the dominant interaction modes. The elution order and binding energy of the interactions were in good agreement with the experimental results. Quantitative studies of RE(+) luliconazole the pharmacologically active isomer was also performed using a marketed formulation.","Pandya, Pranav A; Shah, Priyanka A; Shrivastav, Pranav S",Journal of chromatography.

Megacities are a significant source of emissions of various substances into the atmosphere, including CO2 which is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. In 2019 and 2020, the mobile experiment EMME (Emission Monitoring Mobile Experiment) was carried out on the territory of St Petersburg which is the second-largest industrial city in Russia with a population of more than 5 million people. In 2020, several measurement data sets were obtained during the lockdown period caused by the COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease of 2019) pandemic. One of the goals of EMME was to evaluate the CO2 emission from the St Petersburg agglomeration. Previously, the CO2 area flux has been obtained from the data of the EMME-2019 experiment using the mass balance approach. The value of the CO2 area flux for St Petersburg has been estimated as being 89±28 kt km-2 yr-1, which is 3 times higher than the corresponding value reported in the official municipal inventory. The present study is focused on the derivation of the integral CO2 emission from St Petersburg by coupling the results of the EMME observational campaigns of 2019 and 2020 and the HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories) model. The ODIAC (Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2) database is used as the source of the a priori information on the CO2 emissions for the territory of St Petersburg. The most important finding of the present study, based on the analysis of two observational campaigns, is a significantly higher CO2 emission from the megacity of St Petersburg compared to the data of municipal inventory, i.e. ∼75800±5400 kt yr-1 for 2019 and ∼68400±7100 kt yr-1 for 2020 versus∼30000 kt yr-1 reported by official inventory. The comparison of the CO2 emissions obtained during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020 to the results obtained during the same period of 2019 demonstrated the decrease in emissions of 10 % or 7400 kt yr-1.","Ionov, Dmitry V.; Makarova, Maria V.; Hase, Frank Foka Stefani C.; Kostsov, Vladimir S.; Alberti, Carlos Blumenstock Thomas Warneke Thorsten Virolainen Yana A.",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,494,28

Across disorders, neurotoxic dysregulated glutamate (Glu) signaling may underlie symptom emergence. Current first-line antidepressant drugs (ADs), which do not directly target Glu signaling, fail to provide adequate benefit for many patients and are associated with high relapse rates. Riluzole modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by increasing metabolic cycling and modulating signal transduction. Clinical studies exploring riluzole’s efficacy in stress-related disorders have provided varied results. However, the utility of riluzole for treating specific symptom dimensions or as a prophylactic treatment has not been comprehensively assessed. Methods We investigated whether chronic prophylactic riluzole (∼12-15/kg/day p.o.) could prevent the emergence of behavioral deficits induced by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in mice. We assessed i) anxiety-like behavior using the elevated-plus maze, open field test, and novelty-suppressed feeding, ii) mixed anxiety/anhedonia-like behavior in the novelty-induced hypophagia test and, iii) anhedonia-like behavior using the sucrose consumption test. Z-scoring summarized changes across tests measuring similar outcomes. In a separate learned helplessness (LH) cohort, we investigated whether chronic preventative riluzole treatment could block the development of helplessness-like behavior. Results UCMS induced an elevation in anxiety-, anhedonia-like behavior, and overall behavioral emotionality that was blocked by prophylactic riluzole. In the LH cohort, preventative riluzole blocked the development of helplessness-like behavior. Conclusion This study supports the utility of riluzole as a prophylactic medication, and potential relapse-preventing treatment targeting anhedonia, anxiety, and helplessness symptoms associated with stress-related disorders. Significance Statement Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating drug with mixed evidence of efficacy in clinical studies of patients with stress-related disorders. Based on evidence suggesting that glutamatergic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders, we investigated whether prophylactic treatment with riluzole could prevent the onset of behavioral deficits induced by unpredictable chronic mild stress or learned helplessness in mice. Riluzole effectively prevented the emergence of anxiety-, anhedonia-like behavior, and overall behavioral emotionality in mice exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress. In a separate cohort, riluzole blocked the emergence of helplessness-like behavior as measured in an active avoidance paradigm. These results support testing riluzole as a prophylactic treatment strategy in stress-related illnesses such as major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.","Bansal, Yashika; Fee, Corey; Misquitta, Keith A.; Codeluppi, Sierra; Sibille, Etienne; Berman, Robert M.; Coric, Vladimir; Sanacora, Gerard; Banasr, Mounira",bioRxiv,494,24

While crucial, the precise identification of structures serving as evolutionary traits and systematic criteria is not per se a highly motivating task for students. Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more difficult if, as during the COVID-19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for hands-on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short-range movements outside their home. Here we present QuoVidi, a new open-source web platform for the organisation of large scale treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organised in teams, receive a list of quests that contain morphologic, ecologic or systematic terms. They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment. Once they find the organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their finding and submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff. During the COVID-19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for evaluation to students that were locked in low-biodiversity areas. From a research perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar to citizen-science projects. Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform observations on self-found specimens, this system allows faculties to remotely follow and assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available, open-source and customizable. It can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings.","Lobet, Guillaume; Descamps, Charlotte; Leveau, Lola; Guillet, Alain; Rees, Jean-François",bioRxiv,494,1

For example, they are often called upon to support civilian authorities in humanitarian crises and to provide routine healthcare for civilians. Furthermore, military personnel are a unique population in a health security context, as they are highly mobile and often deploy to austere settings domestically and internationally, which may increase exposure to infectious diseases. Despite the role of militaries, few studies have systematically evaluated the involvement of militaries in global health security activities, including the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). To address this shortcoming, we analyzed Joint External Evaluation (JEE) mission reports (n=91) and National Action Plans for Health Security (n=11) that had been completed as of October 2019 (n=91) to determine the extent to which military organizations have been involved in the evaluation process, country military contributions to health security are accounted for, and specific recommendations are provided for the country's military. For JEE reports, military involvement was highest for the ""Respond"" core area (73%) but much lower for the Prevent (36%) and Detect (30%) core areas. Similarly, 73% of NAPHS documents mentioned military involvement in the Respond core area, compared to 27% and 36% for Prevent and Detect, respectively. Additionally, only 26% of JEE reports provide recommendations for the military in any of the core areas. Our results indicate the need to more fully incorporate military roles and contributions into the GHSA framework and other health security activities in order to improve national capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.","Forshey, B.

According to currently used criteria, COVID-19 was classified as definite COVID-19 (signs or symptoms of COVID-19 confirmed by positive oral/nasopharyngeal swabs at PCR testing) or highly suspected COVID-19 (signs or symptoms highly suggestive of Covid-19, but not confirmed by PCR testing due to limited availability of virological tests in that period). The results were analyzed performing the Odds Ratio by Java-Stat 2-way Contingency Table Analysis. Results: The main findings of the survey study revealed a significantly increased prevalence of COVID-19 in: a.the whole series of ASD patients (definite Covid-19: 22/2994, 0.73%;p=0.0007;definite COVID-19 plus highly suspected Covid-19: 74/2,994, 2.47%;p<0.0001) when compared to Italian general population of COVID-19 infected individuals (349/100000 = 0.34%;data from Italian Superior Institute of Health;h t t p s : / / w w w . e p i c e n t r o . i s s . i t / e n / c o r o n a v i r u s / sars-cov-2-national-surveillance-system). b.the subgroup of patients with connective tissue diseases or systemic vasculitis (n = 1,901) compared to the subgroup of inflammatory arthritis (n = 1,093), namely rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (definite Covid-19: 19/1,901, 0.99%, vs 3/1,093, 0.27%;p=0.036;definite COVID-19 plus highly suspected Covid-19: 69/1,901, 3.6%, vs 5/1,093, 0.45%;p<0.0001) c.the subgroup of patients with pre-existing interstitial lung involvement (n = 526) compared to those without (n = 2,468) (definite Covid-19: 10/526, 1.90%, vs 12/2,468, 0.48%;p=0.0015;definite COVID-19 plus highly suspected Covid-19: 33/526, 6.27%, vs 41/2,468, 1.66%;p<0.0001). Of interest, the prevalence of COVID-19 did not correlate with presence/absence of different comorbidities, mainly diabetes, cardio-vascular and/or renal disorders, as well as of ongoing treatments with biological DMARDs;while patients treated with conventional DMARDs showed a significantly lower prevalence of COVID-19 compared to those without. COVID-19 was more frequently observed in the patients' populations from northern and central compared to southern Italian macro area with lower diffusion of pandemic. Clinical manifestations of Covid-19, observed in 74 patients, were generally mild or moderate;4/9 individuals requiring hospital admission died for severe pneumonia. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 observed in ASD patients during the first wave of pandemic was significantly higher than that observed in Italian general population;moreover, the actual prevalence of COVID-19 might be underestimated due to the high number of mild variants as well as the possible clinical overlapping between these two conditions. Patients with ASD should be invariably regarded as 'frail patients' during the pandemic course, considering the risk of worse outcome in the acute phase of Covid-19, as well as the potential long-term effects of viral infection. The statistically significant association of COVID-19 with connective tissue diseases/ systemic vasculitis, as well as with pre-existing interstitial lung involvement, suggests the presence of distinct clinico-pathological ASD subsets, characterized by markedly different patients' vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ferri, C.; Giuggioli, D.; Raimondo, V.; Dagna, L.; Riccieri, V.; Zanatta, E.; Guiducci, S.; Tavoni, A.; Foti, R.; Cuomo, G.; De Angelis, R.; Cozzi, F.; Murdaca, G.; Cavazzana, I.; Romeo, N.; Codullo, V.; Ingegnoli, F.; Pellegrini, R.; Varcasia, G.; Della Rossa, A.; De Santis, M.; Abignano, G.; Colaci, M.; Caminiti, M.; L'Andolina, M.; Lubrano, E.; Spinella, A.; Lumetti, F.; De Luca, G.; Bellando Randone, S.; Visalli, E.; Bilia, S.; Masini, F.; Pellegrino, G.; Pigatto, E.; Generali, E.; Franceschini, F.; Pagano Mariano, G.; Barsotti, S.; Pettiti, G.; Zanframundo, G.; Brittelli, R.; Aiello, V.; Scorpiniti, D.; Ferrari, T.; Caminiti, R.; Campochiaro, C.; Gigliotti, P.; Cecchetti, R.; Olivo, D.; Ursini, F.; Brusi, V.; Meliconi, R.; Caso, F.; Scarpa, R.; D'Angelo, S.; Iannone, F.; Matucci-Cerinic, M.; Doria, A.; Miccoli, M.; Paparo, S.

Gene-for-gene -type interactions can identify new sources of resistance but genetic resistance is often short lived. Ultimately an understanding of how pathogens rapidly adapt will allow us to both increase resistance gene durability and more effectively target chemical treatments. Until recently all agricultural pathogens were living on wild hosts. To understand crop pathogen evolution, we compared genetic diversity in agricultural and wild populations. Wild reservoirs may be the source of emergent pathogen lineages, but here we outline a strategy for comparison of wild and agricultural pathogen populations to highlight genes adapting to agriculture. To address this, we have selected and developed the beet rust system (Beta vulgaris, Uromyces beticola, respectively) as our wild-agricultural model. Our hypothesis is that pathogen adaptation to agricultural crops will be evident as divergence in comparisons of wild and agricultural plant pathogen populations. We sampled isolates in both the wild and agriculture, sequenced and assembled and annotated a large fungal genome and analysed genetic diversity in 42 re-sequenced rust isolates. We found population differentiation between isolates in the wild compared to a predominantly agricultural group. Fungal effector genes are co-evolving with host resistance and are important for successful colonisation. We predicted (and found) that these exhibit a greater signal of diversification and adaptation and more importantly displayed increased wild agricultural divergence. Finding a signal of adaptation in these genes highlights this as an important strategy to identify genes which are key to pathogen success, that analysis of agricultural isolates alone cannot. Author Summary As quickly as we develop new strategies for crop defence, pathogens evolve to circumvent them. Novel crop pathogen strains emerge periodically and sweep through the agricultural system. However, because of the (often) clonal nature of these crop pathogens it is difficult to identify the trait that is key to their success. In other words, if there is a trait that is key for success in agriculture, all agricultural isolates will have it (or die without it). What we need is a case and control system where we identify genes important to pathogen success in agricultural by comparing them to pathogens that live in the wild. Here we exemplify this strategy by focussing on genes already known to specifically adapt for the successful colonisation of the host, the fungal effector genes. We find that these genes appear to be evolving quickly and that they are more different between the wild and agriculture than other non-effector genes. These differences between wild and agricultural pathogens suggest we are observing adaptation to agriculture. We do this work in the sugar beet rust system because of its tractability to sample but this understanding about how to identify genetic variation that is key to pathogen success in agriculture is applicable to crop systems where pathogen reservoirs exist as well as other pathogen reservoir systems (e.g. zoonoses).","McMullan, Mark; Percival-Alwyn, Lawrence; Sawford, Kevin; Kaithakottil, Gemy; Grey, Michelle; Yvanne, Hélène; Low, Ross; Warring, Sally; Heavens, Darren; Peel, Ned; Kroboth, Jakob; Stevens, Mark; Swarbreck, David; Clark, Matt; Hall, Neil",bioRxiv,494,11

Heterozygous missense mutations in DOCK8 diminish NK cell lytic function and contribute to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production (CSS). CSS is a potential complication of COVID-19 with severe consequences2. Children are at risk of a SARS-CoV-2 post-infectious CSS, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)3. Host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 CSS and MIS-C CSS are unknown. Objectives: The goals are to identify and functionally study rare mutations in DOCK8 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 and MIS-C. Methods: To date, 16 adult patients enrolled in a COVID-19 CSS clinical trial at UAB had whole genome sequencing. Four (25%) had rare heterozygous DOCK8 mutations (3 missense, 1 intronic). A COVID-19 CSS adult patient in Seattle also had a DOCK8 missense mutation. In addition, DOCK8 missense mutations were identified in five children (UAB & Northwell) hospitalized with MIS-C. DOCK8 mutations, or wild-type (WT) sequence controls, were introduced into human NK-92 cells by FOAMY virus transduction. WT and mutant DOCK8-expressing NK-92 cells were incubated with K562 target cells and compared for cytolysis and degranulation (CD107a). Results: One COVID-19 patient DOCK8 mutation (Gly523Arg) reduced NK cell degranulation by 30% and cytolysis by 23% (n=3) (Figure 1). Similar studies of 3 MIS-C patients with DOCK8 missense mutations (Arg899Trp, Ala2Thr, Pro-687Leu) revealed up to 31% reduced NK cell degranulation and 48% reduction in cytolysis by 3 distinct mutations (n=3). Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant (p<0.05) differences in NK cell degranulation and lysis for four unique DOCK8 mutations. Conclusion: Heterozygous DOCK8 missense mutations may contribute to severe COVID-19 and MIS-C CSS by partial dominant-negative effects yielding decreased NK cell cytolysis.","Cron, R.; Zhang, M.; Absher, D.; Bridges, J.; Schnell, A.; Bhatraju, P.; Vagrecha, A.; Lozinsky, S.; Acharya, S.; Levy, C.; Chatham, W.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,494,1

One key challenge is the use of many different atlases, automated segmentation tools, manual edits in semiautomated protocols, and quality control protocols, which complicates comparisons between studies. In this article, we present our semiautomated segmentation protocol using FreeSurfer v6.0, ENIGMA consortium software, and the quality control protocol that was used in FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. We used a dichotomous quality rating scale for inclusion and exclusion of images, and then explored the quality on a region of interest level to exclude all regions with major segmentation errors. The effects of manual edits on cortical thickness values were minor: less than 2% in all regions. Supplementary materials cover registration and additional edit options in FreeSurfer and comparison to the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12). Overall, we conclude that despite minor imperfections FreeSurfer can be reliably used to segment cortical metrics from T1-weighted images of 5-year-old children with appropriate quality assessment in place. However, custom templates may be needed to optimize the results for the subcortical areas. Our semiautomated segmentation protocol provides high quality pediatric neuroimaging data and could help investigators working with similar data sets.","Pulli, Elmo P.; Silver, Eero; Kumpulainen, Venla; Copeland, Anni; Merisaari, Harri; Saunavaara, Jani; Parkkola, Riitta; Lähdesmäki, Tuire; Saukko, Ekaterina; Nolvi, Saara; Kataja, Eeva-Leena; Korja, Riikka; Karlsson, Linnea; Karlsson, Hasse; Tuulari, Jetro J.",bioRxiv,494,24

Self-quarantine is the only existing solution to stop the spread of the virus when vaccination is under trials. Due to COVID-19, individuals may have difficulties in breathing and may experience cognitive impairment, which results in physical and psychological health issues. Healthcare professionals are doing their best to treat the patients at risk to their health. It is important to develop innovative solutions to provide non-contact and remote assistance to reduce the spread of the virus and to provide better care to patients. In addition, such assistance is important for elderly and those that are already sick in order to provide timely medical assistance and to reduce false alarm/visits to the hospitals. This research aims to provide an innovative solution by remotely monitoring vital signs such as breathing and other connected health during the quarantine. We develop an innovative solution for connected health using software-defined radio (SDR) technology and artificial intelligence (AI). The channel frequency response (CFR) is used to extract the fine-grained wireless channel state information (WCSI) by using the multi-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique. The design was validated by simulated channels by analyzing CFR for ideal, additive white gaussian noise (AWGN), fading, and dispersive channels. Finally, various breathing experiments are conducted and the results are illustrated as having classification accuracy of 99.3% for four different breathing patterns using machine learning algorithms.

We observe that their investments in the experiment were 12 percent lower in March 2020 than in December 2019, although their price expectations had not changed, and although they considered the experimental asset less risky during the crash than before. This lower perceived risk is likely due to adaptive normalization, as volatility during the shock is compared to volatility experienced in real markets (which was low in December 2019, but very high in March 2020). Lower investments during the crash can be supported by higher risk aversion, not by changes in beliefs.","Huber, Christoph Huber Jürgen Kirchler Michael",Journal of Banking &amp; Finance,494,16

The velocity fluctuations interact with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature of such magnetic field fluctuations, $\vec{\delta B}$, over a wide range of turbulent Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M} = 2 - 20$ (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfv\'en Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0} = 0.1 - 100$ (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, $B_0$). We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfv\'enic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD turbulence. We then generalise an analytical model for the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations to include $\mathcal{M}$, and find $|\vec{\delta B}| = \delta B = c_s\sqrt{\pi\rho_0}\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $\rho_0$ is the mean density of gas. This new relation fits well in the strong $B$-field regime. We go on to study the anisotropy between the perpendicular ($ B_{\perp}$) and parallel ($ B_{\parallel}$) fluctuations and the mean-normalised fluctuations, which we find follow universal scaling relations, invariant of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a detailed analysis of the morphology for the $\delta B_{\perp}$ and $\delta B_{\parallel}$ probability density functions and find that eddies aligned with $B_0$ cause parallel fluctuations that reduce $B_{\parallel}$ in the most anisotropic simulations.

The relationship between unplanned consequences and developments in science and technology is fundamental for a definition of the contemporary picture of social action developments. Theoretical interests link to the working-in-progress formulations. Empirical development emerges from these perspectives. The significance of the theoretical progression encapsulated in the American sociologist's doctoral dissertation is astounding (1938). The theory-research connection is equally significant when placed in relation to the scholarly output of the 1950s. In addition, the questions posed by Merton apply in the 1970s and 1990s sociology. They are fertile with interesting answers even today, which is a dramatically disturbed time due to the technological progress. This progress raises new ethical, political, and social questions about the future of humanity. Other sources of disorder derive from the ecological crisis that leads to a rethinking of the man-environment relationship. Merton does not address this topic. The twentieth-century totalitarianisms that have survived into the twenty-first century embed dangerously within the scientific technological development (e.g. the China case). The development of new medical-biological theories and practices impose new questions about the value attributed to life.

In the majority of cases, once a victim has been attacked there remain only two courses of action open to them; either pay the ransom or lose their data. One common behaviour shared between all crypto ransomware strains is that at some point during their execution they will attempt to encrypt the users' files. Previous research Penrose et al. (2013); Zhao et al. (2011) has highlighted the difficulty in differentiating between compressed and encrypted files using Shannon entropy as both file types exhibit similar values. One of the experiments described in this paper shows a unique characteristic for the Shannon entropy of encrypted file header fragments. This characteristic was used to differentiate between encrypted files and other high entropy files such as archives. This discovery was leveraged in the development of a file classification model that used the differential area between the entropy curve of a file under analysis and one generated from random data. When comparing the entropy plot values of a file under analysis against one generated by a file containing purely random numbers, the greater the correlation of the plots is, the higher the confidence that the file under analysis contains encrypted data.","Davies, Simon R; Macfarlane, Richard; Buchanan, William J",,494,1

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging viruses.","Xiao, Minfeng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Ji, Jingkai; Li, Min; Li, Jiandong; Yang, Lin; Sun, Wanying; Ren, Peidi; Yang, Guifang; Zhao, Jincun; Liang, Tianzhu; Ren, Huahui; Chen, Tian; Zhong, Huanzi; Song, Wenchen; Wang, Yanqun; Deng, Ziqing; Zhao, Yanping; Ou, Zhihua; Wang, Daxi; Cai, Jielun; Cheng, Xinyi; Feng, Taiqing; Wu, Honglong; Gong, Yanping; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Zhu, Shida; Chen, Fang; Zhang, Yanyan; Chen, Weijun; Li, Yimin; Li, Junhua",bioRxiv,494,1

In contrast, the second year of the pandemic was punctuated by the emergence of several variants that bore evidence of dramatic evolution. Here, we compare and contrast evolutionary patterns of various variants, with a focus on the recent Delta variant. Most variants are characterized by long branches leading to their emergence, with an excess of non-synonymous substitutions occurring particularly in the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins. In contrast, the Delta variant that is now becoming globally dominant, lacks the signature long branch, and is characterized by a step-wise evolutionary process that is ongoing. Contrary to the star-like topologies of other variants, we note the formation of several distinct clades within Delta that we denote as clades A-E. We find that sequences from the Delta D clade are dramatically increasing in frequency across different regions of the globe. Delta D is characterized by an excess of non-synonymous mutations, mostly occurring in ORF1a/b, and also T140I in ORF7b, and G215C in Nucleocapsid. We conclude that the Delta surge these days is composed almost exclusively of Delta D, and discuss whether selection or random genetic drift has driven the emergence of Delta D.","Stern, A.; Fleishon, S.; Kustin, T.; Mandelboim, M.; Erster, O.; Israel Consortium of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing,; Mendelson, E.; Mor, O.; Zuckerman, N.",,494,26

We investigated the prevalence of smell and/or taste loss and the clinical characteristics and recovery in a comprehensive cohort of consecutive patients treated by two COVID-19 reference hospitals and evaluated late persistence of hyposmia. METHODS A retrospective observational questionnaire study was conducted. All consecutive RT-PCR diagnosed patients who had been hospitalized in March-April 2020 in the COVID-19 care wards were contacted, excluding patients with cognitive disorders and severe deconditioning. The patients responded to a survey about the loss of smell and taste, nasal blockage, and rhinorrhea, rated the symptoms' severity from 0 to 4, and reported the recovery of smell and taste with time. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS We contacted 117 patients. Ninety responded to the questionnaire; 38.9 % of them reported olfactory and 36.66 % gustatory disorders during their disease. Smell loss prior to other symptoms was reported by 42.86 %, and severe hyposmia/anosmia by 74.28 % of the hyposmic. Among the non-ICU treated patients, 43.75 % reported hyposmia. Only 8.89 % had nasal blockage, and 6.66 % rhinorrhea. Most of the patients (85.71 %) recovered their sense of smell in 3-61 days (median: 17; IQR: 24), but 8.57 % had persistent hyposmia. For one out of four, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. CONCLUSION Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent and early symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The great majority recover their smell, but nearly one out of ten have not recovered in two months.

Historically, public health issues have been managed within each county, with very little sharing of information among counties. The 1999 West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in the Northeast caused public health officials in Atlanta to recognize the potential for the disease to spread to Georgia and the need to develop a coordinated, multi-jurisdictional response plan. This plan would need to address a new disease with little scientific data to predict how it might behave in a new environment and would also require closely coordinated communication among the local/state public health entities and elected officials. In early 2000, staff from the five health districts in the metro Atlanta area and the state health department voluntarily convened the Metro Atlanta Surveillance Task Force (MASTF) to create the Metro Atlanta West Nile Virus Response Plan. This plan utilizes a coordinated effort encompassing public education, surveillance, and mosquito control. With this plan in place, when the first human case of WNV was detected in Atlanta, the public heard consistent health messages about preventive measures to lower their risk of illness and the metro counties were able to carry out a successful uniform approach to mosquito control. This plan has received recognition by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) as a 2004 Model Practice, demonstrating exemplary and replicable qualities in response to a local public health need. Since the early days of the emergence of WNV in the metro Atlanta area, MASTF has continued to be a viable, evolving entity, managing and anticipating health issues. The MASTF plan is a successful effort to develop consistent policies and procedures for disease surveillance in a heavily populated area with multiple local health departments.","Willis, Juanette",Ethnicity & disease,494,29

METHODS The medical staff associated with nosocomial infection of SARS in a hospital were investigated with standard procedures of epidemiological survey. RESULTS The source of SARS infection was identified as the husband of a tumor patient who received chemotherapy in the Department of Oncology, during which they maintained intimate contact for at least two weeks when the husband had typical symptoms of SARS. The tumor patient had no any signs of SARS before her death. The mean latent period of SARS was 12.6 days in the 8 nurses transferred temporarily from other departments to assist in the management of the tumor patient. All 57 persons with close contact with the 12 medical staff suffering SARS in the latent period or with one having early-stage SARS did not show any signs of SARS during one month for observation in isolation. CONCLUSION SARS patients may have no or very limited infectivity during the latent period. Infection of SARS might be concerned with the intensity and persistence of contact with the infectious sources. The pathogenesis of SARS might involve the immune status of the potential patients, and immunodeficient individuals are at the risk of becoming asymptomatic carriers of SARS virus and the infectious sources.","Li, Hai-lan; Feng, Xiao-rong; Dai, Lin; Yang, Qing",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,494,7

This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented physical distancing (often communicated as social distancing) measures resulting in significant changes to people's usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people's well-being, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. AIMS: We examined the relationship between individuals' levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. METHOD: Survey data were collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry-both general and COVID-19 specific-and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19-specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19-specific worries-respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity in times of adversity.","Nitschke, Jonas P; Forbes, Paul A G; Ali, Nida; Cutler, Jo; Apps, Matthew A J; Lockwood, Patricia L; Lamm, Claus",Br. j. health psychol,494,16

However, in many countries a ""Phase-2"" is approaching and many activities will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10. Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria; Miani, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),494,4

The simultaneous infection of a single individual by two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages provides a window of opportunity for viral recombination and the emergence of new lineages with differential phenotype. Several hundred SARS-CoV-2 lineages are currently well characterized but two main factors have precluded major coinfection/codetection analysis thus far: i) the low diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages during the first year of the pandemic which limited the identification of lineage defining mutations necessary to distinguish coinfecting viral lineages; and the ii) limited availability of raw sequencing data where abundance and distribution of intrasample/intrahost variability can be accessed. Here, we have put together a large sequencing dataset from Brazilian samples covering a period of 18 May 2020 to 30 April 2021 and probed it for unexpected patterns of high intrasample/intrahost variability. It enabled us to detect nine cases of SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with well characterized lineage-defining mutations. In addition, we matched these SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with spatio-temporal epidemiological data confirming their plausibility with the co-circulating lineages at the timeframe investigated. These coinfections represent around 0.61% of all samples investigated. Although our data suggests that coinfection with distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages is a rare phenomenon, it is likely an underestimation and coinfection rates warrants further investigation.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort including 502 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 8, 2020 within one of 15 participating hospitals in 5 health systems across 5 states in the Southeast US. METHODS: The study objectives were to identify risk factors that could increase progression to hospital mortality and severe disease (defined as a composite of intensive care unit admission or requirement of mechanical ventilation) in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in the Southeast US. RESULTS: A total of 502 patients were included, and the majority (476/502, 95%) had clinically evaluable outcomes. Hospital mortality was 16% (76/476), while 35% (177/502) required ICU admission, and 18% (91/502) required mechanical ventilation. By both univariate and adjusted multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was independently associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.03 for each decade increase, 95% CI 1.56-2.69), male sex (aOR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.34-4.59), and cardiovascular disease (aOR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.15-4.09). As with mortality, risk of severe disease was independently associated with age (aOR 1.17 for each decade increase, 95% CI: 1.00-1.37), male sex (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.54-3.60), and cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.09-2.85). CONCLUSIONS: In an adjusted multivariate analysis, advanced age, male sex, and cardiovascular disease increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19 in the Southeast US.

Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS: Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8â±â3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9â±â10.8%, pâ<â0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0â±â8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION: Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention. Ideal protection of medical staff is achieved when the procedure is performed under endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation.","Loth, Andreas German; Guderian, Daniela Brigitta; Haake, Birgit; Zacharowski, Kai; Stöver, Timo; Leinung, Martin",Shock (Augusta Ga.),494,30

Up until 27 March 2020, we downloaded 50 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (WA State) and Australia (VIC). A total of 30 datasets (60%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal (founder) effect were found in USA next-generation sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from North America in GenBank (22 April 2020) present this signature with up to 39% allele frequencies among samples (n = 1,359). Australian variant signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in these samples. Mutations in the helicase, encoded by the ORF1ab gene in SARS-CoV-2 were predominant, among others, suggesting that these regions are actively evolving. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.","Farkas, Carlos; Fuentes-Villalobos, Francisco; Garrido, Jose Luis; Haigh, Jody; Barría, María Inés",PeerJ,494,2

COVID-19 has wide spectrum of clinical features starting from mild symptoms to severe illness. Otolaryngological symptoms as nasal obstruction, loss of smell, taste dysfunction, sore throat, sticky mucus, and dysphagia are common in COVID-19 patients. Other vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia are common in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to detect the occurrence of vocal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in Egypt and to investigate the videolaryngoscopic findings associated with these symptoms. A total number of 106 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were randomly assessed for vocal symptoms. The following epidemiological and clinical data were collected: age, gender, smoking consumption, general symptoms, otolaryngological and vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia. Auditory perceptual assessment of voice and videolaryngoscopic examination were done. The occurrence of dysphonia and phonesthenia were observed in COVID -19 patients. Of the 106 patients, 84 patients (79%) were dysphonic, 20 (18.8%) patients were phonesthenic. The correlation of the different otolaryngological symptoms with dysphonia and phonesthenia were reported. A significant correlation was found between dysphonic patients and rhinorrhea, taste dysfunction, sore throat, and cough. A significant correlation was found between phonesthenic patients and allergic rhinitis. Videolaryngoscopic findings were detected in COVID-19 patients. Vocal fold congestion was found in 42 patients (39.6%), benign vocal fold swellings was found in 18 patients (16.9%), ventricular hypertrophy was found in 6 patients (0.05%), unilateral vocal fold immobility was found in 14 patients (13.2%), and vocal fold congestion associated with ventricular fold hypertrophy was found in 20 patients (18.8%).There was significant correlation of dysphonia and phonesthenia with vocal fold congestion (P value:0.001, P value:0.039 respectively).There was a significant correlation between cough and vocal fold congestion (P value: 0.000). Benign vocal fold swellings were associated with 18 patients (16.9%), but it was not statistically significant (P value: 0.931). Dysphonia and phonesthenia were observed in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.The vocal symptoms were associated with different laryngoscopic findings, in which, vocal fold congestion was the commonest.","Azzam, Azza Abdel Aziz; Samy, Azza; Sefein, Ihab; ElRouby, Iman",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,494,21

The aim of this work was to develop a simple chromogenic magnetic bead-based immunoassay which allows rapid, inexpensive, and quantitative detection of human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum, plasma, or blood. Recombinant 6xHis-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein was mobilized on the surface of Ni2+ magnetic beads and challenged with serum or blood samples obtained from controls or COVID-19 cases. The beads were washed, incubated with anti-human IgG-HPR conjugate, and immersed into a solution containing a chromogenic HPR substrate. Bead transfer and homogenization between solutions was aided by a simple low-cost device. The method was validated by two independent laboratories, and the performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans was in the same range as obtained using the gold standard immunoassays ELISA and Luminex, though requiring only a fraction of consumables, instrumentation, time to deliver results, and volume of sample. Furthermore, the results obtained with the method described can be visually interpreted without compromising accuracy as demonstrated by validation at a point-of-care unit. The magnetic bead immunoassay throughput can be customized on demand and is readily adapted to be used with any other 6xHis tagged protein or peptide as antigen to track other diseases.","Huergo, Luciano F; Selim, Khaled A; Conzentino, Marcelo S; Gerhardt, Edileusa C M; Santos, Adrian R S; Wagner, Berenike; Alford, Janette T; Deobald, Nelli; Pedrosa, Fabio O; de Souza, Emanuel M; Nogueira, Meri B; Raboni, Sônia M; Souto, Dênio; Rego, Fabiane G M; Zanette, Dalila L; Aoki, Mateus N; Nardin, Jeanine M; Fornazari, Bruna; Morales, Hugo M P; Borges, Vânia A; Nelde, Annika; Walz, Juliane S; Becker, Matthias; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Reis, Rodrigo A; Forchhammer, Karl",ACS Sens,494,29

A quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) for inhibitory constants (pKi) of 89 compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme was developed by using support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm. The optimal SVM model (C =90.2339 and γ = 1.19826×10-5) based on six molecular descriptors has determination coefficients of 0.839 for the training set (65 compounds) and 0.747 for test set (24 compounds), and rms errors of 0.435 and 0.525, respectively. These results are accurate and acceptable compared with that in other models reported, although our SVM model deals with more samples in the dada set.

In this current worldwide emergency, the clinical business is searching for new advancements to screen and combat COVID-19 contamination. Strategies used by artificial intelligence can stretch screen the spread of the infection, distinguish highly infected patients, and be compelling in supervising the illness continuously. The artificial intelligence anticipation can further be used for passing dangers by sufficiently dissecting information from past sufferers. International patient support with recommendations for population testing, medical care, notification, and infection control can help fight this deadly virus. We proposed the hybrid deep learning method to diagnose COVID-19. The layered approach is used here to measure the symptom level of the patients and to analyze the patient image data whether he/she is positive with COVID-19. This work utilizes smart AI techniques to predict and diagnose the coronavirus rapidly by the Oura smart ring within 24 h. In the laboratory, a coronavirus rapid test is prepared with the help of a deep learning model using the RNN and CNN algorithms to diagnose the coronavirus rapidly and accurately. The result shows the value 0 or 1. The result 1 indicates the person is affected with coronavirus and the result 0 indicates the person is not affected with coronavirus. X-Ray and CT image classifications are considered here so that the threshold value is utilized for identifying an individual's health condition from the initial stage to a severe stage. Threshold value 0.5 is used to identify coronavirus initial stage condition and 1 is used to identify the coronavirus severe condition of the patient. The proposed methods are utilized for four weighting parameters to reduce both false positive and false negative image classification results for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.","Poongodi, M; Hamdi, Mounir; Malviya, Mohit; Sharma, Ashutosh; Dhiman, Gaurav; Vimal, S",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,494,20

This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells, and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a level of least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably 40 to 60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.","Charoenngam, Nipith; Shirvani, Arash; Holick, Michael F",Endocr Pract,494,30

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. METHODS: A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17th April to 17th May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002). RESULTS: Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5-2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 antibody test could detect a considerable number of hospital staff who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 cases. Accurate antibody testing is a valuable screening tool, particularly in asymptomatic healthcare workers.

Evaluate the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 pandemic during the social distancing period and explore the relationship between social media use and psychological stress during COVID-19 outbreak among Najran city population. Research design is descriptive correlational research design. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A snowball sampling technique, was used to recruit participants live in Najran city during the COVID-19 pandemic (1508 participant). RESULTS: A statistically significant differences (P<0.05) are observed between Saudi and non-Saudi participants in all social aspects assessed except for time spent on social media. In addition, a high mean of depression, stress, and anxiety subscale scores are observed in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants with statistically significant differences (p=0.000). As well as high DASS-21 total scores in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants. Also, there are positive statistically significant correlations (&#8804;0.05) between participants' time spent in social media and their depression, stress, anxiety, and total DASS scores during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic generates stress, anxiety and depression among Najran population especially, non-Saudi. This poor psychological condition is exaggerated with prolonged social media use. COVID-19 also has negative impact on social wellbeing and use of social media cannot replace direct contact with friends. The current study results may be utilized to formulate interventions that enhance psychosocial health and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Al-Qahtani, Awad Mohammed; Elgzar, Wafaa Taha; Ibrahim, Heba Abdel-Fatah",Psychiatr Danub,494,16

To investigate the impact of national vaccination programs and natural infection on viral transmission in those South American countries, we analyzed the coupling between population mobility and the viral effective reproduction number Rt. Our analyses reveal that population mobility was highly correlated with viral Rt from January to May 2021 in all countries analyzed; but a clear decoupling occurred since May-June 2021, when the rate of viral spread started to be lower than expected from the levels of social interactions. These findings support that populations from the South American Southern cone probably achieved the conditional herd immunity threshold to contain the spread of regional SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Fiori, Marcelo; Bello, Gonzalo; Wschebor, Nicolás; Lecumberry, Federico; Ferragut, Andrés; Mordecki, Ernesto",,494,16

One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behavior, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance machine learning-based classification and regression models for predicting Bitcoin price movements and prices in short and medium terms. In previous works, machine learning-based classification has been studied for an only one-day time frame, while this work goes beyond that by using machine learning-based models for one, seven, thirty and ninety days. The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh-ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days. These results indicate that the presented models outperform the existing models in the literature.","Mudassir, Mohammed; Bennbaia, Shada; Unal, Devrim; Hammoudeh, Mohammad",Neural Comput Appl,494,10

This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective review included 44 patients who were infected with COVID-19. The dynamic chest CT and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records. The intervals between onset and CT scans and the dynamic changes of the lesions were recorded. The above data were reviewed, sorted, and analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS From the time of onset, the dynamic image of the lungs became more complete. Fibrous cord shadow absorption in the lungs were observed. Experimental indicators, biochemical indicators of lymphocytes, and protein series were decreased to varying degrees, while erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were increased to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Jiang, Xiangsen; Yin, Zudong; Wang, Tao; Zhai, Nailiang; Lu, Feng; Zhan, Chunhua; Han, Qizheng; Feng, Changjiang",Med Sci Monit,494,22

The work, notably led by the World Health Organization with the initiation of age-friendly cities and age-friendly communities, has now sparked a movement for the creation of age-friendly health systems and age-friendly public health systems. Now more than ever, in an era of pandemics, it seems wise to create an ecosystem where each of the age-friendly initiatives can create synergies and additional momentum as the population continues to age. Work of a global nature is especially important given the array of international programs and scientific groups focused on improving the lives of older adults along with their care and support system and our interconnectedness as a world community.

Previously, we developed a liver-regeneration therapy using autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which is under clinical investigation. Cell-cell interactions between BMSCs and macrophages (M&#966;s) participate in the improvement of liver function and alleviation of liver fibrosis, although the associated mechanisms have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated phenotypic changes in M&#966;s caused by interactions with BMSCs, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Co-culturing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived M&#966;s (BMDMs) with BMSCs substantially upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), MMP12, and MMP13 expression, and downregulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#945;) expression. To identify humoral factors involved in phenotypic changes occurring in M&#966;s, microarray analysis was performed with microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from extracellular vesicles in the supernatant of co-cultured BMSCs and LPS-stimulated BMDMs. We found that miR-6769b-5p was highly expressed and that transfecting miR-6769b-5p mimic upregulated MMP9 in LPS-stimulated BMDMs and downregulated TNF&#945; and interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß). MiR-6769b-5p expression in BMDMs was decreased by LPS stimulation but was increased by co-culture with BMSCs. Microarray and pathway analyses of gene expression in LPS-stimulated, miR-6769b-5p-transfected BMDMs revealed changes in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-signaling pathway and decreased the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). LPS-stimulated BMDMs exhibited increased MMP9 expression and decreased the expression of TNF&#945; and IL-1ß by ATF4 knockdown. These findings indicate that upregulating miR-6769b-5p in BMDMs induced a fibrolytic phenotype, where MMP9 was highly expressed and inflammatory cytokine expression was decreased by the suppression of ATF4 expression. These findings imply that regulating miR-6769b-5p or ATF4 expression in BMDMs may be helpful for treating chronic liver disease.","Nishi, Maiko; Matsumoto, Toshihiko; Fujisawa, Koichi; Suehiro, Yutaka; Takami, Taro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Yamasaki, Takahiro; Sakaida, Isao",Stem cells dev,494,16

School closure is implemented widely in order to prevent viral transmission and its impact on the broader community, based on preliminary recommendations and evidence from influenza. However, there is debate with regard to the effectiveness of school closures. Growing evidence suggests that a child's SARS-CoV-2 infection is often mild or asymptomatic and that children may not be major SARS-CoV-2 transmitters; thus, it is questionable if school closures prevent transmission significantly. This question is important as a majority of children in low- and middle-income countries depend on free school meals; unexpected long-term school closure may adversely impact nutrition and educational outcomes. Food insecurity is expected to be higher during the pandemic. In this viewpoint, we argue for a more thorough exploration of potential adverse impacts of school closures in low- and middle-income countries and recommend actions to ensure that the health and learning needs of vulnerable populations are met in this time of crisis.","Mayurasakorn, Korapat; Pinsawas, Bonggochpass; Mongkolsucharitkul, Pichanun; Sranacharoenpong, Kitti; Damapong, Sa-Nga",J Paediatr Child Health,494,3

However, these accommodations are seldom individualized to ensure that they actually improve the performance of a specific student. Therefore, a need exists for an evidence-based protocol (henceforth, the Protocol) for selecting individually tailored test accommodations for students with dysgraphia. OBJECTIVE: To establish the Protocol's content validity, interrater reliability, and preliminary outcomes through a pilot study. DESIGN: Descriptive and exploratory design. SETTING: Research laboratory at a large university in central Israel. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 25 students (mean age = 24.9 yr, standard deviation = 2.1), of whom 88.0% were male. Inclusion criteria included a previous diagnosis of a specific learning disability and handwriting difficulties. Exclusion criteria were a physical condition or medication intake that may have affected students' handwriting or typing ability. RESULTS: The Protocol was found to have face validity and high interrater reliability (&#954; = .80). Its initial use showed that the most suitable accommodations for students with dysgraphia varied and were not always intuitive (e.g., extended time was not always the best accommodation for students with slow handwriting). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Protocol appears to be a promising tool to assist occupational therapists in selecting the most appropriate accommodations for students with dysgraphia in a systematic manner. However, additional studies are required to further support these results. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: This study indicates that the selection of the most appropriate accommodation for students with dysgraphia is not always intuitive. It describes a Protocol that enables occupational therapists to select accommodations that are tailored to students' writing abilities, following a systematic process, while considering the students' writing performance with and without accommodations.","Rosenberg-Adler, Tali; Weintraub, Naomi",Am J Occup Ther,494,33

Methods: All 34 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR through nasopharyngeal swab specimens were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 19 to Febuary 7, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 34 cases, 14 were males, and 20 were females. The median age was 8 years and 11 months. No patients had underlying diseases. There were 28 children (82%) related with a family cluster outbreak. There were 26 children (76%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 22 (65%) common cases, 9 (26%) mild cases and 3 (8.8%) asymptomatic cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were fever (17 cases, 50%) and cough (13 cases, 38% ). In the 34 cases, the white blood cell counts of 28 cases (82%) were normal. Five cases had white blood cell counts more than 10×10(9)/L. One case had white blood cell counts less than 4×10(9)/L. Neutropenia and lymphopenia was found in one case, respectively. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were elevated in 1 and 5 case, respectively. Elevated procalcitonin was found in 1 case and D-Dimer in 3 cases. The levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were more than 400 U/L in 10 cases.

The Reynolds number, based on the square cross section channel hydraulic diameter is 8888,13333 and 17777. Mean flow, Reynolds stress and POD are taken into consideration to investigate the flow characteristic with three different turning sections. Through analysis, a series of important conclusions have been drawn. For the main flow, the structure of turning sections has obvious influence on the characteristics of flow field. The size and number of vortices in the corner area are significantly reduced, because the increase in Reynolds number makes the influx impact stronger. It can be seen from the Reynolds stress distribution which is obviously different in different turning sections that the pulsation caused by the mixing of the main flow and the vortex is obviously stronger than that at the boundary. The flow at the turning section is complex, the distribution of the proportion of turbulent kinetic energy in the low-order mode is relatively gentle, and there is an obvious wavy structure at the turning section of the inner circle and outer circular passage, which matches the velocity field from the POD.","Liu, Runzhou; Li, Haiwang; You, Ruquan; Tao, Zhi",,494,22

Although their loss or dysfunction is associated with many diseases, it remains unclear how ZP proteins assemble in aECMs. Current models suggest that ZP proteins polymerize via their ZPn subdomains, while ZPc subdomains modulate ZPn behavior. Using the model organism C. elegans, we investigated the aECM assembly of one ZP protein, LET-653, which shapes several tubes. Contrary to prevailing models, we find that LET-653 localizes and functions via its ZPc domain. Furthermore, we show that ZPc domain function requires cleavage at the LET-653 C-terminus, likely in part to relieve inhibition of the ZPc by the ZPn domain, but also to promote some other aspect of ZPc domain function. In vitro, the ZPc, but not ZPn, domain bound crystalline aggregates. These data offer a new model for ZP function whereby the ZPc domain is primarily responsible for matrix incorporation and tissue shaping.","Cohen, Jennifer D; Bermudez, Jessica G; Good, Matthew C; Sundaram, Meera V",PLoS Genet,494,1

In this paper, the impact of sudden suspension of human activities on air pollution was analyzed by studying the change in satellite retrieved NO2 concentrations and top-down NOx emission over the urban and rural areas around Delhi. NO2 was chosen for being the most indicative of emission intensity due to its short lifetime of the order of a few hours in the planetary boundary layer. We present a robust temporal comparison of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved NO2 column density during the lockdown with the counterfactual baseline concentrations, extrapolated from the long-term trend and seasonal cycle components of NO2 using observations during 2015 to 2019. NO2 concentration in the urban area of Delhi experienced an anomalous relative change ranging from 60.0% decline during the Phase 1 of lockdown (March 25-April 13, 2020) to 3.4% during the post-lockdown Phase 5. In contrast, we find no substantial reduction in NO2 concentrations over the rural areas. To segregate the impact of the lockdown from the meteorology, weekly top-down NOx emissions were estimated from high-resolution TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) retrieved NO2 by accounting for horizontal advection derived from the steady state continuity equation. NOx emissions from urban Delhi and power plants exhibited a mean decline of 72.2% and 53.4% respectively in Phase 1 compared to the pre-lockdown business-as-usual phase. Emission estimates over urban areas and power-plants showed a good correlation with activity reports, suggesting the applicability of this approach for studying emission changes. A higher anomaly in emission estimates suggests that comparison of only concentration change, without accounting for the dynamical and photochemical conditions, may mislead evaluation of lockdown impact. Our results shall also have a broader impact for optimizing bottom-up emission inventories.","Misra, Prakhar; Takigawa, Masayuki; Khatri, Pradeep; Dhaka, Surendra K; Dimri, A P; Yamaji, Kazuyo; Kajino, Mizuo; Takeuchi, Wataru; Imasu, Ryoichi; Nitta, Kaho; Patra, Prabir K; Hayashida, Sachiko",Sci Rep,494,24

In this study, we identified an identical ribosomal frameshift motif among the three bat-human pairs of viruses and strong purifying selection after jumping from bats to humans. This represents genetic signatures of coronaviruses that are related to bat-to-human transmission. To further trace the early human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in North America, a geographically stratified genome-wide association study (North American isolates and the remaining isolates) and a retrospective study were conducted. We determined that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 1,059.C > T and 25,563.G > T were significantly associated with approximately half of the North American SARS-CoV-2 isolates that accumulated largely during March 2020. Retrospectively tracing isolates with these two SNPs was used to reconstruct the early, reliable transmission history of North American SARS-CoV-2, and European isolates (February 26, 2020) showed transmission 3 days earlier than North American isolates and 17 days earlier than Asian isolates.

On average, the Chinese stock market is the net recipient of spillover, non-ferrous metals and chemical industry have a very obvious spillover impact on the stock market. The degree of total volatility spillover is different in different periods. After major crisis events, the volatility correlation between markets increases. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the spillover effect of the stock market on the commodity market has been significantly enhanced.

The result shows that the ability of most commodities to hedge against risks is significantly reduced when the crisis occurs;NMFI (precious metals) and CRFI (grain) still have good hedging ability after the crisis, but the effectiveness of hedging risk is relatively low.

In this work, a dataset of CT images of confirmed and negative COVID-19 was used for the screening of COVID-19. Some preprocessing operations were applied to enhance the COVID-19 CT images which aim at including only the Area of Interest (AOI). This was accomplished in three stages. First, a conversion of the CT images to the binary scale was performed by applying a global threshold algorithm. Then, the median filter algorithm was applied to remove random noise. Then, we include only the ROI (the lung) and exclude other parts of the images. Finally, we applied VGGNet 19 to extract features from the preprocessed CT images, which is a popular CNN architecture, trained previously on ImageNet. The proposed pipeline showed high performance by achieving 98.31%, 100%, 98.19% and 98.64% of accuracy, recall, precision and f1-score, respectively.

Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. RESULTS: A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSION: Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency. It is important to track and coordinate research efforts across jurisdictions to gain a composite evidence-based view that will influence future practice and preparative strategies.","O039,; Brien, Sheila F; Lieshout-Krikke, Ryanne W; Lewin, Antoine; Erikstrup, Christian; Steele, Whitney R; Uzicanin, Samra; Custer, Brian",Vox Sang,494,1

How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial in Hopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show that the attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the update rule of modern Hopfield networks that can store exponentially many patterns. We exploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve a challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology: immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learning methods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines and therapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by the COVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number of immunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedly massive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currently considered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, we present our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, or equivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures for massive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate that DeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance on large-scale experiments, including simulated and real-world virus infection data, and enables the extraction of sequence motifs that are connected to a given disease class.

One of the major complications of this disease is the rapid and dangerous pulmonary deterioration that can lead to critical pneumonia conditions, resulting in death. The current healthcare system around the world faces the potential problem of lacking resources to assist a large number of patients at the same time; then, the non-critical patients are mostly referred to perform self-isolation/quarantine at home. This pandemic has placed new demands on the health systems world, asking for novel, rapid and secure ways to monitor patients in order to detect and quickly report patient's symptoms to the healthcare provider, even if they are not in the hospital. While tremendous efforts have been done to develop technologies to detect the virus, create the vaccine, and stop the spread of the disease, it is also important to develop IoT technologies that can help track and monitor diagnosed COVID-19 patients from their homes. In this paper, we explore the possibility of monitoring respiration rates (RR) of COVID-19 patients using a widely-available technology at home - WiFi. Using the at-home WiFi signals, we propose Wi-COVID, a non-invasive and non-wearable technology to monitor the patient and track RR for the healthcare provider. We first introduce the currently available applications that can be done using WiFi signals.

Prolonged exposure to backlit screens before sleep influences the circadian system leading to negative consequences on sleep health. We investigated the relationship between changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. METHODS: 2,123 Italians (mean age ± standard deviation, 33.1 ± 11.6) were tested longitudinally during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. The second assessment survey inquired about intervening changes in backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. RESULTS: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and individuals reporting moderate/severe insomnia symptoms increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving screen time habits did not show variations of the sleep parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between modifications of evening electronic device usage and time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Monitoring the potential impact of excessive evening exposure to backlit screens on sleep health is recommendable during the current period of restraining measures due to COVID-19.","Salfi, Federico; Amicucci, Giulia; Corigliano, Domenico; D039,; Atri, Aurora; Viselli, Lorenzo; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",Sleep,494,5

While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS: Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",,494,20

One way to improve rates of institutional deliveries is through improving institutional delivery service satisfaction in women. The aim of this research is to identify which factors influence delivery service satisfaction during the period of COVID-19 and which socio-demographic characteristics of women are associated with greater fear of catching COVID-19 during institutional deliveries. METHODS: A total of 190 women who had given birth between May to June, 2020, were sampled from two private and two public sector hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A standardized tool was modified for use and a combination of descriptive statistics and multivariate regression was applied. RESULTS: The results reveal that a majority of women, at 74.7%, are afraid of contracting COVID-19; specifically, women delivering at public hospitals, those who are illiterate or semi-literate, with more than four children, with low household income, and who are unemployed. Regression models are used to identify factors related to higher satisfaction, including the following: (i) pre-delivery care (explanatory power of R2 = 0.651); (ii) during delivery care (R2 = 0.716); (iii) after delivery care for women (R2 = 0.525); and (iv) after delivery care for newborn (R2 = 0.780). The main areas which influence satisfaction include the following: service quality of staff and administration; maintenance of hygiene and sanitation; involvement in decision-making; provision of necessary information; and advice for breastfeeding, immunization and family planning. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on our findings, we recommend improved regulation of delivery services in both public and private hospitals and increased protection for disadvantaged women groups to maintain service quality during the pandemic.","Jafree, Sara Rizvi; Momina, Ainul; Muazzam, Amina; Wajid, Rabia; Calib, Gloria",Matern Child Health J,494,21

Among several therapeutic targets of coronaviruses, the spike protein is of great significance due to its key role in host invasion. Here, we report a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy based on the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Methods: A comprehensive set of bioinformatics methods, including sequence alignment, structural comparison, and molecular docking, was utilized to identify a SARS-CoV-2-spike(S)-specific segment. A tiling crRNA library targeting this specific RNA segment was designed, and optimal crRNA candidates were selected using in-silico methods. The efficiencies of the crRNA candidates were tested in human HepG2 and AT2 cells. Results: The most effective crRNA sequence inducing a robust cleavage effect on S and a potent collateral cleavage effect were identified. Conclusions: This study provides a rapid design pipeline for a CRISPR-Cas13a-based antiviral tool against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it offers a novel approach for anti-virus study even if the precise structures of viral proteins are indeterminate.","Wang, Lin; Zhou, Junhu; Wang, Qixue; Wang, Yunfei; Kang, Chunsheng",Theranostics,494,24

It is unknown whether state-of-the-art treatment has resulted in less thrombotic complications in the second wave. METHODS: We assessed the incidence of thrombotic complications and overall mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to eight Dutch hospitals between September 1st and November 30th 2020. Follow-up ended at discharge, transfer to another hospital, when they died, or on November 30th 2020, whichever came first. Cumulative incidences were estimated, adjusted for competing risk of death. These were compared to those observed in 579 patients admitted in the first wave, between February 24th and April 26th 2020, by means of Cox regression techniques adjusted for age, sex and weight. RESULTS: In total 947 patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis, of whom 358 patients were admitted to the ICU; 144 patients died (15%). The adjusted cumulative incidence of all thrombotic complications after 10, 20 and 30 days was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-15%), 16% (13-19%) and 21% (17-25%), respectively. Patient characteristics between the first and second wave were comparable. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall mortality in the second wave versus the first wave was 0.53 (95%CI 0.41-0.70). The adjusted HR for any thrombotic complication in the second versus the first wave was 0.89 (95%CI 0.65-1.2). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was reduced by 47% in the second wave, but the thrombotic complication rate remained high, and comparable to the first wave.

The current gold standard test for screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray. Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A (1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763 non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19), respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and 184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model, which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for better outcomes.","Misra, Sampa; Jeon, Seungwan; Lee, Seiyon; Managuli, Ravi; Kim, Chulhong",,494,26

Although there is a significant variation in COVID-19 outbreaks among the US nursing homes, we still do not know why such outbreaks are larger and more likely in some nursing homes than others. This research aims to understand why some nursing homes are more susceptible to larger COVID-19 outbreaks. DESIGN: Observational study of all nursing homes in the state of California until 1 May 2020. SETTING: The state of California. PARTICIPANTS: 713 long-term care facilities in the state of California that participate in public reporting of COVID-19 infections as of 1 May 2020 and their infections data could be matched with data on ratings and governance features of nursing homes provided by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of reported COVID-19 infections among staff and residents. RESULTS: Study sample included 713 nursing homes. The size of outbreaks among residents in for-profit nursing homes is 12.7 times larger than their non-profit counterparts (log count=2.54; 95% CI, 1.97 to 3.11; p<0.001). Higher ratings in CMS-reported health inspections are associated with lower number of infections among both staff (log count=-0.19; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.01; p=0.05) and residents (log count=-0.20; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.14; p<0.001). Nursing homes with higher discrepancy between their CMS-reported and self-reported ratings have higher number of infections among their staff (log count=0.41; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.51; p<0.001) and residents (log count=0.13; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.18; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The size of COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes is associated with their ratings and governance features. To prepare for the possible next waves of COVID-19 epidemic, policy makers should use these insights to identify the nursing homes who are more likely to experience large outbreaks.","Gopal, Ram; Han, Xu; Yaraghi, Niam",BMJ Open,494,1

Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7-10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7.

Although this form of assessment is more prevalent in clinical education, LCME standards require ? ? a narrative description of a medical student's performance, including his or her non-cognitive achievement ? whenever teacher-student interaction permits this form of assessment.?1 To provide a narrative assessment (NA) of student performance in a large medical school class is challenging. Here, we present the methodology used in the Human Structure Course at UT Southwestern Medical School. This pre-clerkship course is taught to about 230 students each year and combines Anatomy, Embryology and the basics of Radiology. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was dissection-based, but was conducted entirely online in 2020, when the NA procedure was implemented. To emulate the regular dissection experience, small groups of 2-3 students synchronously met in Zoom Breakout Rooms to study a given body region using 3D-Anatomy software together with our own dissection guide and dissection videos. The NA was based on observations faculty members made while joining the small groups in their Breakout Rooms. A rubric with three categories (?Preparation and Knowledge?, ?Teamwork?, and ?Feedback?) was used to categorize the observed behavior of individual students. To construct the NA, faculty members could choose appropriate comments from provided lists as well as write individual comments on the strengths and areas for improvement for each of the categories. All observations were recorded in a FileMaker application database. The records were then transferred to the Data Mart maintained by the Office of Medical Education, where the observations and comments comprising the NA were converted into cohesive individual reports, which were made available to the students. We aimed at providing six NAs for each student over the course of 11 small-group sessions. To achieve this goal, on average, each faculty member needed to observe and comment on 12-13 students per session. As the students did not spent as much time in their Breakout Room sessions as initially anticipated, faculty members were not always able to observe all students assigned to them during a given session. However, of the 229 students in the class, 58% received all 6 reports, 28% received 5, and 12% received 4 reports. Less than 2% of the students received only 2 or 3 reports. Once the reporting mechanism was fully established, we were able to send the individual reports to the students within 48 hours after the session. In summary, the established procedure allowed us to regularly provide timely narrative feedback to a large class. The greatest limitations were constraints on the time for teacher-student interactions and some inconsistencies in the use of the rubric by faculty. In general, students found the NA helpful, but many requested more individualized comments. In the future, the NA will have to be adapted to a dissection-based course and additional faculty development is desirable. 1Liaison Committee on Medical Education,Standards for Accreditation of Medical Education Programs Leading to the MD Degree.","Prange-Kiel, Janine Botterman Barry Lysikowski Jerzy Winkler Alisa",The FASEB Journal,494,16

However, whether ZNF367 plays a role in colorectal cancer has not been fully understood. Our data showed that ZNF367 expression was higher in colorectal cancer. Depletion of ZNF367 weakened the proliferative and invasive capabilities of colorectal cancer cells. Up-regulation of ZNF367 enhanced the in vitro malignant features of colorectal cancer cells. Knockdown of ZNF367 impeded the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP1). Reactivation of YAP1 reversed the ZNF367-knockdown-mediated anticancer effects. Suppression of YAP1 significantly abolished ZNF367-overexpression-induced tumor-promotion effects. Depletion of ZNF367 repressed the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells in vivo. These findings demonstrate that ZNF367 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and acts as a potential tumor-promoter that contributes to the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer by enhancing the activation of YAP1 signaling.","Lei, Ting; Gao, Ya; Duan, Yuhong; Cui, Chunli; Zhang, Li; Si, Mingming",Environ. toxicol,494,20

Next, we introduce a control input into the model to represent the Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention of social distancing. Implementing the control using two distinct schemes, we find that in both cases the control input is able to significantly mitigate the infection spread.

Though nonlocal diffusion processes are more applicable to many biological and physical problems compared with random diffusion processes, there are very few theoretical results on age-structured population models with nonlocal diffusion. In this paper our objective is to develop basic theory for age-structured population dynamics with nonlocal diffusion. In particular, we study the semigroup of linear operators associated to an age-structured model with nonlocal diffusion and use the spectral properties of its infinitesimal generator to determine the stability of the zero steady state. It is shown that (i) the structure of the semigroup for the age-structured model with nonlocal diffusion is essentially determined by that of the semigroups for the age-structured model without diffusion and the nonlocal operator when both birth and death rates are independent of spatial variables; (ii) the asymptotic behavior can be determined by the sign of spectral bound of the infinitesimal generator when both birth and death rates are dependent on spatial variables; (iii) the weak solution and comparison principle can be established when both birth and death rates are dependent on spatial variables and time; and (iv) the above results can be generalized to an age-size structured model. In addition, we compare our results with the age-structured model with Laplacian diffusion in the first two cases (i) and (ii).","Kang, Hao; Ruan, Shigui; Yu, Xiao",J Dyn Differ Equ,494,16

Due to an additional range of anti‐viral and anti‐inflammatory properties, it has been given to patients with the coronaviruses SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV. It is now being investigated as a potential candidate treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 having been identified as a candidate therapeutic for this virus by both in vitro and in silico drug screens. To date there are no randomised trial data on its use in any novel coronavirus infection, although a large number of trials are currently in progress. In this review, we summarise data from in vitro, murine and human clinical studies on the anti‐viral and anti‐inflammatory properties of macrolides, particularly AZM. AZM reduces in vitro replication of several classes of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza A, Zika virus, Ebola, enteroviruses and coronaviruses, via several mechanisms. AZM enhances expression of anti‐viral pattern recognition receptors and induction of anti‐viral type I and III interferon responses. Of relevance to severe coronavirus‐19 disease (COVID‐19), which is characterised by an over‐exuberant innate inflammatory response, AZM also has anti‐inflammatory properties including suppression of IL‐1beta, IL‐2, TNF and GM‐CSF. AZM inhibits T cells by inhibiting calcineurin signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin activity and NFκB activation. AZM particularly targets granulocytes where it concentrates markedly in lysosomes, particularly affecting accumulation, adhesion, degranulation and apoptosis of neutrophils. Given its proven safety, affordability and global availability, tempered by significant concerns about antimicrobial stewardship, there is an urgent mandate to perform well‐designed and conducted randomised clinical trials.","Oliver, Madeleine E.; Hinks, Timothy S.

Randomised trials have shown that these vaccines dramatically reduce symptomatic COVID-19; however, less is known about their effects on transmission between individuals. The natural course of infection with SARS-CoV-2 involves infection of the respiratory epithelia and replication within the mucosa to sufficient viral titres for transmission via aerosol particles and droplets. Here we discuss the available data on the existing, approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines' capacity to reduce transmissibility by reducing primary infection, viral replication, capacity for transmission, and symptomaticity. The potential for mucosal-targeted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies to more effectively limit transmission than intramuscular vaccines is considered with regard to known immunological mechanisms. Finally, we enumerate the population-level effects of approved vaccines on transmission through observational studies following clinical trials and vaccine distribution in real-world settings.","Mostaghimi, Darius; Valdez, Caroline N; Larson, Haleigh T; Kalinich, Chaney C; Iwasaki, Akiko",Lancet Infect Dis,494,1

There is a lack of serological prevalence data in this age group. We have some interim data from our research for WHO unity protocol, which might help policymakers and the research community to answer such questions based on evidence. Hence, we conducted a study to compare the COVID -19 sero-positivity rate between children and adults Methods/Materials: This is part of an ongoing large multi-centric population-based sero-surveillance study. The study is being conducted in five selected states with a proposed total sample size of 10,000. We have data of 4,500 participants at the time of midterm analysis from four states of India. Total serum antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed qualitatively by using a standard ELISA kit. Here we are reporting the interim data of serological prevalence among children aged between 2 to 17 years along with a comparison with [≥]18-year old participants. Results: The data collection period was from 15th March 2021 to 10th June 2021. Total available data was of 4,509 participants out of which <18 years were 700 and [≥]18 years was 3,809.

The seroprevalence was 55.7% in the <18 years age group and 63.5% in the [≥] 18 year age group. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence between adult and children. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate among children was high and were comparable to the adult population. Hence, it is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing COVID-19 variant would disproportionately affect children two years or older.","Misra, P.; AIIMS, WHO Unity Seroprevalence study team of",,494,10

Methods HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: [≥]50 AU/ml). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalised additive models to track antibody responses over time. Results Vaccine uptake was 80%, but less in lower-paid roles and Black, south Asian and minority ethnic groups. 3570/3610(98.9%) HCWs were seropositive >14 days post-first vaccination and prior to second vaccination, 2706/2720(99.5%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890(97.1%) following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post-first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after second vaccine were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median(IQR) >21 days post-first Pfizer-BioNTech 14,604(7644-22,291) AU/ml vs. 1028(564-1985) AU/ml without prior infection (p<0.001). Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine recipients had lower readings post-first dose compared to Pfizer-BioNTech, with and without previous infection, 10,095(5354-17,096) and 435(203-962) AU/ml respectively (both p<0.001 vs. Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses post-second vaccination were similar to those after prior infection and one vaccine dose. Conclusions Vaccination leads to detectable anti-spike antibodies in nearly all adult HCWs. Whether differences in response impact vaccine efficacy needs further study.","Eyre, D. W.; Lumley, S.

This study aims to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a peri-conception nutrition and exercise intervention on mitigating obesity-associated changes in oocyte gene expression profiles and follicular fluid metabolites. METHODS: This single blinded randomized control trial will include 120 women with a BMI of 25–45 kg/m(2), ≥21 years of age, and undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Participants will be randomized to standard of care (N = 60) or an intervention group (N = 60) in a block design by polycystic ovary syndrome status. The intervention will combine a dietary component (Mediterranean meal plan) with exercise prescription following the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. The standard of care group will be offered to join the intervention group if the IVF treatments are unsuccessful as a cross over design. Recruitment is anticipated to start in July of 2021. Primary outcomes will include single oocyte gene expression profiles and follicular fluid metabolites. Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests will be used to assess potential differences for each stratum. Follicular fluid and serum metabolites will be analyzed using a one-factor Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) at four levels, pair-wise comparisons using Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests will be used to identify groups whose means differ significantly while retaining the family-wise error rate at 5%. When the design is balanced, two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), or non-parametric Friedman test will be used in data analysis. Additionally, general linear models and ANCOVA may be used to control for covariates. Significance will be set at p < 0.05. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations at scientific conferences. DISCUSSION: This study will provide novel data and key information on the impact of a dietary and exercise intervention on oocyte gene expression and follicular fluid content.

As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50%) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.","Huang, Zhifeng; Zhuang, Donglin; Xiong, Bing; Deng, David Xingfei; Li, Hanhua; Lai, Wen",Biomed Pharmacother,494,26

An atmospheric science perspective,11.801457,2.6729298,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Therapy of severely affected coronavirus patient, requiring intubation and sedation is still challenging. Recently, difficulties in sedating these patients have been discussed. This study aims to describe sedation practices in patients with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We performed a retrospective monocentric analysis of sedation regimens in critically ill intubated patients with respiratory failure who required sedation in our mixed 32-bed university intensive care unit. All mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-induced ARDS requiring continuously infused sedative therapy admitted between April 4, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were included. We recorded demographic data, sedative dosages, prone positioning, sedation levels and duration. Descriptive data analysis was performed; for additional analysis, a logistic regression with mixed effect was used. RESULTS: In total, 56 patients (mean age 67 (±14) years) were included. The mean observed sedation period was 224 (±139) hours. To achieve the prescribed sedation level, we observed the need for two or three sedatives in 48.7% and 12.8% of the cases, respectively. In cases with a triple sedation regimen, the combination of clonidine, esketamine and midazolam was observed in most cases (75.7%). Analgesia was achieved using sufentanil in 98.6% of the cases. The analysis showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients required an unusually high sedation dose compared to those available in the literature. CONCLUSION: The global pandemic continues to affect patients severely requiring ventilation and sedation, but optimal sedation strategies are still lacking. The findings of our observation suggest unusual high dosages of sedatives in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Prescribed sedation levels appear to be achievable only with several combinations of sedatives in most critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19-induced ARDS and a potential association to the often required sophisticated critical care including prone positioning and ECMO treatment seems conceivable.","Flinspach, Armin Niklas; Booke, Hendrik; Zacharowski, Kai; Balaban, Ümniye; Herrmann, Eva; Adam, Elisabeth Hannah",PLoS One,494,14

All but one of the newly characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Lai, A.; Bergna, A.; Caucci, S.; Clementi, N.; Vicenti, I.; Dragoni, F.; Cattelan, A.

It is significant for prevention and control to model the evolution effectively and efficiently . Methods: We first propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model which is based on the original single-chain model to describe the revival of COVID-19 in some countries. Multi-chains are considered as the superposition of distinctive single chains. Parameter identification is carried out by minimizing the penalty function. Results: From results of numerical simulations, the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting and reasonably interprets the revival phenomena. The band of 25% fluctuation of simulation results could contain most seemly unsteady increments. Conclusion: The multi-chain model has better performance on data fitting in revival situations compared with the single-chain model. It is predicted by the three-chain model with data by Apr 21 that the epidemic curve of Iran would level off on round May 10, and the final cumulative confirmed cases would be around 88820. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval would be around 96000.","Pan, Hanshuang; Shao, Nian; Yan, Yue; Luo, Xinyue; Ahmadi, Ali; Fadaei, Yasin; Cheng, Jin; Chen, Wenbin",,494,20

The principle of greater involvement of PLHIV (GIPA) has and will increasingly ensure equitable access to services and engagement of marginalized groups in the HIV response, and to health services more broadly. This paper describes the history, current place in the HIV response and potential future role of PLHIV and communities in health responses. DISCUSSION: Historically, the role of communities of PLHIV and peers in service delivery, research and drug development, advocacy, social and political accountability, resource mobilization and social and human rights protection is well documented. Their leadership and engagement have contributed directly to improved outcomes in access to HIV treatment, prevention, support and care services around the world. Their continued and expanded role is especially important for the future success of HIV responses in sub‐Saharan Africa, where the HIV burden remains the greatest. The lessons learned from the leadership and involvement of communities of PLHIV and peers in the HIV response hold value beyond HIV responses. The models and approaches they have efficiently and effectively utilized have relevant applications in addressing shortfalls in health systems in the COVID‐19 era, as well as broader, more integrated health challenges as countries move to develop and operationalize universal health coverage (UHC). However, neither HIV nor other health and development targets can be met if their contributions are not adequately recognized, valued and funded. CONCLUSIONS: The past three decades have demonstrated that communities of PLHIV and their peers are instrumental in sustaining engagement and advocacy for health equity and financing for health and ensuring that the human rights of all people are recognized and upheld. Quality and effective integration of health systems and UHC can be more effectively designed, implemented and sustained with communities of PLHIV and peers at the centre.","Caswell, Georgina; Dubula, Vuyiseka; Baptiste, Solange; Etya’ale, Helen; Syarif, Omar; Barr, David",J Int AIDS Soc,494,9

Thus the research is now shifted towards immunomodulatory agents other than antivirals. In this review, we aim to describe the latest findings towards the role of type I IFN-mediated innate antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the use of IFNs as a medication for COVID-19. A growing body of evidence indicated a promoting active but delayed IFNs response to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in the infected bronchial epithelial cells. Studies have demonstrated that IFNs administration before the viral peak and the inflammatory phase of disease could offer a highly protective effect. However, IFNs Treatment during the inflammatory and severe stages of the disease causes immunopathology and long-lasting harm for patients. Therefore, it is critical to notice the best time window for IFNs administration. Further investigation of the clinical effectiveness of interferon for patients with mild to severe COVID-19 and its optimal timing and route of administration can be beneficial in finding a safe and effective antiviral therapy for the COVID-19 disease.

A single cell therapy laboratory was selected to function as the central cryopreservation hub for all European registry donor transplants intended for the Australian-Pacific region. We examined properties of these transplants to ascertain how quality is maintained. METHODS: We analyzed 100 pandemic-related allogeneic mobilized blood-derived stem cell apheresis products generated at 30 collection sites throughout Europe, shipped to and cryopreserved at our center between April and November of 2020. Products were shipped in the cool, subsequently frozen with DMSO as cryoprotectant. Irrespective of origin, all products were frozen within the prescribed shelf-life of 72 h. RESULTS: Prior to cryopreservation, viable stem cell and leukocyte count according to the collection site and our reference laboratory were highly concordant (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.93, respectively) and viability was > 90% in all instances. Median nominal post-thaw recovery of viable CD34+ cells was 42%. Weakly associated with poorer CD34+ cell recovery was higher leukocyte concentration, but not time lag between apheresis or addition of cryopreservant, respectively, and start of freezing. The correlation between pre- and post-thaw CD34+ cell dose was high (r(2) = 0.85), hence predictable. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were prompt with no evidence of dose dependency within the range of administered cell doses (1.31–15.56 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg). CONCLUSIONS: General cryopreservation of allogeneic stem cell transplants is feasible. While more than half of the CD34+ cell content is lost, the remaining stem cells ensure timely engraftment.

They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins’ functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified.

Methods: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig.

Induction of exosomes(Nsp12Nsp13)-mediated lung inflammation was abolished with ginger exosome-like nanoparticle (GELN) microRNA (miRNA aly-miR396a-5p. The role of GELNs in inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was further demonstrated via GELN aly-miR396a-5p- and rlcv-miR-rL1-28-3p-mediated inhibition of expression of Nsp12 and spike genes, respectively. Taken together, our results reveal exosomes(Nsp12Nsp13) as potentially important contributors to the development of lung inflammation, and GELNs are a potential therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19.","Teng, Yun; Xu, Fangyi; Zhang, Xiangcheng; Mu, Jingyao; Sayed, Mohammed; Hu, Xin; Lei, Chao; Sriwastva, Mukesh; Kumar, Anil; Sundaram, Kumaran; Zhang, Lifeng; Park, Juw Won; Chen, Shao-yu; Zhang, Shuangqin; Yan, Jun; Merchant, Michael L.; Zhang, Xiang; McClain, Craig J.; Wolfe, Jennifer K.; Adcock, Robert S.; Chung, Donghoon; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Zhang, Huang-Ge",Mol Ther,494,24

Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39—a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex—as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7+ and Lamp1+ endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs—an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape.","Steinauer, Angela; LaRochelle, Jonathan R.; Wissner, Rebecca; Berry, Samuel; Schepartz, Alanna",bioRxiv,494,24

In this clinical trial study, oral liposomal glutathione supplementation (L-GSH) or placebo was given to individuals with T2DM to investigate the therapeutic effects of L-GSH supplementation. We report that L-GSH supplementation for 3 months in people with T2DM was able to reduce the levels of oxidative stress in all blood components and prevent depletion of glutathione (GSH) in this population known to be GSH deficient. Additionally, L-GSH supplementation significantly reduced the burden of intracellular mycobacteria within in vitro granulomas generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM subjects. L-GSH supplementation also increased the levels of Th1-associated cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 and decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-10. In conclusion our studies indicate that oral L-GSH supplementation in individuals with T2DM for three months was able to maintain the levels of GSH, reduce oxidative stress, and diminish mycobacterial burden within in vitro generated granulomas of diabetics. L-GSH supplementation for 3 months in diabetics was also able to modulate the levels of various cytokines.","To, Kimberly; Cao, Ruoqiong; Yegiazaryan, Aram; Owens, James; Nguyen, Timothy; Sasaninia, Kayvan; Vaughn, Charles; Singh, Mohkam; Truong, Edward; Medina, Albert; Avitia, Edith; Villegas, Jose; Pham, Christal; Sathananthan, Airani; Venketaraman, Vishwanath",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,494,30

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and millennial participants had 56% and 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior compared to baby boomers. The results suggest that there is a politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78) compared to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A national, coordinated effort toward a pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","Clements, John M",JMIR Public Health Surveill,494,1

This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language. METHODS: The 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged ≥18 years) were included in the final analysis. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha. Construct validity was determined by concurrent, convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. RESULTS: Age of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, 30% were healthcare workers, and 42.8% had the intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ≥0.7). The predictors of intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (concurrent validity) were young age and the 5C sub-scales. Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-mean score of the sub-scale correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin sampling adequacy measure was 0.80 and Bartlett’s sphericity test was highly significant (P<0.001). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA = 0.060, GFI = 0.924, CFI = 0.957, TLI = 0.937, SRMR = 0.076 & NFI = 906). CONCLUSION: The Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population.","Abd ElHafeez, Samar; Elbarazi, Iffat; Shaaban, Ramy; ElMakhzangy, Rony; Ossama Aly, Maged; Alnagar, Amr; Yacoub, Mohamed; El Saeh, Haider M.; Eltaweel, Nashwa; Alqutub, Sulafa T.; Mohamed Ghazy, Ramy",PLoS One,494,18

Methods We analysed data from 2710 young adult participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We assessed the associations of socioeconomic position (SEP) and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs, e.g. abuse, neglect, measures of family dysfunction) with changes to health-related behaviours (meals, snacks, exercise, sleep, alcohol and smoking/vaping), and to financial and employment status during the first UK lockdown between March-June 2020. Results Experiencing 4 or more ACEs was associated with reporting decreased sleep quantity during lockdown (OR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07-2.18) and increased smoking and/or vaping (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 0.99-3.43); no other associations were seen between ACEs or SEP and health-related behaviour changes. Adverse financial and employment changes were more likely for people with low SEP and for people who had experienced multiple ACEs; e.g. people who had been in the 'never worked or long-term unemployed' or 'routine and manual occupation' categories pre-lockdown were almost 3 times more likely to have stopped working during lockdown compared with people who were in a higher managerial, administrative or professional occupation pre-lockdown (OR 2.83, 95% CI: 1.45-5.50 and OR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.63-4.42 respectively). Conclusion Adverse financial and employment consequences of lockdown were more likely to be experienced by people who have already experienced socioeconomic deprivation or childhood adversity, thereby widening social inequalities. Despite this, in this sample of young adults, there was little evidence that lockdown worsened inequalities in health-related behaviours.","Smith, M.

Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is the primary antigen of the virus for development of sensitive diagnostic assays. Thus far, limited knowledge exists about the antigenic properties of the N protein. In this paper, we demonstrate the significant impact of dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein on sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based diagnostics of COVID-19. The expressed purified protein from E.coli consists of two forms, dimeric and monomeric forms, which have been further characterized by biophysical and immunological means. Indirect ELISA indicated elevated susceptibility of the dimeric form of the nucleocapsid protein for identification of protein-specific monoclonal antibody as compared to the monomeric form of the protein. These findings have also been confirmed with the modelled structure of monomeric and dimeric nucleocapsid protein via HHPred software and its solvent accessible surface area, which indicates higher stability and antigenicity of the dimeric type as compared to the monomeric form. It is evident that use of the dimeric form will increase the sensitivity of the current nucleocapsid dependent ELISA for rapid COVID-19 diagnostic. Further, the results indicate that monitoring and maintaining of the monomerdimer composition is critical for accurate and robust diagnostics.

It belongs to the CD28 superfamily and is similar to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) in terms of its structure and function. BTLA can be detected in most lymphocytes and induces immunosuppression by inhibiting B and T cell activation and proliferation. The BTLA ligand, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), does not belong to the classic B7 family. Instead, it is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. The association of BTLA with HVEM directly bridges the CD28 and TNFR families and mediates broad and powerful immune effects. Recently, a large number of studies have found that BTLA participates in numerous physiopathological processes, such as tumor, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and transplantation rejection. Therefore, the present work aimed to review the existing knowledge about BTLA in immunity and summarize the diverse functions of BTLA in various immune disorders.","Ning, Zhaochen; Liu, Keyan; Xiong, Huabao",Front Immunol,494,27
