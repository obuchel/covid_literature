39,An ontology for immune epitopes: application to the design of a broad scope database of immune reactivities,2005-09-20,"BACKGROUND: Epitopes can be defined as the molecular structures bound by specific receptors, which are recognized during immune responses. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) project will catalog and organize information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens, experimental antigens and self-antigens, with a priority on NIAID Category A-C pathogens () and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Both intrinsic structural and phylogenetic features, as well as information relating to the interactions of the epitopes with the host's immune system will be catalogued. DESCRIPTION: To effectively represent and communicate the information related to immune epitopes, a formal ontology was developed. The semantics of the epitope domain and related concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes, which represent the general and specialized relationships between the various concepts. A complete listing of classes and their properties can be found at . CONCLUSION: The IEDB's ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune system. We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases will facilitate rigorous description of data related to immune epitopes, and might ultimately lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses.","Sathiamurthy, Muthuraman; Peters, Bjoern; Bui, Huynh-Hoa; Sidney, John; Mokili, John; Wilson, Stephen S; Fleri, Ward; McGuinness, Deborah L; Bourne, Philip E; Sette, Alessandro",Immunome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287064/,31
114,"Lost in the World of Functional Genomics, Systems Biology, and Translational Research: Is There Life after the Milstein Award?",2007-10-01,"We've always wanted to save the world from the scourges of virus infection by developing better drugs and vaccines. But fully understanding the intricacies of virus-host interactions, the first step in achieving this goal, requires the ability to view the process on a grand scale. The advent of high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry, provided the first opportunities to obtain such a view. Here we describe our efforts to use these tools to focus on the changes in cellular gene expression and protein abundance that occur in response to virus infection. By examining these changes in a comprehensive manner, we have been able to discover exciting new insights into innate immunity, interferon and cytokine signaling, and the strategies used by viruses to overcome these cellular defenses. Functional genomics may yet save the world from killer viruses.","Katze, Michael G.; Korth, Marcus J.",Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1994668?pdf=render,31
212,"IL-1β, IL-6, and RANTES as Biomarkers of Chikungunya Severity",2009-01-21,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus. Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease.","Ng, Lisa F.

436,Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Proteasome Inhibition in Multiple Myeloma Cells,2010-09-29,"BACKGROUND: The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib represents an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib inhibits the activity of the 26S proteasome and induces cell death in a variety of tumor cells; however, the mechanism of cytotoxicity is not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the differential phosphoproteome upon proteasome inhibition by using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our systematic profiling of phosphorylation changes in response to bortezomib treatment not only advanced the global mechanistic understanding of the action of bortezomib on myeloma cells but also identified previously uncharacterized signaling proteins in myeloma cells.","Ge, Feng; Xiao, Chuan-Le; Bi, Li-Jun; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Xiong, Sheng; Yin, Xin-Feng; Li, Li-Ping; Lu, Chun-Hua; Jia, Hai-Tao; He, Qing-Yu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2947515/,31

484,"Reporting errors in infectious disease outbreaks, with an application to Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1",2010-12-15,"BACKGROUND: Effectively responding to infectious disease outbreaks requires a well-informed response. Quantitative methods for analyzing outbreak data and estimating key parameters to characterize the spread of the outbreak, including the reproductive number and the serial interval, often assume that the data collected is complete. In reality reporting delays, undetected cases or lack of sensitive and specific tests to diagnose disease lead to reporting errors in the case counts. Here we provide insight on the impact that such reporting errors might have on the estimation of these key parameters. RESULTS: We show that when the proportion of cases reported is changing through the study period, the estimates of key epidemiological parameters are biased. Using data from the Influenza A/H1N1 outbreak in La Gloria, Mexico, we provide estimates of these parameters, accounting for possible reporting errors, and show that they can be biased by as much as 33%, if reporting issues are not accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for missing data can lead to misleading and inaccurate estimates of epidemic parameters.","White, Laura F; Pagano, Marcello",Epidemiol Perspect Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018365/,31
915,TcdC Does Not Significantly Repress Toxin Expression in Clostridium difficile 630ΔErm,2012-08-17,"In the past decade, Clostridium difficile has emerged as an important gut pathogen. Symptoms of C. difficile infection range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis, sometimes resulting in colectomy or death. The main virulence factors of C. difficile are toxin A and toxin B. Besides the genes encoding these toxins (tcdA and tcdB), the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) also contains genes encoding a sigma factor (tcdR) and a putative anti-sigma factor (tcdC). The important role of TcdR as a sigma factor for toxin expression is undisputed, whereas the role of TcdC as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting toxin expression, is currently the subject of debate. To clarify the role of TcdC in toxin expression, we generated an isogenic ClosTron-based mutant of tcdC in Clostridium difficile strain 630Δ Erm (CT::tcdC) and determined the transcription levels of the PaLoc genes and the expression levels of the toxins in the wild type strain and the tcdC mutant strain. We found only minor differences in transcription levels of the PaLoc genes between the wild type and CT::tcdC strains and total toxin levels did not significantly differ either. These results suggest that in C. difficile 630Δerm TcdC is not a major regulator of toxin expression under the conditions tested.","Bakker, Dennis; Smits, Wiep Klaas; Kuijper, Ed J.; Corver, Jeroen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422341/,31
939,Factors Associated with Increased Risk Perception of Pandemic Influenza in Australia,2010-07-20,"The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with increased risk perception of pandemic influenza in Australia. The sample consisted of 2081 Australian adults aged 16 years and older who completed a short three item pandemic influenza question module which was incorporated into the NSW Health Adult Population Health Survey during the first quarter of 2007. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate analysis indicated that those living in rural regions were significantly more likely to perceive a high risk that a pandemic influenza would occur, while those with poor self-rated health perceived both a high likelihood of pandemic and high concern that self/family would be directly affected were such an event to occur. Those who spoke a language other than English at home and those on low incomes and younger people (16–24 years) were significantly more likely to have changed the way they lived their lives due to the possibility of pandemic influenza, compared to those who spoke only English at home, middle-high income earners, and older age groups, respectively. This data provides an Australian population baseline against which the risk perceptions of demographic subgroups regarding the current, and potential future pandemics, can be compared and monitored.","Jacobs, Jennifer; Taylor, Melanie; Agho, Kingsley; Stevens, Garry; Barr, Margo; Raphael, Beverley",Influenza Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447299/,31
950,"Differential Effects of IL-12 on Tregs and Non-Treg T Cells: Roles of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-2R",2012-09-27,"Complex interactions between effector T cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) contribute to clinical outcomes in cancer, and autoimmune and infectious diseases. Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4(+)Foxp3(−) T cell (Tconv) proliferation. We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-γ at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-γ production by Tregs in vitro. To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-γ is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12. IFN-γ expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation. Rather, IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs. We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells, diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells. Together, these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs. Additionally, we showed that treatment with a second cytokine, IL-27, decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation. Notably, IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells. Together, these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-γ expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression.","Zhao, Jingxian; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459844/,31
1364,Evaluation of a Virucidal Quantitative Carrier Test for Surface Disinfectants,2014-01-27,"Surface disinfectants are part of broader preventive strategies preventing the transmission of bacteria, fungi and viruses in medical institutions. To evaluate their virucidal efficacy, these products must be tested with appropriate model viruses with different physico-chemical properties under conditions representing practical application in hospitals. The aim of this study was to evaluate a quantitative carrier assay. Furthermore, different putative model viruses like adenovirus type 5 (AdV-5) and different animal parvoviruses were evaluated with respect to their tenacity and practicability in laboratory handling. To evaluate the robustness of the method, some of the viruses were tested in parallel in different laboratories in a multi-center study. Different biocides, which are common active ingredients of surface disinfectants, were used in the test. After drying on stainless steel discs as the carrier, model viruses were exposed to different concentrations of three alcohols, peracetic acid (PAA) or glutaraldehyde (GDA), with a fixed exposure time of 5 minutes. Residual virus was determined after treatment by endpoint titration. All parvoviruses exhibited a similar stability with respect to GDA, while AdV-5 was more susceptible. For PAA, the porcine parvovirus was more sensitive than the other parvoviruses, and again, AdV-5 presented a higher susceptibility than the parvoviruses. All parvoviruses were resistant to alcohols, while AdV-5 was only stable when treated with 2-propanol. The analysis of the results of the multi-center study showed a high reproducibility of this test system. In conclusion, two viruses with different physico-chemical properties can be recommended as appropriate model viruses for the evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants: AdV-5, which has a high clinical impact, and murine parvovirus (MVM) with the highest practicability among the parvoviruses tested.","Rabenau, Holger F.; Steinmann, Jochen; Rapp, Ingrid; Schwebke, Ingeborg; Eggers, Maren",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3903494/,31
1424,Investments in respiratory infectious disease research 1997–2010: a systematic analysis of UK funding,2014-03-26,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory infections are responsible for a large global burden of disease. We assessed the public and philanthropic investments awarded to UK institutions for respiratory infectious disease research to identify areas of underinvestment. We aimed to identify projects and categorise them by pathogen, disease and position along the research and development value chain. SETTING: The UK. PARTICIPANTS: Institutions that host and carry out infectious disease research. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The total amount spent and number of studies with a focus on several different respiratory pathogens or diseases, and to correlate these against the global burden of disease; also the total amount spent and number of studies relating to the type of science, the predominant funder in each category and the mean and median award size. RESULTS: We identified 6165 infectious disease studies with a total investment of £2·6 billion. Respiratory research received £419 million (16.1%) across 1192 (19.3%) studies. The Wellcome Trust provided greatest investment (£135.2 million; 32.3%). Tuberculosis received £155 million (37.1%), influenza £80 million (19.1%) and pneumonia £27.8 million (6.6%). Despite high burden, there was relatively little investment in vaccine-preventable diseases including diphtheria (£0.1 million, 0.03%), measles (£5.0 million, 1.2%) and drug-resistant tuberculosis. There were 802 preclinical studies (67.3%) receiving £273 million (65.2%), while implementation research received £81 million (19.3%) across 274 studies (23%). There were comparatively few phase I–IV trials or product development studies. Global health research received £68.3 million (16.3%). Relative investment was strongly correlated with 2010 disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: The UK predominantly funds preclinical science. Tuberculosis is the most studied respiratory disease. The high global burden of pneumonia-related disease warrants greater investment than it has historically received. Other priority areas include antimicrobial resistance (particularly within tuberculosis), economics and proactive investments for emerging infectious threats.","Head, Michael G; Fitchett, Joseph R; Cooke, Mary K; Wurie, Fatima B; Hayward, Andrew C; Lipman, Marc C; Atun, Rifat",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975787/,31
1558,Exploring the Innate Immunological Response of an Alternative Nonhuman Primate Model of Infectious Disease; the Common Marmoset,2014-07-22,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a nonhuman primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious disease. In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals. Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25% B-cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were more similar to human values than mouse values. Comparison of the activation status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their use as models of infectious disease.","Nelson, M.; Loveday, M.",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4129158/,31

The single and selective agonism of PPARγ is the main cause of these side effects. Multitargeted PPARα/γ/δ pan agonist development is the hot topic in the antidiabetic drug research field. In order to identify PPARα/γ/δ pan agonists, a compound database was established by core hopping of rosiglitazone, which was then docked into a PPARα/γ/δ active site to screen out a number of candidate compounds with a higher docking score and better interaction with the active site. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction was done to give eight compounds. Molecular dynamics simulation of the representative Cpd#1 showed more favorable binding conformation for PPARs receptor than the original ligand. Cpd#1 could act as a PPARα/γ/δ pan agonist for novel antidiabetic drug research.","Wang, Xue-Jiao; Zhang, Jun; Wang, Shu-Qing; Xu, Wei-Ren; Cheng, Xian-Chao; Wang, Run-Ling",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232041/,31
1864,Apolipoprotein D Transgenic Mice Develop Hepatic Steatosis through Activation of PPARγ and Fatty Acid Uptake,2015-06-17,"Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.","Labrie, Marilyne; Lalonde, Simon; Najyb, Ouafa; Thiery, Maxime; Daneault, Caroline; Des Rosiers, Chrisitne; Rassart, Eric; Mounier, Catherine",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470830/,31
1950,Early real-time estimation of the basic reproduction number of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in a community with heterogeneous contact pattern: Using data from Hong Kong 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza as an illustrative example,2015-09-15,"Emerging and re-emerging infections such as SARS (2003) and pandemic H1N1 (2009) have caused concern for public health researchers and policy makers due to the increased burden of these diseases on health care systems. This concern has prompted the use of mathematical models to evaluate strategies to control disease spread, making these models invaluable tools to identify optimal intervention strategies. A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R(0.) Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R(0) from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R(0) under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R(0) than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R(0) and age-specific R(0).","Kwok, Kin On; Davoudi, Bahman; Riley, Steven; Pourbohloul, Babak",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4570805/,31
2060,Expression of arginase I and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes of HIV-positive patients,2015-11-23,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV-infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence-based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I(+) CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4(+) T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4(+) T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV.","ZHANG, NAICHUN; DENG, JIANNING; WU, FENGYAO; LU, XIANGCHAN; HUANG, LEI; ZHAO, MIN",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4686052/,31

However, a possible negative impact of CPB on internal organs such as brain, kidney, lung and liver cannot be neglected. In general, CPB initiates a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) which is presumably caused by contact of blood components with the surface of CPB tubing. Moreover, during CPB the heart typically undergoes a period of cold ischemia, and the other peripheral organs a global low flow hypoperfusion. As a result, a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines is released activating different biochemical pathways, which finally may result in the occurrence of microthrombosis, microemboli, in depletion of coagulation factors and haemorrhagic diathesis besides typical ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In our review we will focus on possible pharmacological interventions in patients to decrease negative effects of CPB and to improve post-operative outcome with regard to heart and other organs like brain, kidney, or lung.","Salameh, Aida; Dhein, Stefan",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4686733/,31

In this study, an in-depth analysis of the miRNomes in mock- and virus-infected pig lungs was carried out. We found that highly expressed ssc-miR-30d-R_1 was decreased in infected lungs, and reduced levels were significantly correlated with infection by PRRSV. Moreover, ssc-miR-30d-R_1 was shown to target Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and to suppress the production of immune cytokines through inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. ssc-miR-30d-R_1 significantly reduced viral infections and pathological changes in pig lungs in vivo.

2254,Para-Phenylenediamine Induces Apoptotic Death of Melanoma Cells and Reduces Melanoma Tumour Growth in Mice,2016-05-17,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, usually resistant to standard chemotherapeutics. Despite a huge number of clinical trials, any success to find a chemotherapeutic agent that can effectively destroy melanoma is yet to be achieved. Para-phenylenediamine (p-PD) in the hair dyes is reported to purely serve as an external dyeing agent. Very little is known about whether p-PD has any effect on the melanin producing cells. We have demonstrated p-PD mediated apoptotic death of both human and mouse melanoma cells in vitro. Mouse melanoma tumour growth was also arrested by the apoptotic activity of intraperitoneal administration of p-PD with almost no side effects. This apoptosis is shown to occur primarily via loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caspase 8 activation. p-PD mediated apoptosis was also confirmed by the increase in sub-G0/G1 cell number. Thus, our experimental observation suggests that p-PD can be a potential less expensive candidate to be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma.","Bhowmick, Debajit; Bhar, Kaushik; Mallick, Sanjaya K.; Das, Subhadip; Chatterjee, Nabanita; Sarkar, Tuhin Subhra; Chakrabarti, Rajarshi; Das Saha, Krishna; Siddhanta, Anirban",Biochem Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886052/,31

Thus, the prevention/inhibition of AD may require vaccine/s targeting Aβ and tau simultaneously or sequentially. Since high antibody titers are required for AD vaccine efficacy, we have decided to generate vaccines, targeting Aβ (AV-1959R), Tau (AV-1980R) or Aβ/tau (AV-1953R) B cell epitopes, based on immunogenic MultiTEP platform and evaluate the immunogenicity of these vaccines formulated with Advax(CpG), delta inulin, Alhydrogel(®), Montanide-ISA51, Montanide-ISA720, MPLA-SM pharmaceutical grade adjuvants. Formulation of AV-1959R in Advax(CpG) induced the highest cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. The dual-epitope vaccine, AV-1953R, or the combination of AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines formulated with Advax(CpG) induced robust antibody responses against various forms of both, Aβ and tau pathological molecules. While anti-Aβ antibody titers after AV-1953R immunization were similar to that in mice vaccinated with AV-1959R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination, anti-tau titers were significantly lower after AV-1953R injection when compared to the AV-1980R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R. In silico 3D-modeling provided insight into the differences in immunogenicity of these vaccine constructs.

2532,"Coherence of Influenza Surveillance Data across Different Sources and Age Groups, Beijing, China, 2008-2015",2016-12-30,"Influenza is active during the winter and spring in the city of Beijing, which has a typical temperate climate with four clear distinct seasons. The clinical and laboratory surveillance data for influenza have been used to construct critical indicators for influenza activities in the community, and previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens and outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in subtropical cities. However, few studies have reported on this issue for cities in temperate regions, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the mechanism behind age-specific seasonal epidemics remains unresolved, although it has been widely discussed. We utilized a wavelet analysis method to monitor the coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens with the weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in Beijing, China. We first examined the seasonal pattern of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09) and influenza B separately within the period from 2008–2015; then, we detected the coherence of clinical and laboratory surveillance data in this district, specially examining weekly time series of age-specific epidemics of influenza-like illnesses in the whole study period for three age categories (age 0–5, 5–15 and 25–60). We found that influenza A and B were both active in winter but were not always seasonally synchronous in Beijing. Synchronization between age ranges was found in most epidemic peaks from 2008–2015. Our findings suggested that peaks of influenza-like illness in individuals aged 0–5 and 5–15 years consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations.","Wu, Zhenyu; Sun, Xiaoyu; Chu, Yanhui; Sun, Jingyi; Qin, Guoyou; Yang, Lin; Qin, Jingning; Xiao, Zheng; Ren, Jian; Qin, Di; Wang, Xiling; Zheng, Xueying",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5201231/,31
2534,Tight junctions in pulmonary epithelia during lung inflammation,2016-12-05,"Inflammatory lung diseases like asthma bronchiale, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allergic airway inflammation are widespread public diseases that constitute an enormous burden to the health systems. Mainly classified as inflammatory diseases, the treatment focuses on strategies interfering with local inflammatory responses by the immune system. Inflammatory lung diseases predispose patients to severe lung failures like alveolar oedema, respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. These life-threatening syndromes are caused by increased permeability of the alveolar and airway epithelium and exudate formation. However, the mechanism underlying epithelium barrier breakdown in the lung during inflammation is elusive. This review emphasises the role of the tight junction of the airway epithelium as the predominating structure conferring epithelial tightness and preventing exudate formation and the impact of inflammatory perturbations on their function.","Wittekindt, Oliver H.",Pflugers Arch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5203840/,31
2538,Versatility of Approximating Single-Particle Electron Microscopy Density Maps Using Pseudoatoms and Approximation-Accuracy Control,2016-12-21,"Three-dimensional Gaussian functions have been shown useful in representing electron microscopy (EM) density maps for studying macromolecular structure and dynamics. Methods that require setting a desired number of Gaussian functions or a maximum number of iterations may result in suboptimal representations of the structure. An alternative is to set a desired error of approximation of the given EM map and then optimize the number of Gaussian functions to achieve this approximation error. In this article, we review different applications of such an approach that uses spherical Gaussian functions of fixed standard deviation, referred to as pseudoatoms. Some of these applications use EM-map normal mode analysis (NMA) with elastic network model (ENM) (applications such as predicting conformational changes of macromolecular complexes or exploring actual conformational changes by normal-mode-based analysis of experimental data) while some other do not use NMA (denoising of EM density maps). In applications based on NMA and ENM, the advantage of using pseudoatoms in EM-map coarse-grain models is that the ENM springs are easily assigned among neighboring grains thanks to their spherical shape and uniformed size. EM-map denoising based on the map coarse-graining was so far only shown using pseudoatoms as grains.","Jonić, Slavica; Sorzano, Carlos Oscar S.",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209604/,31
2760,A large-scale behavior change intervention to prevent Nipah transmission in Bangladesh: components and costs,2017-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Nipah virus infection (NiV) is a bat-borne zoonosis transmitted to humans through consumption of NiV-contaminated raw date palm sap in Bangladesh. The objective of this analysis was to measure the cost of an NiV prevention intervention and estimate the cost of scaling it up to districts where spillover had been identified. METHODS: We implemented a behavior change communication intervention in two districts, testing different approaches to reduce the risk of NiV transmission using community mobilization, interpersonal communication, posters and TV public service announcements on local television during the 2012–2014 sap harvesting seasons. In one district, we implemented a “no raw sap” approach recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap. In another district, we implemented an “only safe sap” approach, recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap but offering the option of drinking safe sap. This is sap covered with a barrier, locally called bana, to interrupt bats’ access during collection. We conducted surveys among randomly selected respondents two months after the intervention to measure the proportion of people reached. We used an activity-based costing method to calculate the cost of the intervention. RESULTS: The implementation cost of the “no raw sap” intervention was $30,000 and the “only safe sap” intervention was $55,000. The highest cost was conducting meetings and interpersonal communication efforts. The lowest cost was broadcasting the public service announcements on local TV channels. To scale up a similar intervention in 30 districts where NiV spillover has occurred, would cost between $2.6 and $3.5 million for one season. Placing the posters would cost $96,000 and only broadcasting the public service announcement through local channels in 30 districts would cost $26,000. CONCLUSIONS: Broadcasting a TV public service announcement is a potential low cost option to advance NiV prevention. It could be supplemented with posters and targeted interpersonal communication, in districts with a high risk of NiV spillover.

2830,Purinergic signalling links mechanical breath profile and alveolar mechanics with the pro-inflammatory innate immune response causing ventilation-induced lung injury,2017-05-26,"Severe pulmonary infection or vigorous cyclic deformation of the alveolar epithelial type I (AT I) cells by mechanical ventilation leads to massive extracellular ATP release. High levels of extracellular ATP saturate the ATP hydrolysis enzymes CD39 and CD73 resulting in persistent high ATP levels despite the conversion to adenosine. Above a certain level, extracellular ATP molecules act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and activate the pro-inflammatory response of the innate immunity through purinergic receptors on the surface of the immune cells. This results in lung tissue inflammation, capillary leakage, interstitial and alveolar oedema and lung injury reducing the production of surfactant by the damaged AT II cells and deactivating the surfactant function by the concomitant extravasated serum proteins through capillary leakage followed by a substantial increase in alveolar surface tension and alveolar collapse. The resulting inhomogeneous ventilation of the lungs is an important mechanism in the development of ventilation-induced lung injury. The high levels of extracellular ATP and the upregulation of ecto-enzymes and soluble enzymes that hydrolyse ATP to adenosine (CD39 and CD73) increase the extracellular adenosine levels that inhibit the innate and adaptive immune responses rendering the host susceptible to infection by invading microorganisms. Moreover, high levels of extracellular adenosine increase the expression, the production and the activation of pro-fibrotic proteins (such as TGF-β, α-SMA, etc.) followed by the establishment of lung fibrosis.

2908,Mir-21 Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of Ang (1–7) on AngII-induced NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts,2017-10-30,"MicroRNA-21 (mir-21) induced by angiotensin II (AngII) plays a vital role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is known to be involved in fibrogenesis. However, whether there is a link between mir-21 and the NLRP3 inflammasome in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin(1–7) [ACE2/Ang(1–7)] has been shown to attenuate AngII-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but it is not clear whether ACE2/Ang(1–7) protects against pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting AngII-induced mir-21 expression. This study’s aim was to investigate whether mir-21 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and mediates the different effects of AngII and ACE2/Ang(1–7) on lung fibroblast apoptosis and collagen synthesis. In vivo, AngII exacerbated bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in rats, and elevated mir-21 and the NLRP3 inflammasome. In contrast, ACE2/Ang(1–7) attenuated BLM-induced lung fibrosis, and decreased mir-21 and the NLRP3 inflammasome. In vitro, AngII activated the NLRP3 inflammasome by up-regulating mir-21, and ACE2/Ang(1–7) inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulating AngII-induced mir-21. Over-expression of mir-21 activated the NLRP3 inflammasome via the ERK/NF-κB pathway by targeting Spry1, resulting in apoptosis resistance and collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts. These results indicate that mir-21 mediates the inhibitory effect of ACE2/Ang(1–7) on AngII-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts.","Sun, Na-Na; Yu, Chang-Hui; Pan, Miao-Xia; Zhang, Yue; Zheng, Bo-Jun; Yang, Qian-Jie; Zheng, Ze-Mao; Meng, Ying",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662719/,31
2978,Combination treatment with quercetin and resveratrol attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity and associated inflammation in rats via the AMPKα1/SIRT1 signaling pathway,2017-10-18,"Diet-induced obesity is associated with systemic inflammation, which is considered to originate predominantly from the adipose tissue. Quercetin and resveratrol are two dietary polyphenols that exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and anti-insulin resistance when administered in isolation or combination (CQR). It remains unknown whether CQR reduces high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and inflammation in rats. In the current study, 46 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (ND, 5.4% fat, w/w) and one of which was fed a HFD (45% fat, w/w) for 3 weeks. Following removal of the 12 most obesity-resistant rats from the HFD group, the remaining rats were divided into two sub-groups: A HFD group and a HFD+CQR group (administered 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin). The results revealed that the HFD+CQR group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the HFD group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes. Serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the HFD+CQR group. CQR attenuated the expression of systemic proinflammatory adipokines, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6. It also reduced the recruitment of mast cells to the epididyotic adipose tissue (EAT). Furthermore, CQR reversed the HFD-induced suppression of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in EAT. In conclusion, CQR may suppress obesity and associated inflammation via the AMPKα1/SIRT1 signaling pathway in rats fed a HFD.","Zhao, Le; Cen, Fang; Tian, Feng; Li, Min-Jie; Zhang, Qi; Shen, Hong-Yi; Shen, Xiang-Chun; Zhou, Ming-Mei; Du, Jun",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740593/,31
3191,Synthesis and In vitro Leishmanicidal Activities of Six Quercetin Derivatives,2018-04-24,"BACKGROUND: Today, leishmaniasis is a widespread, infectious parasitic disease caused by Leishmania spp. Natural-derived compounds are likely to provide a valuable source of new pharmaceuticals, and among them, quercetin derivatives may have antileishmanial effects. The antileishmanial activity of 3,5,7,3’,4’-pentahydroxyflavonol (quercetin) derivatives is partly attributed to the position and pKa of phenolic or catechol hydroxyl groups. Therefore, to optimize their leishmanicidal effect, the structural features of quercetin and its derivatives were improved by acylation or alkylation of hydroxyl groups and changing their pKa and consequently their activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, during a regioselective method, quercetin derivatives were synthesized. The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by mass, IR, (1)H-, and (13)C-NMR spectral data. The antileishmanial activities of compounds 1–6 were compared with glucantime as the standard drug against promastigotes of Leishmania major using standard cell-based leishmanicidal assay. RESULTS: In this study, during a regioselective method, two 7-O-quercetin derivatives (5 and 6), and three quercetin acetate derivatives (2, 3, and 4) were synthesized. In detail, the IC(50) values found against L. major were (1) 2.5 ± 0.92; (2) 2.85 ± 0.99; (3) 15.5 ± 1.95; (4) 13.5 ± 3.5; (5) 2.6 ± 0.57; and (6) 1.3 ± 0.35 μM while IC(50) value of glucantime as the standard drug was 88.5 ± 9.47 μM. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed an effective antileishmanial activity of quercetin semisynthetic compounds (1–6) against in vitro promastigotes of L. major. Among them, quercetin analogs with more lipophilic and iron-chelating activity showed more antiparasite activity.","Mohajeri, Maryam; Saghaei, Lotfollah; Ghanadian, Mustafa; Saberi, Sedighe; Pestechian, Nader; Ostadhusseini, Ehsan",Adv Biomed Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5952540/,31

The pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds oleanolic acid (OA) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) are distributed widely in nature. METHODS: In this study, various oleanolic acids and glycyrrhetinic acids were designed and synthesized by using the combination principle. The in vitro anticancer activities of new OA and GA derivatives were tested by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method with SGC-7901 (gastric cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), Eca-109 (esophageal cancer), HeLa (cervical cancer), Hep-G2 (hepatoma cancer) and HSF (normal human skin fibroblast) cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The screening results showed that the compound 3m presented the highest inhibitory activities against SGC-7901, MCF-7 and Eca-109 cell lines with IC(50) values of 7.57±0.64 μM, 5.51±0.41 μM and 5.03±0.56 μM, respectively. In addition, this compound also showed effective inhibition of Hep-G2 cells with an IC(50) value of 4.11±0.73 μM. Moreover, compound 5b showed the strongest inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells with an IC(50) value of 3.74±0.18 μM and compound 3l showed strong selective inhibition of the HeLa cells with the lowest IC(50) value of 4.32±0.89 μM. A series of pharmacology experiments indicated that compound 5b could induce Hep-G2 cells autophagy and apoptosis. These compounds will expand the structural diversity of anti-cancer targets and confirm the prospects for further research.","Wang, Rui; Li, Yang; Huai, Xu-Dong; Zheng, Qing-Xuan; Wang, Wei; Li, Hui-Jing; Huai, Qi-Yong",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968802/,31
3332,Adapted HCV JFH1 variant is capable of accommodating a large foreign gene insert and allows lower level HCV replication and viral production,2018-07-13,"Infectious HCV carrying reporter genes have further applications in understanding the HCV life cycle including replication, viral assembly and release. In this study, a full-length 3039bp LacZ gene was inserted into the derivative of JFH1-AM120 to develop an additional reporter virus. The results showed that the recombinant reporter virus JFH1-AM120-LacZ can replicate and produce lower titers of infectious virus. However, insertion of the LacZ gene in the C-terminal region of the NS5A in HCV JFH1-AM120-LacZ decreased viral replication and dramatically impaired the production of infectious viral particles. Moreover, the JFH1-AM120-LacZ reporter virus lost the LacZ gene after serial passage. Nevertheless, the JFH1-AM120-LacZ reporter virus displayed the entire life cycle of HCV, from replication to production of infectious virus, in Huh7.5 cells. This study demonstrates that the NS5A region of HCV JFH1-AM120 has the capacity to accommodate large foreign genes up to 3,039 bp and suggests that other relatively large gene inserts can be accommodated at this site.","Wang, Qi; Hagedorn, Curt; Liu, Shuanghu",Int J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097470/,31

Due to its toxic effects, the recommended maximum daily intake of OTA for poultry feeds is 0.1 mg OTA/kg (ECR2006/575/EC); this dose does not induce changes in hepatic/renal parameters, but decreases thymus size and serum globulin concentrations. Accordingly, in this study, we assessed quantitatively the total circulating IgY and IgA serum levels, in chicks consuming a 0.1 mg OTA/kg diet (limit) and higher doses (0.3–1.1 mg OTA/kg diet) for 14 or 21 days. We also evaluated other immunological parameters (thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and spleen weights and leukocyte profiles) at day 21. Decreased IgY serum levels were observed in all OTA-treated groups (p < 0.05). In the low-dose group, IgA levels were decreased on day 21, but not on day 14. The size of the thymus and the bursa of Fabricius was decreased in all OTA-treated groups (p < 0.05), whereas reduced spleen size and altered leukocyte profiles were detected only in the high-dose group (p < 0.05). We concluded that chronic exposure to OTA, even at the recommended highest dose, affected IgY and IgA production in chicks.","Khan, Shahzad A.; Venancio, Emerson J.; Fernandes, Eduardo V.; Hirooka, Elisa Y.; Oba, Alexandre; Flaiban, Karina K.

Objectives: Due to the lack of pharmacological studies on this herbal medicine, we explored the inhibitory activity of torilidis fructus on the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response using its ethanol extract (Tf-EE). Material and methods: The Griess assay and prostaglandin (PGE(2)) ELISA assay were conducted with Tf-EE (0-75 µg/mL) and LPS (1 µg/mL) treated RAW264.7 cells in cultured media. Tf-EE pretreated RAW264.7 cells were incubated with LPS for 6 h and semi-quantitative PCR was performed. Reporter gene assays, overexpression of target enzymes and immunoblotting were performed on macrophages to determine the molecular targets of Tf-EE. Results: Tf-EE markedly suppressed the inflammatory response of macrophages, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and PGE(2) production with IC(50) values of 35.66 and 62.47 µg/mL, respectively. It was also found that Tf-EE reduced the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by 80%. Nuclear translocation and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and p50) were declined by 60% and 30% respectively, and their regulatory events including the phosphorylation of AKT, IκBα, Src, and the formation of complexes between Src and p-p85 were also recognized to be diminished. Conclusions: The signalling events managed by Src and p85 complex seemed to be critically involved in Tf-EE-mediated anti-inflammatory response. This might suggest that Tf-EE exhibited anti-inflammatory effects through Src-targeted inhibition of NF-κB.","Park, Gyubyung; Kim, Eunji; Son, Young-Jin; Yoon, Deok Hyo; Sung, Gi-Ho; Aravinthan, Adithan; Park, Yung Chul; Kim, Jong-Hoon; Cho, Jae Youl",Pharm Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130681/,31

Blockade of the CEACAM1 signaling pathway has recently been implicated as a novel mechanism for cancer immunotherapy. CC1, a mouse anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), has been widely used as a pharmacological tool in preclinical studies to inform on CEACAM1 pathway biology although limited data are available on its CEACAM1 blocking characteristics or pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic profiles. We sought to investigate CEACAM1 expression on mouse tumor and immune cells, characterize CC1 mAb binding, and evaluate CC1 in syngeneic mouse oncology models as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb. CEACAM1 expression was observed at high levels on neutrophils, NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while the expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was low. Unexpectedly, rather than blocking, CC1 facilitated binding of soluble CEACAM1 to CEACAM1 expressing cells. No anti-tumor effects were observed in CT26, MBT2 or A20 models when tested up to 30 mg/kg dose, a dose that was estimated to achieve >90% target engagement in vivo.

Cancer cells activate chemoresistant pathways and lead to therapeutic failure for patients with TNBC. Several kinases have been identified as chemoresistant genes. However, the involvement of kinases in the chemoresistance in TNBC cells is not fully understood. Methods: We employed a kinome siRNA library to screen whether targeting any kinases could increase the chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines. The effects of kinase on cell viability in various breast cancer cells were validated with ATP level and colony formation. Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was collected to analyze the correlation of Src expression with prognosis of TNBC patients. Results: Primary screening and validation for the initial hits showed that Src kinase was a potential doxorubicin-resistant kinase in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. Both siRNA against Src and the Src inhibitor dasatinib enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream effectors of Src, were accordingly decreased in Src-silenced or -inhibited TNBC cells. Additionally, TCGA data analysis indicated that Src expression levels in tumor tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was also significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients. Conclusion: Our results showed that Src-STAT3 axis might be involved in chemoresistance of TNBC cells.","Tzeng, Yen-Dun Tony; Liu, Pei-Feng; Li, Ju-Yueh; Liu, Li-Feng; Kuo, Soong-Yu; Hsieh, Chiao-Wei; Lee, Cheng-Hsin; Wu, Chih-Hsuan; Hsiao, Michael; Chang, Hong-Tai; Shu, Chih-Wen",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238227/,31
3611,SOX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,2018-12-07,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human skin cancer, which is driven by the aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","Li, Zhuo-Ran; Jiang, Yong; Hu, Jian-Zhong; Chen, Yang; Liu, Quan-Zhong",Oncol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341784/,31

In the authors' previous studies, the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) was confirmed to exert a function in distraction osteogenesis (DO) during the healing of a condylar fracture, which resulted in the formation of excess bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the expression of any associated genes via an Affymetrix GeneChip method. The traumatic TMJA model was fabricated by a condylar fracture in the TMJ area of sheep with either a dissected LPM (LPD) or normal (LPN). The untreated sheep served as a control. At 4- and 12 weeks post-surgery, the condylar zone was isolated to perform the gene chip analysis, which was performed according to a standard Affymetrix protocol. The validated genes were further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The gene chip analysis indicated that the LPN gene expression pattern was similar compared with the DO process, while LPD was similar to that of normal bone fracture healing. The validated genes were collagen type II α1 chain, C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, interleukin 1A, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, chondromodulin (LECT1), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)7, among which, BMP7, LECT1, CALCR and FOS were confirmed by RT-qPCR.

3851,Clinical characteristics of liver failure with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,2019-05-31,"Liver failure with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening syndrome with high mortality. The aim of this study was to decipher clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after definite diagnosis of liver failure and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of HLH in patients with liver failure. Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH. The average interval from the earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days. Six (54.55%) patients died during follow-up. For patients with liver failure after admission and subsequently definitively diagnosed with HLH, bilirubin and INR were significantly decreased. HLH is definitely diagnosed at an intermediate or late stage when patients have already suffered from liver failure. The initial dose of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) was decreased to 1–1.5 mg/kg/d and gradually reduced thereafter. In conclusion, for patients with liver failure, HLH should be screened as early as possible upon persistent fever, splenomegaly and unexplained pancytopenia. For patients with liver failure and HLH, the dosage of glucocorticoid should be reduced to avoid serious side effects.","Dong, Jinling; Xie, Fang; Jia, Lin; Li, Juan; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhu, Yueke; Yu, Hongwei; Zhao, Yujuan; Yao, Qinwei; Meng, Qinghua",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544643/,31

4086,Interaction of a Densovirus with Glycans of the Peritrophic Matrix Mediates Oral Infection of the Lepidopteran Pest Spodoptera frugiperda,2019-09-17,"The success of oral infection by viruses depends on their capacity to overcome the gut epithelial barrier of their host to crossing over apical, mucous extracellular matrices. As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect gut barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut epithelium; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest Spodoptera frugiperda. Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall gut function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the gut barrier in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.","Pigeyre, Laetitia; Schatz, Malvina; Ravallec, Marc; Gasmi, Leila; Nègre, Nicolas; Clouet, Cécile; Seveno, Martial; El Koulali, Khadija; Decourcelle, Mathilde; Guerardel, Yann; Cot, Didier; Dupressoir, Thierry; Gosselin-Grenet, Anne-Sophie; Ogliastro, Mylène",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6783882/,31
4094,CD206(+) tumor-associated macrophages promote proliferation and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma via EGF production,2019-10-10,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor progression and inhibit anti-tumor immune response by producing various mediators and preferentially express CD163, CD204, and CD206. However, the role of these TAM subsets in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. Here we investigated the expression and function of TAM subsets in OSCC, especially in cancer cell proliferation. Biopsy sample from 44 patients with OSCC were examined for the expression of TAM markers and EGF by immunohistochemistry. EGF production of TAM subsets isolated from OSCC patients was assessed by flow cytometry. We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from TAM subsets on the proliferation of OSCC cells. CD163(+) cells were detected diffusely all over the tumor and connective tissue area, while CD204(+) and CD206(+) cells were mainly detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis found that CD206(+) TAMs strongly produced EGF compared with CD163(+) and CD204(+) TAMs. Cell proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells cultured with conditioned medium of CD206(+) TAMs were strongly enhanced and inhibited by anti-EGFR. The number of CD206(+) TAMs positively correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Our results revealed differences in localization and EGF production among these TAM subsets. CD206(+) TAMs might play a critical role in the proliferation of OSCC via EGF production.","Haque, A. S. M.

4240,Roles of transforming growth factor-β and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoforms in integrin β1-mediated bio-behaviors of mouse lung telocytes,2019-12-30,"BACKGROUND: Telocytes (TCs) have the capacity of cell–cell communication with adjacent cells within the tissue, contributing to tissue repair and recovery from injury. The present study aims at investigating the molecular mechanisms by which the TGFβ1-ITGB1-PI3K signal pathways regulate TC cycle and proliferation. METHODS: Gene expression of integrin (ITG) family were measured in mouse primary TCs to compare with other cells. TC proliferation, movement, cell cycle, and PI3K isoform protein genes were assayed in ITGB1-negative or positive mouse lung TCs treated with the inhibition of PI3Kp110α, PI3Kα/δ, PKCβ, or GSK3, followed by TGFβ1 treatment. RESULTS: We found the characters and interactions of ITG or PKC family member networks in primary mouse lung TCs, different from other cells in the lung tissue. The deletion of ITGB1 changed TCs sensitivity to treatment with multifunctional cytokines or signal pathway inhibitors. The compensatory mechanisms occur among TGFβ1-induced PI3Kp110α, PI3Kα/δ, PKCβ, or GSK3 when ITGB1 gene was deleted, leading to alterations of TC cell cycle and proliferation. Of those PI3K isoform protein genes, mRNA expression of PIK3CG altered with ITGB1-negative TC cycle and proliferation. CONCLUSION: TCs have strong capacity of proliferation through the compensatory signaling mechanisms and contribute to the development of drug resistance due to alterations of TC sensitivity.","Song, Dongli; Tang, Li; Huang, Jianan; Wang, Lu; Zeng, Tao; Wang, Xiangdong",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936066/,31

Longitudinal lung function assessments were performed at approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Perinatal characteristics were further analyzed to ascertain the determinants of lung function indexes. Although all preterm infants (n = 121; 61 without BPD and 60 with BPD) exhibited decreased lung function in early infancy (6 months of age), after body length was adjusted for, only infants with BPD exhibited poor performance. Furthermore, the lung function of infants with mild to moderate BPD caught up gradually, but the generally poor lung function performance of infants with severe BPD, especially in forced expiratory flow, persisted until later age (24 months). Regarding perinatal characteristics, the z-score of body length at the time of examination and total number of days on positive-pressure ventilation are the major determinants of lung function in later infancy.","Lai, Shen-Hao; Chiang, Ming-Chou; Chu, Shih-Ming; Hsu, Jen-Fu; Yao, Tsung-Chieh; Tsai, Ming-Han; Hua, Man-Chin; Chiu, Chih-Yung; Yeh, Kuo-Wei; Huang, Jing-Long; Liao, Sui-Ling",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965604/,31
4425,Vaccination with virosomally formulated recombinant CyRPA elicits protective antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum parasites in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models,2020-01-31,"The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) cysteine-rich protective antigen (PfCyRPA) has emerged as a promising blood-stage candidate antigen for inclusion into a broadly cross-reactive malaria vaccine. This highly conserved protein among various geographical strains plays a key role in the red blood cell invasion process by P. falciparum merozoites, and antibodies against PfCyRPA can efficiently prevent the entry of the malaria parasites into red blood cells. The aim of the present study was to develop a human-compatible formulation of the PfCyRPA vaccine candidate and confirming its activity in preclinical studies. Recombinant PfCyRPA expressed in HEK 293 cells was chemically coupled to phosphoethanolamine and then incorporated into the membrane of unadjuvanted influenza virosomes approved as antigen delivery system for humans. Laboratory animals were immunised with the virosome-based PfCyRPA vaccine to determine its immunogenic properties and in particular, its capacity to elicit parasite binding and growth-inhibitory antibodies. The vaccine elicited in mice and rabbits high titers of PfCyRPA-specific antibodies that bound to the blood-stage parasites. At a concentration of 10 mg/mL, purified total serum IgG from immunised rabbits inhibited parasite growth in vitro by about 80%. Furthermore, in a P. falciparum infection mouse model, passive transfer of 10 mg of purified total IgG from PfCyRPA vaccinated rabbits reduced the in vivo parasite load by 77%. Influenza virosomes thus represent a suitable antigen delivery system for the induction of protective antibodies against the recombinant PfCyRPA, designating it as a highly suitable component for inclusion into a multivalent and multi-stage virosomal malaria vaccine.","Tamborrini, Marco; Hauser, Julia; Schäfer, Anja; Amacker, Mario; Favuzza, Paola; Kyungtak, Kwak; Fleury, Sylvain; Pluschke, Gerd",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6994490/,31

This study aimed to exploratively develop a standardized preparedness system to use during unfolding threats of severe infectious diseases. METHODS: A qualitative three-step study among infectious disease prevention and control experts was performed. First, interviews (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat. Second, these triggers informed the design of a phased preparedness system which was tested in a focus group discussion (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat. Second, these triggers informed the design of a phased preparedness system which was tested in a focus group discussion (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat. Second, these triggers informed the design of a phased preparedness system which was tested in a focus group discussion ( RESULTS: Four preparedness phases were identified: preparedness phase green is a situation without the presence of the infectious disease threat that requires centralized care, anywhere in the world. Phase yellow is an outbreak in the world with some likelihood of imported cases. Phase orange is a realistic chance of an unexpected case within the country, or unrest developing among population or staff; phase red is cases admitted to hospitals in the country, potentially causing a shortage of resources. Specific preparedness activities included infection prevention, diagnostics, patient care, staff, and communication. Consensus was reached on the need for the development of a preparedness system and national coordination during threats. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a standardized system to support institutional preparedness during an increasing threat. Use of this system by both curative healthcare institutions and the (municipal) public health service, could help to effectively communicate and align preparedness activities during future threats of severe infectious diseases.","de Rooij, Doret; Belfroid, Evelien; Eilers, Renske; Roßkamp, Dorothee; Swaan, Corien; Timen, Aura",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998699/,31

The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related clinical manifestations of adverse events (AEs) related to NAIs. FAERS and WebMD data were downloaded. The available NAIs selected for the analysis were oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the information component (IC) methods. In total, 16729 AEs from 4598 patients and 575 AEs from 440 patients in the FAERS and WebMD, respectively, were included in the analysis. In the FAERS, AEs were more common among those who were younger (<19 years) for zanamivir, while for those who were older (>65 years) for peramivir. A disproportionality analysis showed that signals for vomiting and hallucinations were detected in younger patients given oseltamivir, while an abnormal hepatic function, cardiac failure, shock, and cardio-respiratory arrest were detected in older patients given peramivir. Psychiatric disorders were most common in younger and older patients, while gastrointestinal disorders were most common in adult given oseltamivir in the WebMD. Adverse symptoms related to NAIs varied and depended on the drugs used and the age of the patient.","Han, Nayoung; Oh, Jung Mi; Kim, In-Wha",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033147/,31

METHODS: Adult patients with septic shock underwent volume mechanical ventilation between October 2015 and October 2016. RR was started at 10 breaths/min, and 2 breaths/min were added every 60 min until 16 breaths/min was reached. At every point, central venous and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: In this study, gapCO(2) induced by hyperventilation significantly increased, while the central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO(2)) and the partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) in arteries decreased. The decreasing trend of the PaCO(2) was more obvious than that of the PvCO(2). HCO(3)(−) and ctCO(2) were markedly decreased, when the RR was increased (P < 0.05). Central venous oxygen saturation (S(cv)O(2)) had a decreasing trend between 14 (77.1 ± 8.3%) and 16 (75.2 ± 8.7%) breaths/min; however, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients undergoing ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation caused an increase in the gapCO(2). Clinicians should cautiously interpret the gapCO(2) in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients and its relationship with low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion.","Guo, Zhixiang; Wang, Yapeng; Xie, Chao; Hua, Guofang; Ge, Shenglin; Li, Yuedong",Eur J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076974/,31

O’Neill used the large context of space travel with his undergraduate physics students. A Canadian physics teacher, Art Stinner, independently arrived at a similar notion in a more limited but, therefore, more generally useful sense, which he referred to as the “large context problem” approach. At a slightly earlier time the large context problem type of approach had already been used in the study of medicine, pioneered by McMaster Medical School. And the Faculty of Education at the University of Calgary currently uses a large context problem method to deliver its entire curriculum. These approaches are four distinct ways of presenting large context problems to students. This paper will discuss these approaches historically, look at their grounds and their applications, weigh their successes and characterize their limitations. It will try to see what they take most deeply for granted as viable approaches to teaching science, both theoretical and applied. Finally, it will relate these approaches to the constructivist prejudices of our own time, suggesting their relation to earlier forms of philosophical idealism.","Winchester, Ian",Interchange (Tor : 1984),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088099/,31

Methods: Through an Internet panel 579 respondents filled in an online questionnaire. Results. Risk perception of avian influenza in the Netherlands is, especially in case of an outbreak, high, 3,51 (scale 1 – 5). 23,7% of respondents believe that protection against avian influenza is possible, while 28,2% feel that they are able to protect oneself. A higher level of response and self efficacy is related to a lower level of risk perception.

According to UNOS, as of 8/2009, there were 102,962 patients on the transplant waiting list and only 6,004 donors in 2009 (UNOS.org. Accessed 4/8/2009). In 2008, an estimated 17 patients died each day awaiting transplant (OPTN.org). Though currently most organ donations come after brain death (DND or donation after neurological death), tissue donation (cornea, skin, bone, and musculoskeletal tissue), and donation after cardiac death (DCD) and are also possible. The term “extended criteria donor” refers to potential donors over 60 years of age or age 50–59 years plus 2 of the 3 following criteria: stroke as the cause of death, creatnine > 1.5 meq/dl, or a history of hypertension. Historically, extended criteria donors have had a lower organ yield per donor. In order to preserve the choice of organ donation for the family, intensive management of the potential organ donor is necessary. Since each potential donor could save seven lives or more, nihilism in the care of such patients can have far reaching ramifications.

5572,Minimal hepatic toxicity of Onyx-015: spatial restriction of coxsackie-adenoviral receptor in normal liver,2006-12-01,"Recombinant adenoviruses are currently the most important vector system in gene therapy. Adenoviruses frequently cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans and anti-adenoviral antibodies are found in 35–70% of the population. Therefore in the majority of potential patients receiving adenoviral gene therapy, the contact of virus particles and blood will lead to the formation of antigen–antibody complexes. These complexes have the ability to induce inflammatory reactions via an activation of the complement system. We have determined the level of C3a (the most reactive complement component) generated in isolated citrate plasma of healthy individuals after challenge with recombinant and wild-type adenoviruses in amounts corresponding to virus blood levels to be expected in patients during adenoviral gene therapy. All plasma samples containing anti-adenoviral antibodies showed a substantial, dose-dependent generation of C3a. A virus plasma level of about 7.5 × 10(9) particles/ml (which was calculated to be the highest blood level reached during clinical trials in the past) induced an average release of about 3000 ng/ml C3a (baseline levels <140 ng/ml). Analyzing the nature of anti-adenoviral antibodies showed, that not only antibodies with neutralizing properties (anti-Ad5), but also non-neutralizing anti-adenoviral antibodies are capable of complement activation. This study suggests that complement activation can be ignored in local low-dose applications of recombinant adenoviruses, but warrants attention after systemic application of large viral quantities. In clinical protocols aiming at systemic virus application, measures for monitoring and controlling the complement system should be included on a regular basis.","Cichon, G; Boeckh-Herwig, S; Schmidt, HH; Wehnes, E; Müller, T; Pring-Akerblom, P; Burger, R",Gene Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091591/,31

It is postulated that IL-2 administered after ASCT may eliminate minimal residual disease and thereby reduce relapses. A phase I/II study was performed to identify a regimen of IL-2 (Chiron) that could be given early after ASCT in phase III trials. In the phase I study, beginning a median of 46 days after ASCT for hematologic malignancy, cohorts of three to four patients received escalating doses of ‘induction’ IL-2 of 9, 10, or 12 × 10(6) IU/m(2)/day for 4 or 5 days by continuous i.v. infusion (CIV), followed by a 4-day rest period, and then 1.6 × 10(6) IU/m(2)/day of maintenance IL-2 by CIV for 10 days.

There are few studies in adults assessing the incidence of RTI in patients hospitalized with acute asthma. AIM: To document the incidence of RTI in adults hospitalized with acute asthma. METHODS: A prospective study of patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Hospital Footscray, over a 12-month period. A control group was studied from elective surgical inpatients. Patients were investigated with serologic tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and influenza A and R. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were cultured for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and herpes simplex virus. If sputum was available, it was assessed with microscopy and culture. Rlood cultures were taken if patients were febrile and all patients had a chest radiograph. Control subjects completed serologic tests and NPA. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (33 male and 46 female) and 54 control subjects (26 male and 28 female) were studied. Two patients were enrolled twice. Mean (±SD) age of patients was 35 ±15 years (range, 16 to 66 years), and mean age of control subjects was 37±15 years (range, 18 to 69 years). In the patient group, 29 (37%) had evidence of recent RTI of which 23 were viral. Five of the control subjects (9%) had evidence of recent RTI (p<0.001). Twenty-four patients were positive on serologic and/or NPA culture. Five patients had positive serologic test results and/or NPA culture to two or more agents. Two patients tested positive on sputum, radiograph, and temperature criteria. Three patients tested positive on the basis of radiographic evidence of consolidation, blood neutrophilia, and temperature. Influenza A (13) and rhinovirus (9) were the most common infectious agents. Other agents identified were RSV (one), influenza R (two), adenovirus (one), and Mycoplasma (one). Influenza and rhinovirus infections occurred predominantly in late and early winter, respectively. Summer hospitalization did not relate to RTI.

6648,Adhesion molecules in lung diseases,1994,"PURPOSE: The clinical presentation, complications and mortality in molecularly confirmed influenza A and B infections were analyzed. METHODS: This retrospective observational single-centre study included all influenza positive patients older than 18 years who were hospitalized and treated at the flu isolation ward during 2017/2018. The diagnosis was based on point-of-care tests with the Alere(TM). RESULTS: Of the 396 patients tested positive for influenza, 24.2% had influenza A and 75.8% influenza B. Influenza A patients were younger (median age 67.5 years vs. 77 years, p < 0.001), were more often smokers (27.7% vs. 16.8%, p = 0.021), had chronic pulmonary diseases more frequently (39.6% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.013), presented with a higher body temperature (38.6 °C vs. 38.3 °C, p = 0.004), leucocyte count (8 G/L vs. 6.8 G/L, p = 0.002), C‑reactive protein (CRP) level (41 mg/l vs. 23 mg/l, p < 0.001) and had dyspnea more often (41.7% vs. 28%, p = 0.012). Influenza B patients had an underlying chronic kidney disease in 37% vs. 18.8% (p < 0.001) and presented with vomiting on admission more frequently (21.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.027). Influenza A patients were admitted for 8 days vs. 7 days (p = 0.023). There were no differences in the rate of complications; however, 22 (5.6%) patients died during the hospital stay. The in-hospital mortality was higher in influenza A patients (8.3% vs 4.7%, p = 0.172). CONCLUSION: Some differences were found between influenza A and B virus infections but symptoms were overlapping, which necessitates polymerase chain reaction point-of-care testing for accurate diagnosis. Influenza A was a more severe disease than influenza B during the period 2017/2018.","Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Daller, Simon; Kaczmarek, Caroline; Laferl, Hermann; Niculescu, Iulia; Schrader, Birte; Stütz, Christian; Zoufaly, Alexander; Wenisch, Christoph",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101895/,31
6735,Modulation of Airway Responsiveness to Acetylcholine by Nitric Oxide in a Rabbit Model,1997,"Cytokines play a critical role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we investigated whether IL-27 was elevated in patients with ALI/ARDS and its potential clinical significance. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples were obtained from 58 ALI/ARDS patients, and 25 control healthy volunteers. IL-27 and other inflammatory mediators were measured in BAL and serum by ELISA. Besides, a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced lung inflammation/injury was established, and serum, BAL fluid and tissues were collected for analyses in the presence or absence of IL-27 neutralizing antibodies. BAL IL-27 was found to be significantly higher in patients with ALI/ARDS than that in controls, particularly of pulmonary origin; serum IL-27 was also significantly higher. Increased IL-27 was associated with markers of inflammation, and correlated with disease severity of patients in ALI/ARDS. In a mouse model of CLP-induced lung inflammation/injury, elevated IL-27 levels were observed in the lung, serum, and BAL fluids. IL-27 neutralizing antibody treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and lung injury and improved mouse survival in response to CLP. Therefore, IL-27 is a critical cytokine in ALI/ARDS and inhibition of IL-27 may open a promising approach for ALI/ARDS patients.","Xu, Fang; Liu, Qiong; Lin, Shihui; Shen, Na; Yin, Yibing; Cao, Ju",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102048/,31
6767,Roles of Nitric Oxide in Surgical Infection and Sepsis,1998,"The relevance of nursing interventions for patients with fecal incontinence/defecation problems in intensive care medicine is very often underestimated. Fecal incontinence can either be a symptom of a disease, an epiphenomenon or a primary disease. Fecal incontinence negatively influences the ability of affected intensive patients to care for themselves. Fecal incontinence and diarrhea often occur together, which in return restricts the patient’s mobility. Improperly treated fecal incontinence can result in infections (e.g., skin disorders, existing catheter sores), secondary healing can be delayed (e.g., bedsores, sores on the back or groin/genital area) and can also result in contamination of other areas (e.g., intestinal infection). In the past, many improvised techniques and materials have been used to drain feces for patients who are either immobile or critically ill with temporary or persistent fecal incontinence. Continuous and safe fecal drainage is often a problem. There is no basic standard nursing concept that can be recommended or verified. At present there are a number of continuous fecal drainage systems that have been launched on the market. Different indications and fields of application have been recommended when dealing with continuous fecal drainage. This article shows weaknesses and strengths of continuous fecal drainage, explains how each functions, and illustrates possible indications and contra-indications with each of these. Deployment options and limits are presented and summarized in an algorithm as a practical help for decision-making.","Rothaug, O.; Kaltwasser, A.; Dubb, R.; Müller-Wolff, T.; Steinfeld, E.-H.; Wagner, S.",Intensivmed Notfallmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102101/,31
6889,"Arctigenin Protects against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Pulmonary Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in a Mouse Model via Suppression of MAPK, HO-1, and iNOS Signaling",2015-01-24,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced autophagy inhibition in lung fibroblasts is closely associated with the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that LPS activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibited lung fibroblast autophagy by depleting thymocyte differentiation antigen-1 (Thy-1) and upregulating integrin β3 (Itgb3). Challenge of the human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line with LPS resulted in significant upregulation of integrin β3, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibition of autophagy, which could be abolished by integrin β3 silencing by specific shRNA or treatment with the integrin β3 inhibitor cilengitide. Meanwhile, LPS could inhibit Thy-1 expression accompanied with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition; these effects could be prevented by Thy-1 overexpression. Meanwhile, Thy-1 downregulation with Thy-1 shRNA could mimic the effects of LPS, inducing the activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibiting lung fibroblast autophagy. Furthermore, protein immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that LPS reduced the binding of Thy-1 to integrin β3. Thy-1 downregulation, integrin β3 upregulation and autophagy inhibition were also detected in a mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which could be prohibited by intratracheal injection of Thy-1 overexpressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) or intraperitoneal injection of the integrin β3 inhibitor cilengitide. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Thy-1 depletion and integrin β3 upregulation are involved in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and may serve as potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis.","Wan, Hanxi; Xie, Tingting; Xu, Qiaoyi; Hu, Xiaoting; Xing, Shunpeng; Yang, Hao; Gao, Yuan; He, Zhengyu",Lab Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102294/,31
7058,Chloroquine-containing compounds: a patent review (2010 – 2014),2015-05-26,"PURPOSE: To review the pathophysiology of coagulopathy in massively transfused, adult and previously hemostatically competent patients in both elective surgical and trauma settings, and to recommend the most appropriate treatment strategies. METHODS: Medline was searched for articles on “massive transfusion,” “transfusion,” “trauma,” “surgery,” “coagulopathy” and “hemostatic defects.” A group of experts reviewed the findings. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Coagulopathy will result from hemodilution, hypothermia, the use of fractionated blood products and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The clinical significance of the effects of hydroxyethyl starch solutions on hemostasis remains unclear. Maintaining a normal body temperature is a first-line, effective strategy to improve hemostasis during massive transfusion. Red cells play an important role in coagulation and hematocrits higher than 30% may be required to sustain hemostasis. In elective surgery patients, a decrease in fibrinogen concentration is observed initially while thrombocytopenia is a late occurrence. In trauma patients, tissue trauma, shock, tissue anoxia and hypothermia contribute to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and microvascular bleeding. The use of platelets and/or fresh frozen plasma should depend on clinical judgment as well as the results of coagulation testing and should be used mainly to treat a clinical coagulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy associated with massive transfusion remains an important clinical problem. It is an intricate, multifactorial and multicellular event. Treatment strategies include the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, the correction of hypothermia and anemia, and the use of hemostatic blood products to correct microvascular bleeding.

MÉTHODE: Dans Medline, nous avons cherché les articles traitant de “massive transfusion,” “transfusion,” “trauma,” “surgery,”“coagulopathy” et “hemostatic defects.” Un groupe ďexperts a examiné les résultats. CONSTATATIONS PRINCIPALES: La coagulopathie résulte de ľhémodilution, ľhypothermie, ľusage de produits sanguins fractionnés et la coagulation intravasculaire disséminée. La portée clinique des effets des solutions ďhydroxyéthyl-amidon sur ľhémostase n’est toujours pas claire. Le maintien ďune température corporelle normale est une stratégie de première intention efficace pour améliorer ľhémostase pendant la transfusion massive. Les globules rouges sont importants dans la coagulation et des hématocrites supérieurs è 30 % pourraient être nécessaires à une hémostase adéquate. Chez les patients en chirurgie réglée, une baisse de la concentration de fibrinogène est observée précocement tandis que la thrombocytopénie est plus tardive. Chez les traumatisés, le trauma tissulaire, le choc, ľanoxie et ľhypothermie tissulaires contribuent au développement ďune coagulation intravasculaire disséminée et du saignement microvasculaire. Ľutilisation de plaquettes et/ou de plasma frais congelé dépendra du jugement du clinicien ainsi que des résultats des tests de coagulation.

PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL CHALLENGE(1)(2)",1971-06-11,"Alphaviruses were amongst the first arboviruses to be isolated, characterized and assigned a taxonomic status. They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions.

7585,Understanding the mechanisms of viral induced asthma: New therapeutic directions,2008-01-29,"OBJECTIVES: Chemical-biological-radio-nuclear (CBRN) gas masks are the standard means for protecting the general population from inhalation of toxic industrial compounds (TICs), for example after industrial accidents or terrorist attacks. However, such gas masks would not protect patients on home mechanical ventilation, as ventilator airflow would bypass the CBRN filter. We therefore evaluated in vivo the safety of adding a standard-issue CBRN filter to the air-outflow port of a home ventilator, as a method for providing TIC protection to such patients. METHODS: Eight adult patients were included in the study. All had been on stable, chronic ventilation via a tracheostomy for at least 3 months before the study. Each patient was ventilated for a period of 1 hour with a standard-issue CBRN filter canister attached to the air-outflow port of their ventilator. Physiological and airflow measurements were made before, during, and after using the filter, and the patients reported their subjective sensation of ventilation continuously during the trial. RESULTS: For all patients, and throughout the entire study, no deterioration in any of the measured physiological parameters and no changes in measured airflow parameters were detected. All patients felt no subjective difference in the sensation of ventilation with the CBRN filter canister in situ, as compared with ventilation without it. This was true even for those patients who were breathing spontaneously and thus activating the ventilator’s trigger/sensitivity function. No technical malfunctions of the ventilators occurred after addition of the CBRN filter canister to the air-outflow ports of the ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: A CBRN filter canister can be added to the air-outflow port of chronically ventilated patients, without causing an objective or subjective deterioration in the quality of the patients’ mechanical ventilation.

7861,Therapeutic Applications,2011-04-12,"Since the 1986 regulatory approval of muromonomab-CD3, a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against the T cell CD3ε antigen, MAbs have become an increasingly important class of therapeutic compounds in a variety of disease areas ranging from cancer and autoimmune indications to infectious and cardiac diseases. However, the pathway to the present acceptance of therapeutic MAbs within the pharmaceutical industry has not been smooth. A major hurdle for antibody therapeutics has been the inherent immunogenicity of the most readily available MAbs, those derived from rodents. A variety of technologies have been successfully employed to engineer MAbs with reduced immunogenicity. Implementation of these antibody engineering technologies involves in vitro optimization of lead molecules to generate a clinical candidate. An alternative technology, involving the engineering of strains of mice to produce human instead of mouse antibodies, has been emerging and evolving for the past two decades. Now, with the 2006 US regulatory approval of panitumumab, a fully human antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, transgenic mice expressing human antibody repertoires join chimerization, CDR grafting, and phage display technologies, as a commercially validated antibody drug discovery platform. With dozens of additional transgenic mouse-derived human MAbs now in clinical development, this new drug discovery platform appears to be firmly established within the pharmaceutical industry.","Lonberg, N.",Therapeutic Antibodies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120671/,31

9181,ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS OF APES,1978-08-26,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in alleviating arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity. METHODS: Sixty male Kunming mice received the following treatments by gavage: normal saline solution (control); arsenic trioxide (ATO; 4 mg/kg); GSPE (400 mg/kg); ATO+GSPE (100 mg/kg); ATO+GSPE (200 mg/kg) and ATO+GSPE (400 mg/kg). Thereafter, the mice were sacrificed and weighed, and the testis was examined for pathological changes. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, and quinone 1 (NQO1) expression in the testis was detected by real-time PCR. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidative capability (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and reproductive indexes were analyzed. RESULTS: ATO-treated mice showed a significantly decreased sperm count and testis somatic index and activity levels of SOD, GSH, and T-AOC than control group. Compared to the ATO-treated group, ATO +GSPE group showed recovery of the measured parameters. Mice treated with ATO+high-dose GSPE showed the highest level of mRNA expression of Nrf2, HO, NQO1, and GST. CONCLUSIONS: GSPE alleviates oxidative stress damage in mouse testis by activating Nrf2 signaling, thus counteracting arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity.","LI, Shu Gang; DING, Yu Song; NIU, Qiang; XU, Shang Zhi; PANG, Li Juan; MA, Ru Lin; JING, Ming Xia; FENG, Gang Ling; LIU, Jia Ming; GUO, Shu Xia",Biomed Environ Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135117/,31

The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively. The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice. We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.","Bergström, T.; Sjögren-Jansson, E.; Jeansson, S.; Lycke, E.",Mol Cell Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135814/,31

9474,Tumor microenvironment complexity and therapeutic implications at a glance,2020-04-07,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases and an important health problem, having considerable implications for healthcare systems worldwide. Despite important advances in prevention through vaccines, new rapid diagnostic tests and antibiotics, CAP management still has significant drawbacks. Mortality remains very high in severely ill patients presenting with respiratory failure or shock but is also high in the elderly. Even after a CAP episode, higher risk of death remains during a long period, a risk mainly driven by inflammation and patient-related co-morbidities. CAP microbiology has been altered by new molecular diagnostic tests that have turned viruses into the most identified pathogens, notwithstanding uncertainties about the specific role of each virus in CAP pathogenesis. Pneumococcal vaccines also impacted CAP etiology and thus had changed Streptococcus pneumoniae circulating serotypes. Pathogens from specific regions should also be kept in mind when treating CAP. New antibiotics for CAP treatment were not tested in severely ill patients and focused on multidrug-resistant pathogens that are unrelated to CAP, limiting their general use and indications for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Similarly, CAP management could be personalized through the use of adjunctive therapies that showed outcome improvements in particular patient groups. Although pneumococcal vaccination was only convincingly shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease, with a less significant effect in pneumococcal CAP, it remains the best therapeutic intervention to prevent bacterial CAP. Further research in CAP is needed to reduce its population impact and improve individual outcomes.","Ferreira-Coimbra, João; Sarda, Cristina; Rello, Jordi",Adv Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140754/,31

While hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is well known as a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, the role of muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (Fbp2) in glucose disposal and thermogenesis is unknown. Here, using Fbp2 knockout (KO) mice, we assessed the physiological role of Fbp2 in energy and glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. In vivo assessments of energy metabolism, glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis were performed by indirect calorimetry, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and cold challenge studies, respectively. Under both feeding and fasting conditions, Fbp2 KO mice showed similar phenotypes regarding energy and glucose metabolism compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, Fbp2 KO mice were severely intolerant to cold challenge under fasting conditions. Mechanistically, the cold-induced intramuscular conversion of lactate to glycogen (glyconeogenesis) is completely abolished in the KO muscle, which leads to a lack of glycogen source for thermogenesis in Fbp2 KO mice. The cold-intolerant phenotype of KO mice disappeared after feeding, and the KO mice were equally as cold tolerant as the WT mice and survived during the cold challenge for three weeks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Fbp2 is essential for muscle thermogenesis by replenishing the intramuscular glycogen pool through glyconeogenesis when the exogenous glucose source is limited. These data imply the physiological importance of Fbp2 in thermal homeostasis and suggest a potential novel therapy targeted to increase glycogen replenishment upon cold stress.","Park, Hyun-Jun; Jang, Hye Rim; Park, Shi-Young; Kim, Young-Bum; Lee, Hui-Young; Choi, Cheol Soo",Exp Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156669/,31

Standard assay chemistries for these markers have been converted to disposable test strips such that patients may one day be able to monitor their clinical status at home. Details of these developments are described. In addition, saliva from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is being screened for useful diagnostic markers. Our goal is to develop a multiplexed assay for these protein and nucleic acid biomarkers for diagnosing the cause and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, enabling more effective treatment to be administered. These results are reported in the second part of this article.","WALT, DAVID R.; BLICHARZ, TIMOTHY M.; HAYMAN, RYAN B.; RISSIN, DAVID M.; BOWDEN, MICHAELA; SIQUEIRA, WALTER L.; HELMERHORST, EVA J.; GRAND‐PIERRE, NERLINE; OPPENHEIM, FRANK G.; BHATIA, JASVINDER S.; LITTLE, FRÉDÉRIC F.; BRODY, JEROME S.",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168095/,31

It involves modeling the respective collections of epidemic states and syndromic observations as random finite sets. Each epidemic state consists of the number of infected individuals in an isolated population system and the corresponding partially known parameters of the epidemic model. The infectious disease could spread between population systems with known probabilities based on prior knowledge of ecological and biological features of the environment. The problem is then formulated in the context of Bayesian framework and estimated via a probability hypothesis density filter. Each population system under surveillance is assumed to be homogenous and fixed, with daily reports on the number of infected people available for monitoring and prediction. When model parameters are partially known, results of numerical studies indicate that the proposed approach can help early prediction of the epidemic in terms of peak and duration.",,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186040/,31

Porous silica has been identified as an effective adjuvant for more than a decade, and we have therefore investigated the take up rate by an immortalized macrophage-like cell line of a number of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) with differing diameter and pore size. The MSNPs were synthesized using a sol-gel reaction and post-synthesis removal of the template. The MSNPs showed a clear distribution in take up rate peaking at 217 nm, whereas a comparison with solid spherical nanoparticles showed a similar distribution peaking at 377 nm. The MSNPs were investigated before and after loading with antigen. Diphtheria toxoid was used as a proof-of-concept antigen and showed a peak macrophage internalization of 53.42% for loaded LP3 particles which had a diameter of 217.75 ± 5.44 nm and large 16.5 nm pores. Optimal MSNP sizes appeared to be in the 200–400 nm range, and larger pores showed better antigen loading. The mesoporous silica particles were shown to be generally biocompatible, and cell viability was not altered by the loading of particles with or without antigen.

Its beneficial effects are related to physical and chemical factors, but the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the use of preclinical models to investigate the influence of BT on inflammation, immunity, and cartilage and bone metabolism. The objective of this comprehensive analysis was to summarize the current knowledge about the in vitro studies in BT and to revise the obtained results on the biological effects of mineral waters. Special attention has been paid to the main rheumatological and dermatological conditions, and to the regulation of the immune response. The objective of this review was to summarize the in vitro studies, on human and animal samples, investigating the biological effects of BT. In particular, we analyzed the properties of a thermal water, as a whole, of an inorganic molecule, such as hydrogen sulfide in different cell cultures (keratinocytes, synoviocytes, chondrocytes, and peripheral blood cells), or of the organic component. The results corroborated the scientific value of in vitro studies in demonstrating the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, chondroprotective, and immunosuppressive role of BT at the cellular level. However, the validity of the cell culture model is limited by several sources of bias, as the differences in experimental procedures, the high heterogeneity among the available researches, and the difficulties in considering all the chemical and physical factors of BT. We would like to stimulate the scientific community to standardize the experimental procedures and enhance in vitro research in the field of BT.","Cheleschi, Sara; Gallo, Ines; Tenti, Sara",Int J Biometeorol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223834/,31

Here, we report the isolation of a Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) strain from bank voles caught in a highly endemic region around the city Osnabrück, north-west Germany. Coding and non-coding sequences of all three segments (S, M, and L) were determined from original lung tissue, after isolation and after additional passaging in VeroE6 cells and a bank vole-derived kidney cell line. Different single amino acid substitutions were observed in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of the two stable PUUV isolates. The PUUV strain from VeroE6 cells showed a lower titer when propagated on bank vole cells compared to VeroE6 cells. Additionally, glycoprotein precursor (GPC)-derived virus-like particles of a German PUUV sequence allowed the generation of monoclonal antibodies that allowed the reliable detection of the isolated PUUV strain in the immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, this is the first isolation of a PUUV strain from Central Europe and the generation of glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies for this PUUV isolate. The obtained virus isolate and GPC-specific antibodies are instrumental tools for future reservoir host studies.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be a promising diagnostic tool for antigenic diseases such as virus infection, as they offer a high specificity toward a specific viral antigen. However, to date, there is no specific mAb available for the diagnosis of HPeV3 infection. In this study, we developed and characterized mAbs specific for HPeV3 capsid protein VP0. We used cell-free, wheat germ-synthesized viral VP0 protein for immunizing BALB/c mice to generate hybridomas. From the resultant hybridoma clones, we selected nine clones producing mAbs reactive to the HPeV3-VP0 antigen, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Epitope mapping showed that these mAbs recognized three distinct domains in HPeV3 VP0. Six mAbs recognized HPeV3 specifically and the other three mAbs showed cross-reactivity with other HPeVs. Using the HPeV3-specific mAbs, we then developed an ELISA for viral antigen detection that could be reliably used for laboratory diagnosis of HPeV3. This ELISA system exhibited no cross-reactivity with other related viruses. Our newly developed mAbs would, thus, provide a useful set of tools for future research and ensure HPeV3-specific diagnosis.","Goto, Keiko; Yamaoka, Yutaro; Khatun, Hajera; Miyakawa, Kei; Nishi, Mayuko; Nagata, Noriko; Yanaoka, Toshikazu; Kimura, Hirokazu; Ryo, Akihide",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563955/,31
13522,Use of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) in Chronic Airway Diseases,2020-09-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Stress in cats residing in a shelter environment is a significant contributor to the development of upper respiratory disease (URD). Previous studies have shown that positive interactions can reduce stress and enhance the immune system. However, little is known on how the frequency and duration of daily handling affects a cat’s likelihood of developing URD. The goal of this study was to record the daily frequency and duration of handling of clinically healthy cats that were relinquished at a closed admission shelter and determine if these parameters were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of developing URD. While no parameters were statistically significantly associated with an increased hazard of developing URD, we found that cats that did not develop URD were handled more frequently than cats that did develop URD. Our results suggest that increased frequency and duration of handling does not appear to increase the risk of URD signs and may reduce the incidence of URD development. These results are important for the shelter community in developing handling and hygiene protocols for shelter cats. ABSTRACT: Reducing stress is important to maintaining the health of shelter cats and decreasing the risk of upper respiratory disease (URD). The aim of this study was to determine if the frequency and/or duration of daily routine handling of shelter cats affects the likelihood of URD development. At a closed admission shelter, each cat free of URD on intake was given a cage card for recording handling data. These data included: date and times when the cat was handled, duration of handling, if and when the cat developed signs of URD, and the handler identity. Cox regression was used to determine the relationship between these factors and URD development. We found cats that did not develop URD were handled significantly more than cats that did (1.1 times per day vs. 0.7 times per day, p < 0.001). Increased frequency of handling had a borderline significant effect on the hazard of developing URD (HR 0.37; CI: 0.13–1.1; p = 0.066). No other parameters were significantly associated with the development of URD; however, small sample size may be responsible for this finding. A larger study is needed to elucidate the relationship between handling and URD development.","Burns, Charlotte C.; Redding, Laurel E.; Watson, Brittany",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601765/,31

13668,The Msi1-mTOR pathway drives the pathogenesis of mammary and extramammary Paget’s disease,2020-05-26,"Programmed DNA recombination in mammalian cells occurs predominantly in a directional manner. While random DNA breaks are typically repaired both by deletion and by inversion at approximately equal proportions, V(D)J and class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene overwhelmingly delete intervening sequences to yield productive rearrangement. What factors channel chromatin breaks to deletional CSR in lymphocytes is unknown. Integrating CRISPR knockout and chemical perturbation screening we here identify the Snf2-family helicase-like ERCC6L2 as one such factor. We show that ERCC6L2 promotes double-strand break end-joining and facilitates optimal CSR in mice. At the cellular levels, ERCC6L2 rapidly engages in DNA repair through its C-terminal domains. Mechanistically, ERCC6L2 interacts with other end-joining factors and plays a functionally redundant role with the XLF end-joining factor in V(D)J recombination. Strikingly, ERCC6L2 controls orientation-specific joining of broken ends during CSR, which relies on its helicase activity. Thus, ERCC6L2 facilitates programmed recombination through directional repair of distant breaks.","Liu, Xiaojing; Liu, Tingting; Shang, Yafang; Dai, Pengfei; Zhang, Wubing; Lee, Brian J.; Huang, Min; Yang, Dingpeng; Wu, Qiu; Liu, Liu Daisy; Zheng, Xiaoqi; Zhou, Bo O.; Dong, Junchao; Yeap, Leng-Siew; Hu, Jiazhi; Xiao, Tengfei; Zha, Shan; Casellas, Rafael; Liu, X.

METHODS: Prospective study of 16 eyes of patients who did not tolerate gas-permeable corneal contact lenses and were fitted with Rose K2 XL scleral lenses. We assessed the central vault and the corneal thickness centrally and at peripheral regions (2 to 5 mm annulus). All these measures were obtained by anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The measurements were taken immediately after fitting the lenses and 1, 6 and 12 months later. Prior to the study and at 1 year, we performed an objective test for diagnosing limbal stem cell deficiency (Limbokit). RESULTS: The mean vault was 201.7 ± 82.3 µm 20 min after fitting the contact lens; 189.4 ± 94.0 µm at 1 month; 165.1 ± 75.9 µm at 6 months and 142.1 ± 76.8 µm at 1 year, the values at 6 and 12 months being significantly different to baseline. After 1 year, the central corneal thickness had increased by 2.3% (IQR = 5.6), but the changes were only significant for the superior thickness. There is no limbal stem cell deficiency after 1 year of scleral contact lens use. CONCLUSIONS: After use of Rose K2 XL scleral contact lenses, the corneal physiology of patients with an irregular cornea remains unchanged, as assessed by corneal thickness measurements and the Limbokit test. In all cases, however, the vault decreased over time.","de Luis Eguileor, Beatriz; Acera, Arantxa; Santamaría Carro, Alaitz; Feijoo Lera, Raquel; Escudero Argaluza, Julene; Etxebarria Ecenarro, Jaime",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608222/,31
13691,Correction: Suppression of interferon gene expression overcomes resistance to MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer,2019-05-30,"Alien plants represent a potential threat to environment and society. Understanding the process of alien plants naturalization is therefore of primary importance. In alien plants, successful establishment can be constrained by the absence of suitable fungal partners. Here, we used 42 independent datasets of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) communities associated with alien Pinaceae and Eucalyptus spp., as the most commonly introduced tree species worldwide, to explore the strategies these plant groups utilize to establish symbioses with EcMF in the areas of introduction. We have also determined the differences in composition of EcMF communities associated with alien ectomycorrhizal plants in different regions. While alien Pinaceae introduced to new regions rely upon association with co-introduced EcMF, alien Eucalyptus often form novel interactions with EcMF species native to the region where the plant was introduced. The region of origin primarily determines species composition of EcMF communities associated with alien Pinaceae in new areas, which may largely affect invasion potential of the alien plants. Our study shows that alien ectomycorrhizal plants largely differ in their ability to interact with co-introduced and native ectomycorrhizal fungi in sites of introduction, which may potentially affect their invasive potential.","Vlk, Lukáš; Tedersoo, Leho; Antl, Tomáš; Větrovský, Tomáš; Abarenkov, Kessy; Pergl, Jan; Albrechtová, Jana; Vosátka, Miroslav; Baldrian, Petr; Pyšek, Petr; Kohout, Petr",ISME J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608243/,31

This is linked to an inflammatory microglial phenotype in the offspring induced by maternal immune activation (MIA). Microglia are crucial for brain development and maintenance of neuronal niches, however, whether and how their activation is involved in the regulation of neurodevelopment remains unclear. Here, we used a MIA rodent model in which polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) was injected into pregnant mice. We found fewer parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells and impaired GABAergic transmission in the dentate gyrus (DG), accompanied by schizophrenia-like behavior in the adult offspring. Minocycline, a potent inhibitor of microglia activation, successfully prevented the above-mentioned deficits in the offspring. Furthermore, by using microglia-specific arginase 1 (Arg1) ablation as well as overexpression in DG, we identified a critical role of Arg1 in microglia activation to protect against poly (I:C) imparted neuropathology and altered behavior in offspring. Taken together, our results highlight that Arg1-mediated alternative activation of microglia are potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders induced by MIA.","Xia, Yucen; Zhang, Zhiqing; Lin, Weipeng; Yan, Jinglan; Zhu, Chuan’an; Yin, Dongmin; He, Su; Su, Yang; Xu, Nenggui; Caldwell, Robert William; Yao, Lin; Chen, Yongjun",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608378/,31

METHOD: An exploratory mixed-methods study comprising a survey (n=77) and semistructured interviews (n=6) with Australian psychiatrists participating in a PRG in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: Qualitative findings indicate that PRGs address experiential learning through a focus on both breadth and specificity of work, as well as participants’ experiences. Participants described using PRGs as a forum to manage difficult and complex work (through critiquing work, learning from one another, considering theory and guidelines, benchmarking, validating, reflecting and generalising learning) and to manage stress and well-being associated with crises, everyday stress and professional isolation. Particular structural aspects of PRGs considered essential to achieve these functions were self-selection of members, self-direction of meeting content and provision of a safe environment. These findings were convergent with the quantitative findings from scale survey data. Difficulties experienced during PRG participation are also described. CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative findings from psychiatry PRGs demonstrate how practice-based professional experience functions as both a source of learning and of collegial connection that contributes to well-being and reduction in professional stress.

14043,Hematological Toxicity During Concomitant Treatment With Ruxolitinib and Avelumab for Merkel Cell Carcinoma,2020-10-22,"Safety, quality, and regulatory-driven iterative optimization of therapeutic cell source selection has constituted the core developmental bedrock for primary fetal progenitor cell (FPC) therapy in Switzerland throughout three decades. Customized Fetal Transplantation Programs were pragmatically devised as straightforward workflows for tissue procurement, traceability maximization, safety, consistency, and robustness of cultured progeny cellular materials. Whole-cell bioprocessing standardization has provided plethoric insights into the adequate conjugation of modern biotechnological advances with current restraining legislative, ethical, and regulatory frameworks. Pioneer translational advances in cutaneous and musculoskeletal regenerative medicine continuously demonstrate the therapeutic potential of FPCs. Extensive technical and clinical hindsight was gathered by managing pediatric burns and geriatric ulcers in Switzerland. Concomitant industrial transposition of dermal FPC banking, following good manufacturing practices, demonstrated the extensive potential of their therapeutic value. Furthermore, in extenso, exponential revalorization of Swiss FPC technology may be achieved via the renewal of integrative model frameworks. Consideration of both longitudinal and transversal aspects of simultaneous fetal tissue differential processing allows for a better understanding of the quasi-infinite expansion potential within multi-tiered primary FPC banking. Multiple fetal tissues (e.g., skin, cartilage, tendon, muscle, bone, lung) may be simultaneously harvested and processed for adherent cell cultures, establishing a unique model for sustainable therapeutic cellular material supply chains. Here, we integrated fundamental, preclinical, clinical, and industrial developments embodying the scientific advances supported by Swiss FPC banking and we focused on advances made to date for FPCs that may be derived from a single organ donation. A renewed model of single organ donation bioprocessing is proposed, achieving sustained standards and potential production of billions of affordable and efficient therapeutic doses. Thereby, the aim is to validate the core therapeutic value proposition, to increase awareness and use of standardized protocols for translational regenerative medicine, potentially impacting millions of patients suffering from cutaneous and musculoskeletal diseases. Alternative applications of FPC banking include biopharmaceutical therapeutic product manufacturing, thereby indirectly and synergistically enhancing the power of modern therapeutic armamentariums. It is hypothesized that a single qualifying fetal organ donation is sufficient to sustain decades of scientific, medical, and industrial developments, as technological optimization and standardization enable high efficiency.","Laurent, Alexis; Hirt-Burri, Nathalie; Scaletta, Corinne; Michetti, Murielle; de Buys Roessingh, Anthony S.; Raffoul, Wassim; Applegate, Lee Ann",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7644790/,31

Although most parts of moringa tree have been widely studied, seeds remained scarcely explored. The first goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of germination to improve the nutritional composition (proximate composition and levels of vitamins B1 and B2), content of bioactive compounds (glucosinolates, phenolics and γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and antioxidant activity of moringa seed. Germination improved protein, fat, fiber, riboflavin, phenolics, some individual glucosinolates (GLS) and GABA contents, as well as the antioxidant potential in moringa sprouts, but the extent of the improvement depended on germination conditions. The second objective of this work was to identify the optimal germination conditions to maximize nutritional and bioactive quality of moringa by applying multi-response optimization (response surface methodology, RSM). RSM models indicated that 28 °C and 24 h were the optimal conditions to enhance the accumulation of riboflavin, phenolics and antioxidant activity of sprouts, while the highest GABA and total GLS contents were observed at 36 °C for 96 h and thiamine achieved the maximum content at 36 °C for 24 h. These results show that moringa sprouts are promising functional foods that might be also used as ingredients for the elaboration of novel foodstuffs.","Coello, Karín E.; Frias, Juana; Martínez-Villaluenga, Cristina; Cartea, María Elena; Abilleira, Rosaura; Peñas, Elena",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696275/,31

From still images, position-sensitive, quantitative intensity, or colorimetric information can be obtained. Video images made of a time series of still images can provide time-dependent, quantitative intensity, or colorimetric information in addition to the position-sensitive information from a single still image. With the aid of novel image processing/analysis software, extraction of position- and time-sensitive quantitative colorimetric information was demonstrated from still image and video images of litmus test strips for pH tests of solutions. Visual inspection of the color change in the litmus test strips after chemical reaction with chemical solutions is typically exercised. Visual comparison of the color of the test solution with a standard color chart provides an approximate pH value to the nearest whole number.

14564,Inhibitors of bromodomain and extra‐terminal proteins for treating multiple human diseases,2020-09-14,"Increasingly, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is being recognized as a sensor for endogenous and pseudo-endogenous metabolites, and in particular microbiota and host generated tryptophan metabolites. One proposed explanation for this is the role of the AHR in innate immune signaling within barrier tissues in response to the presence of microorganisms. A number of cytokine/chemokine genes exhibit a combinatorial increase in transcription upon toll-like receptors and AHR activation, supporting this concept. The AHR also plays a role in the enhanced differentiation of intestinal and dermal epithelium leading to improved barrier function. Importantly, from an evolutionary perspective many of these tryptophan metabolites exhibit greater activation potential for the human AHR when compared to the rodent AHR. These observations underscore the importance of the AHR in barrier tissues and may lead to pharmacologic therapeutic intervention.","Murray, Iain A.; Perdew, Gary H.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766308/,31
14578,β-Glucan Metabolic and Immunomodulatory Properties and Potential for Clinical Application,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting is an independent risk behavior for the development of chronic disease. With most interventions focusing on physical activity and exercise, there is a separate need for investigation into innovative and accessible interventions to decrease sedentary behavior throughout the day. Twitter is a social media platform with application for health communications and fostering of social support for health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of delivering daily behavior change strategies within private Twitter groups to foster peer-to-peer support and decrease sedentary behavior throughout the day in women. The Twitter group was combined with a Fitbit for self-monitoring activity and compared to a Fitbit-only control group. METHODS: In a 2-group design, participants were randomized to a Twitter + Fitbit treatment group or a Fitbit-only control group. Participants were recruited via the Stanford Research Repository System, screened for eligibility, and then invited to an orientation session. After providing informed consent, they were randomized. All participants received 13 weeks of tailored weekly step goals and a Fitbit. The treatment group participants, placed in a private Twitter support group, received daily automated behavior change “tweets” informed by theory and regular automated encouragement via text to communicate with the group. Fitbit data were collected daily throughout the treatment and follow-up period. Web-based surveys and accelerometer data were collected at baseline, treatment end (13 weeks), and at 8.5 weeks after the treatment. RESULTS: The initial study design funding was obtained from the Women’s Heart Clinic and the Stanford Clayman Institute. Funding to run this pilot study was received from the National Institutes of Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute under Award Number K01HL136702. All procedures were approved by Stanford University’s Institutional Review Board, #32127 in 2018, prior to beginning data collection. Recruitment for this study was conducted in May 2019. Of the 858 people screened, 113 met the eligibility criteria, 68 came to an information session, and 45 consented to participate in this pilot study. One participant dropped out of the intervention, and complete follow-up data were obtained from 39 of the 45 participants (87% of the sample). Data were collected over 6 months from June to December 2019. Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy results are being analyzed and will be reported in the winter of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of delivering behavior change strategies in a Twitter social support group to decrease sedentary behavior in women. These findings will inform a larger evaluation. With an accessible, tailorable, and flexible platform, Twitter-delivered interventions offer potential for many treatment variations and titrations, thereby testing the effects of different behavior change strategies, peer-group makeups, and health behaviors of interest.

15087,Virome-wide serological profiling reveals association of herpesviruses with obesity,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) in lower-middle income countries (LMICs) are suspected to constitute a special risk for patients of acquiring infection due to multiple antibiotic resistant organisms. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to present the data published on ICU-acquired infections and on antimicrobial resistance observed in ICUs in LMICs over a 13-year period. A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the PRISMA extension guideline for scoping reviews and registered in the Open Science Framework. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Articles were sought that reported on ICU-acquired infection in LMICs between 2005 and 2018. Two reviewers parallelly reviewed 1961 titles and abstracts retrieved from five data banks, found 274 eligible and finally included 51. Most LMICs had not produced reports in Q1 or Q2 journals in this period, constituting a large gap in knowledge. However, from the reported evidence it is clear that the rate of ICU-acquired infections was comparable, albeit approximately 10% higher, in LMICs compared to high income countries. In contrast, ICU mortality was much higher in LMICs (33.6%) than in high income countries (< 20%). Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative species, especially Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae played a much more dominant role in LMIC ICUs than in those in high income countries. However, interventions to improve this situation have been shown to be feasible and effective, even cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to high income countries the burden of ICU-acquired infection is higher in LMICs, as is the level of antimicrobial resistance; the pathogen distribution is also different. However, there is evidence that interventions are feasible and may be quite effective in these settings.

15130,QAIS-DSNN: Tumor Area Segmentation of MRI Image with Optimized Quantum Matched-Filter Technique and Deep Spiking Neural Network,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Surgery under general anesthesia results in temperature decrease due to the effect of anesthetics and peripheral vasodilation on thermoregulatory centers. Perioperative temperature control is therefore an issue of high importance. In this study, we aimed to compare the warming effect of underbody and overbody blankets in patients undergoing surgery in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. METHODS: From September 2018 to October 2019, 99 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer in the lithotomy position were included in this randomized controlled trial and assigned to the intervention group (underbody blanket) or control group (overbody blanket). RESULTS: The central temperature was significantly higher in the underbody blanket group than in the overbody blanket group at 90 min after the beginning of the surgery (p = 0.02); also in this group, the peripheral temperature was significantly higher 60 min after the beginning of the surgery (p = 0.02). Regarding postoperative factors, the underbody blanket group had a significantly lower frequency of postoperative shivering (p < 0.01) and a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.04) than the overbody blanket group. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of underbody blankets for intraoperative temperature control in patients undergoing surgery in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. Underbody blankets showed improved rise and maintenance of central and peripheral temperature, decreased the incidence of postoperative shivering, and shortened the postoperative length of hospital stay.","Hara, Kentaro; Kuroda, Hiromi; Matsuura, Emi; Ishimatsu, Yuji; Honda, Sumihisa; Takeshita, Hiroaki; Sawai, Terumitsu",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845577/,31

However, there is a paucity of evidence on the relationship between frequency of use of electronic devices and social media and sleep-onset difficulties among the Italian population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the use of technology and social media, including Facebook and YouTube, and sleep-onset difficulties among adolescents from Lombardy, the most populous region in Italy. METHODS: The relationship between use of technology and social media and sleep-onset difficulties was investigated. Data came from the 2013-2014 wave of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey, a school-based cross-sectional study conducted on 3172 adolescents aged 11 to 15 years in Northern Italy. Information was collected on difficulties in falling asleep over the last 6 months. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for sleep-onset difficulties and corresponding 95% CIs using logistic regression models after adjustment for major potential confounders. RESULTS: The percentage of adolescents with sleep-onset difficulties was 34.3% (1081/3151) overall, 29.7% (483/1625) in boys and 39.2% (598/1526) in girls. It was 30.3% (356/1176) in 11-year-olds, 36.2% (389/1074) in 13-year-olds, and 37.3% (336/901) in 15-year-olds. Sleep-onset difficulties were more frequent among adolescents with higher use of electronic devices, for general use (OR 1.50 for highest vs lowest tertile of use; 95% CI 1.21-1.85), use for playing games (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.11-1.64), use of online social networks (OR 1.40 for always vs never or rarely; 95% CI 1.09-1.81), and YouTube (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.50-2.66). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds novel information about the relationship between sleep-onset difficulties and technology and social media in a representative sample of school-aged children from a geographical location that has not been included in studies of this type previously. Exposure to screen-based devices and online social media is significantly associated with adolescent sleep-onset difficulties. Interventions to create a well-coordinated parent- and school-centered strategy, thereby increasing awareness on the unfavorable effect of evolving technologies on sleep among adolescents, are needed.","Varghese, Nirosha Elsem; Santoro, Eugenio; Lugo, Alessandra; Madrid-Valero, Juan J; Ghislandi, Simone; Torbica, Aleksandra; Gallus, Silvano",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862002/,31
15279,Protective Effect and Mechanism of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 on Apoptosis of Human Lens Epithelium Cells under Oxidative Stress,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND: Despite the well-known health benefits of physical activity (PA), older adults are the least active citizens. Older adults are also at risk for loneliness. Given that lonely individuals are at risk for accelerated loss of physical functioning and health with age, PA interventions that aim to enhance social connectedness may decrease loneliness and increase long-term PA participation. The objectives of this mixed-method study are to: (1) evaluate whether an evidence-based PA intervention (Choose to Move; CTM) influenced PA and loneliness differently among self-identified ‘lonely’ versus ‘not lonely’ older adults and (2) to describe factors within CTM components most likely to promote social connectedness/reduce loneliness. METHODS: CTM is a flexible, scalable, community-based health promoting physical activity intervention for older adults. Two community delivery partner organizations delivered 56 CTM programs in 26 urban locations across British Columbia. We collected survey data from participants (n = 458 at baseline) at 0 (baseline), 3 (mid-intervention) and 6 (post-intervention) months. We conducted in depth interviews with a subset of older adults to understand how CTM facilitated or impeded their PA and social connectedness. RESULTS: PA increased significantly from baseline to 3 months in lonely and not lonely participants. PA decreased significantly from 3 to 6 months in lonely participants; however, PA at 6 months remained significantly above baseline levels in both groups. Loneliness decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months in participants identifying as lonely at baseline. Factors within CTM components that promote social connectedness/reduce loneliness include: Activity coach characteristics/personality traits and approaches; opportunity to share information and experiences and learn from others; engagement with others who share similar/familiar experiences; increased opportunity for meaningful interaction; and accountability. CONCLUSION: Health promoting interventions that focus on PA and social connectedness through group-based activities can effectively reduce social isolation and loneliness of older adults. Given the ‘epidemic of loneliness’ that plagues many countries currently, these kinds of interventions are timely and important. Research that further delineates mechanisms (e.g., sharing experiences vs. lectures), that modify the effect of an intervention on social connectedness outcomes for older adults engaged in community-based PA programs would be a welcome addition to the literature.","Franke, Thea; Sims-Gould, Joanie; Nettlefold, Lindsay; Ottoni, Callista; McKay, Heather A.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865112/,31
15440,Multifunctional lipid-based nanocarriers with antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory activities for treating MRSA bacteremia in mice,2021-02-15,"Inflammation is increased by infection with pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. High levels of inflammatory mediators and infiltration of macrophages into inflammatory lesions were reported in severe inflammatory diseases. Here, the aim of this study was to evaluate an anti-inflammatory activity of di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (1–100 ng/mL) had no effect on viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (100 ng/mL) significantly reduced LPS-induced release of nitric oxide and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. A significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 by LPS stimulation was downregulated by treatment with Dp44mT. Dp44mT blocked activation of nuclear factor-κB by the interruption of IκBα phosphorylation. Dp44mT suppressed the phagocytosis. Furthermore, administration of Dp44mT significantly reduced the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-treated mice without side effects. In conclusion, these results indicate that Dp44mT has an anti-inflammatory activity and may be of therapeutic significant for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

15793,Rebaudioside A Enhances Resistance to Oxidative Stress and Extends Lifespan and Healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans,2021-02-08,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic gene region that regulates cellular communication in all specific immune responses. In this study, we investigated 11 microsatellite (MS) markers in the MHC-B region of chicken populations from four countries: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Nigeria. The MS markers were divided into two sets. Set 1 included five novel MS markers, which we assessed using 192 samples from 21 populations. Set 2 included six previously reported markers, which we assessed using 881 samples from 29 populations. The Set 1 MS markers had lower polymorphism (polymorphic information content (PIC) < 0.5) than the Set 2 markers (PIC = 0.4–0.9). In all populations, the LEI0258 marker was the most polymorphic, with a total of 38 alleles (PIC = 0.912, expected heterozygosity (H(e)) = 0.918). Local populations from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nigeria had higher allele diversity and more haplotypes for Set 2 MS markers than Korean and commercial populations. The Sri Lankan Karuwalagaswewa village population had the highest MHC diversity (mean allele number = 8.17, H(e) = 0.657), whereas the white leghorn population had the lowest (mean allele number = 2.33, H(e) = 0.342). A total of 409 haplotypes (89 shared and 320 unique), with a range of 4 (Rhode Island red) to 46 (Karuwalagaswewa village (TA)), were identified. Among the shared haplotypes, the B21-like haplotype was identified in 15 populations. The genetic relationship observed in a neighbour-joining tree based on the D(A) distance agreed with the breeding histories and geographic separations. The results indicated high MHC diversity in the local chicken populations. The difference in the allelic pattern among populations presumably reflects the effects of different genotypes, environments, geographic variation, and breeding policies in each country. The selection of MHC allele in domestic poultry can vary due to intensification of poultry production. Preserved MHC diversity in local chicken provides a great opportunity for future studies that address the relationships between MHC polymorphisms and differential immune responses.","Manjula, Prabuddha; Kim, Minjun; Cho, Sunghyun; Seo, Dongwon; Lee, Jun Heon",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915948/,31
15809,Adoptive Immunotherapy beyond CAR T-Cells,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Although mRNA vaccines have been effective against multiple cancers, their efficacy against pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remains undefined. Accumulating evidence suggests that immunotyping can indicate the comprehensive immune status in tumors and their immune microenvironment, which is closely associated with therapeutic response and vaccination potential. The aim of this study was to identify potent antigens in PAAD for mRNA vaccine development, and further distinguish immune subtypes of PAAD to construct an immune landscape for selecting suitable patients for vaccination. METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical information of 239 PAAD datasets were extracted from ICGC, and RNA-Seq data of 103 samples were retrieved from TCGA. GEPIA was used to calculate differential expression levels and prognostic indices, cBioPortal program was used to compare genetic alterations, and TIMER was used to explore correlation between genes and immune infiltrating cells. Consensus cluster was used for consistency matrix construction and data clustering, DAVID was used for functional annotation, and graph learning-based dimensional reduction was used to depict immune landscape. RESULTS: Six overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens associated with poor prognosis and infiltration of antigen presenting cells were identified in PAAD, including ADAM9, EFNB2, MET, TMOD3, TPX2, and WNT7A. Furthermore, five immune subtypes (IS1-IS5) and nine immune gene modules of PAAD were identified that were consistent in both patient cohorts. The immune subtypes showed distinct molecular, cellular and clinical characteristics. IS1 and IS2 exhibited immune-activated phenotypes and correlated to better survival compared to the other subtypes. IS4 and IS5 tumors were immunologically cold and associated with higher tumor mutation burden. Immunogenic cell death modulators, immune checkpoints, and CA125 and CA199, were also differentially expressed among the five immune subtypes. Finally, the immune landscape of PAAD showed a high degree of heterogeneity between individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: ADAM9, EFNB2, MET, TMOD3, TPX2, and WNT7A are potent antigens for developing anti-PAAD mRNA vaccine, and patients with IS4 and IS5 tumors are suitable for vaccination.","Huang, Xing; Zhang, Gang; Tang, Tianyu; Liang, Tingbo",Mol Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917175/,31

However, its role has never been elucidated in sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI). We aimed to explore Gal-3’s role and its potential utility as a therapeutic target in S-AKI. METHODS: In 57 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis, serum Gal-3 was examined as a predictor of ICU mortality and development of AKI. In a rat model of S-AKI induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), 7-day mortality and serum Gal-3, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and creatinine were examined at 2, 8, and 24 hours (h) post-CLP. Two experimental groups received the Gal-3 inhibitor modified citrus pectin (P-MCP) at 400 mg/kg/day and 1200 mg/kg/day, while the control group received water only (n = 18 in each group). RESULTS: Among 57 patients, 27 developed AKI and 8 died in the ICU. Serum Gal-3 was an independent predictor of AKI (OR = 1.2 [95% CI 1.1–1.4], p = 0.01) and ICU mortality (OR = 1.4 [95% CI 1.1–2.2], p = 0.04) before and after controlling for age, AKI, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score. In the CLP rat experiment, serum Gal-3 peaked earlier than IL-6. Serum Gal-3 was significantly lower in both P-MCP groups compared to control at 2 h post-CLP (400 mg: p = 0.003; 1200 mg: p = 0.002), and IL-6 was significantly lower in both P-MCP groups at all time points with a maximum difference at 24 h post-CLP (400 mg: p = 0.015; 1200 mg: p = 0.02). In the Gal-3 inhibitor groups, 7-day mortality was significantly reduced from 61% in the control group to 28% (400 mg P-MCP: p = 0.03) and 22% (1200 mg P-MCP: p = 0.001). Rates of AKI per RIFLE criteria were significantly reduced from 89% in the control group to 44% in both P-MCP groups (400 mg: p = 0.007; 1200 mg: p = 0.007).

This translation and cross-cultural adaptation was performed in eight stages: initial translations, reconciliation of translations and cultural adaptation, back translation, appraisal of back translations, validation of the translation, review and adjustment by reconciliation committee, pretesting in 12 football players and document finalisation. As an alternative to the problematic Months In Reverse Order Test (MIROT) in Arabic, the Serial 3s test (32 Arabic and 30 English participants), the Days of the Week Backwards test (DWBT), and the ‘Adding Serial 3s’ test were tested (30 English and 30 Arabic participants) for accuracy, difficulty and time of completion. The Arabic SCAT5 was similar and comparable to the original English version (7-point Likert scales =< 2). Testing of the pre-final version of the Arabic SCAT5 took 20.4 (SD 3.4) and 17.7 (SD 3.0) minutes respectively to complete and was found acceptable in terms of clarity, understandability, grammatical correctness and coherence. The Arabic Serial 3s test (subtraction version) was unsuitable due to high completion time, low pass rate and high difficulty perception [time = 47.2 (SD 28.0) s; accuracy = 55.2%; difficulty = 3.2 (SD 1.1)]. The Arabic DWBT was too fast and undemanding for concentration testing [time = 4.6 (SD 1.5) s; accuracy = 90%; difficulty = 1.1 (SD 0.3)].

An increasing array of MMM-derived biomarkers now exist that are associated with injury severity and functional outcomes after TBI. A standardized MMM reporting process has not been well described, and a paucity of evidence exists relating MMM reporting in TBI management with functional outcomes or adverse events. METHODS: Prospective implementation of standardized MMM reporting at a single pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is described that included monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral oxygenation and electroencephalography (EEG). The incidence of clinical decisions made using MMM reporting is described, including timing of neuroimaging, ICP monitoring discontinuation, use of paralytic, hyperosmolar and pentobarbital therapies, neurosurgical interventions, ventilator and CPP adjustments and neurologic prognostication discussions. Retrospective analysis was performed on the association of MMM reporting with initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) scores, duration of total hospitalization and PICU hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation and invasive ICP monitoring, inpatient complications, time with ICP > 20 mmHg, time with cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) < 40 mmHg and 12-month Glasgow Outcome Scale—Extended Pediatrics (GOSE-Peds) scores. Association of outcomes with MMM reporting was investigated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: Eighty-five children with TBI underwent MMM over 6 years, among which 18 underwent daily MMM reporting over a 21-month period. Clinical decision-making influenced by MMM reporting included timing of neuroimaging (100.0%), ICP monitoring discontinuation (100.0%), timing of extubation trials of surviving patients (100.0%), body repositioning (11.1%), paralytic therapy (16.7%), hyperosmolar therapy (22.2%), pentobarbital therapy (33.3%), provocative cerebral autoregulation testing (16.7%), adjustments in CPP thresholds (16.7%), adjustments in PaCO2 thresholds (11.1%), neurosurgical interventions (16.7%) and neurologic prognostication discussions (11.1%). The implementation of MMM reporting was associated with a reduction in ICP monitoring duration (p = 0.0017) and mechanical ventilator duration (p = 0.0018). No significant differences were observed in initial GCS or PRISM III scores, total hospitalization length, PICU hospitalization length, total complications, time with ICP > 20 mmHg, time with CPP < 40 mmHg, use of tier 2 therapy, or 12-month GOS-E Peds scores. CONCLUSION: Implementation of MMM reporting in pediatric TBI management is feasible and can be impactful in tailoring clinical decisions. Prospective work is needed to understand the impact of MMM and MMM reporting systems on functional outcomes and clinical care efficacy.

Tanshinones are a class of lipophilic phenanthrene compounds found in the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which contribute to its anti-osteoporosis effects. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the skeletal beneficial effects of tanshinones. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2021 using Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science from the inception of these databases. Original studies reporting the effects of tanshinones on bone through cell cultures, animal models and human clinical trials were considered. Results: The literature search found 158 unique articles on this topic, but only 20 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The available evidence showed that tanshinones promoted osteoblastogenesis and bone formation while reducing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Conclusions: Tanshinones modulates bone remodelling by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast apoptosis and stimulating osteoblastogenesis. Therefore, it might complement existing strategies to prevent bone loss.","Ekeuku, Sophia Ogechi; Pang, Kok-Lun; Chin, Kok-Yong",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073409/,31
17081,"Protective Effects of Cinnamaldehyde on the Inflammatory Response, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis in Liver of Salmonella typhimurium-Challenged Mice",2021-04-16,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The literature is conflicting regarding the feasibility and survival outcomes of distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DP-CAR), although this procedure, in selected cases, represents the only therapeutical option for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The available studies often include small surgical populations, and there are important variations in the inclusion criteria and pre- and post-operative treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the literature of the last 15 years, to evaluate the efficacy and the clinical safety of this procedure. This could help physicians in the choice of a multidisciplinary targeted therapeutical plan for patients. The combination of neoadjuvant chemo/radiochemotherapy and demolitive surgeries such as DP-CAR could have a role in changing the survival outcomes of patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ABSTRACT: Background: Major vascular invasion represents one of the most frequent reasons to consider pancreatic adenocarcinomas unresectable, although in the last decades, demolitive surgeries such as distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) have become a therapeutical option. Methods: A meta-analysis of studies comparing DP-CAR and standard DP in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was conducted. Moreover, a systematic review of studies analyzing oncological, postoperative and survival outcomes of DP-CAR was conducted. Results: Twenty-four articles were selected for the systematic review, whereas eleven were selected for the meta-analysis, for a total of 1077 patients. Survival outcomes between the two groups were similar in terms of 1 year overall survival (OS) (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.31, p = 0.24). Patients who received DP-CAR were more likely to have T4 tumors (OR 28.45, 95% CI 10.46 to 77.37, p < 0.00001) and positive margins (R+) (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.17, p = 0.008). Overall complications (OR, 1.72, 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.58, p = 0.008) were more frequent in the DP-CAR group, whereas rates of pancreatic fistula (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.65, p = 0.41) were similar. Conclusions: DP-CAR was not associated with higher mortality compared to standard DP; however, overall morbidity was higher. Celiac axis involvement should no longer be considered a strict contraindication to surgery in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Considering the different baseline tumor characteristics, DP-CAR may need to be compared with palliative therapies instead of standard DP.","Nigri, Giuseppe; Petrucciani, Niccolò; Belloni, Elena; Lucarini, Alessio; Aurello, Paolo; D’Angelo, Francesco; di Saverio, Salomone; Fancellu, Alessandro; Ramacciato, Giovanni",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073522/,31

Adjusted Odd Ratios (AORs) and 95% Confidence Interval (CIs) of gout for active smoking and SHS were 3.26 (95% CI = 1.07~9.90) and 4.67 (95% CI = 2.18~10.00) compared to non-smokers. Time-dependent manner of active smoking and SHS significantly increased gout risk with AORs and 95% CIs of 5.95 (1.41~25.03) and 10.12 (3.51~29.14). Dose-dependency of active smokers and SHS showed AORs and 95% CIs of 5.15 (1.28~20.63) and 4.37 (1.33~14.28). Smoking 20 cigarettes (one pack) per day for one year is equivalent to one pack-year. Active smoking >20 pack-year and SHS > 26.5 pack-year increased gout risk with AORs and 95% CIs of 7.18 (1.53~33.67) and 9.95 (3.64~27.22). Participants who smoked (active smoking and SHS) and with Body Mass Index (BMI) of > 24.9 kg/m(2) synergistically increased gout risk, with an AOR of 9.65 and 95% CI of 3.25~28.65, compared to BMI ≤ 24.9 kg/m(2) and non-smoker.

However, ultrafiltration failure after peritoneal injury is an important reason for patients to withdraw from PD treatment. Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis, which results in an accelerated process of peritoneal injury due to direct damage from acute inflammation and local release of cytokine TGF-β. In this paper, the application of ultrasound to examine the peritoneum revealed a positive correlation between peritoneal thickness and the development of peritonitis. The results of this study also further confirmed the effect of peritonitis on peritoneal thickening. A multifactorial regression analysis also revealed that peritonitis and its severity were independent risk factors for peritoneal thickening and omental structural abnormalities. This paper reported a correlation between mural peritoneal thickness and peritoneal transit function. In this study, patients with high peritoneal transit and high mean transit were found to be more prone to omental structural abnormalities than patients with low mean and low transit and a higher proportion of patients with mural peritoneal thickening, but this did not reach statistical significance, which may be related to the still small number of cases.","Tong, Jin; Xu, Wangda",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079201/,31

In over 90% of patients the frontal EEG changes somewhat predictably in response to administration of the normally used anesthetic agents (propofol and volatile gasses). An adequate depth of anesthesia and appropriate concentrations of anesthetics in the brain generate mostly frontal oscillations between 8 and 12 Hz as well as slow delta waves between 0.5 and 4 Hz. The frontal EEG channel is well-suited for avoidance of insufficient depth of anesthesia and excessive administration of anesthetics. This article explains the clinical interpretation of the most important EEG patterns and the biophysical background. Also discussed are important limitations and pitfalls for the clinical routine, which the anesthetist should know in order to utilize the EEG as an admittedly incomplete but clinically extremely important parameter for the level of consciousness.","Kaiser, H.

17579,Are Fc Gamma Receptor Polymorphisms Important in HIV-1 Infection Outcomes and Latent Reservoir Size?,2021-05-04,"Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are valuable tools to link genetic information with functional features and to provide a platform for conformational epitope mapping. Additionally, combined data on genetic and functional features provide a valuable mosaic for systems immunology approaches. Strategies to generate human mAbs from peripheral blood have been described and used in several studies including single cell sequencing of antigen-binding B cells and the establishment of antigen-specific monoclonal Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). However, direct comparisons of these two strategies are scarce. Hence, we sought to set up these two strategies in our laboratory using peanut 2S albumins (allergens) and the autoantigen anti-Rho guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2, alternatively ‘ARHGDIB’) as antigen targets to directly compare these strategies regarding costs, time expenditure, recovery, throughput and complexity. Regarding single cell sequencing, up to 50% of corresponding V(D)J gene transcripts were successfully amplified of which 54% were successfully cloned into expression vectors used for heterologous expression. Seventy-five percent of heterologously expressed mAbs showed specific binding to peanut 2S albumins resulting in an overall recovery of 20.3%, which may be increased to around 29% by ordering gene sequences commercially for antibody cloning. In comparison, the establishment of monoclonal EBV-LCLs showed a lower overall recovery of around 17.6%. Heterologous expression of a mAb carrying the same variable region as its native counterpart showed comparable concentration-dependent binding abilities. By directly comparing those two strategies, single cell sequencing allows a broad examination of antigen-binding mAbs in a moderate-throughput manner, while the establishment of monoclonal EBV-LCLs is a powerful tool to select a small number of highly reactive mAbs restricted to certain B cell subpopulations. Overall, both strategies, initially set-up for peanut 2S albumins, are suitable to obtain human mAbs and they are easily transferrable to other target antigens as shown for ARHGDIB.","Ehlers, Anna M.; den Hartog Jager, Constance F.; Kardol-Hoefnagel, Tineke; Katsburg, Miriam M.D.; Knulst, André C.; Otten, Henny G.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8130674/,31

METHODOLOGY: A randomized control trial was conducted amongst class II students of a private school in Korangi, Karachi. Pre-intervention assessment including baseline knowledge and observed practices of hand washing in comparison with World Health Organization (WHO) standard hand washing techniques was done. This was followed by education and demonstration of proper hand washing steps by principal investigator utilizing visual aids. Participants were then randomized into two group: Group A (education only group) and Group B (education along with glow gel application group). First post-intervention assessment was conducted on same day where both groups were observed for the hand washing steps and scored for hand washing technique. In addition, participants of group B were shown germs under Ultraviolet (UV) light. School was revisited after 1 week later and participants were reassessed for their hand washing technique along with cleanliness grade after applying glow gel and observing under UV light. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. RESULT: No significant differences were found in median hand washing scores pre-intervention between both the groups (Group A vs B: 4 vs 5, P value = 0.659), while significant improvement in median hand washing scores was seen post intervention in group B as compared to group A (7 vs 6, P value = 0.011). However, no significant differences were seen in median hand washing scores at follow-up between both the groups (Group A vs B: 9 vs 8.5, P value = 0.715) but a significant improvement was observed in both the groups in the hand washing practices from baseline (P-value = 0.000). On the contrary, no significant differences were found in median cleanliness grade between both the groups (Median for both the groups was 5, P value = 0.695). CONCLUSIONS: Hand washing education utilizing various aids is an effective method to improve children's hand washing capability. This short-term intervention was effective even in absence of glow gel, but no cleanliness of hands was observed in both the groups.","Khan, Samreen; Ashraf, Hiba; Iftikhar, Sundus; Baig-Ansari, Naila",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138401/,31
17901,Mechanism of allosteric activation of SIRT6 revealed by the action of rationally designed activators,2020-09-19,"Electronic mental health services (eMHSs) offer additional options for the dissemination of psychological interventions for university students. Still, many university students are reluctant to use eMHSs. Narrative messages may help increase the awareness and acceptance of quality-approved programs. However, little is known about the usefulness of narrative messages to improve attitudes towards eMHSs. In this experiment, we thus aimed to explore in how far different ways of targeting information to students affect their attitudes towards eMHSs for stress prevention and therapy, and to identify potential determinants of attitude change. N = 451 students (Mean = 32.6 years, SD = 10.2, 75% female, 7% with eMHS experience) were randomly assigned to one of four study arms involving information designed to induce different levels of perceived similarity. While the active control condition only received general information (arm 1, “information only”, n = 116), the other experimental arms were additionally exposed to testimonials on specific eMHSs either addressing an unspecified audience (arm 2, n = 112), employees (arm 3, n = 115) or working university students (arm 4, n = 108). Two-way ANOVA revealed no impact of information on the alteration of attitudes towards eMHSs for stress coping (d = 0.20). Only a small effect of target-group specific testimonials on attitudes towards online therapies was identified at post-intervention (d = 0.29). Regression analyses demonstrated significant influences of source credibility and perceived similarity on attitudes for preventative eMHSs (p(s)<0.01), as well as a partial mediation effect of perceived similarity in favor of testimonials targeted to students (95% CI [0.22, 0.50]). Overall, this study indicated no meaningful impact of information on attitudes and limited evidence for benefits of tailored narrative messages. Since attitudes were already positive at baseline, further research with a representative student sample mimicking real-world decision scenarios is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of acceptance-facilitating message features that may contribute to promote the adoption of evidence-based eMHSs.","Apolinário-Hagen, Jennifer; Harrer, Mathias; Dederichs, Melina; Fritsche, Lara; Wopperer, Jeannette; Wals, Frank; Loerbroks, Adrian; Lehr, Dirk; Salewski, Christel; Angerer, Peter; Ebert, David Daniel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153476/,31

Despite its high prevalence, only half of patients with HF respond to guideline-directed medical management, prompting therapeutic efforts to confront the molecular underpinnings of its heterogeneity. In the current study, we examined epigenetics as a yet unexplored source of heterogeneity among patients with end-stage HF. Specifically, a multicohort-based study was designed to quantify cardiac genome-wide cytosine-p-guanine (CpG) methylation of cardiac biopsies from male patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. In both pilot (n = 11) and testing (n = 31) cohorts, unsupervised multidimensional scaling of genome-wide myocardial DNA methylation exhibited a bimodal distribution of CpG methylation found largely to occur in the promoter regions of metabolic genes. Among the available patient attributes, only categorical self-identified patient race could delineate this methylation signature, with African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) samples clustering separately. Because race is a social construct, and thus a poor proxy of human physiology, extensive review of medical records was conducted, but ultimately failed to identify covariates of race at the time of LVAD surgery. By contrast, retrospective analysis exposed a higher all-cause mortality among AA (56.3%) relative to CA (16.7%) patients at 2 yr following LVAD placement (P = 0.03). Geocoding-based approximation of patient demographics uncovered disparities in income levels among AA relative to CA patients. Although additional studies are needed, the current analysis implicates cardiac DNA methylation as a previously unrecognized indicator of socioeconomic disparity in human heart failure outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A bimodal signature of cardiac DNA methylation in heart failure corresponds with racial differences in all-cause mortality following mechanical circulatory support. Racial differences in promoter methylation disproportionately affect metabolic signaling pathways. Socioeconomic factors are associated with racial differences in the cardiac methylome among men with end-stage heart failure.

18646,"RNA N (6)-Methyladenosine in Cancer Metastasis: Roles, Mechanisms, and Applications",2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including mental health, have become a major concern in low- and middle-income countries. Despite increased attention to them over the past decade, progress toward addressing NCDs has been slow. A lack of bold policy commitments has been suggested as one of the contributors to limited progress in NCD prevention and management. However, the policies of key global actors (bilateral, multilateral, and not-for-profit organisations) have been understudied. METHODS: This study aimed to map the key global actors investing in action regarding NCDs and review their policies to examine the articulation of priorities regarding NCDs. Narrative synthesis of 70 documents and 31 policy papers was completed, and related to data collated from the Global Health Data Visualisation Tool. RESULTS: In 2019 41% of development assistance for health committed to NCDs came from private philanthropies, while that for other global health priorities from this source was just 20%. Through a range of channels, bilateral donors were the other major source of NCD funding (contributing 41% of NCD funding). The UK and the US were the largest bilateral investors in NCDs, each contributing 8%. However, NCDs are still under-prioritised within bilateral portfolios – receiving just 0.48% of US funding and 1.66% of the UK. NGOs were the key channels of funding for NCDs, spending 48% of the funds from donors in 2019. The reviewed literature generally focused on NCD policies of WHO, with policies of multilateral and bilateral donors given limited attention. The analysis of policies indicated a limited prioritisation of NCDs in policy documents. NCDs are framed in the policies as a barrier to economic growth, poverty reduction, and health system sustainability. Bilateral donors prioritise prevention, while multilateral actors offer policy options for NCD prevention and care. Even where stated as a priority, however, funding allocations are not aligned. CONCLUSION: The growing threat of NCDs and their drivers are increasingly recognised. However, global actors’ policy priorities and funding allocations need to align better to address these NCD threats. Given the level of their investment and engagement, more research is needed into the role of private philanthropies and NGOs in this area.

The combination of echocardiographic parameters could potentially improve PESI’s mortality prediction. To assess the additional prognostic value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) when combined with the PESI score in patients with PE to predict short-term mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicentric prospective study database of patients admitted with PE in 75 academic centres in Argentina between 2016 and 2017 was analysed. Patients with an echocardiogram at admission with simultaneous measurement of TAPSE and PASP were included. PESI risk score was calculated blindly and prospectively, and in-hospital all-cause mortality was assessed. Of 684 patients, 91% had an echocardiogram, PASP and TAPSE could be estimated simultaneously in 355 (57%). All-cause in-hospital mortality was 11%. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 0.76 (0.72–0.81), 0.74 (0.69–0.79), and 0.71 (0.62–0.79), for the PESI score, PASP, and TAPSE parameters, respectively. When PESI score was combined with the echocardiogram parameters (PESI + PASP-TAPSE = PESI-Echo), an AUC of 0.82 (0.77–0.86) was achieved (P = 0.007). A PESI-Echo score ≥128 was the optimal cut-off point for predicting hospital mortality: sensitivity 82% (95% CI 67–90%), specificity 69% (95% CI 64–74%). The global net reclassification improvement was 9.9%. CONCLUSIONS: PESI-Echo score is a novel tool for assessing mortality risk in patients with acute PE. The addition of echocardiographic parameters to a validated clinical score improved the prediction of hospital mortality.","Burgos, Lucrecia M; Scatularo, Cristhian E; Cigalini, Ignacio M; Jauregui, Juan C; Bernal, Maico I; Bonorino, José M; Thierer, Jorge; Zaidel, Ezequiel J",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241311/,31

Immunity is only achieved after repeated exposure. There has been a lack of methods to mimic the in vivo co-occurrence, where cells and parasites can be grown together for many days, and it has been difficult with long time in vitro studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A new method for growing P. falciparum in 5% CO(2) with a specially formulated culture medium is described. This knowledge was used to establish the co-culture of live P. falciparum together with human B-cells in vitro for 10 days. The presence of B-cells clearly enhanced parasite growth, but less so when Transwell inserts were used (not allowing passage of cells or merozoites), showing that direct contact is advantageous. B-cells also proliferated more in presence of parasites. Symbiotic parasitic growth was verified using CESS cell-line and it showed similar results, indicating that B-cells are indeed the cells responsible for the effect. In malaria endemic areas, people often have increased levels of atypical memory B-cells in the blood, and in this assay it was demonstrated that when parasites were present there was an increase in the proportion of CD19 + CD20 + CD27 − FCRL4 + B-cells, and a contraction of classical memory B-cells. This effect was most clearly seen when direct contact between B-cells and parasites was allowed. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that P. falciparum and B-cells undoubtedly can affect each other when allowed to multiply together, which is valuable information for future vaccine studies.","Reddy, Sreenivasulu B.; Nagy, Noemi; Rönnberg, Caroline; Chiodi, Francesca; Lugaajju, Allan; Heuts, Frank; Szekely, Laszlo; Wahlgren, Mats; Persson, Kristina E.

One of its subtypes is associated with defective mismatch repair (dMMR) genes. Saffron has many potentially protective roles against colon malignancy. However, these roles in the context of dMMR tumors have not been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of saffron and its constituents in CRC cell lines with dMMR. Methods: Saffron crude extracts and specific compounds (safranal and crocin) were used in the human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116, HCT116+3 (inserted MLH1), HCT116+5 (inserted MSH3), and HCT116+3+5 (inserted MLH1 and MSH3). CDC25b, p-H2AX, TPDP1, and GAPDH were analyzed by Western blot. Proliferation and cytotoxicity were analyzed by MTT. The scratch wound assay was also performed. Results: Saffron crude extracts restricted (up to 70%) the proliferation in colon cells with deficient MMR (HCT116) compared to proficient MMR. The wound healing assay indicates that deficient MMR cells are doing better (up to 90%) than proficient MMR cells when treated with saffron. CDC25b and TDP1 downregulated (up to 20-fold) in proficient MMR cells compared to deficient MMR cells, while p.H2AX was significantly upregulated in both cell types, particularly at >10 mg/mL saffron in a concentration-dependent manner. The reduction in cellular proliferation was accompanied with upregulation of caspase 3 and 7. The major active saffron compounds, safranal and crocin reproduced most of the saffron crude extracts’ effects. Conclusions: Saffron’s anti-proliferative effect is significant in cells with deficient MMR. This novel effect may have therapeutic implications and benefits for MSI CRC patients who are generally not recommended for the 5-fluorouracil-based treatment.","Amin, Amr; Farrukh, Aaminah; Murali, Chandraprabha; Soleimani, Akbar; Praz, Françoise; Graziani, Grazia; Brim, Hassan; Ashktorab, Hassan",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270282/,31

In the present study, we showed that various forms of exogenous vitamins—K(1), K(3), K(2) (MK-4, MK-5, MK-6 and MK-7)—regulated a wide scope of inflammatory pathways in murine macrophages in vitro, including NOS-2, COX-2, cytokines and MMPs. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that macrophages are able to synthesise endogenous MK-4 on their own. Vitamins with shorter isoprenoid chains—K(1), K(3) and MK-5—exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory potential than vitamins with longer isoprenoid chains (MK-6 and MK-7) and simultaneously were preferably used as a substrate for MK-4 endogenous production. Most interesting, atorvastatin pretreatment inhibited endogenous MK-4 production but had no impact on the anti-inflammatory activity of vitamins K. In summary, our results demonstrate that macrophages are able to synthesise endogenous MK-4 using exogenous vitamins K, and statin inhibits this process. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of exogenous vitamins K was independent of endogenous MK-4 synthesis.","Kieronska-Rudek, Anna; Kij, Agnieszka; Kaczara, Patrycja; Tworzydlo, Anna; Napiorkowski, Marek; Sidoryk, Katarzyna; Chlopicki, Stefan",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8303864/,31
19422,Serum Extracellular Vesicle-Derived circHIPK3 and circSMARCA5 Are Two Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers for Glioblastoma Multiforme,2021-06-27,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus is a causative agent of systemic disease in poultry, characterized by high mortality. Rapid diagnosis is crucial for the control of HPAI. In this study, we aimed to develop a differential diagnostic method that can distinguish HPAI from low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses using dual split proteins (DSPs). DSPs are chimeras of an enzymatic split, Renilla luciferase (RL), and a non-enzymatic split green fluorescent protein (GFP). Nanoparticles expressing DSPs, sialic acid, and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were generated, and RL activity was determined in the presence of HPAI or LPAI pseudotyped viruses. The RL activity of nanoparticles containing both DSPs was approximately 2 × 10(6) RLU, indicating that DSPs can be successfully incorporated into nanoparticles. The RL activity of nanoparticles containing half of the DSPs was around 5 × 10(1) RLU. When nanoparticles containing half of the DSPs were incubated with HPAI pseudotyped viruses at low pH, RL activity was increased up to 1 × 10(3) RLU. However, LPAI pseudotyped viruses produced RL activity only in the presence of proteases (trypsin or TMPRSS2), and the average RL activity was around 7 × 10(2) RLU. We confirmed that nanoparticle fusion assay also diagnoses authentic viruses with specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 91.67%. The data indicated that the developed method distinguished HPAI and LPAI, and suggested that the diagnosis using DSPs could be used for the development of differential diagnostic kits for HPAI after further optimization.","Kim, Jihee; Park, Jae-Yeon; Ryu, Jihoon; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Park, Jung-Eun",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310176/,31
19427,Polymer Coated Oncolytic Adenovirus to Selectively Target Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells,2021-06-24,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is the most prevalent HPV type causing cervical cancers. Herein, using 1597 full genomes, we systemically investigated the mutation profiles, surface protein glycosylation sites and the codon usage bias (CUB) of HPV16 from different lineages and sublineages. Multiple lineage- or sublineage-conserved mutation sites were identified. Glycosylation analysis showed that HPV16 lineage D contained the highest number of different glycosylation sites from lineage A in both L1 and L2 capsid proteins, which might lead to their antigenic distances between the two lineages. CUB analysis showed that the HPV16 open reading frames (ORFs) preferred codons ending with A/T. The CUB of HPV16 ORFs was mainly affected by natural selection except for E1, E5 and L2. HPV16 only shared some of the preferred codons with humans, which might help reduce competition in translational resources. These findings increase our understanding of the heterogeneity between HPV16 lineages and sublineages, and the adaptation mechanism of HPV in human cells. In summary, this study might facilitate HPV classification and improve vaccine development and application.","Liu, Wei; Li, Junhua; Du, Hongli; Ou, Zhihua",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310365/,31

Seventy-eight multiparous Polish Holstein–Friesian cows were selected for the experiment. Colostrum samples were collected immediately after calving (up to a max. of 2 h). The cows were divided into groups according to the following levels: Immunoglobulins (IG class)—(IG(1)) over 50 g/L, (IG(2)) up to 50 g/L; SCC class—(SCC(1)) up to 400 000/ml, (SCC(2)) 400–800 000/ml, (SCC(3)) over 800 000/ml. Colostrum assigned to the IG(1) SCC(1) group had a statistically significant higher (p ≤ 0.01) concentration of both whey proteins and fatty acids compared to the IG(1) SCC(2) and SCC(3) groups. The concentration of IgG, IgM, and IgA was shown to be higher in IG(1) SCC(1) than IG(2) SCC(3) by 226%, 149%, and 115%, respectively. The concentration of lactoferrin was shown to be higher in IG(1) SCC(1) than IG(2) SCC(3) by 149%. The determination of colostrum quality based on the concentration of immunoglobulins in the colostrum may not be sufficient because serum IgG concentrations at birth show a linear increase relative to colostrum SCC. A breakdown of colostrum into quality classes, taking into account the level of SCC, should therefore be introduced.","Puppel, Kamila; Gołębiewski, Marcin; Slósarz, Jan; Grodkowski, Grzegorz; Solarczyk, Paweł; Kostusiak, Piotr; Grodkowska, Kinga; Balcerak, Marek; Sakowski, Tomasz",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8333324/,31
19819,Experimental Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma—A Preclinical Perspective,2021-07-21,"The explosive data growth in the current information age requires consistent new methodologies harmonized with the new IoT era for data analysis in a space–time context. Moreover, intuitive data visualization is a central feature in exploring, interpreting, and extracting specific insights for subsequent numerical data representation. This integrated process is normally based on the definition of relevant metrics and specific performance indicators, both computed upon continuous real-time data, considering the specificities of a particular application case for data validation. This article presents an IoT-oriented evaluation tool for Radon Risk Management (RRM), based on the design of a simple and intuitive Indoor Radon Risk Exposure Indicator (IRREI), specifically tailored to be used as a decision-making aid tool for building owners, building designers, and buildings managers, or simply as an alert flag for the problem awareness of ordinary citizens. The proposed methodology was designed for graphic representation aligned with the requirements of the current IoT age, i.e., the methodology is robust enough for continuous data collection with specific Spatio-temporal attributes and, therefore, a set of adequate Radon risk-related metrics can be extracted and proposed. Metrics are summarized considering the application case, taken as a case study for data validation, by including relevant variables to frame the study, such as the regulatory International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dosimetric limits, building occupancy (spatial dimension), and occupants’ exposure periods (temporal dimension). This work has the following main contributions: (1) providing a historical perspective regarding RRM indicator evolution along time; (2) outlining both the formulation and the validation of the proposed IRREI indicator; (3) implementing an IoT-oriented methodology for an RRM indicator; and (4) a discussion on Radon risk public perception, undertaken based on the results obtained after assessment of the IRREI indicator by applying a screening questionnaire with a total of 873 valid answers.","Lopes, Sérgio Ivan; Nunes, Leonel J.

However, the dynamic responses of IBCs to host stresses and antibiotic therapy are difficult to assess in situ. We develop a human bladder-chip model wherein umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells are co-cultured under flow in urine and nutritive media respectively, and bladder filling and voiding mimicked mechanically by application and release of linear strain. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation but does not prevent IBC formation. Subsequently, we tracked bacterial growth dynamics in individual IBCs through two cycles of antibiotic administration interspersed with recovery periods which revealed that the elimination of bacteria within IBCs by the antibiotic was delayed, and in some instances, did not occur at all. During the recovery period, rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs reseeded new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These insights reinforce a dynamic role for IBCs as harbors of bacterial persistence, with significant consequences for non-compliance with antibiotic regimens.","Sharma, Kunal; Dhar, Neeraj; Thacker, Vivek V; Simonet, Thomas M; Signorino-Gelo, Francois; Knott, Graham W; McKinney, John D",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8354636/,31

The normal control group selected 40 patients who came to our center for physical examination. In the normal control group, the average value of the standard uptake value of both sides of the thyroid was used as the SUV of the thyroid gland and the highest SUV value of the patient's lesion (SUV max) represented the SUV of the lesion. After injection of imaging agent 18F-FD1G, routine imaging was performed at 1h, time-lapse imaging was performed at 2.5 h, and the changes with conventional imaging were compared to infer the benign and malignant lesions. We used SPSS software to carry out statistical analysis, respectively, carrying out analysis of variance, paired t-test, independent sample t-test, and linear correlation analysis. In the thyroid cancer group, 87.5% of the delayed imaging SUV was higher than the conventional imaging SUV, while 83.33% of the benign disease group had a lower SUV than the conventional imaging SUV. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients with Tg positive. However, it has lower sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC and 18F-FDG PET/CT. The specificity increases with the increase of serum Tg level. The above results confirm that 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging is of great significance for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients; with PET/CT imaging, the results changed 16.13% of the Tg-positive and 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC patients' later treatment decision.

The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice of primary care physician in Sudan about prediabetes. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among primary care physicians working at two family and primary health care centers in Khartoum. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and expressed as percentages. RESULTS: Out of 200 primary care physicians, 189 completed the questionnaire. 60.8% of the participants had satisfactory knowledge about prediabetes and positive attitude towards prediabetes and their practice was relatively good. Knowledge score was significantly correlated with age (P = 0.000), duration of experience (P value = 0.000), the number of working hours per day (P value = 0.001), and the number patients seen per day (P value = 0.001).

There are currently no studies describing the prevalence of sedative drug use among medical students in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of self-reported sedative drug use among medical students attending the College of Medicine and Health Science (CMHS) students at the University of Gondar (UoG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from May to July 2018 in CMHS at UoG. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered standard questionnaire. Data were collected, entered into a computer using Epi Info 7 software, and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Frequency, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe descriptive statistics, and binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between different variables and sedative drug use; P <0.05 was used to declare association. RESULTS: Of the 422 students who returned questionnaires, 26 (6.2%) participants were reported sedative drug use at some time since enrollment. Of these, 61.54% participants used antihistamine drugs. Smoking status (AOR (95% CI), 0.046 (0.009–0.241) P = 0.0001), stimulant use (AOR (95% CI), 0.220 (0.062–0.780) P = 0.019), sleeping hour (AOR (95% CI), 9.931 (4.155–14.785) P = 0.001) and sleep disorder (AOR (95% CI), 0.149 (0.033–0.680) P = 0.014) were significantly associated with sedative drug use.

20246,Cross‐company collaboration to leverage analytics for clinical quality and accelerate drug development: The IMPALA industry group,2021-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest the importance of non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) in the development of vaccines against HIV-1 because two types of nnAbs that recognize the coreceptor binding site (CoRBS) and the C1C2 region mediate antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV-1-infected cells. However, many studies have been conducted with nnAbs obtained from subtype B-infected individuals, with few studies in patients with non-subtype B infections. RESULTS: We isolated a monoclonal antibody 1E5 from a CRF02_AG-infected individual and constructed two forms of antibody with constant regions of IgG1 or IgG3. The epitope of 1E5 belongs to the C1C2 of gp120, and 1E5 binds to 27 out of 35 strains (77 %) across the subtypes. The 1E5 showed strong ADCC activity, especially in the form of IgG3 in the presence of small CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) and 4E9C (anti-CoRBS antibody), but did not show any neutralizing activity even against the isolates with strong binding activities. The enhancement in the binding of A32, anti-C1C2 antibody isolated from a patient with subtype B infection, was observed in the presence of 1E5 and the combination of 1E5, A32 and 4E9C mediated a strong ADCC activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anti-C1C2 antibodies that are induced in patients with different HIV-1 subtype infections have common functional modality and may have unexpected interactions. These data may have implications for vaccine development against HIV-1.

Previous research has investigated the impact of media richness on user satisfaction; however, little attention has been given to the mixed effects of the nesting of multiple media. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact and differences of the use of single or mixed media on users’ perceived effect from the perspectives of social support and satisfaction by mining user reviews on online health platforms. The data were collected from a professional online psychological counseling platform. We collected data on 48,807 reviews from 11,694 users. Text annotation and sentiment analysis were then used to extract variable eigenvalues from the reviews. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. The results show that mixed media with different richness has a significant impact on the users’ perceived effects. Among them, compared to “text + audio,” using “text + audio + video/face to face” can significantly improve the users’ perceived social support and satisfaction. However, compared to single medium, mixed media with higher richness may not necessarily achieve a better effect. We found that the inclusion of “video/face to face” mixed media significantly reduced the users’ perceived social support and satisfaction compared to text or audio use alone. These research results complement the blank media richness theory in the field of online health care and provide guidance for improving the personalized customization of online psychological counseling platforms.","Liu, Jingfang; Gao, Lu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392227/,31

Hypertension is closely related to cognitive frailty and these two conditions often coexist in aging individuals. Few studies have explored the relationship between hypertension and cognitive frailty in the Chinese population. This study investigates the epidemiological characteristics of and factors related to cognitive frailty in aging Chinese patients with hypertension. In total, cognitive function, weakness, social support, depression and sociodemographic were assessed in 305 participants aged 60 and over. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed. The prevalence of cognitive frailty in aging Chinese hypertensive patients was 9.8% (95% CI = 6.4–13.2%). After adjusting for confounding variables, logistic regression showed that the course of hypertension (6–10 years, OR = 8.588, 95% CI = 1.608–45.859;course of more than 10 years, OR = 9.020, 95%CI = 1.854–43.892), multimorbidity (OR = 11.231, 95% CI = 2.912–43.322), depression (OR = 6.917, 95% CI = 2.424–19.738) and social support (OR = 0.187, 95% CI = 0.071–0.492) were independently associated with cognitive frailty.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) seem to be an appealing alternative to chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients, due to a more tolerable toxicity profile, they can lead to a peculiar variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, data on tolerability and outcome of ICIs in the elderly are lacking due to poor accrual in clinical trials of these patients. Methods: We performed a retro-prospective analysis on patients treated with single agent anti-PD-L1/PD-1 at the Clinical Oncology Unit, Careggi University Hospital, from March 2016 to March 2020. Data on the treatment responses, type and severity of irAEs, as well as the corticosteroids (CCS) dosage used for irAEs and the discontinuation rate, were described per each patient, according to two different age-based cohorts of patients (< or ≥70 years). Results: We reported a lower incidence of all-grade toxicity in elderly compared to younger patients (64.9% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.018). The two age-cohorts showed a different profile of irAEs. Endocrine irAEs were significantly higher in younger patients (39.7% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.002), while dermatologic toxicities were more common in the older group (35.0% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.047). Use of CCS and treatment discontinuation rate do not differ significantly between the two age groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that treatment with ICIs in elderly populations is safe and feasible. Patients over 70 years are more prone to develop skin irAEs, while younger patients are more subject to experience endocrine toxicities.","Paderi, Agnese; Fancelli, Sara; Caliman, Enrico; Pillozzi, Serena; Gambale, Elisabetta; Mela, Marinella Micol; Doni, Laura; Mazzoni, Francesca; Antonuzzo, Lorenzo",Curr Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395507/,31

Moreover, algorithm designers also have to make a trade-off between model’s complexity and accuracy to meet the real-world deployment requirements. To deal with these challenges, we proposed a lightweight YOLO-like object detector with the ability to detect objects in remote sensing images with high speed and high accuracy. The detector is constructed with efficient channel attention layers to improve the channel information sensitivity. Differential evolution was also developed to automatically find the optimal anchor configurations to address issue of large variant in object scales. Comprehensive experiment results show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight models by 5.13% and 3.58% in accuracy on the RSOD and DIOR dataset, respectively. The deployed model on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX embedded board can achieve a detection speed of 58 FPS with less than 10W power consumption, which makes the proposed detector very suitable for low-cost low-power remote sensing application scenarios.","Lang, Lei; Xu, Ke; Zhang, Qian; Wang, Dong",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398883/,31

FDA-approved antiviral therapies against IAV include neuraminidase inhibitors, M2 inhibitors, and polymerase inhibitor baloxavir. Resistance against adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) is widespread as virtually all IAV strains currently circulating in the human population are resistant to adamantanes through the acquisition of the S31N mutation. The neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains also contain the M2-S31N mutant, suggesting M2-S31N is a high-profile antiviral drug target. Here we report the development of a novel deuterium-containing M2-S31N inhibitor UAWJ280. UAWJ280 had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against both oseltamivir sensitive and -resistant influenza A strains and had a synergistic antiviral effect in combination with oseltamivir in cell culture. In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies demonstrated that UAWJ280 had favourable PK properties. The in vivo mouse model study showed that UAWJ280 was effective alone or in combination with oseltamivir in improving clinical signs and survival after lethal challenge with an oseltamivir sensitive IAV H1N1 strain. Furthermore, UAWJ280 was also able to ameliorate clinical signs and increase survival when mice were challenged with an oseltamivir-resistant IAV H1N1 strain. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the M2-S31N channel blocker UAWJ280 has in vivo antiviral efficacy in mice that are infected with either oseltamivir sensitive or -resistant IAVs, and it has a synergistic antiviral effect with oseltamivir.","Cáceres, C.

21533,Ferroptosis is involved in the anti-tumor effect of lycorine in renal cell carcinoma cells,2021-09-13,"Outbreaks of infectious viruses resulting from spillover events from bats have brought much attention to bat‐borne zoonoses, which has motivated increased ecological and epidemiological studies on bat populations. Field sampling methods often collect pooled samples of bat excreta from plastic sheets placed under‐roosts. However, positive bias is introduced because multiple individuals may contribute to pooled samples, making studies of viral dynamics difficult. Here, we explore the general issue of bias in spatial sample pooling using Hendra virus in Australian bats as a case study. We assessed the accuracy of different under‐roost sampling designs using generalized additive models and field data from individually captured bats and pooled urine samples. We then used theoretical simulation models of bat density and under‐roost sampling to understand the mechanistic drivers of bias. The most commonly used sampling design estimated viral prevalence 3.2 times higher than individual‐level data, with positive bias 5–7 times higher than other designs due to spatial autocorrelation among sampling sheets and clustering of bats in roosts. Simulation results indicate using a stratified random design to collect 30–40 pooled urine samples from 80 to 100 sheets, each with an area of 0.75–1 m(2), and would allow estimation of true prevalence with minimum sampling bias and false negatives. These results show that widely used under‐roost sampling techniques are highly sensitive to viral presence, but lack specificity, providing limited information regarding viral dynamics. Improved estimation of true prevalence can be attained with minor changes to existing designs such as reducing sheet size, increasing sheet number, and spreading sheets out within the roost area. Our findings provide insight into how spatial sample pooling is vulnerable to bias for a wide range of systems in disease ecology, where optimal sampling design is influenced by pathogen prevalence, host population density, and patterns of aggregation.","Giles, John R.; Peel, Alison J.; Wells, Konstans; Plowright, Raina K.; McCallum, Hamish; Restif, Olivier",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462156/,31
21540,Traditional ancient Egyptian medicine: A review,2021-06-19,"Nucleic acid test (NAT), most typically quantitative PCR, is one of the standard methods for species specific flavivirus diagnosis. Semi-comprehensive NATs such as pan-flavivirus PCR which covers genus Flavivirus are also available; however, further specification by sequencing is required for species level differentiation. In this study, a semi-comprehensive detection system that allows species differentiation of flaviviruses was developed by integration of the pan-flavivirus PCR and Nanopore sequencing. In addition, a multiplexing method was established by adding index sequences through the PCR with a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline. This enables defining cut-off values for observed read counts. In the laboratory setting, this approach allowed the detection of up to nine different flaviviruses. Using clinical samples collected in Vietnam and Brazil, seven different flaviviruses were also detected. When compared to a commercial NAT, the sensitivity and specificity of our system were 66.7% and 95.4%, respectively. Conversely, when compared to our system, the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial NAT were 57.1% and 96.9%, respectively. In addition, Nanopore sequencing detected more positive samples (n = 8) compared to the commercial NAT (n = 6). Collectively, our study has established a semi-comprehensive sequencing-based diagnostic system for the detection of flaviviruses at extremely affordable costs, considerable sensitivity, and only requires simple experimental methods.","Reteng, Patrick; Nguyen Thuy, Linh; Tran Thi Minh, Tam; Mares-Guia, Maria Angélica Monteiro de Mello; Torres, Maria Celeste; de Filippis, Ana Maria Bispo; Orba, Yasuko; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Hayashida, Kyoko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Hall, William W.; Nguyen Thi, Lan Anh; Yamagishi, Junya",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8463598/,31

Infectious diseases are a worldwide burden that have been deteriorating because of the improvement of species impervious to various anti-infection agents. Hence, the distinguishing proof of antimicrobial specialists with high-power dynamic against MDR microorganisms is central to conquer this issue. Successful treatment of infection involves the improvement of new drugs or some common source of novel medications. Numerous naturally occurring antimicrobial agents can be of plant origin, animal origin, microbial origin, etc. Many plant and animal products have antimicrobial activities due to various active principles, secondary metabolites, or phytochemicals like alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, essential oils, flavonoids, lectins, phagocytic cells, and many other organic constituents. Phytocomplexes’ antimicrobial movement frequently results from a few particles acting in cooperative energy, and the clinical impacts might be because of the direct effects against microorganisms. The restorative plants that may furnish novel medication lead the antimicrobial movement. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antimicrobial properties of the phytocomplexes and natural extracts of the plants that are ordinarily being utilized as conventional medications and then recommended the chance of utilizing them in drugs for the treatment of multiple drug-resistant disease.","Rahman, Md.

METHODS: An online curriculum in movement disorders was implemented across nine neurology residency programs (six intervention, three control), with the objective to determine feasibility, acceptability, and knowledge growth from the curriculum. Residents in the intervention group completed ten modules and a survey. All groups completed pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-tests. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 138 eligible housestaff (62.3%) in the intervention group completed some modules and 74 completed at least half of modules. Seventy-four, 49, and 30 residents completed the pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-tests respectively. Twenty-five of 42 eligible control residents (59.5%) completed at least one test. Mean pre-test scores were not significantly different between groups (6.33 vs. 6.92, p = 0.18); the intervention group had significantly higher scores on immediate post- (8.00 vs. 6.79, p = 0.001) and delayed post-tests (7.92 vs. 6.92, p = 0.01). Residents liked having a framework for movement disorders, appreciated the interactivity, and wanted more modules. Residents completed the curriculum over variable periods of time (1–174 days), and at different times of day. DISCUSSION: This curriculum was feasible to implement across multiple residency programs. Intervention group residents showed sustained knowledge benefit after participating, and residents took advantage of its flexibility in their patterns of module completion. Similar curricula may help to standardize certain types of clinical learning and exposure across residency programs. HIGHLIGHTS: Interactive online tools for resident didactic learning are valuable to residents. Residents learn from interactive online curricula, find the format engaging, and take advantage of the flexibility of online educational tools. Beginner learners appreciate algorithms that help them to approach a new topic.","Schaefer, Sara M.; London, Zachary; Ferrara, Joseph M.; McCoyd, Matthew A.; Cronin, Carolyn; Pharr, Emily Poole; Price, Raymond; Rigby, Heather B.; Vota, Scott; Cincotta, Molly; Slade, Martin D.; Moeller, Jeremy J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462470/,31

Then, we use the term lists as instances to build matrices with the remaining viruses (bacteria) to discover how much the term lists describe the remaining viruses (bacteria). Next, we build a algorithm to rank all remaining viruses (bacteria). We suspect that the higher the ranking of the virus (bacterium) is, the more suspicious they will be potential bio-terrorism weapon.

23667,Pneumonia,2009,"Epidemical crisis prediction is one of the most challenging examples of decision making with uncertain information. As in many other types of crises, epidemic outbreaks may pose various degrees of surprise as well as various degrees of “derivatives” of the surprise (i.e., the speed and acceleration of the surprise). Often, crises such as epidemic outbreaks are accompanied by a secondary set of crises, which might pose a more challenging prediction problem. One of the unique features of epidemic crises is the amount of fuzzy data related to the outbreak that spreads through numerous communication channels, including media and social networks. Hence, the key for improving epidemic crises prediction capabilities is in employing sound techniques for data collection, information processing, and decision making under uncertainty and exploiting the modalities and media of the spread of the fuzzy information related to the outbreak. Fuzzy logic-based techniques are some of the most promising approaches for crisis management. Furthermore, complex fuzzy graphs can be used to formalize the techniques and methods used for the data mining. Another advantage of the fuzzy-based approach is that it enables keeping account of events with perceived low possibility of occurrence via low fuzzy membership/truth-values and updating these values as information is accumulated or changed. In this chapter we introduce several soft computing based methods and tools for epidemic crises prediction. In addition to classical fuzzy techniques, the use of complex fuzzy graphs as well as incremental fuzzy clustering in the context of complex and high order fuzzy logic system is presented.","Tamir, Dan E.; Rishe, Naphtali D.; Last, Mark; Kandel, Abraham",Intelligent Methods for Cyber Warfare,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115031/,31

These new perspectives enrich our understanding by deconstructing migrants as many social groups with competing needs and facing constraints. They also demystify migrant families by examining the power dynamics within these families. New research methodologies, such as ethnography and participatory action research, and new methods, such as photovoice and community map drawing, have been experimented with in order to engage and empower the migrants.

The parties’ respective liability for risks to which the vessel and its cargo might be exposed during the course of the contracted voyage will be of paramount importance. Should they arise, the potential risks might expose the parties, through their insurance, to expensive damage claims. Therefore, the description of the cargo for shipment is one of the crucially important components of the negotiations between the parties to any shipping contract.(1) This requirement becomes especially relevant when it has been estimated that more than 50% of the cargoes transported by sea today may be regarded as dangerous, hazardous, and/or harmful and need to be handled with special care. As a result, a shipper does not have unlimited freedom as to what he may transport by sea. Restrictions on goods which a charterer or shipper may ship are imposed by law, the terms of the contract and statutes. These restrictions are commonly elided into a general proposition that a person sending goods by sea must not ship dangerous goods. Yet it is the case that dangerous goods are often shipped and legitimately so; and the carrier should discharge his normal duties in respect of whatever cargo he has agreed to carry. The real issues, therefore, are to identify what risks are involved in the carriage of the cargo in question, how these risks are allocated between the parties and what the consequences of shipping dangerous goods are.(2)",,The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Sea,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120359/,31

They attach and replicate in the susceptible and permissive hosts and host derived cell lines. They enter the cells either through direct attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Hence, to thwart the invasion by viruses, hosts have developed immunity in ascending stages—intrinsic, innate and adaptive immunity. A robust intrinsic and innate immune response governs an effective adaptive immune response, should that be needed. Both enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses are subject to distinct types of DNA sensors, subject to their site of replication. DNA sensors of viral PAMPs can be classified into three types, based on the location of their PAMPs in the host cellular compartment viz. cell surface, cytoplasmic and nuclear. The host cell membrane both, surface as well as intra cellular, is continuously monitored for the non-host, pathogenic components or PAMPs. Among the intracellular sensors of the viral genome, there are two types—essentially due to the two types of major viral genomes i.e. RNA and DNA sensors. The cytosolic DNA sensors include AIM2, IFI16, cGAS, RNA Pol III, DNA-PK, DDX9, DHX36, DDX41, DDX60, DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1 and MRE11. PYHIN family of sensors include AIM2, IFI16, IFIX and MNDA. Another recently discovered family of sensor called stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), specifically houses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions in association with its upstream sensor, cGAS. Some DNA sensors shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus pre- and post-extraneous DNA binding. These include IFI16, IFIX, RNA Pol III, etc. There is no exclusive nuclear DNA sensor. Many enzymes known to be present in the cells for their obvious primary functions also additionally function as DNA sensors. The DNAse family of sensors include DNAse II and TREX1, which are ubiquitously present in the cell for their housekeeping functions. The RNAse family of sensor includes one member—RNA Pol III. Additionally, DNA-PK also functions to cater to viral DNA sensing. The endosomal DNA sensors include TLR7 and TLR9, which belong to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. The DExD/H-box helicase family include the putative DNA sensors recently discovered including DDX9, DHX36, DDX41 and DDX60. Several other sensors remain to be characterised or are less classified viz. DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1, MRE11. In general, response to a viral RNA or DNA produces three types of responses, namely, production of antiviral cytokines including Types I and III IFNs, release of pro-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors. This chapter discusses the structure, function and mechanism of action of the viral DNA sensors explored till date.","Sapre, Siddhesh U.; Nair, Preethika",Dynamics of Immune Activation in Viral Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121249/,31

They are a prime object of study for at least three reasons: (1) Understanding the way of pathogens affords the basis for preventing and treating the diseases they cause. (2) The interactions of pathogens with their hosts afford valuable insights into the working of the hosts’ cells, in general, and of the host’s immune system, in particular. (3) The co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts allows for transferring knowledge across the two interacting species and affords valuable insights into how evolution works, in general.

They are usually undertaken with the aim of increasing the user friendliness of Corporate IT systems’ user log-on processes. This should result in abolishing the use of multiple username and password combinations the user has to remember and change at different intervals. The SSO aim should be achieved without jeopardizing information security in any way. Increasing user convenience in such a manner will increase user satisfaction with the IT department along with general productivity levels. Cost control related to IT help desks resetting forgotten passwords should follow. SSO can also help organizations address information security compliance requirements, through the central logging (and audit facilities) of all access attempts and authorization decisions granted in relation to the organization’s restricted information resources. Sometimes compliance objectives are in fact the major business driver for SSO. In the consumer space customer loyalty and retention rates are often cited as an important commercial driver for SSO projects. With the advent of the de-perimeterized organization and increased scepticism around ‘Cloud Security’ is SSO still a viable worthwhile goal for organisations? This paper takes a closer look at special security issues arising when an organization attempts to create an Enterprise Single Sign-On (ESSO) solution that includes both legacy applications hosted within traditional organizational firewalls and a new breed of ‘Cloud Based’ solutions that are following the Software as Service (SaaS) model and therefore can be hosted with any number of Service Providers (SP) ‘in the cloud’.","Lasance, Marcus",ISSE 2010 Securing Electronic Business Processes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121900/,31

It is also involved in the regulation of different genes and cellular functions, particularly in the context of inflammation, regeneration and immune control. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency which is often found in chronic, infectious and inflammatory diseases is thought to drive or enhance uncontrolled inflammation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways most often because of cigarette smoking. It has been recognized that repetitive airway infections and systemic consequences or co-morbidities also contribute to the progressive nature of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is known to sneak in from the early stages of COPD, to become highly prevalent at the more severe stages, and may thereby catalyse airway infection, inflammation and systemic consequences. Undoubtedly, vitamin D deficiency enhances bone resorption and osteoporosis in COPD for which appropriate vitamin D supplementation is recommended. However, conflicting evidence has emerged on the extra-calcemic effects of vitamin D in COPD. A recent intervention trial with high-dose supplementation in COPD was only able to reduce exacerbation frequency in the subgroup of patients with lowest baseline vitamin D levels. It confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is a health hazard but that more clinical and experimental studies are needed to explore how vitamin D deficiency may affect airway biology and systemic effects in the context of smoke-induced lung diseases.","Janssens, Wim; Lehouck, An; Decramer, Marc; Gayan-Ramirez, Ghislaine",Vitamin D and the Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121988/,31
25406,Coronavirus Receptors,2005,"Infection of the lung parenchyma, or pneumonia, accounts for over four million deaths per year worldwide (Ferkol and Schraufnagel, Ann Am Thorac Soc 11:404–406, 2014). The condition is common, but also over-diagnosed, in part due to relatively poor laboratory and radiographic diagnostics. Indeed, we continue to rely on antiquated tools such as sputum culture and chest X-ray – the former of which lacks speed and sensitivity, and the latter specificity (Albaum et al. Chest 110:343–50, 1996). The resulting presumptive diagnoses of pneumonia lead to excessive use of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics; indeed, by some estimates, 30–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for lower respiratory tract infection are inappropriate (Kraus, PLoS One 12(3): e0174584, 2017). This approach begets microbial resistance, exposes patients to medication side effects, and puts patients at risk of potentially life-threatening complications including Clostridium difficile colitis. To improve diagnostic certainty in patients with suspected pneumonia, we must begin to consider and implement emerging technologies for efficient and accurate characterization of host responses to infection and identification of pathogens.

It is interestingly to note that only a subset of individuals exposed to potential ALI-inciting insults develop the disorder and the severity of the disease varies from complete resolution to death. In addition, ALI susceptibility and severity are also affected by ethnicity as evidenced by the higher mortality rates observed in African-American ALI patients compared with other ethnic groups in the USA. Moreover, marked differences in strain-specific ALI responses to inflammatory and injurious agents are observed in preclinical animal models. Together, these observations strongly indicate genetic components to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. The identification of genes contributing to ALI would potentially provide a better understanding of ALI pathobiology, yield novel biomarkers, identify individuals or populations at risk, and prove useful for the development of novel and individualized therapies. Genome-wide searches in animal models have identified a number of quantitative trait loci that associate with ALI susceptibility.

Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts? With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. ‘Black Swans’ represent the unpredictable. They represent “… our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises” (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A ‘Black Swan’ is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as 9/11. Sornette (Int J Terraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1–18, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls ‘Dragon Kings’. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible “Dragon-King” type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency.

The standard methyl labeling protocols employ isotope-labeled α-keto acid precursors, which enable selective observations of the methyl groups of Ile, Leu, and Val residues. More recently, the stereo-specific isotope labeling methods of prochiral methyl groups have become available, using either regio-selectively isotope-labeled precursors or stereo-specifically (13)CH(3)-labeled amino acids. We also focus on the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method, which is a breakthrough isotope labeling technology using stereo- and regio-selectively [(2)H, (13)C, (15)N]-labeled amino acids with isotope labeling patterns optimized for NMR studies. Various applications of SAIL and related methods to structural studies, including protein dynamics such as aromatic ring-flipping motions, hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates, conformational analysis, and dynamics about disulfide bonds, will be discussed.","Miyanoiri, Yohei; Takeda, Mitsuhiro; Kainosho, Masatsune",Modern Magnetic Resonance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123952/,31

28105,"Ancient diseases, modern views",2004-03-06,"Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0 and Smart Factory are phenomena regarded as a key necessity for Small, Medium and Micro Businesses (SMMEs) worldwide. Even though these 4(th) Industrial Revolution (4IR) phenomena are generally used interchangeably, this paper sought to identify how SMME readiness for smart manufacturing has been investigated through a systematic review. The systematic review was conducted through the lens of Nooteboom, and Tornatzky and Klein’s research on technological innovation in SMMEs based on Rogers’ diffusion of innovations theory. The findings reveal that there is little to no research on smart manufacturing in relation to SMMEs in low-income countries particularly the African continent. The results also show that smart manufacturing is still an emergent phenomenon with disparate definitional challenges. These definitional challenges make the adoption of smart manufacturing innovations a challenge in resource-constrained contexts; but similarly present an opportunity for new definitions and theories in such contexts. The little research often treats SMMEs homogenously and as such misses their important heterogeneous (sector or industry specific) nature. Few research studies investigate SMME awareness (adequate knowledge) or make explicit the benefits (relative advantage) of smart manufacturing. Even fewer studies are explicit on the smart manufacturing technologies that are relevant for different SMME sectors. Smart manufacturing is identified as incompatible with SMME characteristics, that is SMMEs lack expertise/skills to comprehend the complexity of smart manufacturing, and also lack financial and human resources to implement smart manufacturing. Given that awareness, relative advantage, complexity and compatibility are critical barriers for SMME smart manufacturing readiness/adoption, there is a critical need for research to focus on these factors in particular for the context of resource constrained low-income country environments.","Gumbi, Lucas; Twinomurinzi, Hossana","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134223/,31

GCA and TA display stringent tissue tropism and affect defined vascular territories in a preferential manner. GCA predominantly affects the second- to fifth-order aortic branches, often in the extracranial arteries of the head. The aorta itself may also be affected in GCA, albeit less often than other regions.

32601,Dual-Use and Infectious Disease Research,2020-05-16,"Many lessons for procedural choice have been provided by axiomatic studies of decision procedures. However, there appears to be a gap between these axiomatic studies and the actual determination of appropriate procedures, as an axiomatic characterization does not directly answer which axiom should be appropriate—particularly when there is no agreement on the relative desirability of criteria. The present study proposes a formal model of procedural choice based on preferences over criteria (PCBPC). Specifically, we focus on the aggregation rule that maps a dichotomous preference profile over criteria for decision procedures to a nonempty set of decision procedures. We prove that the counting rule, which chooses the decision procedures with greatest supports, is the unique aggregation rule that satisfies anonymity (A), neutrality (N), strict monotonicity (SM), and partition consistency (PC), where PC is proposed based on the idea that representations of equivalent criteria in different ways should not affect the results. Two distinct standpoints for PCBPC are highlighted: one is to regard criteria as atomic, i.e., inseparable, objects and the other as composite, i.e., separable, objects. The difference between them is made explicit with two impossibility theorems showing the inconsistency between unanimity in the former standpoint and A (or PC) in the latter standpoint.","Suzuki, Takahiro; Horita, Masahide",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215189/,31
32724,Bacterial Infections and the Respiratory Microbiome,2020-02-06,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain has negative consequences on patients’ outcomes after cardiac surgery. Routine management with opioid and or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications has several disadvantages. Dexmedetomidine is a selective α2 agonist used for sedation and analgesia. The use of dexmedetomidine for postoperative pain management and decreasing delirium and agitation in cardiac surgery patients is a matter of debate. Our objective was to determine the role of an early administration of dexmedetomidine in decreasing opioid use post-cardiac surgery and its effects on the quality of postoperative recovery. RESULTS: Medical records of 120 patients admitted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in two cardiac centers between December 2015 and December 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 55 patients who received dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/h on admission to CSICU, and group B included 65 patients who did not receive dexmedetomidine. The primary outcome was the pain score immediately after extubation, and the secondary outcomes included post-extubation sedation and pain scores for 12 h. There were significant decrease of the pain scores in dexmedetomidine group that continues through the 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 12th hour readings after surgery with mean modified Ramsay scores 0.1 ± 0.0, 0.89 ± 2.05, 0.35 ± 0.1, and 0.12 ± 1.1 respectively compared to 0.46 ± 1.15, 3.46 ± 2.93, 0.98 ± 1.90, and 0.12 ± 1.1 in group B (p < 0.001), significant decrease in cumulative morphine received (p < 0.001, OR = 909, 95% CI 0.05–0.19), favorable reduction in heart rate in dexmedetomidine group (80 ± 1.9 b/min) compared to 96 ± 8.8 b/min in the other group (p = 0.017), and smoother recovery from general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Administration of dexmedetomidine in the early postoperative period can be safe. It may reduce the use of opioids, has sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic effects that could play a useful role during the management of coronary artery bypass patients, and may improve postoperative recovery.","Hamouda, Tamer; Ismail, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Tamer Hamed; Ewila, Hesham; Elmahrouk, Ahmed",Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223605/,31

This assumption, which may constitute a severe bottleneck in the practical use of ML, is relaxed in weakly supervised learning. In this ML paradigm, training instances are not necessarily precisely labeled. Instead, annotations are allowed to be imprecise or partial. In the setting of superset learning, instances are assumed to be labeled with a set of possible annotations, which is assumed to contain the correct one. In this article, we study the application of rough set theory in the setting of superset learning. In particular, we consider the problem of feature reduction as a mean for data disambiguation, i.e., for the purpose of figuring out the most plausible precise instantiation of the imprecise training data. To this end, we define appropriate generalizations of decision tables and reducts, using information-theoretic techniques based on evidence theory. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of the associated computational problems.","Campagner, Andrea; Ciucci, Davide; Hüllermeier, Eyke",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274316/,31

Second, in every time step, we apply the residual minimization method for stabilization of the numerical solution. Third, we use isogeometric analysis with B-spline basis functions for the numerical discretization. We perform alternating directions splitting of the resulting system of linear equations, so the computational cost of the sequential LU factorization is linear [Formula: see text]. We test our method on the three-dimensional simulation of the advection-diffusion problem.

Structural equation modeling was used to study the relationship between the risk of in‐store infection, emotions and in‐shop behavior, based on data retrieved from 914 questionnaires. Results showed, that the perceived risk of becoming infected in a store causes an increase in arousal and, at the same time, a decrease in perceived pleasure during shopping. The rise in arousal led to an increase in consumers taking actions to decrease their risk of contagion, while an increase in noticeable pleasure lowered interest of following recommendations for pandemic behavior. The findings imply that through changes regarding in‐store atmosphere, stationary shops can provide consumers with a sense of urgency and awareness of infection risk so that they may do their shopping more efficiently.","Szymkowiak, Andrzej; Gaczek, Piotr; Jeganathan, Kishokanth; Kulawik, Piotr",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7436385/,31

Adapting Sarah Sharma’s concepts of power-chronography and temporal politics, I problematize my COVID-enforced slow time, and explore more deeply how my fraught COVID time experiences intersect with the multiple COVID times of others. I use this methodological format—autoethnography, thick description, and theorization—to make sense of my pandemic experiences at both microscopic and massive levels.","Sarkar, Sucharita",Qual Inq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7509239/,31
40099,Prognostic Implications of Metabolism Related Gene Signature in Cutaneous Melanoma,2020-09-09,"COVID-19 has wreaked havoc worldwide. Schools have escaped neither the pandemic nor its consequences. Indeed, by April 2020, schools had been suspended in 189 countries, affecting 89% of learners globally. While the Australian government has implemented variously effective health and economic policies in response to COVID-19, their inability to agree with states on education policy during the pandemic caused considerable confusion and anxiety. Accordingly, this study analyses 3 weeks of Tweets during April, leading up to the beginning of term 2, during the height of Government policy incongruity. Findings confirm a wide and rapidly changing range of public responses on Twitter. Nine themes were identified in the quantitative analysis, and six of these (positive, negative, humorous, appreciation for teachers, comments aimed at Government/politicians and definitions) are expanded upon qualitatively. Over the course of 3 weeks, the public began to lose its sense of humour and negative tweets almost doubled.","Ewing, Lee-Ann; Vu, Huy Quan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520655/,31

STUDY DESIGN: We computationally collected and analyzed ventilator data of babies ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with VG (n = 28) or without VG (n = 8). RESULT: The expiratory tidal volume of ventilator inflations was lower with SIMV-VG (median [IQR]: 4.9 [4.6–5.3] mL/kg) than with SIMV only (median [IQR]: 7.1 [5.3–8.0] mL/kg, p = 0.01). Babies receiving SIMV-VG had lower peak inflating pressures (median: 10.7 cmH(2)O, versus 17.5 cmH(2)O, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in minute ventilation or in pCO(2). Babies with strong spontaneous breathing had a mean PIP < 10 cmH(2)O but this did not result in adverse events or worsening of acidosis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of VG ventilation in babies with HIE reduces tidal volumes and frequently results in very low inflating pressures without affecting pCO(2).","Lantos, Lajos; Berenyi, Aniko; Morley, Colin; Somogyvari, Zsolt; Belteki, Gusztav",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520879/,31
40997,Use of adenovirus type-5 vectored vaccines: a cautionary tale,2020-10-19,"Alcohol sponsorship of sport in New Zealand, especially rugby, has a long history, but in recent times government-resourced reviews together with public health agencies, activists, and academics have proposed a ban of alcohol sponsorship of sport to help reduce alcohol-related harm. Responses to a proposed ban from a number of diverse sectors, including the alcohol industry and sport organizations, have ranged from ambiguous to resistant. Yet, the conditions for implementing a ban are poorly understood and there has been no change to state-regulated sponsorship policy to date. These widely publicized debates serve as a hotbed for discussions with provincial rugby union managers to consider the economic risks as well as the social connections between rugby clubs and cultural and civic life. In this paper, we address important new questions that query how the alcohol sponsorship debate plays out at a micro-level and the extent to which regional rugby unions may constitute a special case in terms of resistance to and the potential effects of regulation. The discussion expands the debate by drawing attention to the perceived positive effects of alcohol sponsorship as an enabler for addressing other social issues at a micro-level.","Gee, Sarah; Batty, Rachel; Millar, Patti",Int J Sociol Leis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7558246/,31

However, proteomic profiling of a large cohort of cancer tissues is often limited by the conventional approaches. METHODS: We present a proteomic landscape of 16 major types of human cancer, based on the analysis of 126 treatment-naïve primary tumor tissues, 94 tumor-matched normal adjacent tissues, and 12 normal tissues, using mass spectrometry-based data-independent acquisition approach. RESULTS: In our study, a total of 8527 proteins were mapped to brain, head and neck, breast, lung (both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers), esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, kidney, bladder, prostate, uterus and ovary cancers, including 2458 tissue-enriched proteins. Our DIA-based proteomic approach has characterized major human cancers and identified universally expressed proteins as well as tissue-type-specific and cancer-type-specific proteins. In addition, 1139 therapeutic targetable proteins and 21 cancer/testis (CT) antigens were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our discoveries not only advance our understanding of human cancers, but also have implications for the design of future large-scale cancer proteomic studies to assist the development of diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in multiple cancers.","Zhou, Yangying; Lih, T.

43157,Relationship Between T-Cell Exosomes and Cellular Subsets in SLE According to Type I IFN-Signaling,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: More than half of the unaccompanied young refugees (UYRs) resettled in Europe report elevated levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and comorbid symptoms. Earlier studies have highlighted the effectiveness of the trauma-focused preventive group intervention “Mein Weg” (English “My Way”), and the feasibility of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for UYRs. Both interventions are deemed to be empirically supported treatments (ESTs). However, UYRs seldom receive ESTs or, in fact, any treatment at all. In view of the high need and the limited treatment resources available, a stepped-care approach is indicated but has not been evaluated so far. The purpose of this trial is to compare the stepped-care approach BETTER CARE with usual care enhanced with screening and indication (usual care+). METHODS: In a cluster randomized controlled trial involving N = 540 UYRs living in up to N = 54 child and youth welfare service (CYWS) facilities, BETTER CARE will be compared with usual care+. We will randomize clusters comprising a CYWS facility with at least one eligible psychotherapist. BETTER CARE consists of step (1) screening and indication and either step (2) preventive trauma-focused group intervention “Mein Weg” delivered by trained CYWS staff or step (3) TF-CBT delivered by trained community therapists and supported by trained translators if necessary. Participants will be assessed 6 and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is the severity of PTSS after 12 months. Secondary outcomes are depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and proxy reported PTSS. Furthermore, drug use, health costs, benefits, and long-term effects on integration/acculturation will be assessed. DISCUSSION: The trial will directly integrate a stepped-care approach into existing structures of the German child welfare and (mental) health system. It could, therefore, serve as a blueprint for how to implement ESTs for UYRs. If successful, screening, prevention, and intervention will be sustainably implemented in CYWS in southern Germany.

The three stations in the second step of the procedure, the biographical one-on-one interview, presentation and discussion on a subject-specific topic as well as multiple mini interviews (MMI) on the social skills of the applicants were audiovisual and in real time in zoom meetings. Project description: The medical, psychological and student reviewers were prepared for the virtual selection procedure in training sessions. Three weeks before the selection days, the applicants received information on the technical requirements for the interviews and on data protection for the persons affected by the collection of personal data. The evaluation of the virtual selection procedure was carried out by the reviewers using an online questionnaire with 8 socio-demographic, 5 organizational, 8 content and 3 open questions. Results: The 108 reviewers conducted selection interviews in tandems (medical/psychological and student reviewers) with 178 applicants for human medicine and 105 applicants for psychology. The online evaluation by 58 reviewers (response rate 53.7%) showed a positive agreement with the virtual selection procedure, with a more favorable assessment of organization and content by the medical and psychological reviewers compared to the student reviewers. Discussion: The adequate adaptation of the selection procedure of the UW/H to the virtual zoom room as well as its acceptance are confirmed by the successful execution of the selection days for the students for the winter semester 2020/21 and the evaluation of the reviewers. Conclusion: The results and analysis of this exceptional situation will be used to also conduct the upcoming selection procedure for the summer semester 2021 in the virtual space. A valid assessment for the future use of a virtual selection procedure as a possible supplement to the personal selection interviews at the University of Witten/Herdecke remains to be made.","Zupanic, Michaela; Schulze-Rohr, Judith; Nitsche, Julia; Ostermann, Thomas; Hofmann, Marzellus; Ehlers, Jan P.",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740028/,31

However, its efficacy relies upon student access to suitable technology and the internet, and the quality of the online course material. With the COVID-19 outbreak, education providers worldwide were forced to turn to e-learning to retain their student base and allow them to continue learning through the pandemic. However, in geographically remote, developing nations, many students may not have access to suitable technology or internet connections. Hence it is important to understand the potential of e-learning to maintain equitable access to education in such situations. This study found the majority (88%) of commencing students at the University of the South Pacific owned at least one ICT device and had access to the internet. Similarly, most students had adequate to strong ICT skills and a positive attitude toward e-learning. These attitudes among the student cohort, in conjunction with the previous experience of The University of the South Pacific in distance education, are likely to have contributed to its relatively successful transition from face-to-face to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, Joel B.; Reddy, Pritika; Chand, Ronil; Naiker, Mani",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7946445/,31

Contrary to this, second study conducted after pandemic outbreak found that major constructs proposed in the PVT behaved otherwise regarding the characteristics of process virtualization. To fill the gaps in empirical knowledge, the enablers and inhibitors so found together may be motivations to anticipate business organizations and their workforces to experiment with this form of work process, predominantly improved flexibility for organizations and employees, improved productivity, quicker responsiveness to the needs and unexpected man-made and natural disasters, lower absenteeism, improved employee retention, greater cost control, along with more general social benefits.","Agrawal, Kalyan Prasad; Pani, Ashis K.; Sharma, Rajeev",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978928/,31

These events and disasters threaten the attainment of the ambitious targets outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. While intense tropical cyclones, extreme floods, fires, droughts and record polar ice melting characterised 2019, the year 2020 ushered in COVID-19, a global pandemic that has left a trail of untold suffering and economic disruption. Although the pandemic is known to have shaken citizens around the globe, to date, there is very little knowledge of how this has affected various economic sectors. Nevertheless, the tourism industry appears to have suffered a serious blow. This study investigated how one subsector of tourism, namely, aviation, was affected by and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using critical document analysis, the study found that the aviation sector was brought to a halt, costing billions of dollars in losses around the world. COVID-19 also resulted in job losses along the entire aviation industry’s value chain and in related sectors; these were due to losses in passenger revenue, cargo revenue, air ticket refunds, fixed costs and increased parking fees for grounded aircraft, among other things. The study identified various strategies that were used to provide relief, including private and public funding through bailouts, tax deferment, waiver of individual taxes, provision of grants and low-interest loans. They also recommend additional documentation of impacts as they continue unfolding, thus providing valuable lessons for handling any future disasters.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980003/,31

BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HTN) has been found to increase the risk of Covid-19 mortality when compared with normotensives, and those discontinuing the antihypertensive treatment have an additional fatality risk. OBJECTIVE: The survey was carried out to seek the opinion of Indian healthcare practitioners (HCPs) on the risk factors, challenges and management of HTN during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: This was a structured web-based objective questionnaire survey involving 2545 HCPs PAN-India. The survey comprised questions related to the risk factors for HTN, home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), BP control, treatment, complications and challenges of uncontrolled HTN during Covid-19. RESULTS: This study showed that tobacco use, obesity and comorbidities are top three modifiable risk factors for HTN followed by emotional stress, during Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of HCPs (44%) reported that <30% of their hypertensive patients check BP at home while 36% and 20% reported that 30-50% and >50% of their patients respectively, practice HBPM. 20%, 63%, and 17% of HCPs respectively, reported that <20%, 20-40% and >40% of their patients presented with BP > 150/100 mmHg during lockdown. Of all the HCPs, 53% and 33% respectively, reported BP increase in <20% and 20-40% of their patients on monotherapy while 14% of HCPs reported BP increase in >40% of their patients on monotherapy during the lockdown. As compared to high dose monotherapy, dual and triple combination therapies (TDC) were selected as most preferred for the management of uncontrolled BP opted by 56% and 34% of the HCPs, respectively. The dual combination antihypertensives were ranked as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) + diuretic (DU) > ARB + calcium channel blockers (CCB) > ARB + beta-blocker. The TDC with ARB + CCB + DU was the most favored TDC antihypertensive therapy during Covid-19 era. Acute coronary syndrome was anticipated as the most common complication of HTN in the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by renal dysfunction, cerebral ischemia and cerebral hemorrhage reported by 47%, 17%, 14% and 14% of HCPs, respectively. Multiple challenges in HTN care during Covid-19 as opined by HCPs included BP measurement while avoiding the risk of infection (57%), advising treatment via teleconsultation (48%), dose modification (41%), patient compliance (32%) and transport-related issues (30%). Most of the HCPs believed that self-monitoring of BP (32%) and economical medicines (24%) can improve medication adherence in patients with HTN. CONCLUSION: The study underlined that the provision of economic medicines, single pill combinations, doctor-patient digital connect, and patient education can help in improving medication adherence leading to better outcomes in patients with HTN during Covid-19. The study also suggested the need to enhance HBPM and the use of ARB-based dual and triple combination therapies to improve BP control in patients uncontrolled on monotherapy during Covid-19 pandemic.","Abhyankar, M; Majumder, B; Agarwal, DK; Amarnath, KA; Jha, MUKESH; Kumar, BK; Revankar, S; Silki, SILKI; Surase, VIJAY",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136034/,31

Main funding source(s): the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic - conceptual development of research organization (65269705) Background Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including in Central Europe. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) represents an efficient secondary prevention model, but it is highly underutilised. Barriers to CR in the Czech Republic (and in Central Europe) are not well-characterised, and therefore we present a study to define these barriers. Purpose Through this study, a reliable and valid means of assessing patient""s CR barriers will be established. Results will be used to identify ways to help patients overcome barriers to CR and potentially contribute to improving CR utilisation in this region. Methods This is a multi-method study. First, in 2019, we professionally translated and cross-culturally validated the Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale to Czech (CRBS-CZE), and piloting it in 50 cardiac patients. A prospective study was undertaken to psychometrically-validate the CRBS-CZE, where patients eligible for phase II/outpatient CR were recruited. The internal reliability of the scale was assessed with Cronbach""s alpha. In total, 143 eligible patients (target of 200-300 patients) in the University Hospital Brno was approached from January 2020 for one year. Consenting participants were informed about the CR program and their sociodemographic (age, sex, highest educational attainment, work status, travel time), clinical characteristics (diagnosis, anthropometrics, blood pressure, lipids levels, diabetes), heart-healthy behaviours (level of physical activity, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol), and the CRBS-CZE administered. Mean CRBS-CZE scores (21-items/barriers, five-point Likert scale) were analysed to determine key barriers in this setting. To test construct validity, differences in CRBS-CZE total scores were compared by patient characteristics outlined above, using a t-test and Pearson""s correlation. Patient""s enrollment, adherence, and completion of the CR program (% of 24 prescribed sessions attended) were tracked. Results (preliminary) The CRBS-CZE had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .74). Mean total perceived barriers were significantly greater among non-enrollers (2.1, SD = .57) than CR enrollers (1.8, SD = .53), and among rural (2.2, SD = .54) than urban inhabitants (1.7, SD = .46) (p < .05). The long distance from CR facilities (mean commuting time about 50 mins), a little free time, and the transportation problems were identified as the greatest barriers. From all eligible patients, 19.6% entered and 10.5% completed the CR program. The mean completion rate was 70.6%. The main limitations of the study were a small number of participants and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The CRBS-CZE has shown adequate validity and reliability, which supports its use in future studies. Results also point to suboptimal CR availability in the Czech Republic. This finding, especially in the pandemic situation, promotes the need for CR alternatives like home-based programs and telerehabilitation.","Winnige, P; Batalik, L; Filakova, K; Hnatiak, J; Dosbaba, F",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136069/,31

To contain the spread of the infection, a complete lockdown was enforced from March 25 to May 31, 2020 in India. During the unlock phase from June 1, 2020, only limited mobility was allowed. At present, in the pandemic, mass media is playing a very important role in sharing information and connecting people. The objective of this study is to understand the role and impact of mass media in the general public during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study has been conducted on the above 10-year aged population by the online survey through Google spreadsheets. The semi-structured questionnaire was circulated to the known contacts in north Indian states for responses. The data collection started on June 23 and was closed on July 3, 2020. RESULTS: This study shows that the use of internet/social media was the highest, followed by TV news before and during lockdown. The use of the internet and TV news increased during the lockdown and the use of newspapers, radio, and magazine declined significantly. The anxiety due to COVID-related news through mass media was reported highest (27.3 %) in the 40–49 years age group and lowest (14.49%) in the 20–29 age group. About 43.18% of people of 30–39 years of age group developed fear, and 28% of 50–59 age groups felt panic due to COVID-related news in media. It has been found that the use of social media is highest in the 20–29 age group followed by 10–19 years age group CONCLUSION: Mass media is playing a very important role in the dissemination of the COVID-related information to the general public in north India.

Among these attempts, computational drug screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 has potential for: (1) narrowing down billions of chemical compounds into a list of possible high‐affinity ligands for SARS‐CoV‐2 protein targets, (2) providing information about the activities of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins, (3) offering possible treatments, and (4) assisting in scientific knowledge to fight against future coronavirus infections. In this work, computational ligand screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 is a combination of site prediction using machine learning technology Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) and molecular docking. Among the techniques deployed, the machine learning technology POOL was developed by us and assists in the drug screening process for SARS‐CoV‐2 by predicting targeted protein sites, including those that are not the obvious catalytic sites, such as exosites, allosteric sites, and other interaction sites. Results will be presented for the SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease, non‐structural protein 1 (Nsp1), non‐structural protein 9 (Nsp9), and non‐structural protein 15 (Nsp15). Compounds are taken from a variety of libraries, including the ZINC and Enamine databases. Protein structures are downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Molecular dynamic structure simulations are used to generate structures for ensemble docking.","Vu, Hoang; Iyengar, Suhasini; Barnsley, Kelton; Ondrechen, Mary; Beuning, Penny",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239782/,31
55940,"Infectious Diseases, Trade, and Economic Growth: a Panel Analysis of Developed and Developing Countries",2021-07-21,"The molecular evolutionary dynamics that shape hantaviruses’ evolution are poorly understood even now, besides the contribution of virus-host interaction to their evolution remains an open question. Our study aimed to investigate these two aspects in Hantaan virus (HTNV)—the prototype of hantaviruses and an emerging zoonotic pathogen that infects humans, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS): endemic in Far East Russia, China, and South Korea—via a comprehensive, phylogenetic-dependent codon usage analysis. We found that host- and natural reservoir-induced natural selection is the primary determinant of its biased codon choices, exceeding the mutational bias effect. The phylogenetic analysis of HTNV strains resulted in three distinct clades: South Korean, Russian, and Chinese. An effective number of codon (ENC) analysis showed a slightly biased codon usage in HTNV genomes. Nucleotide composition and RSCU analyses revealed a significant bias toward A/U nucleotides and A/U-ended codons, indicating the potential influence of mutational bias on the codon usage patterns of HTNV. Via ENC-plot, Parity Rule 2 (PR2), and neutrality plot analyses, we would conclude the presence of both mutation pressure and natural selection effect in shaping the codon usage patterns of HTNV; however, natural selection is the dominant factor influencing its codon usage bias. Codon adaptation index (CAI), Relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and Similarity Index (SiD) analyses uncovered the intense selection pressure from the host (Human) and natural reservoirs (Striped field mouse and Chinese white-bellied rat) in shaping HTNV biased codon choices. Our study clearly revealed the evolutionary processes in HTNV and the role of virus-host interaction in its evolution. Moreover, it opens the door for a more comprehensive codon usage analysis for all hantaviruses species to determine their molecular evolutionary dynamics and adaptability to several hosts and environments. We believe that our research will help in a better and deep understanding of HTNV evolution that will serve its future basic research and aid live attenuated vaccines design.","Ata, Galal; Wang, Hao; Bai, Haoxiang; Yao, Xiaoting; Tao, Shiheng",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283416/,31

The capsid protein is an attractive goal for anti-DENV due to its position in the dengue existence cycle. The widely accessible immunological data, advances in antigenic peptide prediction using reverse vaccinology, and the introduction of molecular docking in immunoinformatics have directed vaccine manufacturing. The C-proteins of DENV-1-4 serotypes were known as antigens to assist with logical design. Binding epitopes for TC cells, TH cells, and B cells is predicted from structural dengue virus capsid proteins. Each T cell epitope of C-protein integrated with a B cell as a templet was used as a vaccine and produce antibodies in contrast to serotype of the dengue virus. A chimeric tetravalent vaccine was created by combining four vaccines, each representing four dengue serotypes, to serve as a standard vaccine candidate for all four Sero groups.

METHODS A scoping review of peer reviewed literature was conducted in two phases. Phase I: Searching seven databases, two independent raters screened articles using a set of predetermined criteria. Included articles were reviewed, and categorized according to common themes. Phase II: Five stakeholders were engaged in a consultation. A content analysis was performed by extracting statements from each interview using an inductive strategy, and organizing each into themes. FINDINGS A total of 11 articles were included in the final analysis. Inter-rater reliability was assessed at both the title and abstract search [98.8% agreement; k = 0.3425 (95% CI, .246 to .439), p < .05]; and the full-text review [83% agreement; k = 0.542 (95% CI, 0.340 to 0.745), p < .05] phases. Seven articles identified potential interventions, and four identified and evaluated an intervention. Interventions targeted subjective burden (n = 4) and objective burden (n = 4), with caregiver knowledge and skill development (n = 3) classified as a sub-category of objective burden. Stakeholders overwhelmingly emphasized the need for interventions to reduce objective burden. IMPLICATIONS Included articles were primarily composed of levels six and seven evidence, suggesting that this literature is in an early stage of development. Future research should emphasize the development and evaluation of interventions to reduce objective burden.","Marshall, Carrie Anne; Nalder, Emily; Colquhoun, Heather; Lenton, Erica; Hansen, Melissa; Dawson, Deirdre R; Zabjek, Karl; Bottari, Carolina",Brain injury,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2018.1553308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500265/,31

This multicenter retrospective register study aimed to evaluate the impact of retriever passes on treatment efficacy and safety outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in anterior circulation and treated with mechanical thrombectomy were enrolled. The primary efficacy outcome was a favorable functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. Major safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the impact of retriever passes on efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS Of the 472 enrolled patients, the likelihood of favorable outcome declined in patients with more than three retriever passes (44.4% in patients with three passes, 26.3% with four passes, 14.8% with five or more passes). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three or less passes as an independent predictor for favorable functional outcomes (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.10-5.45, P = 0.029). More than three passes was associated with an increased risk of SICH (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16-4.33, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS More than three retriever passes may increase the rate of recanalization, but not the likelihood of favorable functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Notably, multiple retriever passes may also increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

60307,Modified radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.,2016,"Nitro-fatty acids are a class of endogenous electrophilic lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in a wide range of inflammatory and fibrotic disease models. While these beneficial biological effects of nitro-fatty acids are mainly attributed to their ability to form covalent adducts with proteins, only a small number of proteins are known to be nitro-alkylated and the scope of protein nitro-alkylation remains undetermined. Here we describe the synthesis and application of a clickable nitro-fatty acid probe for the detection and first global identification of mammalian proteins that are susceptible to nitro-alkylation. 184 high confidence nitro-alkylated proteins were identified in THP1 macrophages, majority of which are novel targets of nitro-fatty acids, including extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). In particular, we showed that 9-nitro-oleate covalently modified and inhibited dexamethasone binding to NR3C1. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that nitro-alkylated proteins are highly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and transmembrane proteins, and are overrepresented in lipid metabolism and transport pathways. This study significantly expands the scope of protein substrates targeted by nitro-fatty acids in living cells and provides a useful resource towards understanding the pleiotropic biological roles of nitro-fatty acids as signaling molecules or as multi-target therapeutic agents.","Fang, Ming-Yu; Huang, Kuan-Hsun; Tu, Wei-Ju; Chen, Yi-Ting; Pan, Pei-Yun; Hsiao, Wan-Chi; Ke, Yi-Yu; Tsou, Lun K; Zhang, Mingzi M",Redox biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.102126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509914/,31

In this study, we review our experience in laparoscopic non-resectional management for children who presented with non-traumatic colonic perforation. METHODS Between October 2003 and May 2011, 15 children who had been diagnosed with colonic perforation and underwent laparoscopic surgery were included in the study. Their medical records were reviewed for analysis. RESULTS The clinical manifestation of non-traumatic colon perforation in children was non-specific. The most likely aetiology was infective colitis. Solitary perforation at the caecum was the most common finding. The exact perforation site could not be identified in 3 patients. Nine patients had primary closure while 3 patients underwent wedge resection. The single trocar laparoscopic surgery was successful in 12 patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.3 days. CONCLUSION For children presenting with suspected non-traumatic colon perforation, laparoscopic management is the desirable approach. The peritoneal lavage, wedge excision and primary repair can be performed with single trocar techniques and is associated with minimal morbidity. Future prospective studies are needed to compare this minimally invasive approach with conventional open surgery.","Chiang, Li Wei; Lee, Shin-Yi",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-012-3246-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23307021/,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective interventional case series (design classification: Canadian Task Force II3) performed in the endoscopic unit of a tertiary care referral facility and university hospital. We assessed 15 symptomatic parous women with stage ≥2 apical POP according to the POP Quantification (POP-Q) classification. Interventions comprised posterior colpotomy with mesh fixation to the uterosacral ligaments and the back of the uterus that was further fixed to the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum using a tacker via laparoscopy. RESULTS The main outcome was a significant postoperative improvement in prolapse and resultant improvement in quality of life (QoL) after VLS. Six patients required concomitant reconstructive procedures. Mean operative time for the vaginal phase was 8.54 ± 3.10 (7-12) min and 32.36 ± 8.2 (27-41) min. for the laparoscopic phase Mean duration of VLS ranged from 30 to 50 min. At the 6-months follow-up, the procedure was successful in 14 of 15 patients (93.34%); one woman (6.66%) presented with recurrence at a lower stage. Neither mesh complications nor sacral ostitis were encountered. There was significant improvement in vaginal symptoms, sexual well-being, QoL, and clinical staging after the procedure. CONCLUSION By eliminating all forms of intraperitoneal suturing, performing a posterior colpotomy, and the advent of tackers without evidence of sacral ostitis, VLS seems to be a simple, feasible, effective, and fast approach for treating POP.","Darwish, Atef; Bahlol, Mostafa; Ahmad, AbdelGhafar; Fekry, Mohamed",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-017-3511-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159667/,31

Notwithstanding, reports describing its adoption in children are still fragmentary and some perplexities have been raised by some surgeons. We reviewed our experience with the SILS Palomo varicocelectomy procedure (SIL-V) in children and adolescents, comparing this group with a similar series operated using conventional laparoscopic varicocelectomy (CL-V). PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 69 Palomo laparoscopic varicocelectomies were performed in patients aged 11-17 years from January 2011 to January 2013. Indications for surgery included grades II-III varicocele or ipsilateral testicular hypotrophy. The SIL-V procedure was performed in 44 patients with roticulating and conventional 5 mm instruments. Testicular vessels were isolated ""en bloc,"" clipped and cut. Operating time, visual analogue scale and post-operative results were compared to a similar group of 25 patients operated with CL-V. RESULTS No patient of the SIL-V group required conversion to conventional laparoscopy, none to open surgery. Mean operative time was 22 min (range: 19-28) in the SIL-V group, not significantly different compared with CL-V (mean 21 min, range: 18-25). All patients experienced a smooth recovery from surgery without any complications, and were discharged on day 1. No difficulties were found in the SIL-V group. The post-operative pain score was significantly better in SIL-V. CONCLUSION The SIL-V procedure is safe and effective and allows a fast and efficient isolation of the vascular bundle.

Factors such as surgical technique or mesh features are thought to be highly influent. The aim was to evaluate the impact of the defect size, the mesh overlap and the fixation depth on VHR using both physical and numerical models. METHODS The physical model was developed to mimic a passive abdominal wall. Healthy, damaged, and repaired configurations were evaluated using a spherical plunger. The associated numerical (Finite Elements) model was first loaded by a plunger for validation. A parametric study was then conducted with the numerical model loaded by a uniform pressure. Two defect sizes (3.5 × 5 cm and 8.25 × 12 cm elliptic shape), two overlaps (2 and 5 cm), and two fixation depths (peritoneum or muscle) were investigated for both passive and active abdominal walls. RESULTS With the physical model, the repaired configuration was 22 % stiffer than the damaged configuration. The statistical analysis of the parametric study showed that the defect size was the most influential parameter regarding the stress in the mesh, the bulging and the pull-out force at the fixation points. The overlap was influential in terms of stress in the mesh. The fixation depth was not influential. These trends increased with the abdominal wall activity. CONCLUSION Increase of the defect size and decrease of the overlap affected significantly the VHR mechanical performances. Such numerical models could help to better understand the behavior of the repaired abdominal wall and finally to reduce the clinical complications.","Guérin, G; Turquier, F",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1050-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456147/,31

METHODS The recruitment of healthy subjects willing to donate marrow for BMSC production and the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) used for assessing potential donors, collecting marrow, culturing BMSCs and BMSC cryopreservation are described. RESULTS Seventeen subjects were enrolled in our marrow collection protocol for BMSC production. Six of the 17 subjects were found to be ineligible during the donor screening process and one became ill and their donation was cancelled. Approximately 12 ml of marrow was aspirated from one posterior iliac crest of 10 donors; one donor donated twice. The BMSCs were initially cultured in T-75 flasks and then expanded for three passages in multilayer cell factories. The final BMSC product was packaged into units of 100 × 106 viable cells, cryopreserved and stored in a vapor phase liquid nitrogen tank under continuous monitoring. BMSC products meeting all lot release criteria were obtained from 8 of the 11 marrow collections. The rate of growth of the primary cultures was similar for all products except those generated from the two oldest donors. One lot did not meet the criteria for final release; its CD34 antigen expression was greater than the cut off set at 5%. The mean number of BMSC units obtained from each donor was 17 and ranged from 3 to 40. CONCLUSIONS The production of large numbers of BMSCs from bone marrow aspirates of healthy donors is feasible, but is limited by the high number of donors that did not meet eligibility criteria and products that did not meet lot release criteria.","Sabatino, Marianna; Ren, Jiaqiang; David-Ocampo, Virginia; England, Lee; McGann, Michael; Tran, Minh; Kuznetsov, Sergei A; Khuu, Hanh; Balakumaran, Arun; Klein, Harvey G; Robey, Pamela G; Stroncek, David F",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-10-23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22309358/,31

Our study documented pilot work scheduling practices (n = 61) over a one-year period. Most pilots worked a week-on/week-off schedule. Work periods averaged 7.6 hours in duration and pilots worked up to four ship assignments during a given work period. Work weeks averaged a total of 35.0 hours with pilots working on average three consecutive days. Night work was common (19.0 hours/week) with 02:00 h the most common starting hour for a work period. On-call work periods occurred at irregular times with a high degree of start time variability between consecutive work periods. While typical individual and weekly work total hours were not high, there were instances with long work periods, minimal rest opportunities, and extended total weekly work hours. Fatigue-model predictions based on work schedules were similar to objective outcomes collected among other groups of maritime pilots and may prove useful in identifying potential fatigue risks within on-call work schedules. Future studies should be conducted using objective measures to provide further insight on how on-call maritime operations influence sleep timing, alertness, and performance.","Gregory, Kevin; Hobbs, Alan; Parke, Bonny; Bathurst, Nicholas; Pradhan, Sean; Flynn-Evans, Erin",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1817932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911999/,31

Altogether, 981 proteins were identified, of which 124 protein abundances were decreased and 79 were increased. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the altered proteins were related to structure (n = 10), mechanical properties (n = 13), chaperone (n = 15), antibacterial (n = 12), and antioxidant (n = 3). Alterations in abundances of structural proteins, possibly resulting from the disintegration of these complexes, were observed in this study, suggesting a loss in fibrous structure. Several proteins involved in mechanical strength (n = 10), elasticity (n = 3), and chaperone were decreased in abundances, which indicated that deficits in these proteins might affect the CEVM mechanical properties. These findings will extend our understanding of the CEVM deterioration during high-temperature storage from a proteomic perspective.","Zhou, Yu; Qiu, Ning; Mine, Yoshinori; Meng, Yaqi; Keast, Russell; Zhu, Chunxia",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809818/,31

A series of country-specific and multicountry consultative meetings were conducted during 2018-2019 that involved 15 countries across five regions to determine the status of implementation of HHSDGs. Almost 120 representatives from health and non-health sectors participated. The assessment relied on a multidomain analytical framework drawing on existing public health policy frameworks. During the first 5 years of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era, participating LMICs from South and Central Asia, East Africa and Latin America demonstrated growing political commitment to HHSDGs, with augmentation of multisectoral institutional arrangements, strengthening of monitoring systems and engagement of development partners. On the other hand, there has been limited involvement of civic society representatives and academia, relatively few capacity development initiatives were in place, a well-crafted communication strategy was missing, and there is limited evidence of additional domestic financing for implementing HHSDGs. While the momentum towards universal health coverage is notable, explicit linkages with non-health SDGs and integrated multisectoral implementation strategies are lacking. The study offers messages to LMICs that would allow for a full decade of accelerated implementation of HHSDGs, and points to the need for more implementation research in each domain and for testing interventions that are likely to work before scale-up.","Siddiqi, Sameen; Aftab, Wafa; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Huicho, Luis; Mogilevskii, Roman; Friberg, Peter; Lindgren-Garcia, Johanna; Causevic, Sara; Khamis, Anil; Shah, Mashal Murad; Bhutta, Zulfiqar Ahmed",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900695/,31

64785,Embracing Genetic Diversity to Improve Black Health.,2021-02-10,"Purpose: Seizures related to tumor growth are common in glioma patients, especially in low-grade glioma patients this is often the first tumor manifestation. We hypothesize that there are associations between preoperative seizures and morphologic features (e.g., tumor size, location) and histogram features in patients with glioblastoma (GB). Methods: Retrospectively, 160 consecutive patients with initial diagnosis and surgery of GB (WHO IV) and preoperative MRI were analyzed. Preoperative MRI sequences were co-registered (T2-FLAIR, T1-contrast, DTI) and tumors were segmented by a neuroradiologist using the software ITK-snap blinded to the clinical data. Tumor volume (FLAIR, T1-contrast) and histogram analyses of ADC- and FA-maps were recorded in the contrast enhancing tumor part (CET) and the non-enhancing peritumoral edema (FLAIR). Location was determined after co-registration of the data with an atlas. Permutation-based multiple-testing adjusted t statistics were calculated to compare imaging variables between patients with and without seizures. Results: Patients with seizures showed significantly smaller tumors (CET, adj. p = 0.029) than patients without preoperative seizures. Less seizures were observed in patients with tumor location in the right cingulate gyrus (adj. p = 0.048) and in the right caudate nucleus (adj. p = 0.009). Significant differences of histogram analyses of FA in the contrast enhancing tumor part were observed between patients with and without seizures considering also tumor location and size. Conclusion: Preoperative seizures in GB patients are associated with lower preoperative tumor volume. The different histogram analyses suggest that there might be microstructural differences in the contrast enhancing tumor part of patients with seizures measured by fractional anisotropy. Higher variance of GB presenting without seizures might indicate a more aggressive growth of these tumors.","Bette, Stefanie; Barz, Melanie; Ly Nham, Huong; Huber, Thomas; Berndt, Maria; Sales, Arthur; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Meyer, Hanno S; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S; Wiestler, Benedikt; Gempt, Jens",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12040994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316566/,31

Here we show that in response to polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (pI:C), DCs mount a specific integrated stress response during which the transcription factor ATF4 and the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34/Ppp1r15a), a phosphatase 1 (PP1) cofactor, are expressed. In agreement with increased GADD34 levels, an extensive dephosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α was observed during DC activation. Unexpectedly, although DCs display an unusual resistance to protein synthesis inhibition induced in response to cytosolic dsRNA, GADD34 expression did not have a major impact on protein synthesis. GADD34, however, was shown to be required for normal cytokine production both in vitro and in vivo. These observations have important implications in linking further pathogen detection with the integrated stress response pathways.","Clavarino, Giovanna; Cláudio, Nuno; Dalet, Alexandre; Terawaki, Seigo; Couderc, Thérèse; Chasson, Lionel; Ceppi, Maurizio; Schmidt, Enrico K; Wenger, Till; Lecuit, Marc; Gatti, Evelina; Pierre, Philippe",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1104491109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315398/,31

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this publication, the authors present preliminary results of their own observations of psychoemotional disorders and sleep disorders in their structure in patients with a new coronavirus infection. We analyzed the data of 119 patients (aged 47 to 69 years, male and female), conducted a detailed interview, including using telemedicine technologies, and assessed the scales: The hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), subjective the asthenia rating scale (MFI-20, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. RESULTS According to the results of the HADS questionnaire, clinically pronounced anxiety-depressive symptoms were observed in 33 (28%) patients of 119 hospitalized in connection with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Of them, only clinically significant anxiety was recorded in 11% of cases (n=13), in 5 (4%) patients - clinically significant depression, an increase in both subscales of anxiety and depression - in 13% (n=15). An increase in the MFI-20 scale (more than 20 points) was found in 87 (73%) patients, sleep disorders in accordance with the PSQI questionnaire was recorded in 32 (27%) patients. CONCLUSION According to the results of the study, it was noted that in most patients with COVID-19, along with a depressive symptom complex, anxiety and hypochondriacal disorders, an asthenic symptom complex, sleep disturbances with difficulty falling asleep, and dissatisfaction with the quality of sleep are recorded. Differentiated recommendations for the treatment of the studied conditions have been developed, taking into account the side effects of the prescribed drugs, drug interactions and the characteristics of the somatic status of patients.

66265,"Understanding and Mitigating Health Inequities - Past, Current, and Future Directions.",2021-05-06,"We have recently identified the two major determinants of the glycoprotein G of the viral hemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (gpGVHSV), peptides p31 and p33 implicated in triggering the host type I IFN antiviral response associated to these rhabdoviral antigens. With the aim to investigate the properties of these viral glycoprotein regions as DNA molecular adjuvants, their corresponding cDNA sequences were cloned into a plasmid (pMCV1.4) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane sequences of gpGVHSV. In addition, a plasmid construct encoding both sequences p31 and p33 (pMCV1.4-p31+p33) was also designed. In vitro transitory cell transfection assays showed that these VHSV gpG regions were able to induce the expression of type I IFN stimulated genes as well as to confer resistance to the infection with a different fish rhabdovirus, the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). In vivo, zebrafish intramuscular injection of only 1μg of the construct pMCV1.4-p31+p33 conferred fish protection against SVCV lethal challenge up to 45 days post-immunization. Moreover, pMCV1.4-p31+p33 construct was assayed for molecular adjuvantcity's for a DNA vaccine against SVCV based in the surface antigen of this virus (pAE6-GSVCV). The results showed that the co-injection of the SVCV DNA vaccine and the molecular adjuvant allowed (i) a ten-fold reduction in the dose of pAE6-Gsvcv without compromising its efficacy (ii) an increase in the duration of protection, and (iii) an increase in the survival rate. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which specific IFN-inducing regions from a viral gpG are used to design more-efficient and cost-effective viral vaccines, as well as to improve our knowledge on how to stimulate the innate immune system.","Martinez-Lopez, A; Garcia-Valtanen, P; Ortega-Villaizan, M; Chico, V; Gomez-Casado, E; Coll, J M; Estepa, A",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203447/,31

We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of SILS for appendectomy (SILS-A) in children and compare it with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (C-LA). METHODS We studied, retrospectively, adolescent patients who underwent C-LA or SILS-A. There were 25 patients in the C-LA group and 30 patients in the SILS-A group. The clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS The SILS-A procedures were performed successfully in adolescent patients . There were no significant difference between the C-LA and SILS-A group with respect to demographic data and post-operative outcomes. There was one complication (4%) in the C-LA group and two complications (6.6%) in the SILS-A group, but there was no significant difference. CONCLUSION SILS-A was technically feasible and safe in children. Considering little postoperative scar and no difference in post-operative outcomes compared to C-LA, SILA could be applicable in adolescent patients. Larger studies and further technical implements will be necessary to assess the true benefit of this approach.","Kang, Dong Baek; Lee, Seung Hyun; Lee, Seok Youn; Oh, Jung Taek; Park, Dong Eun; Lee, Cheol; Choi, Duk Hwa; Park, Won Cheol; Lee, Jeong Kyun",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.4174/jkss.2012.82.2.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22347713/,31

It is essential to better understand the impact of weight management interventions on mental health to optimise care and minimise risk of harm. We will assess the effect of behavioural weight management interventions on mental health in adults with overweight and obesity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. We will include behavioural weight management interventions with a diet and/or physical activity component focusing on weight loss for adults with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs will be the only eligible study designs. Outcomes of interest will be related to mental health. The following databases were searched from inception to 07 May 2019: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane database (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, ASSIA, AMED and CINAHL. The search strategy was based on four concepts: (1) adults, defined as ≥18 years, with overweight/obesity, defined as BMI ≥25kg/m², (2) weight management interventions, (3) mental health outcomes and (4) study design. The search was restricted to English-language published papers, with no other restrictions applied. Two stage screening for eligibility will be completed by two independent reviewers, with two independent reviewers completing data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Data permitting, a random-effects meta-analysis of outcomes, subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be conducted. If not appropriate, narrative synthesis and 'levels of evidence' assessment will be completed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. The completed systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, at conferences and contribute towards the lead author's PhD thesis.

METHODS We performed a prospective, randomized crossover study of 39 medical students using the McGrath MAC, GlideScope Ranger, and Macintosh in a manikin with 2 normal airways. The primary outcome was the intubation time. Secondary outcomes included the success rates and the overall glottic view of the 3 laryngoscopes. RESULTS The mean intubation times for each attempt with the McGrath MAC were 30.8 ± 16.9 seconds or less and did not differ significantly from those obtained with the GlideScope Ranger or the Macintosh in both airway scenarios (P = .18; P = .49). The mean success rates at each attempt with the McGrath MAC were 82.0% ± 38.8% or more, equal to the Macintosh and the GlideScope Ranger in both scenarios (P = .026; P = .72) except during the first intubation attempt in a normal airway (P = .008). The median grades of the glottic view visible at each intubation attempt with the McGrath Mac were Cormack-Lehane grade 1 (scenario 1: interquartile range, 1-1; scenario 2: interquartile range, 1-2), which was significantly better than the Macintosh laryngoscope in both scenarios. However, the McGrath Mac did not produce a better glottic view than the GlideScope Ranger with either scenario.

We hypothesized that severe RSV disease is associated with an impaired immune response characterized by low circulating T lymphocytes and plasma cytokine concentrations. METHODS We evaluate the in vivo immune responses of previously healthy infants with their first proven RSV-acute lower respiratory infection that required hospitalization. According to the clinical severity, defined by using a strict scoring system, the in vivo immune response was compared through the analysis of plasma cytokine values and the phenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cells. RESULTS Absolute blood cell counts of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes and NK cells were lower in subjects with RSV than in control infants. Lowest cell counts were observed in more severe RSV-infected infants. Significant low values were obtained in CD8+ lymphocytes (P = 0.03) and nonactive NK cells, that express CD94 antigen (P = 0.046). In contrast, activated NK cells that do not express CD94 molecules were significantly higher in RSV infected infants than in healthy controls (% of cells: P = 0.004). The interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha values in RSV infected patients were lower than in controls subjects. Interleukin-17 cytokine was not detected in healthy infants and the largest concentration was found in moderately ill patients as compared with severe cases (P = 0.033). RSV infection showed significantly higher interleukin-8 chemokine than in control infants (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION We propose that severe RSV infection in very young infants is associated with poor blood proinflammatory cytokine production, low counts of CD8+ T cells and with a greater activity of a group of NK cells, that are independent of the major histocompatibility complex class Ib recognition system.","Larrañaga, Carmen L; Ampuero, Sandra L; Luchsinger, Vivian F; Carrión, Flavio A; Aguilar, Nelson V; Morales, Pamela R; Palomino, María Angélica M; Tapia, Lorena F; Avendaño, Luis F",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181a3ea71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19738511/,31
70643,Retinoic acid signaling and the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium.,2019-06-01,"Many viral proteases mediate the evasion of antiviral innate immunity by cleaving adapter proteins in the interferon (IFN) induction pathway. Host proteases are also involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report that the transmembrane protease hepsin (also known as TMPRSS1), which is predominantly present in hepatocytes, inhibited the induction of type I IFN during viral infections. Knocking out hepsin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased the viral infection-induced expression of Ifnb1, an Ifnb1 promoter reporter, and an IFN-sensitive response element promoter reporter. Ectopic expression of hepsin in cultured human hepatocytes and HEK293T cells suppressed the induction of IFNβ during viral infections by reducing the abundance of STING. These effects depended on the protease activity of hepsin. We identified a putative hepsin target site in STING and showed that mutating this site protected STING from hepsin-mediated cleavage. In addition to hepatocytes, several hepsin-producing prostate cancer cell lines showed reduced STING-mediated type I IFN induction and responses. These results reveal a role for hepsin in suppressing STING-mediated type I IFN induction, which may contribute to the vulnerability of hepatocytes to chronic viral infections.","Hsin, Fu; Hsu, Yu-Chen; Tsai, Yu-Fei; Lin, Shu-Wha; Liu, Helene Minyi",Science signaling,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abb4752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131022/,31

In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e-21; PIsibs = 1.011 e-07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.","Aguillon, Samantha; Din Dipita, Alain; Lecompte, Emilie; Missoup, Alain Didier; Tindo, Maurice; Gaubert, Philippe",Molecular biology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05511-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425300/,31

Vaginal cuffs were closed using the 2-layer continuous running technique with unidirectional barbed sutures (V-Loc; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) in 64 patients and with polycolic acid Vicryl; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ sutures in 106 patients. Procedure time, clinical characteristics, and postoperative complications were compared between the 2 study groups. There were no differences in clinical characteristics (age, body mass index, and demographic data) between groups. The mean suturing time was significantly reduced in the barbed group (7.2 vs 12.2 minutes; P < 0.001), although the mean number of stitches was greater than in the Vicryl group (14.1 vs 12.3, P < 0.001). Perioperative complications, including episodes of vaginal bleeding, vaginal cuff cellulitis, and postoperative fever, did not differ between groups. There were no instances of vaginal cuff dehiscence in either group.

To determine the biological relevance of this motif, we constructed a SARS-CoV reverse genetic construct by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based vector controlled by a T7 promoter; and subsequently deleted the SR-rich motif from the N gene. The mutated infectious clone showed reduced level of genome transcription and significantly reduced levels of the infectious virions. These results strongly suggest that the SR-rich motif is critical for effective virus replication.","Tylor, Shaun; Andonov, Anton; Cutts, Todd; Cao, Jingxin; Grudesky, Elsey; Van Domselaar, Gary; Li, Xuguang; He, Runtao",Canadian journal of microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1139/w08-139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370068/,31
74243,Can the Elections End the Health Reform Stalemate?,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic left colectomy (LLC) became the standard of care for treating distal transverse and descending colon cancer in many centers. Most centers use laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis (LAC/EA). A totally laparoscopic colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis (TLC/IA) has been proposed. The purpose of our study is to compare these two techniques. METHODS A series of 52 patients undergoing LLC for left-sided colon cancer was retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three patients underwent TLC/IA, and 19 underwent LAC/EA. The following data were collected: gender, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class, operation duration, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, postoperative course (duration of stay, time to first flatus), number of excised lymph nodes, readmission, and reoperation rates. Data were prospectively recorded in a colorectal cancer database and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The only demographic parameter that differed significantly between the groups was age (64.2 ± 12.4 years for the TLC/IA group, vs. 72.7 ± 2.1 years for LAC/EA, p = 0.0116). The mini-laparotomy incision was significantly shorter in the TLC/IA than in the LAC/EA group (5.8 ± 0.9 vs. 8.2 ± 0.9 cm, respectively, p < 0.00001). Hospital stay duration was shorter in the TLC/IA group (4.2 ± 1.2 vs. 6.3 ± 1.9, p = 0.0001). The average number of harvested lymph nodes did not differ significantly between the groups (12.9 ± 5.7 in TLC/IA vs. 11.2 ± 4.2 in LAC/EA, p = 0.2546). No significant differences between the groups were observed in any other perioperative or surgical outcome parameters. CONCLUSIONS TLC/IA in LLC for the treatment of left colon cancer is technically feasible and can be performed with a low complication rate, favorable cosmetics, and possibly shorter hospital stay, without significantly lengthening operative duration or compromising oncologic radicality principles. Although further prospective randomized studies are needed to determine its role and limitations, we encourage using it as an alternative to LAC/EA in LLC.","Swaid, Forat; Sroka, Gideon; Madi, Hussam; Shteinberg, Dan; Somri, Mustafa; Matter, Ibrahim",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4502-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335075/,31

In the absence of an intraabdominal source of infection, bacterial peritonitis may arise in patients with liver cirrhosis, in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease or in patients with tuberculosis. In patients with cirrhosis, bacterial peritonitis may trigger acute on chronic liver failure with substantial mortality despite optimal treatment. In patients on PD, peritonitis may make continuation of PD impossible, necessitating the switch to hemodialysis.Areas covered: Recovery from peritonitis and prevention of complications depend on timely pharmacological management. Challenges are the broad microbiological spectrum with growing rates of antimicrobial resistance, the underlying chronic liver or kidney failure and high rates of relapse. The authors provide a review of predisposing conditions, diagnosis, and prevention of bacterial peritonitis with a particular focus on the pharmacological management.Expert opinion: Diagnosis of the type of bacterial peritonitis is essential to pharmacological management. In patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given intravenously in conjunction with albumin. In patients on PD, antibiotic therapy should be preferably applied intraperitoneally with empirical coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Secondary peritonitis usually requires surgical or interventional treatment.","Pörner, Daniel; Von Vietinghoff, Sibylle; Nattermann, Jacob; Strassburg, Christian P; Lutz, Philipp",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2021.1915288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878993/,31
74865,Innate receptors and cellular defense against pulmonary infections.,2014,"Blogging is a widely used social medium for storing and sharing information online. Being an attractive online interface, some studies show that education blogging or edublogging might promote more engaged learning. An apathy to contemporary issues related to one's area of study can result in a less knowledgeable student who is less ready for the job industry. To bridge the gap between classroom learning and awareness of emerging issues pertaining to the field of study and potential employment - blogging of ongoing events in a select microbiological field was proposed as a graded semester-long activity called ""Disease Tracking."" The exercise involved instructing students to choose one infectious disease topic, for which traditional and non-traditional scientific information could be sourced with high frequency over the preceding months. Students were to document new information on the topic as it became available over the term, from reliable information resources. At the end of the term, students presented their work in a ""Blog show-off"" presentation session. Blog-based learning was found to be an engaging tool that satisfied all criteria under Bloom's taxonomy. Students developed a continued intrigue for the chosen topic and appreciated the diverse fields in which fundamentals of infectious diseases learned in class, could be applied within and outside academia. Students also valued this experience and feedback showed that the freedom to choose their own topic (77%), opportunity to learn more from other students' blogs (77%), less stress as they were not competing on identical topics (73%), a ""fun way"" to learn (68%), and an opportunity to understand the importance of staying abreast with scientific news (64%) stood out as the chief positive points of the exercise to the students. In view of these benefits, blogs can be used for an immersive, broad learning experience in Microbiology and other fields in which there is likely to be a frequency of new information online.","Lloyd, Charmaine",Frontiers in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.576145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746910/,31

Using recently standardized criteria, we sought to compare the prognostic performance of 2 commonly used reperfusion scales. METHODS Inclusion criteria for this multicenter retrospective study were acute ischemic stroke attributable to middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion, intra-arterial therapy, and 90-day modified Rankin scale score. Post-intra-arterial therapy reperfusion was graded using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scales. The scales were compared for prediction of clinical outcome using receiver-operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS Of 308 patients, mean age was 65 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17. The mean time from stroke onset to groin puncture was 305 minutes. There was no difference in the time to treatment between patients grouped by final TIMI (ie, 0 versus 1 versus 2 versus 3) or mTICI grades (ie, 0 versus 1 versus 2a versus 2b versus 3). Good outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0-2) was achieved in 32.5% of patients, and mortality rate was 25.3% at 90 days. There was a 6.3% rate of parenchymal hematoma type 2. In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, mTICI was superior to TIMI for predicting 90-day modified Rankin scale 0 to 2 (c-statistic: 0.74 versus 0.68; P<0.0001). The optimal threshold for identifying a good outcome was mTICI 2b to 3 (sensitivity 78.0%; specificity 66.1%). CONCLUSIONS mTICI is superior to TIMI for predicting clinical outcome after intra-arterial therapy. mTICI 2b to 3 is the optimal biomarker for procedural success.","Yoo, Albert J; Simonsen, Claus Z; Prabhakaran, Shyam; Chaudhry, Zeshan A; Issa, Mohammad A; Fugate, Jennifer E; Linfante, Italo; Liebeskind, David S; Khatri, Pooja; Jovin, Tudor G; Kallmes, David F; Dabus, Guilherme; Zaidat, Osama O",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.001990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23920017/,31

Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were higher in critical care cases than in mild cases(all P<0.05). Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, elevated NT-proBNP, elevated cTnI, elevated hs-CRP, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and CHD were significantly correlated with critical disease status(all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI(OR=26.909, 95%CI 4.086-177.226, P=0.001) and CHD (OR=16.609, 95%CI 2.288-120.577, P=0.005) were the independent risk factors of critical disease status.

76623,Mourning on morning rounds.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Although cigarette smoking is one of the strongest risk factors for cerebral aneurysm development and rupture, there are limited data evaluating the impact of smoking on outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Additionally, two recent studies suggested that nicotine replacement therapy was associated with improved neurological outcomes among smokers who had sustained an SAH compared with smokers who did not receive nicotine. METHODS Patients who underwent endovascular or microsurgical repair of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS, 2009-2011) and stratified by cigarette smoking. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed in-hospital mortality, complications, tracheostomy or gastrostomy placement, and discharge to institutional care (a nursing or an extended care facility). Additionally, the composite NIS-SAH outcome measure (based on mortality, tracheostomy or gastrostomy, and discharge disposition) was evaluated, which has been shown to have excellent agreement with a modified Rankin Scale score greater than 3. Covariates included in regression constructs were patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, socioeconomic status, comorbidities (including hypertension, drug and alcohol abuse), the NIS-SAH severity scale (previously validated against the Hunt and Hess grade), treatment modality used for aneurysm repair, and hospital characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was performed matching smokers to nonsmokers on age, sex, number of comorbidities, and NIS-SAH severity scale score. RESULTS Among the 5784 admissions evaluated, 37.1% (n = 2148) had a diagnosis of tobacco use, of which 31.1% (n = 1800) were current and 6.0% (n = 348) prior tobacco users. Smokers were significantly younger (mean age 51.4 vs 56.2 years) and had more comorbidities compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in mortality, total complications, or neurological complications by smoking status. However, compared with nonsmokers, smokers had significantly decreased adjusted odds of tracheostomy or gastrostomy placement (11.9% vs 22.7%, odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.78, p < 0.001), discharge to institutional care (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.89, p = 0.002), and a poor outcome (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.77, p < 0.001). Similar statistical associations were noted in the matched-pairs sensitivity analysis and in a subgroup of poor-grade patients (the upper quartile of the NIS-SAH severity scale). CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide study, smokers experienced SAH at a younger age and had a greater number of comorbidities compared with nonsmokers, highlighting the negative ramifications of cigarette smoking among patients with cerebral aneurysms. However, smoking was also associated with paradoxical superior outcomes on some measures, and future research to confirm and further understand the basis of this relationship is needed.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Rudy, Robert F; Rosalind Lai, Pui Man; Smith, Timothy R; Frerichs, Kai U; Gormley, William B; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Du, Rose",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.10.jns16748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076779/,31

76949,Insights into intrauterine growth restriction based on maternal and umbilical cord blood metabolomics.,2021-04-09,"Dyspnea and reduced exercise capacity, caused, in part, by respiratory muscle dysfunction, are common symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the etiology of diaphragmatic dysfunction has not been identified. To investigate the effects of HF on diaphragmatic function, models of HF were surgically induced in CD-1 mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), respectively. Assessment of myocardial function, isolated diaphragmatic strip function, myofilament force-pCa relationship, and phosphorylation status of myofilament proteins was performed at either 2 or 18 wk postsurgery. Echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics revealed development of HF by 18 wk postsurgery in both models. In vitro diaphragmatic force production was preserved in all groups while morphometric analysis revealed diaphragmatic atrophy and fibrosis in 18 wk TAC and AMI groups. Isometric force-pCa measurements of myofilament preparations revealed reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity of force generation and force generation at half-maximum and maximum Ca(2+) activation in 18 wk TAC. The rate of force redevelopment (ktr) was reduced in all HF groups at high levels of Ca(2+) activation. Finally, there were significant changes in the myofilament phosphorylation status of the 18 wk TAC group. This includes a decrease in the phosphorylation of troponin T, desmin, myosin light chain (MLC) 1, and MLC 2 as well as a shift in myosin isoforms. These results indicate that there are multiple changes in diaphragmatic myofilament function, which are specific to the type and stage of HF and occur before overt impairment of in vitro force production.","Gillis, Todd E; Klaiman, Jordan M; Foster, Andrew; Platt, Mathew J; Huber, Jason S; Corso, Melissa Y; Simpson, Jeremy A",American journal of physiology.

A 15-questions survey was anonymously emailed to international experts and physician members of five anesthesia societies which focused on assessing treatment decisions of clinicians during three realistic clinical scenarios measured at two distinct time points. The first is when typical case information and basic monitoring (T1) were provided, and then once again after the addition of advanced monitoring variables (T2). We hypothesized that the addition of advanced variables would increase the incidence of an optimal therapeutic decision (a priori defined as the answer with the highest percentage of expert agreement) and decrease the variability among the physician's suggested treatments. The survey was completed by 18 experts and 839 physicians. Overall, adding advanced monitoring did not significantly increase physician response accuracy, with the least substantial changes noted on questions related to volume expansion or vasopressor administration. Moreover, advanced monitoring data did not significantly decrease the high level of initial practice variability in physician suggested treatments (P = 0.13), in contrast to the low variability observed within the expert group (P = 0.039). Additionally, 5-10 years of practice (P < 0.0001) and a cardiovascular subspecialty (P = 0.048) were both physician characteristics associated with a higher rate of optimal therapeutic decisions. The addition of advanced variables was of limited benefit for most physicians, further indicating the need for more in depth education on the clinical value and technical understanding of such variables.","Joosten, Alexandre; Desebbe, Olivier; Suehiro, Koichi; Essiet, Mfonobong; Alexander, Brenton; Ricks, Cameron; Rinehart, Joseph; Faraoni, David; Cecconi, Maurizio; Van der Linden, Philippe; Cannesson, Maxime",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9817-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686867/,31

In this review, we analyzed the current status of eHealth in transplantation by performing a PubMed search over the last 5 years with a focus on clinical studies for post-transplant care. We retrieved 463 manuscripts, of which 52 clinical reports and 8 randomized controlled trials were identified. Most studies were on kidney (n=19), followed by liver (n=10), solid organ (n=7), bone-marrow (n=6), and lung transplantation (n=6). Eleven articles included adolescents/children. Investigated eHealth features covered the whole spectrum with mobile applications for patients (n=24) and video-consultations (n=18) being most frequent. Prominent topics for patient apps were self-management (n=16), adherence (n=14), symptom-reporting (11), remote monitoring of vital signs (n=8), educational (n=7), and drug reminder (n=7). In this review, we discuss opportunities and strengths of such new eHealth solutions, the implications for successful implementation into the health care process, the human factor, data protection, and finally, the need for better evidence from prospective clinical trials in order to confirm the claims on better patient care, potential efficiency gains and cost savings.","Duettmann, Wiebke; Naik, Marcel G; Zukunft, Bianca; Osmonodja, Bilgin; Bachmann, Friederike; Choi, Mira; Roller, Roland; Mayrdorfer, Manuel; Halleck, Fabian; Schmidt, Danilo; Budde, Klemens",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111393/,31

The status of the host immune system is a critical factor that affects the severity and outcomes of COVID-19. In particular, antibody responses are an indicator of the anti-viral defense; so, a delayed or inappropriate induction of these responses would correlate with a defect in the viral clearance. METHODS This is a rapid synthesis of literature investigating antibody responses in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. RESULTS Lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), along with the direct evidence of antibody responses in COVID-19, pose the potentials of dynamic antibody responses for screening and prognostic purposes in COVID-19. Also, neutralizing antibodies extracted from recovered patients and monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines offer therapeutic support for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Altogether, the dynamics of antibody responses help to determine the effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19. Of note, it might be helpful for the evaluation of the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccination - the dreams for the future of COVID-19. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility and efficacy of antibody extraction from animal subjects. Finally, numerous factors affect antibody response such as race, nutrition status, and virus mutations in viral infections, which need to be considered in the context of COVID-19.","Mohammadi, Tooba; Nasab, Mahsa G; Mohebalizadeh, Mehdi; Kheirandish, Ali; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865266/,31

In this study we assessed whether a second PCR test conducted 2-7 days after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test could identify patients at risk for severe illness. Analysis of a nationwide electronic health records data of 1683 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals indicated that a second negative PCR test result was associated with lower risk for severe illness compared to a positive result. This association was seen across different age groups and clinical settings. More importantly, it was not limited to recovering patients but also observed in patients who still had evidence of COVID-19 as determined by a subsequent positive PCR test. Our study suggests that an early second PCR test may be used as a supportive risk-assessment tool to improve disease management and patient care.","Mizrahi, Barak; Bivas-Benita, Maytal; Kalkstein, Nir; Akiva, Pinchas; Yanover, Chen; Yehezkelli, Yoav; Kessler, Yoav; Alon, Sharon Hermoni; Rubin, Eitan; Chodick, Gabriel",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99671-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650138/,31

The overall goal of endoscopic therapy of BO is to eliminate metaplastic and dysplastic epithelium, to prevent and/or reduce the risk of progression to OAC. Endoscopic therapy techniques can be divided into two broad complementary techniques: tissue acquiring (endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection) and ablative. Endoscopic therapy has been established as safe and effective for the subjects with intra-mucosal cancer (IMC), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and more recently in treating low-grade dysplasia (LGD). Challenges to endoscopic therapy are being recognized, such as incomplete response and recurrence. While eradication of intestinal metaplasia is the immediate goal of endoscopic therapy, surveillance must continue after complete elimination of intestinal metaplasia, to detect and treat recurrences.","Blevins, Christopher H; Iyer, Prasad G",Best practice & research.

We evaluated 3 tools for detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) in aqueous humor: 1) a 7b gene reverse-transcription real-time PCR (7b-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect FCoV RNA, 2) a spike gene mutation RT-rtPCR (S-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect 2 point mutations in the spike gene of FCoV in cats positive by 7b-RT-rtPCR, and 3) immunocytochemistry (ICC) for detection of FCoV antigen in aqueous humor macrophages. We studied 58 cats, including 31 cats with FIP and 27 control cats. FIP was excluded by postmortem examination and negative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Aqueous humor samples obtained postmortem were assessed using 7b-RT-rtPCR in all cats, and positive samples were evaluated with S-RT-rtPCR. ICC evaluation of aqueous humor samples from 36 of the 58 cats was done using an avidin-biotin complex method and monoclonal anti-FCoV IgG 2A. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were calculated including 95% CIs. 7b-RT-rtPCR had a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI: 87.2-100.0) and sensitivity of 35.5% (95% CI: 19.2-54.6). Specificity of S-RT-rtPCR could not be determined because there were no FCoV 7b-RT-rtPCR-positive samples in the control group. Sensitivity of S-RT-rtPCR was 12.9% (95% CI 3.6-29.8). Sensitivity and specificity of ICC were 62.5% (95% CI: 40.6-81.2) and 80.0% (95% CI: 44.4-97.5), respectively. The combination of 7b-RT-rtPCR and IHC could be useful in diagnosing FIP; S-RT-rtPCR did not add value; and ICC of aqueous humor samples cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of FIP.","Sangl, Laura; Felten, Sandra; Matiasek, Kaspar; Dörfelt, Stefanie; Bergmann, Michele; Balzer, Hans-Jörg; Pantchev, Nikola; Leutenegger, Christian; Hartmann, Katrin","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720927362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32517543/,31

Our objective was to calculate the amount of weight loss required to attain established minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) in HRQL, measured using three validated instruments. METHODS Data from the Alberta Population-based Prospective Evaluation of Quality of Life Outcomes and Economic Impact of Bariatric Surgery (APPLES) study, a population-based, prospective Canadian cohort including 150 wait-listed, 200 medically managed and 150 surgically treated patients were examined. Two-year changes in weight and HRQL measures (Short-Form (SF)-12 physical (PCS; MCID = 5) and mental (MCS; MCID = 5) component summary score, EQ-5D Index (MCID = 0.03) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS; MCID = 10), Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQOL)-Lite total score (MCID = 12)) were calculated. Separate multivariable linear regression models were constructed within medically and surgically treated patients to determine if weight changes achieved HRQL MCIDs. Pooled analysis in all 500 patients was performed to estimate the weight reductions required to achieve the pre-defined MCID for each HRQL instrument. RESULTS Mean age was 43.7 (SD 9.6) years, 88% were women, 92% were white, and mean initial body mass index was 47.9 (SD 8.1) kg/m2. In surgically treated patients (two-year weight loss = 16%), HRQL MCIDs were reached for all instruments except the SF-12 MCS. In medically managed patients (two-year weight loss = 3%), MCIDs were attained in the EQ-index but not the other instruments. In all patients, percent weight reductions to achieve MCIDs were: 23% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.5, 32.5) for PCS, 25% (17.5, 40.2) for MCS, 9% (6.2, 15.0) for EQ-Index, 23% (17.3, 36.1) for EQ-VAS, and 17% (14.1, 20.4) for IWQOL-Lite total score. CONCLUSIONS Weight reductions to achieve MCIDs for most HRQL instruments are markedly higher than the conventional threshold of 5% to 10%.

In comparison with the NO2- and O3-induced SO2 oxidation pathways, this SO2 photo-oxidation in Beijing urban PM2.5 could make an important contribution to the daytime sulfate formation. Reactive species, such as •OH radicals and H2O2, are the major oxidants leading to sulfate formation in PM2.5. The water-soluble matter (WSM) and water-insoluble organic matter (WISOM) in PM2.5 were identified as the main photo-oxidant producers.

METHOD We used Analyses of Variance and Chi-squared tests to identify variables related to withdrawal from legal proceedings and variables indicating progress in the separation process related to the timing of withdrawal: in the initial or final stages of the legal proceedings. The analyses were performed in a sample of 105 women who had dropped charges. Then, we ran Binary Logistic Regression analyses to predict the risk of withdrawal during the initial stages of proceedings. RESULTS Women withdrawing in the initial stages showed more indicators that the ending of the relationship was still incipient. The predictive model included two variables: not expecting protection from the judicial system and not applying for a protection order.

Although 70% of patients with localized OSA are cured with multiagent chemotherapy and surgical resection, the prognosis for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease is guarded. The small number of patients diagnosed annually contributes to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis, and challenges in performing appropriately powered clinical trials and detecting correlative biomarkers of response. While mouse models of OSA are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they generally fail to accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment (TME), systemic immune dysfunction, and the clinical features of tumor recurrence, metastases, and chemoresistance, which influence outcome. Pet dogs spontaneously develop OSA with an incidence that is 30-50 times higher than humans. Canine OSA parallels the human disease in its clinical presentation, biological behavior, genetic complexity, and therapeutic management. However, despite therapy, most dogs die from metastatic disease within 1 year of diagnosis. Since OSA occurs in immune-competent dogs, immune factors that sculpt tumor immunogenicity and influence responses to immune modulation are in effect. In both species, immune modulation has shown beneficial effects on patient outcome and work is now underway to identify the most effective immunotherapies, combination of immunotherapies, and correlative biomarkers that will further improve clinical response. In this chapter, the immune landscape of canine OSA and the immunotherapeutic strategies used to modulate antitumor immunity in dogs with the disease will be reviewed. From this immunological viewpoint, the value of employing dogs with spontaneous OSA to accelerate and inform the translation of immunotherapies into the human clinic will be underscored.","Mason, Nicola J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43085-6_14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767244/,31

This study assessed consumer food safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic using (1) surveys and (2) online focus group discussions. From April to August 2020, five waves of surveys were distributed to an online U.S. consumer panel and screened to include only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups were conducted via WebEx from May to July 2020. Focus group participants were recruited from the first wave of survey respondents. Both survey respondents and focus group participants reported higher levels of handwashing in response to the pandemic. However, survey participants' anticipated levels of handwashing after the pandemic decreased; some focus group participants noted that human nature ""kicking in"" could lead to lower levels of hand hygiene practice. For each of the five months, the survey reported increased produce washing, both with water only and with water plus soap. Most focus group participants mentioned using water to wash their produce, but some reported using soap and even vinegar to ""kill"" the virus. Since consumers were worried that SARS-Cov-2 could survive on food, they started to mishandle food to address these concerns. However, this study also reported an increase in food thermometer use during the pandemic. Social determinants like gender, income, education, and age may have also influenced changes in levels of practice throughout the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers to practice proper and improper food safety practices, which may or may not continue after the pandemic.

A noninvasive marker for hypoxia will help physicians in treatment planning and encourage the efficient use of hypoxia targeted therapies. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetic dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion parameters are associated with a specific marker of hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in ovarian cancer (OC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-eight patients with primary OC were enrolled in this prospective study approved by the local ethical committee. Patients underwent dynamic gadolinium-enhanced 3.0 T MRI as part of their staging investigations. Pharmacokinetic perfusion parameters, including a rate constant for transfer of contrast agent from plasma to extravascular extracellular space (EES) (Ktrans) and a rate constant from EES to plasma (Kep), were measured by drawing two types of regions of interest (ROIs): a large solid lesion (L-ROI) and a solid, most enhancing small area (S-ROI) (NordicICE platform). Tissue samples for immunohistochemical analysis were collected during surgery. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used in statistical analyses. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyzes were done for DCE parameters to discriminate high HIF-1α expression. RESULTS Pharmacokinetic perfusion parameters Ktrans and Kep were inversely associated with HIF-1α expression (Ktrans L-ROI P = 0.021; Ktrans S-ROI P = 0.018 and Kep L-ROI P = 0.032; Kep S-ROI P = 0.033). Ktrans and Kep showed good accuracy in identifying high HIF-1α expression (AUC = 0.832 Ktrans L-ROI; 0.840 Ktrans S-ROI; 0.808 Kep L-ROI and 0.808 Kep L-ROI). CONCLUSION This preliminary study demonstrated that pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI perfusion parameters are associated with the hypoxia specific marker, HIF-1α in OC. DCE-MRI may be a useful supplementary tool in the characterization of OC tumors in a staging investigation.","Lindgren, Auni; Anttila, Maarit; Rautiainen, Suvi; Arponen, Otso; Hämäläinen, Kirsi; Könönen, Mervi; Vanninen, Ritva; Sallinen, Hanna",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437208/,31

RESULTS Results indicate no significantly different prevalence of informal caregiving during the pandemic compared to before. Few caregivers and few of their care recipients were infected. Overall, a low to moderate level of impairment was reported by caregivers, but a moderately high perceived danger, particularly for care recipients. Among long-term caregivers, caregiving intensity and time increased during the pandemic, less ambulatory care but more shopping help was used and care task distribution and use of support changed. CONCLUSION While the prevalence of informal caregivers remained unchanged, the caregiving situation worsened among long-term caregivers. Infection rates among caregivers were low, but they perceived themselves and their care recipients to be endangered. Future research and policy should focus more on this vulnerable group during a health crisis, primarily on long-term caregivers, in order to effectively support them in their care provision for the high risk group of older care recipients.","Zwar, Larissa; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1989377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34644202/,31
83228,The Neglected Dimension of Global Security--A Framework for Countering Infectious-Disease Crises.,2016,"BACKGROUND Breast augmentation is one of the most commonly performed operations. Three-dimensional outcome simulation can be used to predict and demonstrate for the patient what the planned operation aims to achieve in terms of size and shape. However, there are still few studies in the literature that look at how close the simulation is to the actual postoperative result and how patients perceive the accuracy and usefulness of the simulation. METHODS A prospective series of 150 patients underwent breast augmentation following consultation with the aid of three-dimensional simulation images. These patients were evaluated with a questionnaire 6 months postoperatively. A retrospective chart review of 52 patients whose three-dimensional simulations were compared with the postoperative photographs were evaluated and graded by an independent panel of investigators. RESULTS The independent panel graded the overall similarity of the three-dimensional simulations to the actual breasts with a total average score ± SD of 7.5 ± 0.80 (range, 4.5 to 8.9) using a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10. The highest average score was given to projection, breast width, and height (7.8); the lowest average score was given to intermammary distance (7.0). Eighty-six percent of patients felt the simulated image was very accurate in predicting the actual result of their breasts. CONCLUSIONS Patients prefer a center that offers three-dimensional imaging technology; they feel that the simulation is very accurate and helps them very much in choosing the implant; if they could go back in time, they would choose the same implant again.

As of September 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 215 countries, has infected more than 28 million people, and has caused more than 910,000 deaths. Since humans do not have pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of COVID-19 in the future. In February 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) assembled an international panel of experts to develop animal models for COVID-19 to accelerate testing of vaccines and therapeutics.

AIMS This study explored adolescent psychopathological profiles at age 17, and their role in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at age 19. METHODS The analyses used a sample of 904 participants (mean age = 19.17 years) from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) sweep 7 who completed the mental health questions from January 2018 to March 2019 (mean age = 17.18 years) and the COVID-19 Survey in May 2020. Adolescent psychopathological profiles were identified by means of latent class analysis. RESULTS Four psychopathological profiles were identified: ""low-symptom class"" (60.17% of participants), ""high-symptom class"" (23.01% of participants), ""substance/behavioural addictions class"" (12.03% of participants), and ""emotion-dysregulation class"" (4.79% of participants). Adolescents in the high-symptom and emotional-dysregulation classes had the worst outcome during the lockdown. Specifically, they experienced more stress, conflict and loneliness, and lower levels of perceived social support than adolescents in the other psychopathological classes. Adolescents in the emotional-dysregulation class also consumed more alcohol and had worse financial situation during the lockdown compared to pre- lockdown period. CONCLUSION Adolescent psychopathological profiles predicted mental health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Essau, Cecilia A; de la Torre-Luque, Alejandro",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887389/,31

To address this issue outside the laboratory, we investigated a sample preparation system and determined that a silica membrane and silica-coated beads are powerful tools for the extraction from raw samples: nucleic acids are kept in the silica membrane, retained during a single wash step, and released at the elution step. The eluent is appropriate for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) assay in terms of purity and quantity. We also built an innovative equipment-free nucleic acid extraction squeeze system which requires less than 20 min. The sample with improved purity augments the specificity and sensitivity. This system is simple, user-friendly, low-cost, and equipment-free, thus making nucleic acid extraction more accessible and affordable for researchers and untrained users. Furthermore, when combined with the reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method, the method will accelerate the detection of diseases. The same goes when combined with the LAMP assay, especially in developing countries.","Lee, Songhyun; Song, Junkyu; Kim, Sanghyo",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1an01401c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643630/,31
84992,Negative pressure wound therapy for a large skin ulcer following repair of huge myeloschisis with kyphosis in a newborn.,2013,"Roller pump infusion devices are widely used for rapid infusion, and may be combined with separate warming devices. There may be instances however, where the pressures generated by the roller pump may not be compatible with the warming device. We assessed a commonly used roller pump in combination with a HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer, and found that it could generate pressures exceeding the HOTLINE® manufacturers specifications. This was of concern because the HOTLINE® manufacturer guideline states that not for use with pressure devices generating over 300 mmHg. Pressure greater than 300 mmHg may compromise the integrity of the HOTLINE® Fluid Warming Set. The aim of this study was to compare in-line pressure within a HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer at different infusion rates of a roller pump using various sizes of intravenous cannulae. The rapid infusion system comprised a 500 mL-normal saline bag, roller pump type infusion device, HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer (blood and fluid warmer system), and six different sizes of intravenous cannulae. In-line pressure was measured proximal to the HOTLINE® (pre-warmer) and proximal to the cannula (post-warmer), at flow rate of 50-160 mL/min. The in-line pressures increased significantly with increasing flow rate. The pre-warmer pressures exceeded 300 mmHg when the flow rate was ≥120 mL/min with 20-gauge, 48 mm length cannula, 130 with 20-gauge, 25 mm cannula, and 160 mL/min with 18-gauge, 48 mm cannula. However, they were <300 mmHg at any flow rates with 18-gauge, 30 mm cannula and 16-gauge cannulae. The post-warmer pressures exceeded 300 mmHg at the flow rate of 140 mL/min with 20-gauge, 48 mm cannula, and 160 mL/min with 20-gauge, 25 mm cannula, while they were <300 mmHg at any flow rates with 18 and 16-gauge cannulae. The in-line pressure within a HOTLINE® could exceed 300 mmHg, depending on the flow rate and size and length of cannula. It is important to pay attention to the size and length of cannulae and flow rate to keep the maximum in-line pressure<300 mmHg when a roller pump type infusion device is used.","Higashi, Midoriko; Yamaura, Ken; Matsubara, Yukie; Fukudome, Takuya; Hoka, Sumio",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-014-9605-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087123/,31
85214,Multimodality management of a polyfunctional pancreatic endocrine carcinoma with markedly elevated serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin levels.,2008,"Social withdrawal is an early and common feature of psychiatric disorders. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activation through increased salivary cortisol (sC) and sympathetic activation through increased salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) may play a role. We aimed to study whether the link between increased sC and sAA on the one hand and depression on the other hand is mediated by social withdrawal. In this cross-sectional, observational study, sC and sAA measures were measured in seven saliva samples in 843 participants (231 psychiatric patients and 612 healthy controls). Social withdrawal was assessed through the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-, the Short Form 36-, and the Dutch Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology social withdrawal subscales, and analyzed using linear regression and mediation analyses. On average, participants were 44.0 years old (SD = 12.8; 64.1% female). Basal and diurnal sAA were unrelated to any social withdrawal scale and depression. Certain sC measures were positively associated with the BSI social withdrawal subscale (i.e., area under the curve with respect to the increase, beta = 0.082, p = 0.02; evening sC value: beta = 0.110, p = 0.003; and mean sC value: beta = 0.097; p = 0.01). We found limited support for statistical mediation by social withdrawal (measured using a composite social withdrawal score) on the relationship between evening sC and depression. Thus, although we found no support for a role of basal and diurnal sAA in social withdrawal, HPA-axis activation may partly aggravate social withdrawal in depressive disorders.","Bauduin, S E E C; Giltay, E J; van Noorden, M S; van der Werff, S J A; de Leeuw, M; van Hemert, A M; van der Wee, N J A",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160608/,31

Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of β-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv). All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv.) The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.","Ferreira, P C D; da Silva, J B; Piazza, R M F; Eckmann, L; Ho, P L; Oliveira, M L S",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.05262-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900533/,31

Any disturbance in the regulation process can lead to neurological developmental diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia. Histone variants are important components of epigenetic regulation. The function and mechanisms of the macroH2A (mH2A) histone variant during brain development are unknown. Here, we show that deletion of the mH2A isoform mH2A1.2 interferes with neural stem cell differentiation in mice. Deletion of mH2A1.2 affects neurodevelopment, enhances neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, and reduces NPC differentiation in the developing mouse brain. mH2A1.2-deficient mice exhibit autism-like behaviors, such as deficits in social behavior and exploratory abilities. We identify NKX2.2 as an important downstream effector gene and show that NKX2.2 expression is reduced after mH2A1.2 deletion and that overexpression of NKX2.2 rescues neuronal abnormalities caused by mH2A1.2 loss. Our study reveals that mH2A1.2 reduces the proliferation of neural progenitors and enhances neuronal differentiation during embryonic neurogenesis and that these effects are at least in part mediated by NKX2.2. These findings provide a basis for studying the relationship between mH2A1.2 and neurological disorders.","Ma, Hongyan; Su, Libo; Xia, Wenlong; Wang, Wenwen; Tan, Guohe; Jiao, Jianwei",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202052150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046991/,31

PURPOSE The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare, in vitro, the peak temperature increase during the removal of fractured abutment screws from implants placed in a porcine mandible, using drilling speeds of 600 or 2000 rpm. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty 4.3×13-mm dental implants were placed in 10 dissected porcine mandibles: 2 implants per mandible, 1 on each side. Localized defects were created in 20 surface-treated abutment screws, which were then tightened into each implant until a reproducible fracture occurred in each screw. The fractured screws were removed with a handpiece removal kit and irrigated with room-temperature water at either 600 or 2000 rpm. The temperature rise at the implant surface was measured at 3 levels with 3 type-K thermocouples. Repeated measure ANOVA was performed with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test for mean pair-wise comparisons (α=.05 for all tests). RESULTS Mean peak temperatures were significantly higher at 2000 rpm than at 600 rpm in the mid-body (P<.001) and crestal (P=.003) regions but not in the apical (P=.225) implant locations. No significant differences in mean peak temperatures were found among the 3 locations using 600 rpm (P=.179). In the 2000-rpm group, mean peak temperature in the mid-body area was consistently higher than that in the apical (P<.001) area, and more instances of temperature rise above 56°C and 60°C were observed. In 1 implant from this group, the estimated peak temperature exceeded the bone damage threshold value (50°C for 30 seconds). CONCLUSIONS A drilling speed of 2000 rpm during the removal of abutment screw fragments caused overheating of the outer surface of the implant which may damage the surrounding bone; a speed of 600 rpm appears to be safe.","Arias, Sergio R; Rueggeberg, Frederick A; Mettenburg, Donald; Sharawy, Mohamed; Looney, Stephen; Elsayed, Ranya; Elsalanty, Mohammed E",The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prosdent.2017.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28967404/,31
86475,Inhaled corticosteroids may have a protective effect against coronavirus infection.,2021,"The reported rates of HER2 positivity in cervical cancer (CC) range from 0% to 87%. The importance of HER2 as an actionable target in CC would depend on HER2 positivity prevalence. Our aim was to provide precise estimates of HER2 overexpression and amplification in CC, globally and by relevant subgroups. We conducted a PRISMA compliant meta-analytic systematic review. We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and grey literature for articles reporting the proportion of HER2 positivity in CC. Studies assessing HER2 status by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization in invasive disease were eligible. We performed descriptive analyses of all 65 included studies. Out of these, we selected 26 studies that used standardized American Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) Guidelines compliant methodology. We conducted several meta-analyses of proportions to estimate the pooled prevalence of HER2 positivity and subgroup analyses using geographic region, histology, tumor stage, primary antibody brand, study size, and publication year as moderators. The estimated pooled prevalence of HER2 overexpression was 5.7% (CI 95%: 1.5% to 11.7%) I2 = 87% in ASCO/CAP compliant studies and 27.0%, (CI 95%: 19.9% to 34.8%) I2 = 96% in ASCO/CAP non-compliant ones, p < 0.001. The estimated pooled prevalence of HER2 amplification was 1.2% (CI 95%: 0.0% to 5.8%) I2 = 0% and 24.9% (CI 95%: 12.6% to 39.6%) I2 = 86%, respectively, p = 0.004. No other factor was significantly associated with HER2 positivity rates. Our results suggest that a small, but still meaningful proportion of CC is expected to be HER2-positive. High heterogeneity was the main limitation of the study. Variations in previously reported HER2 positivity rates are mainly related to methodological issues.","Itkin, Boris; Garcia, Agustin; Straminsky, Samanta; Adelchanow, Eduardo Daniel; Pereyra, Matias; Haab, Gabriela Acosta; Bardach, Ariel",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591928/,31

Its consequences were the implementation of national measures such as the containment of the population, but also a disorganization of the healthcare system, in particular concerning oral care. Indeed, dental procedures produce aerosols which can be loaded with viral particles, and as such, constitute a major contamination route by the virus. At the request of the Conference of Deans of the Faculties of Odontology, the National College of University Dentists in Public Health (CNCDUSP) set up a working group in order to issue recommendations for oral care in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, given the specific risks faced by practitioners. Considering the lack of awareness of the specifics of dentistry in the medical world and among decision-makers, and given the speed with which national measures to fight the epidemic were implemented, the recommendations of the CNCDUSP had to be drawn up rigorously and quickly before being released to the profession.

A combined ligand- and structure-based virtual screening of commercial databases was performed to identify structural analogs of virtual screening hits previously discovered in our laboratory. A total of 28 low micromolar inhibitors of FP-2 and FP-3 were identified and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) in each series was elaborated. The SAR of the compounds was unusually steep in some cases and could not be explained by a traditional analysis of the ligand-protein interactions (van der Waals, electrostatics, and hydrogen bonds). To gain further insights, a statistical thermodynamic analysis of explicit solvent in the ligand binding domains of FP-2 and FP-3 was carried out to understand the roles played by water molecules in binding of these inhibitors. Indeed, the energetics associated with the displacement of water molecules upon ligand binding explained some of the complex trends in the SAR. Furthermore, low potency of a subset of FP-2 inhibitors that could not be understood by the water energetics was explained in the context of poor chemical reactivity of the reactive centers of these compounds. The present study highlights the importance of considering energetic contributors to binding beyond traditional ligand-protein interactions.","Shah, Falgun; Gut, Jiri; Legac, Jennifer; Shivakumar, Devleena; Sherman, Woody; Rosenthal, Philip J; Avery, Mitchell A",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci2005516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22332946/,31

METHODS Twenty patients (6 male and 14 female, median age 62 years) with 45 focal hypovascular liver metastases (16 colorectal carcinoma, 3 melanoma and 1 breast carcinoma) underwent RF ablation under CT-guidance and received a ce-PET/CT scan within 24 h post-procedure. Pre- and post-ablation ce-CT-images were aligned using an interactive procedure and used to verify the tumor coverage of the RF ablation. Results were correlated to LTP as recorded during follow-up performed every 2-3 months after the intervention (mean follow-up of 110 weeks) and compared to standard reading performed by three readers of the ce-CT images. RESULTS Eleven tumors (25%) showed LTP during the follow-up period. One lesion, which did not show LTP, was excluded from analysis due to the poor quality of the alignment. For the remaining, 29 (66%) tumors were completely covered by the ablation zone, 9 (20%) were not, and for 6 (14%) tumors the edges coincided with the edge of the ablation zone. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for LTP of having incomplete tumor coverage or no apparent ablative margin versus standard reading of ce-CT were 100, 88, 73 and 100% versus 42, 88, 58 and 82%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Verifying the tumor coverage of liver metastases by an ablation zone through alignment of pre- and early post-ablation ce-CT images has a high predictive value for LTP.","Vandenbroucke, Frederik; Vandemeulebroucke, Jef; Buls, Nico; Thoeni, Ruedi F; de Mey, Johan",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-018-1765-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651715/,31

By unbiased microarray analysis of the β-cell gene expression profile of insulin-producing cells exposed to glucolipotoxicity in the presence or absence of a selective HDAC3 inhibitor, we identified Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as the sole target candidate. β-Cells were protected against glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress and apoptosis by EZH2 attenuation. Small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity rescued human islets from glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Moreover, EZH2 knockdown cells were protected against glucolipotoxicity-induced downregulation of the protective non-canonical Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NFκB) pathway. We conclude that EZH2 deficiency protects from glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress, apoptosis and downregulation of the non-canonical NFκB pathway, but not from insulin secretory dysfunction. The mechanism likely involves transcriptional regulation via EZH2 functioning as a methyltransferase and/or as a methylation-dependent transcription factor.","Dahlby, Tina; Simon, Christian; Backe, Marie Balslev; Dahllöf, Mattias Salling; Holson, Edward; Wagner, Bridget K; Böni-Schnetzler, Marianne; Marzec, Michal Tomasz; Lundh, Morten; Mandrup-Poulsen, Thomas",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137873/,31

METHODS We examined 15 MRIs along the midsagittal view. Five reference points used for pelvic floor measurements were identified both manually and using our semiautomated measurement model. The two processes were compared in terms of accuracy and precision. RESULTS The semiautomated pelvic floor measurement model provided highly consistent and accurate locations for all reference points on MRI. Results also showed that the model can identify the reference points faster than the manual-point identification process. CONCLUSION The semiautomated pelvic floor measurement model can be used to facilitate and improve the process of pelvic floor measurements on MRI. This will enable high throughput analysis of MRI data to improve the correlation analysis with clinical outcomes and potentially improve POP assessment.,"Onal, S; Lai-Yuen, S; Bao, P; Weitzenfeld, A; Greene, K; Kedar, R; Hart, S",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-013-2287-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429795/,31

A patient with chronic colocutaneous fistula received an off-label treatment with a thermoresponsive Poloxamer 407 gel (20%) via percutaneous administration and injected under endoscopic control. Treatment consisted in the association of esophageal stent placement and gel injection. The product was administered just after the stent placement at<20°C in its liquid form, gelling at body temperature to form a fistula plug. However, the stent was removed at day 26 because of major pain and the fistula was still present. Treatment was continued a total of 14 administrations of thermoresponsive Poloxamer 407 gel during 7 weeks via the external fistula orifice. The treatment reduced fistula orifice diameter from 4.0±0.5 to 1mm and fistula daily output decreased from 425±65 to 23±4mL, when comparing the months before and after treatment. Gel administration was not associated with any toxic effects. The therapeutic outcome remained stable 1 year after treatment. The external fistula diameter and the fistula output were similar to what was observed after the last Poloxamer 407 gel administration.","Berger, Arthur; Caudron, Eric; Perrod, Guillaume; Boucenna, Imane; Gazeau, Florence; Wilhelm, Claire; Berger, Anne; Clément, Olivier; Cellier, Christophe; Silva, Amanda K A; Rahmi, Gabriel",Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2020.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917564/,31
90215,Human lung cancer cells grown on acellular rat lung matrix create perfusable tumor nodules.,2012,"Background: Over the last several years, homelessness has increased in Ireland and across Europe. Rates have recently declined since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but it is unclear whether emergency housing measures will remain in place permanently. Populations experiencing long-term homelessness face a higher burden of multi-morbidity at an earlier age than housed populations and have poorer health outcomes. However, this population also has more difficulty accessing appropriate health services. A realist review by the authors found that important health system contexts which impact access are resourcing, training, funding cycles, health system fragmentation, health system goals, how care is organised, culture, leadership and flexibility of care delivery. Using a realist evaluation approach, this research will explore and refine key system-level factors, highlighted in our realist review, in a local health care system. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand how funding procedures and health system performance management impact service settings, staff, providers and their ability to make services accessible to populations experiencing homelessness. Methods: A realist evaluation will be undertaken to explain how funding and health system performance management impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. Data will be collected using qualitative and realist interview techniques and focus group methodology. Secondary data such as policy documents and budgets will utilised. The analysis will follow Pawson and Tilley's iterative phases starting with building an Initial programme theory, then data collection, data analysis, synthesis and finally building a refined programme theory. Conclusion: Building on a realist review conducted by the same research team, this study will further test and refine findings that explain how health system factors impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. The study has the potential to inform policy makers, health planners and managers of contextual factors that can be modified to increase healthcare accessibility.","Siersbaek, Rikke; Ford, John; Ní Cheallaigh, Clíona; Burke, Sara; Thomas, Steve",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13154.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537554/,31

For two reasons: firstly it seemed to me so little time had passed since the previous issue about this disease and perhaps there weren't many new things to say and secondly I believed that the only topic worth discussing nowadays was the disease that overshadowed anything else: COVID-19. Nevertheless I realized that he was right. More than 3 years had passed since the previous issue and there were many updates related to this subject and COVID-19 or not, the treatment of breast cancer must continue. I am grateful to those who answered to my invitation to write an article. I was amazed by the huge number and the quality of the papers received. They were so numerous that we decided to have a supplement of the journal dedicated to breast cancer edited with the contribution of the Romanian Society of Breast Surgery and Oncology. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire planet in almost every aspect of life, including the medical system. The treatment of other diseases, other than COVID-19, has in some way become secondary, at least for the time being. This had immediate repercussions and will inevitably have a long-term impact as well. Breast cancer patients suffered consequently. Screening, diagnosis, treatments including surgery and post therapeutic follow-ups have been profoundly affected by the pandemic.","Blidaru, Alexandru",Chirurgia,https://doi.org/10.21614/chirurgia.116.2.131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950807/,31
91176,An in vivo microfluidic study of bacterial transit in C. elegans nematodes.,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND When conventional approaches to obtain effective ventilation and return of effective spontaneous breathing fail, surgical airway is the last rescue option. Most physicians have a limited lifetime experience with cricothyrotomy, and it is unclear what method should be taught for this lifesaving procedure. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of medical personnel, naive to surgical airway techniques, in establishing an emergency surgical airway in cadavers using three commonly used cricothyrotomy techniques. METHODS Twenty medical students, without previous knowledge of surgical airway techniques, were randomly selected from their class. After training, they performed cricothyrotomy by three techniques (surgical, Melker, and QuickTrach II) in a random order on 60 cadavers with comparable biometrics. The time to complete the procedure, rate of success, and number of complications were recorded. A success was defined as the correct placement of the cannula within the trachea in 3 min. RESULTS The success rates were 95, 55, and 50% for surgical cricothyrotomy, QuickTrach, and Melker, respectively (P = 0.025). The majority of failures were due to cannula misplacement (15 of 20). In successful procedures, the mean procedure time was 94 ± 35 s in the surgical group, 77 ± 34 in the QuickTrach II group, and 149 ± 24 in the Melker group (P < 0.001). Few significant complications were found in successful procedures. No cadaver biometric parameters were correlated with success of the procedure. CONCLUSION Surgical airway-naive medical personnel establish emergency cricothyrotomy more efficiently and safely with the surgical procedure than with the other two commonly used techniques.","Heymans, Frédéric; Feigl, Georg; Graber, Stephan; Courvoisier, Delphine S; Weber, Kerstin M; Dulguerov, Pavel",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27275669/,31
91256,Inflammasomes in Common Immune-Related Skin Diseases.,2020,"Lower respiratory tract infections in intubated patients include ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). These infections are increasingly caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which colonize the patient's oropharynx and enter the lower respiratory tract around the endotracheal tube cuff or through the lumen. Progression of colonization to VAT and, in some patients, to VAP is related to the quantity, types, and virulence of invading bacteria versus containment by host defenses. Diagnostic criteria for VAT and VAP overlap in terms of clinical signs and symptoms, and they share similar microbiologic criteria when endotracheal sputum aspirate samples are used. In addition, the diagnosis of VAP requires a new and persistent infiltrate on a chest radiograph, which may be difficult to assess in critically ill patients, and a significant bacterial culture of a endtotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. Current guidelines for the management of VAP strongly recommend the use of early, appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy based on patient risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens. An alternative model focused on VAT, using serial surveillance of endotracheal aspirate specimens to identify multidrug-resistant pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities, would allow earlier, targeted antibiotic treatment that could improve outcomes in patients, prevent VAP, and provide an attractive model for clinical research trials.","Craven, Donald E; Hjalmarson, Karin I",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1086/653051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20597674/,31

The aim of this review was to describe the clinical features, treatment and outcomes of MIS-C, as well as to assess the risk of bias of published case studies, analyzing their reporting quality. Methods We searched all articles reporting on multisystem inflammatory condition in children and adolescents in the context of COVID-19 through MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from their inception to June 17, 2020. We used CARE and IHE checklists to evaluate the risk of bias and quality of the included studies. We combined the data of clinical manifestations, imaging findings, treatments and outcomes using STATA version 15. Results Twenty-four studies were included, with a total of 270 participants. Most cases were from Europe and the United States, and the terms of MIS-C in different articles were varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most experienced symptoms. Shock, rash, conjunctivitis, lips or oral cavity changes, hand and feet anomalies, and lymphadenopathy were observed, while respiratory symptoms seemed relatively infrequent. Seventy-eight percent to 100% of patients had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 by serology [86% (95% CI: 78%, 95%)] were more than those by RT-PCR [36% (95% CI: 26%, 46%)]. Most patients had one or more increased inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer, accompanied by neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Impaired cardiac function was seen from elevated biomarkers and abnormal echocardiography. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), anticoagulants, inotropic agents and glucocorticoids were the main treatments, along with other intensive supportive care. Overall, the outcomes of MIS-C were favorable, and only one death was recorded. In terms of the quality assessment of included studies, most of the case studies did not follow the standard reporting checklist, so that they failed to get higher scores in the risk of bias assessment. Conclusions Patients with MIS-C present with symptoms more severe than children with COVID-19, with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms as the primary manifestations and multisystem involvement, particularly cardiovascular system. Longer follow-up and further researches for the pathophysiology of MIS-C are urgently needed. In addition, attention should be paid to the quality of case studies to improve the completeness and transparency of scientific reports.","Tang, Yuyi; Li, Weiguo; Baskota, Muna; Zhou, Qi; Fu, Zhou; Luo, Zhengxiu; Shi, Yuan; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Enmei",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633944/,31

A meta-analysis was conducted to compare efficacy and safety profiles of both techniques in pediatrics and adults. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane until 11/10/2019. Efficacy was evaluated comparing incidence of ETV failure, while safety was defined by the incidence of perioperative complications, intraoperative bleedings, and deaths. Random-effects models were used to pool the incidence. Out of 1365 studies, 46 case series were meta-analyzed, yielding 821 patients who underwent flexible ETV and 2918 who underwent rigid ETV, with an age range of [5 days-87 years]. Although flexible ETV had a higher incidence of failure in adults (flexible: 54%, 95%CI: 22-82% vs rigid: 20%, 95%CI: 22-82%) possibly due to confounding due to etiology in adults treated with flexible, a smaller difference was seen in pediatrics (flexible: 36%, pediatric: 32%). Safety profiles were acceptable for both techniques, with a certain degree of variability for complications (flexible 2%, rigid 18%) and death (flexible 1%, rigid 3%) in pediatrics as well as complications (rigid 9%, flexible 13%), death (flexible 4%, rigid 6%) and intra-operative bleeding events (rigid 6%, flexible 8%) in adults. No clear superiority in efficacy could be depicted between flexible and rigid ETV for hydrocephalus treatment. Safety profiles varied by age but were acceptable for both techniques. Well-designed comparative studies are needed to assess the optimal endoscopic treatment option for hydrocephalus.","Boaro, Alessandro; Mahadik, Bhargavi; Petrillo, Anthony; Siddi, Francesca; Devi, Sharmila; Chawla, Shreya; Abunimer, Abdullah M; Feletti, Alberto; Fiorindi, Alessandro; Longatti, Pierluigi; Sala, Francesco; Smith, Timothy R; Mekary, Rania A",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-021-01590-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173114/,31

METHODS From January 2014 to December 2017, data of consecutive patients who underwent RARC performed by 2 institutional surgeons were prospectively collected in a dedicated database (IRB: 251647). Patients were divided in 2 groups according to the operating surgeon, one performing ECUD, the other ICUD. Groups were compared in perioperative outcomes and Clavien complications (during admission, within 30- and 90-days postoperatively). Univariable and multivariable analyses tested the impact of variables of interest on the occurrence of complications at the different time points. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate recurrence and metastasis-free survivals. RESULTS Sixty to 66 patients underwent RARC with ileal conduit ICUD and ECUD, respectively. ICUD patients were younger (69 vs 73 years old, P = .009). No differences were found in other baseline characteristics and final pathology. Regarding perioperative outcomes, shorter operative time favored ECUD (7 vs 6 hours, P = .0004). Specifically, no differences were found in postoperative complications while admitted, either overall (ICUD: 16 [26.7%] vs ECUD: 23 [34.8%] patients, P = .3) or major (ICUD: 10 [16.7%] vs ECUD: 14 [21.2%], P = .6); same was for reassessment within 30- and 90-days postoperatively. At multivariable analysis, Charlson's Comorbidity Index ≥3 and blood losses >600 mL predicted complications during the admission (P = .02). Male gender, higher body mass index, and ureteral involvement predicted 30-days complications (P = .04). No differences in oncological outcomes. CONCLUSION At head-to-head comparison of 2 expert surgeons, ICUD and ECUD for ileal conduit had comparable perioperative outcomes.","Bertolo, Riccardo; Agudelo, Jose; Garisto, Juan; Armanyous, Sherif; Fergany, Amr; Kaouk, Jihad",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2018.11.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707964/,31

Sex typically involves recombination of closely related DNA or RNA sequences, which is fundamentally a random process that creates but also breaks up beneficial allele combinations. Directed evolution experiments, which combine in vitro mutation and recombination protocols with in vitro or in vivo selection, have proved to be an effective approach for improving functionality of nucleic acids and enzymes. As this approach allows extreme control over evolutionary conditions and parameters, it also facilitates the detection of small or position-specific recombination benefits and benefits associated with recombination between highly divergent genotypes. Yet, in vitro approaches have been largely exploratory and motivated by obtaining improved end products rather than testing hypotheses of recombination benefits. Here, we review the various experimental systems and approaches used by in vitro studies of recombination, discuss what they say about the evolutionary role of recombination, and sketch their potential for addressing extant questions about the evolutionary role of sex and recombination, in particular on complex fitness landscapes. We also review recent insights into the role of 'extracellular recombination' during the origin of life.This article is part of the themed issue 'Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.","Pesce, Diego; Lehman, Niles; de Visser, J Arjan G M","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

To establish a model, a single dose of LPS (500μg/kg body weight) was injected to male Wistar rats intraperitoneally. Troxerutin (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally for 5 days after induction of the model. Cognitive and behavioral evaluations were performed using Y-maze, single-trial passive avoidance, and novel object recognition tests. The expression of inflammatory mediators, SIRT1/SIRT3, and P53 was measured using the ELISA assay. Likewise, the expression levels of SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB were determined using Western blot assay. Brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity was determined by utilizing the method of Ellman. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using Fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined. A single intraperitoneal injection of LPS was led to ROS production, acute neuroinflammation, apoptotic cell death, and inactivation of the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Likewise, ELISA assay demonstrated that post-treatment with Troxerutin considerably suppressed LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and subsequently memory impairments by targeting SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Western blot assay confirmed ELISA results about SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB proteins. These results suggest that Troxerutin can be a suitable candidate to treat neuroinflammation caused by neurodegenerative disorders.","Jamali-Raeufy, Nida; Kardgar, Sedighe; Baluchnejadmojarad, Tourandokht; Roghani, Mehrdad; Goudarzi, Mina",Metabolic brain disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11011-019-00454-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313124/,31

These lesions have been reported mostly in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVES To examine the clinical features and treatment outcomes for adult (≥ 18 years) patients with NGAVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with NGAVFs who underwent endovascular treatment between 2008 and 2013. A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify reports of adult patients with these lesions. RESULTS Two adults with NGAVFs were treated at our institution via transarterial embolization with a favorable outcome. The literature search revealed 24 adult NGAVF cases. Among these cases and ours, mean patient age was 33.4 ± 13.3 years, and 13 were women. Most patients experienced protracted neurological symptoms at the time of treatment whereas 5 (19.2%) patients presented with acute hemorrhage. 18 patients had single hole fistulas; 8 had multi-hole fistulas. 11 patients were treated by microsurgical ligation, 10 by embolization, 4 by combined therapy, and 1 with observation. Two patients died of reperfusion hemorrhage. Women were more likely to have a favorable outcome than men (100% vs 75.0%; p=0.07). No statistical difference was found in terms of clinical outcome for patients with single hole versus multi-hole fistulas or those treated by surgery versus embolization. CONCLUSIONS NGAVFs are extremely rare in the adult population and present a similar clinical course as in older children. In our experience, transarterial embolization can be safely and effectively utilized for the treatment of these lesions in adults.","Lin, Ning; Brouillard, Adam M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25237068/,31

Extensive neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively, including tests for attention, memory and executive functions. Furthermore, headache and depression were assessed using the german version of the HDI (IBK) and the BDI-II. Multiple linear regression analyses of the percentile ranks (adjusted for age, sex and education) including the parameters age, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS), mood, pain and lesion size were performed to identify risk factors for cognitive impairment. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, the influence of hemisphere and type of lesion (tumor/vascular) was assessed. Posthoc Bonferroni correction was performed. Poorer neurocognitive functions were observed only in the category attention in patients with higher age (divided attention, WMS) and reduced KPS (WMS). Lesion volume, mood, pain, hemisphere or the type of the lesion (tumor, vascular) were not identified as risk factors for poorer neurocognitive functions in patients with benign intracranial lesions.

OBJECTIVE Using a well-established health screening database, we assessed the associations between BEC and decline in lung function, measured as the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). METHODS Serial BEC and FEV1 data were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, height, and smoking status. The association between BEC consistency and FEV1 decline was evaluated in subpopulation analyses. RESULTS A total of 4634 individuals were enrolled. The mean number of health-screenings was 7.49 over an average of 11.74 years of observation. A higher log2-transformed BEC was significantly associated with greater FEV1 decline that was stronger in non-smokers (P = 8.56x10-8) than in smokers (P = 1.52x10-3). In subpopulation analyses of 2018 individuals with consistent BECs, those with BECs consistently ≥ 100/μL (P = 4.58x10-6), ≥ 200/μL (P = 3.53x10-7), and ≥ 300/μL (P = 1.12x10-3) had a significantly higher, dose-dependent FEV1 decline than those with BECs consistently < 100/μL. A BEC threshold of 100/μL in non-smokers and 200/μL in smokers may predict accelerated FEV1 decline. CONCLUSIONS BEC is associated with a decline in FEV1, and a consistently high BEC is an independent risk factor for accelerated FEV1 decline. These results suggest the use of the BEC to identify healthy individuals at high risk for developing chronic lung disease, which in turn may enable a tailored preventive strategy.","Lee, So-Hee; Ahn, Kyung-Min; Lee, Suh-Young; Kim, Sun-Sin; Park, Heung-Woo",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

The most common form of pulmonary complication is interstitial pneumonitis which is treated with discontinuation of amiodarone and initiation of corticosteroids. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary eosinophilia is a rare complication of amiodarone therapy, with blood and pulmonary eosinophilia the predominant features. During the COVID-19 era, the incidence of delay in treatment of pulmonary pathology is also delayed due to the effort of excluding COVID-19 infection. Here we report a case of a 64-year-old man who developed eosinophilic pneumonia after initiation of amiodarone therapy, and the investigations required to exclude other forms of pulmonary toxicity.

RECENT FINDINGS Within the past years, five moderate-sized randomized controlled trials evaluated different DAPT durations after percutaneous coronary intervention. These studies included a significant percentage of ACS patients that varied from 30 to 75% depending on the study. Results suggest that in selected populations prolonging DAPT does not offer additional protection from ischemic events and increases bleeding complications. However, results from a large-scale registry illustrate that DAPT durations beyond 6 months are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Moreover, a multicenter registry demonstrated that the context underlying DAPT cessation is an additional correlate of outcomes after stent implantation. SUMMARY Current guidelines suggest 12 months of DAPT after an initial presentation with ACS. Emerging evidence suggest that in selected populations shorter duration might be acceptable.","Christodoulidis, Georgios; Baber, Usman; Mehran, Roxana",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842783/,31
94677,Intestinal bacterial metabolism and anti-complement activities of three major components of the seeds of Entada phaseoloides.,2015,"BACKGROUND Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is considered a reliable locoregional technique for pain control after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. However, no clear benefit of TAP block over wound infiltration has been demonstrated by the current literature. This multicenter randomized clinical trial tested the non-inferiority of wound infiltration (WI) compared to WI plus laparoscopic-assisted TAP block (L-TAP). METHODS All patients with colorectal cancer and diverticular disease scheduled for laparoscopic resection at the Division of General and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust, Verona, Italy and at the Colorectal Cancer Center, Kyungpook National University Medical Center, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, between April 2018 and March 2019 were considered for the trial. Patients were randomly allocated to either the WI group or the WI plus L-TAP group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. In total, 108 patients entered the study and 102 patients were analyzed; 50 patients received WI plus L-TAP and 52 patients received WI. The primary end point was the efficacy in pain control at 6 h measured according to Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Secondary aims evaluated pain control at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h and other short-term results related to pain management. RESULTS Estimation of pain intensity at 6 h was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.16) with a mean (95% CI) difference in pain scores of 0.94 (- 0.13 to 2.02). No differences in pain scores were observed at other interval times or considering analgesic consumption, return of bowel function, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION This study suggests that adding TAP block to WI does not affect pain control, amount of analgesics and other short-term outcomes.

Reliable cardiac imaging modalities are the basis for applicable results. Four-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance (4D CMR) has been set as the gold standard for in-vivo assessment of ventricular function in rodents. However, technical improvements in echocardiography now allow us to image the whole heart, which makes four-dimensional echocardiography (4DE) a possible alternative to 4D CMR. To date, no study has systematically assessed 4DE in comparison with 4D CMR in rats. In total we studied 26 juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats (Crl: CD (SD) IGS). Twenty rats underwent echocardiographic imaging (2D and 4D) and 4D CMR. Five of those rats underwent a ligation of the superior and inferior vena cava to reduce the cardiac inflow as a disease model. Six additional rats were used to assess reproducibility of echocardiography and underwent three echocardiographic examinations. 4D CMR was performed on a 7T scanner; 2D and 4D echocardiography was conducted using a 40 MHz transducer. Correlation between 4D CMR, 4DE and 2DE for left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed. An excellent correlation was observed between 4DE and 4D CMR ( r = 0.95, p < 0.001). Correlation of 2DE and 4D CMR was weak ( r = 0.57, p < 0.01). 4DE provides results that are equally precise as 4D CMR and highly reproducible with less technical effort than 4D CMR.","Stegmann, Hedwig; Bäuerle, Tobias; Kienle, Katharina; Dittrich, Sven; Alkassar, Muhannad",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677218789971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081741/,31

Practice-based resources can help overcome implementation challenges. Methods In 2015, the IGNITE (Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE) Network created an online genomic medicine implementation resource toolbox that was expanded in 2017 to incorporate the ability for users to create targeted implementation guides. This expansion was led by a multidisciplinary team that developed an evidence-based, structured framework for the guides, oversaw the technical process/build, and pilot tested the first guide, CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation. Results Sixty-five resources were collected from 12 institutions and categorized according to a seven-step implementation framework for the pilot CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation Guide. Five months after its launch, 96 CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation Guides had been created. Eighty percent of the resources most frequently selected by users were created by IGNITE to fill an identified resource gap. Resources most often included in guides were from the test reimbursement (22%), Implementation support gathering (22%), EHR integration (17%), and genetic testing workflow steps (17%).

97349,Venous thrombosis and predictors of relapse in eosinophil-related diseases.,2021-03-18,"PURPOSE There is an increasing number of patients being dialyzed with permanent catheters (PC). In the majority of cases, heparin is used to maintain PC patency. This practice causes clotting disturbances due to heparin leakage and may predispose the patient to bleeding episodes. It has not been well studied whether lowering heparin concentration for canal locking decreases short-term bleeding complications after PC placement. METHODS This was a prospective single-center randomized open-label trial conducted in hemodialyzed patients undergoing PC insertion. Low concentration of heparin (LCH) 2,500 IU/ml versus high concentration of heparin (HCH) 5,000 IU/ml was randomly used for catheter lumens locking. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of bleeding within 24 h after catheter placement. The effects of clinical and laboratory data on bleeding events were analyzed as secondary endpoints. RESULTS Seventy-five patients (37 in LCH) were enrolled in the study. Only in the HCH group we found a significant prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 2 h after PC placement (p < 0.001). There was a higher number of bleeding episodes in the HCH group (n = 16; 42.1%) than in the LCH group (n = 7; 18.9%) (χ(2) = 4.74; p = 0.029). In univariate analysis, assignment to HCH, baseline APTT, use of low molecular weight heparin, and femoral localization were associated with bleeding events. In multivariate analysis, the use of HCH (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.10-12.05) and baseline APTT (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.002-1.250) predicted bleeding after PC insertion. CONCLUSION LCH used for canals locking decreases bleeding events in the first 24 hours after permanent catheter placement, compared to HCH.","Hryszko, Tomasz; Brzosko, Szymon; Mysliwiec, Michal",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-012-0151-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22418764/,31

Here, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein-derived CTL epitope, N1 (QFKDNVILL), restricted by HLA-A*2402 was identified by a series of in vitro studies, including a computer-assisted algorithm for prediction, stabilization of the peptide by co-refolding with HLA-A*2402 heavy chain and β(2)-microglobulin (β(2)m), and T2-A24 cell binding. Consequently, the antigenicity of the peptide was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), proliferation assays, and HLA-peptide complex tetramer staining using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had recovered from SARS donors. Furthermore, the crystal structure of HLA-A*2402 complexed with peptide N1 was determined, and the featured peptide was characterized with two unexpected intrachain hydrogen bonds which augment the central residues to bulge out of the binding groove. This may contribute to the T-cell receptor (TCR) interaction, showing a host immunodominant peptide presentation strategy. Meanwhile, a rapid and efficient strategy is presented for the determination of naturally presented CTL epitopes in the context of given HLA alleles of interest from long immunogenic overlapping peptides.","Liu, Jun; Wu, Peng; Gao, Feng; Qi, Jianxun; Kawana-Tachikawa, Ai; Xie, Jing; Vavricka, Christopher J; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Li, Taisheng; Gao, George F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01464-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20844028/,31

We hypothesized that lidocaine jelly applied to the tapered cuff of the endotracheal tube (ETT) might decrease the incidence of POST most commonly arising from endotracheal intubation. METHODS A total of 208 patients under general anesthesia were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups. In the lidocaine group (n = 104), the distal part of ETTs with tapered-shaped cuff was lubricated with lidocaine jelly. In the control group (n = 104), the distal part of ETTs with tapered-shaped cuff was lubricated with normal saline. The incidence of POST, hoarseness, and cough in the postanesthesia patients was compared. RESULTS The overall incidence of POST was higher in the lidocaine group than in the normal saline group [60 (58%) vs 40 (39%), P = .006]. The incidence of POST at 1 hour postoperatively was higher in the lidocaine group than in the normal saline group [53 (51%) vs 32 (31%), P = .003]. The overall incidence of hoarseness for 24 hours postoperatively was comparable (P = .487). The overall incidence of cough for 24 hours postoperatively is higher in the lidocaine group (P = .045).

Each representative collated the collective experiences of trainees in their training programme in key domains, including redeployment, shielding, training, and teaching. RESULTS Ninety-five percent (38 of 40) of representatives completed the questionnaire. Trainees in up to 76% of training programmes were redeployed to wards and some trainees were shielding in 81% of programmes. Only 27% of programmes enabled remote reporting for isolating or shielding trainees. Sixty-two percent of respondents felt their well-being needs were supported. There was an overall increase in the attendance, volume, and quality of teaching and training nationally due to improved accessibility via remote-learning methods. Significant challenges were described with reporting, interventional procedures, and multidisciplinary team meeting attendance, although 62% of programmes noted an increase in service provision.

100010,The potentialities of oxytocin receptor inhibitors for endometriosis therapy.,2020,"Understanding the genetic constraints on pathogen evolution will help to predict the emergence of generalist pathogens that can infect a range of different host genotypes. Here we show that generalist viral pathogens are more likely to emerge during coevolution between the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the lytic phage SBW25Φ2 than when the same pathogen is challenged to adapt to a nonevolving population of novel hosts. When phages were able to adapt to nonevolving novel hosts, the resulting phenotypes had relatively narrow host ranges compared with coevolved phages. Evolved (rather than coevolved) phages also had lower virulence, although they attained virulence similar to that of coevolved phages after continued adaptation to a nonevolving population of the same host. We explain these results by using sequence data showing that the evolution of broad host range is associated with several different amino acid substitutions and therefore occurs only through repeated rounds of selection for novel infectivity alleles. These findings suggest that generalist bacteriophages are more likely to emerge through long-term coevolution with their hosts than through spontaneous adaptation to a single novel host. These results are likely to be relevant to host-parasite systems where parasite generalism can evolve through the acquisition of multiple mutations or alleles, as appears to be the case for many plant-bacteria and bacteria-virus interactions.","Hall, Alex R; Scanlan, Pauline D; Buckling, Angus",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/657441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21117957/,31
100074,Missing the Target.,2020-03-26,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction, deterioration of neuronal transmission, and consequently neuronal death. Although there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant, in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated, resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD. Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128 expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128 expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and function.","Shvarts-Serebro, Inna; Sheinin, Anton; Gottfried, Irit; Adler, Lior; Schottlender, Nofar; Ashery, Uri; Barak, Boaz",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-021-01862-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151409/,31

Nevertheless, evidence of these advantages in prospective, observational studies from real-life settings is scarce. METHODS This is a prospective, observational study, including a consecutive series of patients that underwent elective colonic resection for cancer in 52 Spanish hospitals. Pre-/intraoperative data, related to patient, tumor, surgical procedure, and hospital, were recorded as well as 60-day post-operative outcomes, including wound infection, complications, anastomotic leak, length of stay, and mortality. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine the influence of laparoscopy on short-term post-operative outcome. A sub-analysis of the effect of laparoscopy according to patients' pre-operative risk (ASA Score I-II vs. III-IV) was also performed. RESULTS 2968 patients were included: 44.2% were initially operated by laparoscopy, with a 13.9% conversion rate to laparotomy. At univariate analysis, laparoscopy was associated with a decreased mortality (p = 0.015), morbidity (p < 0.0001), wound infection (p < 0.0001), and post-operative length of stay (p < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, laparoscopy resulted as an independent protective factor for morbidity (OR 0.7; p = 0.004), wound infection (OR 0.6; p < 0.0001), and length of post-operative stay (Effect-2 days; p < 0.0001), compared to open approach. These advantages were more relevant in high-risk patients (ASA III-IV), even if the majority of them were operated by open approach (67.1%). CONCLUSIONS In a real-life setting, laparoscopy decreases wound infection rate, post-operative complications, and length of stay, especially in ASA III-IV patients.","Cerdán Santacruz, Carlos; Frasson, Matteo; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Ramos Rodríguez, José Luis; Trallero Anoro, Marta; Millán Scheiding, Mónica; Maseda Díaz, Olga; Dujovne Lindenbaum, Paula; Monzón Abad, Andrés; García-Granero Ximenez, Eduardo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5548-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455773/,31
100818,Specificities of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 sera.,2009,"AIM Cooling the pharynx and upper oesophagus would be more advantageous for rapid induction of therapeutic hypothermia since the carotid arteries run in their vicinity. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of pharyngeal cooling on brain temperature and the safety and feasibility for patients under resuscitation. METHODS Witnessed non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients (n=108) were randomized to receive standard care with (n=53) or without pharyngeal cooling (n=55). In the emergency room, pharyngeal cooling was initiated before or shortly after return of spontaneous circulation by perfusing physiological saline (5 °C) into a pharyngeal cuff for 120 min. RESULTS There was a significant decrease in tympanic temperature at 40 min after arrival (P=0.02) with a maximum difference between the groups at 120 min (32.9 ± 1.2°C, pharyngeal cooling group vs. 34.1 ± 1.3°C, control group; P<0.001). The return of spontaneous circulation (70% vs. 65%, P=0.63) and rearrest (38% vs. 47%, P=0.45) rates were not significantly different based on the initiation of pharyngeal cooling. No post-treatment mechanical or cold-related injury was observed on the pharyngeal epithelium by macroscopic observation. The thrombocytopaenia incidence was lower in the pharyngeal cooling group (P=0.001) during the 3-day period after arrival. The cumulative survival rate at 1 month was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Initiation of pharyngeal cooling before or immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation is safe and feasible. Pharyngeal cooling can rapidly decrease tympanic temperature without adverse effects on circulation or the pharyngeal epithelium.","Takeda, Yoshimasa; Kawashima, Takahisa; Kiyota, Kazuya; Oda, Shigeto; Morimoto, Naoki; Kobata, Hitoshi; Isobe, Hisashi; Honda, Mitsuru; Fujimi, Satoshi; Onda, Jun; I, Seishi; Sakamoto, Tetsuya; Ishikawa, Masami; Nakano, Hiroshi; Sadamitsu, Daikai; Kishikawa, Masanobu; Kinoshita, Kosaku; Yokoyama, Tomoharu; Harada, Masahiro; Kitaura, Michio; Ichihara, Kiyoshi; Hashimoto, Hiroshi; Tsuji, Hidekazu; Yorifuji, Takashi; Nagano, Osamu; Katayama, Hiroshi; Ujike, Yoshihito; Morita, Kiyoshi",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263513/,31

Due to a lack of reliable confirmatory laboratory tests, the diagnosis of KD is based on a characteristic pattern of clinical findings that appear in a typical temporal sequence. The diagnostic criteria have been periodically modified and the American Heart Association has proposed the most recent guidelines for its diagnosis. However, patients may have incomplete or atypical forms of KD and diagnosis can often be difficult. Because oropharyngeal manifestations are a common and important feature for diagnosing KD and recent studies have hypothesized a possible association between KD and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in this review we highlight the importance of dentists in the diagnosis of KD and its potential association with SARS-CoV-2.","Martelli Júnior, Hercílio; Machado, Renato Assis; Martelli, Daniella Reis Barbosa; Barbosa, Mauro Costa; Bonan, Paulo Rogério Ferreti; Coletta, Ricardo Della",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2021.vol35.0047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729297/,31

The aim of the present study was to validate the Hebrew version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (DTQ; Caselli & Spada, 2011) in a sample of adolescents and to investigate its relationship with measures of thought suppression, impulsivity and individual-based compulsive sexual behaviour. Methods In Study 1, a convenience sample of 718 adolescents completed the newly translated Desire Thinking Questionnaire in Hebrew (DTQ-H) and results were subjected to an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). In Study 2, a convenience sample of 379 adolescents completed a battery of questionnaires including the DTQ-H. A Confirmatory Factors Analysis was performed on the DTQ-H and validity was ascertained by correlating with other measures. Results In Study 1, a 9-item two-factor structure was identified. A 6-item two-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2. Results also indicated that the DTQ-H has acceptable levels of reliability, and good concurrent and incremental validity in predicting compulsive sexual behaviour. Conclusions The 6-item DTQ-H appears to be a reliable and valid measure of desire thinking and may be used also on adolescents - an understudied population.","Efrati, Yaniv; Kolubinski, Daniel C; Caselli, Gabriele; Spada, Marcantonio M",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006958/,31

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NRs revealed the hexagonal wurtzite structure for all composites with an average coherence length of about 40-60 nm. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study confirmed the presence of transparent and wrinkled, dense GO nanosheets among flower-like ZnO nanorods, depending on the GO amounts used in preparation. Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements revealed the impact of GO concentration on the optical and luminescence properties of ZnO NRs/GO nanocomposites. The energy band gap of the ZnO nanorods was independent of GO concentration. Photoluminescence spectra of nanocomposites showed a significant decrease in the intensities in the visible light range and red shifted suggesting a charge transfer process. The nanocomposites' chromaticity coordinates for CIE 1931 color space were estimated to be (0.33, 0.34), close to pure white ones. The obtained results highlight the possibility of using these nanocomposites to achieve good performance and suitability for optoelectronic applications.","Boukhoubza, Issam; Khenfouch, Mohammed; Achehboune, Mohamed; Leontie, Liviu; Galca, Aurelian Catalin; Enculescu, Monica; Carlescu, Aurelian; Guerboub, Mohammed; Mothudi, Bakang Moses; Jorio, Anouar; Zorkani, Izeddine",Nanomaterials,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10081532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764216/,31

This method has been utilized for the extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides from fruit juices prior to their quantification by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. The prepared sorbent consisted of the natural iron oxide (obtained from sand) coated with polyethylene. In the present work, first a few mg of the magnetic composite is added into an aqueous solution containing the analytes and vortexed. After that the analytes are eluted with iso-propanol from the surface of the composite particles separated in the presence of a strong external magnetic field. For further enrichment of the analytes, 1,2-dibromoethane (at µL-level) as an extraction solvent is mixed with the obtained eluent and hastily injected into deionized water. The composite was characterized using techniques including vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller nitrogen sorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry. Under optimal conditions, the method provided low limits of detection (0.94-1.9 μg L-1) and quantification (3.2-5.9 μg L-1), high enrichment factors (570-692), good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.994), and satisfactory repeatabilities (relative standard deviations ≤ 8% for intra- and inter-day precisions at a concentration of 15 μg L-1 of each analyte).","Mohebbi, Ali; Farajzadeh, Mir Ali",Journal of chromatography.

METHODS All mass spectra were collected on an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer in positive mode. Theoretical calculations were carried out by the density functional theory method at the B3LYP level with a hybrid basis set consisting of 6-31G(d,p) and LANL2DZ in the Gaussian 03 program. RESULTS When the ruthenated [15 ]Paracyclophanes (Ru-[15 ]PCPs) and Ru (II)-arene dimers were dissolved in the alkyl alcohol solvents, the adducts of alkoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations were observed under positive ion mode ESI-MS, which were resulted from the coordination of alkyl alcohol molecules with Ru (II)-arene cations followed by the deprotonation of O-H bond on the coordinated alcohols. Furthermore, the number of alkoxides binding to Ru-[15 ]PCPs was regulated by the number of ruthenium atoms. Attributed to good solubility and small steric hindrance, the intensity of the adducts of methoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations was the strongest among three alkyl alcohols used in this study. CONCLUSIONS The characteristic adducts of alkoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations were pervasively present in positive ion mode ESI-MS of nine Ru (II)-arene complexes dissolved in the alkyl alcohol solvents. Taking into consideration of the solubility and signal responding, the methanol is the most suitable solvent for the ESI-MS experiments of Ru (II)-arene complexes among the eight solvents studied, where almost only the diagnostic adducts of methoxides with Ru (II)-arene cation are present.","Cao, Xiaoji; Dong, Danqi; He, Dandan; Lin, Xupin",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.9148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151492/,31
102866,Usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography using Sonazoid for the assessment of therapeutic response to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Research supports the use of specific strategies to discontinue mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients. Little is known about how clinicians actually wean and discontinue MV in practice or the association between different discontinuation strategies and outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to describe international practices in the use of (1) daily screening for readiness to discontinue MV, (2) modes of MV used before initial discontinuation attempts, (3) weaning and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) protocols, (4) SBT techniques and (5) sedation and mobilisation practices to facilitate weaning and discontinuation. The secondary objectives are to identify patient characteristics and time-dependent factors associated with use of selected strategies, investigate associations between SBT outcome (failure vs success) and outcomes, explore differences between patients who undergo an SBT early versus later in their intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and investigate the associations between different SBT techniques and humidification strategies on outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct an international, prospective, observational study of MV discontinuation practices among critically ill adults who receive invasive MV for at least 24 hours at approximately 150 ICUs in six geographic regions (Canada, USA, UK, Europe, India and Australia/New Zealand). Research personnel at participating ICUs will collect demographic data, data to characterise the initial strategy or event that facilitated discontinuation of MV (direct extubation, direct tracheostomy, initial successful SBT, initial failed SBT or death before any attempt could be made), clinical outcomes and site information. We aim to collect data on at least 10 non-death discontinuation events in each ICU (at least 1500 non-death discontinuation events). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study received Research Ethics Approval from St. Michael's Hospital (11-024) Research ethics approval will be sought from all participating sites. The results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals.

COVID-19 may manifest bilateral interstitial pneumonia on imaging. About 30%-60% of patients present varying degrees of interstitial changes, while most patients have a good prognosis. Since there's little practical instruct on treating interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by COVID-19, we present this file as references for all the colleagues fighting with this disease. The primary findings on CT are bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation. Inter-/intra-lobular septal thickening are also common. Subpleural lines and traction bronchiectasis can be seen in some cases which indicate the presence of interstitial fibrosis. Images of severe cases are similar with those in advanced stage of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and organizing pneumonia (OP). COVID-19 could present the typical two phases of diffuse alveolar damage: acute and proliferative phase on pathology. Massive pulmonary interstitial fibrosis may also be present. HRCT is the best radiological approach for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, and to assess the presence of ILD. Periodical CT following-up is recommended for patients who present interstitial manifestations. Biomarkers such as KL-6, SP-D, RAGE may also helpful on evaluating the severity of interstitial fibrosis and therapeutic response. We do not suggest applying pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walking test on patients in active stage of the disease. The primary treatments in acute phase are antiviral therapy and supportive treatment. We do not suggest routine use of corticosteroids, while on patients with excessive activation of inflammatory response or rapid progression of lung lesions, a low to medium dosage of corticosteroids could be applied for a short course. Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are encouraged to apply on patients in reparative phase with evidence of progressing fibrosis. Low to medium dosage of corticosteroids is also feasible on patients with NSIP or OP manifestation in this phase, with a relatively longer course. Chinese traditional medicine and rehabilitation medicine may also helpful. Lung transplant surgery is an option for severe pulmonary fibrosis patients. Patients should receive CT following-up after be discharged from hospital, especially those whose pulmonary exudation is not well absorbed. We suggest a routine following-up on month 1, 4 and 10 after discharging, and an extended period for those who have developed irreversible interstitial fibrosis.",,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200326-00419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992435/,31

The present study is the first to examine the prevalence of DogCV in faeces of dogs from Germany and other European countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS Faecal samples from 184 dogs with diarrhoea and from 82 clinically healthy dogs (control group) were analysed for the presence of DogCV by PCR. Furthermore, the detection of parvovirus, coronavirus, Giardia and Cryptosporidium was performed in all samples. RESULTS In the group of dogs with diarrhoea the prevalence of DogCV was 20.1% (37/184), in the healthy control group it was 7.3% (6/82). Therefore, the virus could be detected significantly more frequently in dogs with diarrhoea. The detection frequency of DogCV is comparable with those of the other tested pathogens. In approximately 50% of the DogCV-positive dogs, infections with other enteropathogenic organisms were diagnosed. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear, but there appears to be an association between co-infection and disease severity. Evidence of DogCV in clinically healthy dogs appears important for the epidemiology and raises questions about its pathogenicity. Further studies are needed to clarify questions regarding the pathogenesis, causal relevance and possible interference by other diarrhoeal pathogens. Nevertheless, the results of this study are an important indication that DogCV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with diarrhoea.","Gentil, Michaela; Gruber, Achim D; Müller, Elisabeth","Tierarztliche Praxis.

The maternal mortality review committee process remains critical during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Maternal deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in the United States. Some state maternal mortality review committees may choose to expedite review of these deaths in an effort to quickly provide clinicians with information intended to prevent other deaths during the ongoing pandemic. If states opt to pursue rapid review, entry of data into the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application system for submission to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will allow for aggregation nationally without duplication. It will be important to review not only deaths directly attributed to COVID-19, but also those that may be indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as those influenced by changes in care practices or delays in seeking care during the pandemic. Therefore, regardless of the timing of the review, maternal deaths that occur during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic must be evaluated within that framework to ensure that all factors contributing to the death are considered to better understand the context of each of these tragic events.","Metz, Torri D; Collier, Charlene; Hollier, Lisa M",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544145/,31

Animal-based research should be performed in accordance with international regulations to monitor the humane care and use of the laboratory animals. Until 2018, the formal training of researchers in the appropriate and correct methods of animal handling during sampling and administration, as well as their husbandry demands, was an uncommon practice in Egypt. In 2018, the Egyptian Association for Animal Research Advancement (EAARA) organised the first international course in laboratory animal science (LAS), in collaboration with Utrecht University (The Netherlands) and the Faculty of Science, Cairo University, to raise researchers' awareness and increase their knowledge of the principles that govern the humane use and care of laboratory animals. A total of 26 researchers from a number of fields (veterinary medicine, dentistry, science, medicine, pharmacy and agriculture) enrolled in the course. In the responses to the post-course questionnaire, 24 (92.3%) participants stated that the principles of animal welfare (Three Rs) were well explained. In addition, 18 (69%) participants found that the course improved their skills in animal sampling and handling. Of the 26 participants, 22 (84.6%) became aware of their responsibility towards their experimental animals and agreed that the different methods of euthanasia were well explained.

Ways in which research funding can be wasted have been examined by researchers over the years, and a seminal series on research waste was published in the Lancet in 2014. The series systematically analysed every step of the funding lifecycle in five major stages and made recommendations to various actors including research funders. Prompted by its participation in the Ensuring Value in Research Funders' Forum, between June and October 2019 the HRB undertook a self-audit against the 17 recommendations identified in the Lancet series. Key HRB staff collated relevant policies and practices regarding each recommendation and sub-recommendation and assessed the HRB's performance under each heading. The self-assessment reflects the state of HRB policies and practices in October 2019. Of the 17 recommendations, five were found to be areas of strength and six were found to be areas of partial strength. Areas of strength reflect work over many years such as support for evidence synthesis, strong processes around award selection, driving research integrity and open data including an HRB-funded open publishing platform. Four recommendations were found to be areas for growth. These mostly revolve around real time reporting of study protocols and of ongoing funded research outside of clinical trials. Work is progressing to address some of these areas.

As providers of inpatient and emergency-based acute neurologic care, we have been attempting to locally prepare for and manage the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on 3 key areas: creating an integrated preparation plan that supports hospital measures; building an optimized, flexible, and redundant workforce; and maintaining a high level of neurologic care in our hospital and across our region despite limited transfer capabilities during the pandemic. This final concern is of key relevance in our region where our tertiary hospital supports numerous smaller community hospitals, typically by providing an open door to patient transfers. These hospitals are often in rural or frontier regions and are also affected by COVID-19, so not only are beginning to experience their own bed and clinician shortages,1 but are understandably nervous about what the pandemic means for the availability of traditional support systems for other non-COVID-related diseases.","Majersik, Jennifer J; Reddy, Vivek K",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284363/,31

We describe a case of a 28-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presenting with facial pain, vomiting and abdominal pain. She also complained of dyspnoea and chest pain. She was diagnosed and treated for DKA triggered by a dental abscess. Given the presentation during the coronavirus pandemic, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed in line with the diagnostic pathway for COVID-19, which incidentally showed a significant pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. The patient was initially investigated for oesophageal rupture secondary to vomiting (Boerhaave's syndrome), however, remained clinically stable throughout. Follow-up computed tomography showed near-complete resolution of pneumomediastinum with no intervention other than treatment of DKA. This therefore confirmed Hamman's syndrome.We propose that given the benign nature of the condition and the incidental finding in this report, as well as poor identification of mediastinal gas on chest X-ray, Hamman's syndrome is more common than reported.","Marchon, Keisha A; Nunn, Maya O; Chakera, Ali J",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199339/,31

Lack of early, intensive rehabilitation misses the opportunity for recovery during the critical time window of endogenous plasticity and improvement post-stroke. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this commentary was to highlighting the benefits of telework and telerehabilitation programs for workers with a stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Relevant publications regarding the management of individuals with a stroke, telerehabilitation and teleworking in the setting of COVID-19 were reviewed. RESULTS Previous studies showed that telerehabilitation can effectively provide an alternate method of promoting recovery for patients with a stroke. With the physical distancing precautions in place for mitigating viral spread, teleworking can also provide a method for long term recovery and improvements in quality of life after a stroke. CONCLUSIONS Overall, this commentary addresses the benefits of physically distant, safe and effective alternatives to support individuals who live with a stroke during COVID-19 pandemic.","Moradi, Vahideh; Babaee, Taher; Esfandiari, Elham; Lim, Shannon B; Kordi, Ramin",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427710/,31

No effective vaccine or treatment is available. Recent studies have shown that the nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) and 2'-C-methyl-cytidine (2CM-C) inhibit NoV replication in vitro and in animal models, but their precise mechanism of action is unknown. We evaluated the molecular interactions between nucleoside triphosphates and NoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NoVpol), the enzyme responsible for replication and transcription of NoV genomic RNA. We found that T-705 ribonucleoside triphosphate (RTP) and 2CM-C triphosphate (2CM-CTP) equally inhibited human and mouse NoVpol activities at concentrations resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC50s) in the low micromolar range. 2CM-CTP inhibited the viral polymerases by competing directly with natural CTP during primer elongation, whereas T-705 RTP competed mostly with ATP and GTP at the initiation and elongation steps. Incorporation of 2CM-CTP into viral RNA blocked subsequent RNA synthesis, whereas T-705 RTP did not cause immediate chain termination of NoVpol. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of enzyme selectivity, as they were both recognized as substrates by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The level of discrimination by the human enzyme was increased with a novel analog of T-705 RTP containing a 2'-C-methyl substitution. Collectively, our data suggest that 2CM-C inhibits replication of NoV by acting as a classic chain terminator, while T-705 may inhibit the virus by multiple mechanisms of action. Understanding the precise mechanism of action of anti-NoV compounds could provide a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities.","Jin, Zhinan; Tucker, Kathryn; Lin, Xiaoyan; Kao, C Cheng; Shaw, Ken; Tan, Hua; Symons, Julian; Behera, Ishani; Rajwanshi, Vivek K; Dyatkina, Natalia; Wang, Guangyi; Beigelman, Leo; Deval, Jerome",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01391-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26392512/,31
105326,Endovascular treatment of supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysms.,2014,"OBJECTIVE In this article, we adopt a syndemic approach to immigrant tuberculosis (TB) in Canada as a way of challenging contemporary epidemiological models of infectious diseases that tend to racialize and medicalize the risk of infections in socio-economically disadvantage populations and obscure the role of social conditions in sustaining the unequal distribution of diseases in these populations. DESIGN A syndemic approach unravels social and biological connections which shape the distribution of infections over space and time and is useful in de-racializing and de-medicalizing these epidemiologic models. The socio-historic framework allows us to examine social factors which, refracted through medical science, were central to the development of TB control in Canada at the beginning of twentieth century. RESULTS We expose the ideological assumptions about race, immigration, and social status which underpin current policies designed to control TB within the immigrant population. We argue that TB control policies which divert the attention from structural health determinants perpetuate health and social inequities of racialized populations in Canada. Medical screening and surveillance is an ineffective control policy because the proportion of TB cases attributed to immigrants increased from 18 to 66% between 1970 and 2007. CONCLUSION More effective TB control policies require shifting the focus from the individual disease carriers toward social inequities which underlie the problem of immigrant TB in Canada. In addition, de-racialization and de-medicalization of the contemporary epidemiological models of infectious diseases entail an in-depth exploration of how the categories of ethnicity, culture, and immigration status are played out in everyday health-related experiences of racialized groups.","Reitmanova, Sylvia; Gustafson, Diana L",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2011.645156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22181967/,31

Our hypothesis was that the subphrenic location of HCC could have an effect on the long-term therapeutic outcomes after hepatic resection and RF ablation. AIM To compare the long-term therapeutic outcomes of hepatic resection and percutaneous RF ablation for HCCs abutting the diaphragm. METHODS A total of 143 Child-Pugh class A patients who had undergone hepatic resection (n = 80) or percutaneous ultrasound-guided RF ablation (n = 63) for an HCC (≤ 3 cm) abutting the right diaphragm were included. Cumulative local tumor progression (LTP), cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated. Prognostic factors for DFS and OS were analyzed. Complications were evaluated. RESULTS The cumulative IDR rate, DFS rate, and OS rate for the hepatic resection group and RF ablation group at 5 years were ""35.9% vs 65.8%"", ""64.1% vs 18.3%"", and ""88.4% vs 68.7%"", respectively. Hepatic resection was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (P ≤ 0.001; hazard ratio, 0.352; 95%CI: 0.205, 0.605; with RF ablation as the reference category); however, treatment modality was not an independent prognostic factor for OS. The LTP rate was 46.6% at 5 years for the RF ablation group. The major complication rate was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.630). The rate of occurrence of peritoneal seeding was higher in the RF ablation group (1.3% vs 9.5%, P = 0.044). CONCLUSION Although OS was not significantly different between patients who had gone hepatic resection or percutaneous RF ablation for HCCs abutting the diaphragm, DFS was better in the hepatic resection group.","Song, Kyoung Doo; Lim, Hyo Keun; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Min Woo; Kang, Tae Wook; Paik, Yong Han; Kim, Jong Man; Joh, Jae-Won",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v11.i3.227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918595/,31

Multiple techniques are used in clinical practice without agreement regarding the optimal approach. We evaluated a novel device, the Cric-Guide (CG), a channelled bougie introducer that enters the airway in a single action and compared it with a scalpel-bougie-tube (SBT) technique in laboratory benchtop model. METHODS Seven anaesthesiologists attempted eFONA on both obese and non-obese models using both techniques in randomized order on an excised porcine trachea with an intact larynx with variable subcutaneous tissue depth. The primary outcome was successful tracheal cannulation. Secondary outcomes included false passage rate, time and tissue injury. RESULTS Anaesthesiologists performed 4 cricothyroidotomies on each model with each device. The CG was more successful in airway cannulation (47/56 [89.4%] vs. 33/56 [58.9%], P = 0.007). This difference was observed in the obese model only. The CG was associated with fewer false passages than the standard technique in the obese model (8/56 [14.3%] vs. 23/56 [41.1%], P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in time to completion or injury patterns between the techniques in the obese model, but the SBT was faster in the non-obese model. There was no difference in the proportion of specimens injured. CONCLUSION The Cric-Guide device was more successful than the standard SBT technique in airway cannulation in an obese neck model and with equivalent frequency and distribution of injury but performed equivalently in the non-obese model.","Chauhan, Sunil K; Monaghan, Myles; McCaul, Conan L",Irish journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02530-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656661/,31

109803,A Novel Coronavirus Emerging in China - Key Questions for Impact Assessment.,2020-01-24,"Dysregulation of wingless-type (Wnt) signaling has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Wnt8B, one of canonical Wnt ligands, has been implicated in oncogenesis. However, the role of Wnt8B in human HCCs and its transcriptional regulation mechanism remain unknown presently. Here we report that Wnt8B expression was frequently increased in HCCs, and was significantly associated with poorer patient prognosis. Wnt8B knockdown suppresses HCC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, via inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Transcription factor ZNF191 can positively regulate Wnt8B mRNA and proteins expression, and promoter luciferase assay indicated that ZNF191 can increase transcription activity of 2Kbps WNT8B promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation- qPCR and Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed ZNF191 protein directly binds to WNT8B promoter and the binding sites are at nt-1491(ATTAATT) and nt-1178(ATTCATT). Moreover, Wnt8B contributes the effect of ZNF191 on cell proliferation, and Wnt8B expression correlates positively with ZNF191 in human HCCs. Our findings suggested that Wnt8B, directly transcriptionally regulated by ZNF191, plays a pivotal role in HCC proliferation via canonical Wnt pathway, and may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.","Liu, Yufeng; Di, Wu; Cheng, Hanghang; Chen, Lei; Zhang, Weidi; Zou, Liping; Gao, Qiongmei; Zhao, Zhonghua; Chen, Qi; Zeng, Wenjiao; Zhang, Zhigang; Jiang, Wei; Huang, Cheng; Liu, Guoyuan",Cancer science,https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197287/,31

111329,Receptor for activated C kinase 1 in rats with ischemia-reperfusion injury: intravenous versus inhalation anaesthetic agents.,2018,"Introduction: The use of negative pressure dressings for open abdominal therapy has made a great impact on strategies for open abdominal treatment. Observed intestinal damage and developement of fistula formation raises questions about safety of commonly used systems (AB-Thera). The most common used system uses foils for shielding intestines directly from negative pressure. As an alternative a system with open pore dressing in double layer film was introduced (Suprasorb CNP) and proved to safe in animal studies. We compared the effects of this two systems on patients requiring open abdominal treatment. Materials and methods: Patients with secondary peritonitis in at least two abdominal quadrants were included in this randomized study. Inclusion criteria were secondary peritonitis (ACS), abdominal compartment syndrome, and abdominal trauma combined with ACS and/or contaminated abdomen. Patients with active bleeding and pancreatitis were not included. We examined Mannheim peritonitis Index (MPI), bloodcount, PCT, amount of fluid collected, and morphological changes on the bowel. Data were collected on day 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Primary end point was fascial closure. Examination was terminated in case of death and damage to the abdominal organs. Groups were compared using Mann Whitney U-test and chi square test. Trend evaluation was evaluated using an one way repeated measure analysis of variance. P-values below 0.05 was considered significat. Results: Thirty four patients were included between August 2010 and September 2012. There were no significant difference between two groups in MPI, age, and gender. Mean duration of treatment, WBC, CRP, and abdominal closure rate were not significantly different between groups. Suprasorb CNP System collected twice more fluid than AB-Thera and decreased PCT on significantly faster rate than AB-Thera. Four patients died (11%) and four patients developed enteric fistula (11%). Closure rate was achieved in 27 out of 34 Patients (79.5%). Closure rate was not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: The use of both systems proved to be efficient and safe. The application of well-dosed, moderate negative pressure on contaminated areas of the abdomen seems to have a lot of potential and it is worth directing greater research potential in this direction.","Auer, Thomas; Sauseng, Siegfried; Delcev, Pavle; Kohek, Peter",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2020.596056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614699/,31

Neoplasia, inflammatory, demyelinating, and stroke are possible etiologies of this disorder. Case report We report an elderly female who presented with dysarthria. She was dysarthric with a hypernasal voice, no apraxia or aphasia was observed. Tongue movements were slow with limited amplitude. Her soft palate dropped bilaterally; gag reflex was present. Also, she reported swallowing difficulty and choking with her saliva. Bilateral vertical and horizontal gaze were intact to either voluntary or oculocephalic movements. A cranial CT scan was suggestive of artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hypersignal on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images and hyposignal on apparent diffusion coefficient in both thalami. CT angiography scan revealed an AOP originating from the left posterior cerebral artery. The swallowing study with a videofluoroscopic demonstrated oral and pharyngeal phases with severe dysfunction. Conclusion To the authors' knowledge, there are two cases of individuals with artery of Percheron infarction who developed PBP associated with other clinical syndromes. Still, isolated PBP following infarction of Percheron's artery was not reported. We hypothesized that the PBP may have occurred because of the existence of vascular territory variations in the perforating arteries that arise from the AOP.","Rissardo, Jamir Pitton; Caprara, Ana Fornari",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394294/,31
111922,Identification of PDE7B as a Potential Core Gene Involved in the Metastasis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,2020,"BACKGROUND To allow for accurate and timely diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) key stakeholders must be familiar with and be able to identify features of this disorder. No studies to date have investigated the awareness of DCD among key stakeholders in Australia. METHODS An online survey was complete by 494 Australian participants: primary caregivers (n=153), teachers (n=149), allied health professionals (n=165) and medical professionals (n=27). RESULTS DCD and related terms were among the least known childhood disorders. Approximately half of the sample were familiar with the term DCD but every stakeholder group were more familiar with the term dyspraxia. Allied health professionals demonstrated greater knowledge of the features of DCD, particularly motor features. Every stakeholder group showed poor recognition of the social and psychological effects of DCD. A relatively low percentage of allied health (53%) and medical (33%) professionals reported they had identified or diagnosed DCD and less than 20% of these felt that the DSM-5 contained adequate information to make a DCD diagnosis. Most teachers (82%) believed they should play a role in identifying early warning signs of this disorder and 80% believed there are children in the school system who were labelled as lazy or defiant when they have motor skills impairments. Primary caregivers were supportive of a diagnosis of DCD being provided; however, only 16% were confident that a physician would provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. CONCLUSION Key stakeholders play a unique and important role in the identification of children with DCD. Though most participants acknowledge the role that they play, all stakeholder groups demonstrated poor familiarity with the term DCD and low levels of knowledge about the features of this disorder. Improved familiarity and knowledge of the disorder is needed for access to appropriate services and improved long-term outcomes for this condition.","Hunt, Jacqui; Zwicker, Jill; Godecke, Erin; Raynor, Annette","Child: care, health and development",https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140459/,31

112719,Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy.,2019,"Background The Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG) is a comprehensive resource on immunization for health professionals and vaccine program decision-makers. It is developed based on the evidence-based recommendations of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). The NACI Vaccine Safety Working Group (VSWG) is comprised of NACI members, liaison members and external experts. The World Allergy Organization now recommends that antihistamines should not be used in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis. The update of the chapter was also used to provide further information and clarity to several tables in the chapter. Methods In updating the CIG anaphylaxis guidance, VSWG conducted an environmental scan, a review of relevant literature and consulted international and Canadian experts and professional societies. Results The use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride as adjunctive treatment in the management of anaphylaxis in a community setting is no longer recommended. Other notable changes made to the chapter include the following: 1) retitled: ""Anaphylaxis and other acute reactions following vaccination""; 2) inclusion of new tables: ""Key distinguishing features of anaphylaxis and vasovagal syncope"" and ""Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis""; and 3) updated tables: ""Anaphylaxis management kit: recommended items"" and ""Dosage of intramuscular EPINEPHrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) solution, by age or weight"". Conclusion The updated CIG chapter provides healthcare providers with further clarity in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis in community settings. The updated intramuscular epinephrine dosage table will aid in optimal epinephrine administration, while the revised guidance against the use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride will prevent its unnecessary stockpiling in preparation for potential mass vaccination clinics related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Dayneka, Natalie; Jensen, Christina; Hildebrand, Kyla",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v46i1112a04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447159/,31

The samples were incubated on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar with Chloramphenicol at 37°C for 48 h, to assess the counts of colony-forming units/milliliter (CFU/ml) of Candida in saliva, and further on chrome agar plates to identify the Candida spp. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA to compare mean CFU/ml of Candida among three groups before and after the intervention. Results A total of 86 patients were included in the final analysis and there was a statistically significant reduction in mean Candida spp. Counts (CFU/ml) after intervention in all the three groups (P = 0.000) and significant reductions identified in both probiotic and combination therapy groups. Apart from reduction in Candida albicans, significant decrease in Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis was observed after probiotics usage compared to other groups. Conclusions The present study suggests that probiotic bacteria were effective in reducing oral Candida spp which can be recommended alone or in combination with traditional antifungal agents for effective reduction in oral Candida in head- and neck-radiotherapy patients.","Doppalapudi, Radhika; Vundavalli, Sudhakar; Prabhat, M P",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_334_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719253/,31
114463,Genome Analysis and Genomic Comparison of the Novel Species Arthrobacter ipsi Reveal Its Potential Protective Role in Its Bark Beetle Host.,2020-09-08,"Although anticoagulants have been in use for over 80 years, heparin and vitamin K antagonists were the sole available options until recently. Although these agents revolutionized the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases, their use has been hampered by the necessity for coagulation monitoring and by bleeding complications resulting in part from their multiple sites of action. Owing to advances in basic science, animal models, and epidemiology, the arsenal of available anticoagulants has expanded in the last two decades. This evolution has yielded many novel compounds that target single coagulation enzymes. Initially, thrombin and factor Xa were targeted because of their critical roles in coagulation. However, attention has now shifted to compounds that target upstream reactions, particularly those catalyzed by factors XIIa and XIa, which are part of the contact system. This shift is predicated on epidemiological and experimental evidence suggesting that these factors are more important for thrombosis than for hemostasis. With the goal of developing a new class of anticoagulants associated with a lower risk of bleeding than currently available agents, dozens of drugs targeting the contact system are now in development. This paper focuses on the rationale, development, and testing of these new agents with a concentration on those that have reached or completed phase 2 evaluation for at least one indication.","Fredenburgh, James C; Weitz, Jeffrey I",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047462/,31

METHODS We identified 411 qualified women from a Chinese urban community, contributing a total of 2544 surveys. The presence of generalized headache was measured. Climacteric symptoms and other risk factors were evaluated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS The prevalence of headache complaints is associated with menopausal stages. Perimenopausal women have relatively high prevalence of headache symptoms, especially stage +1a women (59.0%) compared to late postmenopausal women (37.8%), although menopause stages were not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Women who had headache at baseline and depression were much more likely to have headache during menopause. According to the univariate and multivariate analyses in women without headache at baseline, starting menopausal status, insomnia, sweats, and depression were independently associated with newly developed headache. CONCLUSIONS Symptoms of generalized headache were less prevalent in late postmenopausal women.

In Cape Town, a movement of self-organising, neighbourhood-level community action networks (CANs) has contributed significantly to the community-based response to COVID-19 and the ensuing epidemiological and social challenges it has wrought. This article describes and explains the organising principles that inform this community response, with the view to reflect on the possibilities and limits of such movements as they interface with the state and its top-down ways of working, often producing contradictions and complexities. This presents an opportunity for recognising and understanding the power of informal networks and collective action in community health systems in times of unprecedented crisis, and brings into focus the importance of finding ways to engage with the state and its formal health system response that do not jeopardise this potential.","van Ryneveld, Manya; Whyle, Eleanor; Brady, Leanne",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892520/,31
115485,Assessing the severity of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Netrin-1 was a laminin-related protein involved in neurovascular protection, and we previously discovered that decreased serum netrin-1 was associated with poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. However, the relationship between serum netrin-1 level and the risk of ischemic stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between netrin-1 level and risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS A case-control study including 591 ischemic stroke patients and 591 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals was conducted, and serum netrin-1 concentrations were quantitatively determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for all participants. The serum netrin-1 levels were significantly lower in the ischemic stroke patients than those in matched controls (median, 496.4 vs 652.1 pg/mL; P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke associated with the highest quartile of netrin-1 was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01-0.65; Ptrend = 0.018) compared with the lowest quartile of netrin-1. Each 1-standard deviation increase of log-transformed netrin-1 was associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke (odds ratio: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.94; P = 0.032), and a dose-response relationship between serum netrin-1 and ischemic stroke was observed (Plinearity = 0.003). Incorporating netrin-1 to conventional risk factors improved the discriminatory power for ischemic stroke (net reclassification index = 98.0%, P < 0.001; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.28%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Serum netrin-1 was decreased in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy controls, suggesting that there was a potential role of netrin-1 in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.","Guo, Daoxia; Qiao, Ying; Li, Zaihan; Zhu, Zhengbao; Peng, Hao; Zhang, Qiu; Zhong, Chongke; Wang, Aili; Xu, Tan; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Yonghong; He, Jiang","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917498/,31

Because of the lockdown measures taken to limit the virus spread in Italy, in-person teaching and learning have been interrupted in all health care disciplines and readapted in virtual formulae. METHODS As academic ophthalmology departments, we had to maintain the educational needs of medical and orthoptic students, internships, surgical training of residents, as well as to cover the scientific update of health care personnel (HCPs), and the continuation of research and academic activities. To assure these needs we ideated an educational strategy and a team, which was then translated on a multichannel virtual platform created with Microsoft Teams. RESULTS In this platform there were 21 channels organized in a public view mode, open to all Team members, or in private view mode to separate non-permanent HCPs, internships, residents, and students' tasks, from permanent HCPs tasks. Virtual channels were dedicated to provide theoretical lessons, clinical cases, surgical video, internal meetings and webinar, to offer news from scientific societies, requests of appointments from biomedical companies, links with ophthalmological websites, to move forward research projects, to participate at institutional academic duties, and to obtain feedbacks from users. Residents continued their training on surgery using a surgical simulator, after consulting an agenda uploaded into the dedicated virtual channel. CONCLUSION These positive initial results should represent a boost to rapidly proceed with the development of even more versatile virtual learning solutions, given that the forecasts for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are not encouraging.","Gallenga, Carla Enrica; Agnifili, Luca; D'Aloisio, Rossella; Brescia, Lorenza; Toto, Lisa; Perri, Paolo",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211015576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977779/,31

In these cases, laser-assisted procedures represent a highly successful alternative and have a low procedural complication rate with major adverse events in less than 2% of cases. Unfortunately, most encountered complications are potentially fatal, which prompted us to develop a novel approach that adds additional safety measures by allowing for real-time intrathoracic visualization and intervention. METHODS Five consecutive patients classified as high-risk patients received concomitant laser sheet extraction and right-sided uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery for real-time intrathoracic visualization. RESULTS Complete extraction was achieved in all cases without observing major intraoperative events, and on-table extubation was feasible in all cases. No chest tube-associated or incision-related complications were encountered. CONCLUSIONS Concomitant laser sheet extraction and video-assisted thoracoscopy are feasible and may offer benefits in high-risk patients.

If so, smokers might be at a higher risk.",2020-04-01,"INTRODUCTION Numerous concerns regarding maintenance of blood inventory have been raised after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Coshic, Poonam; C S, Chippy; Arcot, Priyadarsini Jayachandran; Kumar, Karan",Vox sanguinis,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103772/,31

METHODS We examined the prevalence, clinical and angiographic characteristics, and procedural outcomes of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for balloon undilatable CTOs in a contemporary multicenter US registry. RESULTS Between 2012 and 2017 data on balloon undilatable lesions were available for 425 consecutive CTO PCIs in 415 patients in whom guidewire crossing was successful: 52 of 425 CTOs were balloon undilatable (12%). Mean patient age was 65 ± 10 years and most patients were men (84%). Patients with balloon undilatable CTOs were more likely to be diabetic (67 vs. 41%, P < 0.001) and have heart failure (44 vs. 28%, P = 0.027). Balloon undilatable CTOs were longer (40 mm [interquartile range, IQR 20-50] vs. 30 [IQR 15-40], P = 0.016), more likely to have moderate/severe calcification (87 vs. 54%, P < 0.001), and had higher J-CTO score (3.2 ± 1.1 vs. 2.5 ± 1.3, P < 0.001) and PROGRESS-CTO complications score (3.9 ± 1.7 vs. 3.1 ± 2.0, P < 0.005). They were associated with lower technical and procedural success (92 vs. 98%, P = 0.024; and 88 vs. 96%, P = 0.034, respectively) and higher risk for in-hospital major adverse events (8 vs. 2%, P = 0.008) due to higher perforation rates. The most frequent treatments for balloon undilatable CTOs were high pressure balloon inflations (64%), rotational atherectomy (31%), laser (21%), and cutting balloons (15%).

However, excessive intake may lead to adverse effects in the body. Since F is absorbed mostly from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), gastrointestinal symptoms are the first signs following acute F exposure. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanistic events that lead to these symptoms. Therefore, the present study evaluated changes in the proteomic profile as well as morphological changes in the jejunum and ileum of rats upon acute exposure to F. Male rats received, by gastric gavage, a single dose of F containing 0 (control) or 25 mg/Kg for 30 days. Upon exposure to F, there was a decrease in the thickness of the tunic muscularis for both segments and a decrease in the thickness of the wall only for the ileum. In addition, a decrease in the density of HuC/D-IR neurons and nNOS-IR neurons was found for the jejunum, but for the ileum only nNOS-IR neurons were decreased upon F exposure. Moreover, SP-IR varicosities were increased in both segments, while VIP-IR varicosities were increased in the jejunum and decreased in the ileum. As for the proteomic analysis, the proteins with altered expression were mostly negatively regulated and associated mainly with protein synthesis and energy metabolism. Proteomics also revealed alterations in proteins involved in oxidative/antioxidant defense, apoptosis and as well as in cytoskeletal proteins. Our results, when analyzed together, suggest that the gastrointestinal symptoms found in cases of acute F exposure might be related to the morphological alterations in the gut (decrease in the thickness of the tunica muscularis) that, at the molecular level, can be explained by alterations in the gut vipergic innervation and in proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton.","Dionizio, Aline; Melo, Carina Guimarães Souza; Sabino-Arias, Isabela Tomazini; Araujo, Tamara Teodoro; Ventura, Talita Mendes Oliveira; Leite, Aline Lima; Souza, Sara Raquel Garcia; Santos, Erika Xavier; Heubel, Alessandro Domingues; Souza, Juliana Gadelha; Perles, Juliana Vanessa Colombo Martins; Zanoni, Jacqueline Nelisis; Buzalaf, Marília Afonso Rabelo",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886984/,31
118804,Novel treatments for alcoholic hepatitis.,2021-05-01,"RNA nanotechnology is the bottom-up self-assembly of nanometer-scale architectures, resembling LEGOs, composed mainly of RNA. The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities. It was predicted in 2014 that RNA would be the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development. The recent approval of several RNA drugs and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by FDA suggests that this milestone is being realized. Here, we review the unique properties of RNA nanotechnology, summarize its recent advancements, describe its distinct attributes inside or outside the body and discuss potential applications in nanotechnology, medicine, and material science.","Binzel, Daniel W; Li, Xin; Burns, Nicolas; Khan, Eshan; Lee, Wen-Jui; Chen, Li-Ching; Ellipilli, Satheesh; Miles, Wayne; Ho, Yuan Soon; Guo, Peixuan",Chemical reviews,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038115/,31

Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) can be prolonged and clinically challenging to treat. Olfactory training (OT) has demonstrated potential benefit for patients with nonspecific olfactory dysfunction. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of OT specifically for PVOD by pooled analysis of the existing evidence. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried and abstracts screened independently by 2 investigators. We included studies evaluating the efficacy of OT for PVOD and excluded studies evaluating pharmacologic interventions or olfactory loss from other causes. RESULTS Of the initial 1981 abstracts reviewed, 16 full-text articles were included. Sniffin' Sticks olfactory testing results were reported in 15 (93%) studies as threshold (T), discrimination (D), and identification (I) subscores and TDI total scores. All studies reported clinically significant results after OT, defined as a score improvement of TDI >5.5. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis, in which pooled estimates revealed that patients with PVOD who received OT had a 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.58) higher odds of achieving a clinically important difference in TDI scores compared to controls. CONCLUSION Meta-analysis of existing data demonstrates clinically significant improvements in PVOD associated with OT. Variability exists among OT protocols and may benefit from further optimization. Existing data supports the use of OT for the treatment of existing and newly emerging cases of PVOD.","Kattar, Nrusheel; Do, Triet M; Unis, Graham D; Migneron, Matthew R; Thomas, Andrew J; McCoul, Edward D",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820943550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32660334/,31

Despite evidence that on-demand automotive fleets are ripe for electrification, adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in fleet applications has been hindered by lack of charging infrastructure and long charging times. Recent research on electrification programs in Chinese megacities suggests that top-down policy targets can spur investment in charging infrastructure, while intelligent charging coordination can greatly reduce requirements for battery range and infrastructure, as well as revenue losses due to time spent charging. Such capability may require labor policy reform to allow fleet operators to manage their drivers' charging behavior, along with collection and integration of several key datasets including: 1) vehicle trajectories and energy consumption, 2) charging infrastructure installation costs, and 3) real-time charging station availability. In turn, digitization enabled by fleet electrification holds the potential to enable a host of smart urban mobility strategies, including integration of public transit with innovative transportation systems and emission-based pricing policies.","Bauer, Gordon; Zheng, Cheng; Greenblatt, Jeffery Buyers; Shaheen, Susan; Kammen, Daniel",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c01609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401027/,31

Provincial governments will likely not only reopen elective surgical capacity when it is deemed safe, but also target new funding to address the backlog of cases. There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces' approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients' needs perspective or if they are associated with patients' perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won't be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals' marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed. Surgeon input, collaboration and leadership during the strategy development, implementation and management of surgical wait lists postpandemic will be imperative, as these decisions will significantly affect the health and lives of many Canadians.","Wiseman, Sam M; Crump, R Trafford; Sutherland, Jason M",Canadian journal of surgery.

The Cd tolerance of LmHC was greater than that of LmLC at various Cd concentrations. The uptake of Evans blue dye revealed that Cd-induced root cell mortality was higher in LmLC than in LmHC after a 12-h Cd treatment. Furthermore, the content and influx rate of Cd in LmLC roots were greater than in LmHC roots under Cd stress conditions. The RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that the Cd transport regulatory genes (ABCG37, ABCB4, NRAMP4, and HMA5) were differentially expressed between the LmLC and LmHC roots. This expression-level diversity may contribute to the differences in the Cd accumulation and translocation between LmLC and LmHC. These findings may help clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying ryegrass responses to Cd toxicity. Additionally, ryegrass may be able to hyperaccumulate toxic heavy metals during the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.","Wang, Jingang; Zhao, Junchao; Feng, Shuang; Zhang, Jinzhu; Gong, Shufang; Qiao, Kun; Zhou, Aimin",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888621/,31

121766,"In vivo bone regeneration on titanium devices using serum-free grown adipose-derived stem cells, in a sheep femur model.",2017,"OBJECTIVES The aim was to determine whether physician modified stent grafts (PMSGs) are safe and effective for the treatment of high risk patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). DESIGN This was a retrospective single institution study. MATERIAL Consecutive patients with TAAA undergoing endovascular repair using a PMSG between January 2012 and June 2014 were evaluated. METHODS Fenestrations to preserve branch vessels were created in TX2 thoracic (Cook Medical) stent grafts. Pre- intra- and post-operative data were recorded by means of a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS Eleven high risk patients with TAAA (type I, n = 4; type III, n = 3; type IV, n = 3; type V, n = 1) underwent fenestrated endovascular repair using PMSGs. Indications were painful aneurysm (n = 5), >70 mm rapidly enlarging aneurysm (n = 4), saccular aneurysm (n = 1), and visceral patch false aneurysm after open repair of a type IV TAAA (n = 1). In four asymptomatic patients, an additional fenestration was created for temporary selective sac perfusion and occluded 2-4 weeks later. Median duration for stent graft modifications was 2 hours (range 1-3 hours). The median number of fenestrations was three (range 2-4). One patient died during the post-operative period from colonic ischemia, giving a 9% in hospital mortality rate. Four (36%) patients presented with moderate to severe complications. One (9%) patient presented with a paraparesis that resolved completely after spinal fluid drainage. Among surviving patients, four required early endovascular re-intervention for type III endoleak (n = 2), type Ia endoleak (n = 1), or target vessel cannulation failure (n = 1). The median follow up time was 6 months (range 3-20 months). During follow up, no other complications occurred and all target vessels remained patent. One patient presented with a persistent type II endoleak. CONCLUSION PMSGs provided acceptable short-term results and may be a management option for the treatment of TAAA in selected high risk patients. Durability concerns need to be assessed in additional studies with long-term follow up.","Cochennec, F; Kobeiter, H; Gohel, M; Leopardi, M; Raux, M; Majewski, M; Desgranges, P; Allaire, E; Becquemin, J P",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2015.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26259766/,31
122509,Beyond malaria--causes of fever in outpatient Tanzanian children.,2014,"BACKGROUND The safety and immunogenicity of M-M-RII (measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccine live, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA)-the only combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine licensed for use in the United States-were previously reported in pre- and postlicensure clinical trials conducted from 1988 to 2009. M-M-RII continues to be evaluated as a comparator in clinical trials of other vaccines. Here, we review safety and efficacy data from more recent clinical trials of M-M-RII. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review of trials using M-M-RII published from 2010 to 2019. RESULTS In the 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria, a total of 12,032 subjects were vaccinated: 7667 persons received a first dose only, 2137 participated in 2-dose studies (128 received 1 dose and 2009 received both) and 2063 received a single dose of M-M-RII as their second dose. Dose number was not specified for 165 participants, ≥6 years old, in 2 studies in which a single dose of M-M-RII was administered. Similar to previous reports, M-M-RII was well tolerated and immunogenic when administered alone or concomitantly with other routinely recommended vaccinations. The most common adverse events included transient injection site pain and fever. Serious adverse events were extremely rare, with only 4 probable or potential vaccine-related events reported among the 12,032 participating subjects. CONCLUSIONS In trials published from 2010 to 2019, M-M-RII continued to be safe and immunogenic in all age groups studied. These data, along with the results of earlier trials, indicate that the performance of the vaccine has been consistent across more than 30 years of postlicensure studies.","Nyaku, Mawuli; Richardson, Elizabeth; Martinon-Torres, Federico; Kuter, Barbara J",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310506/,31
122896,Effect of sibutramine on cardiovascular outcomes in overweight and obese subjects.,2010,"PURPOSE This study aimed to determine the feasibility of the fetal ovine model for anesthesia-induced neuroapoptosis detection and effect of dexmedetomidine on neuroapoptosis. METHODS Brains of fetal lambs that underwent tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia were studied following anesthetic exposure. The brains of nine fetuses from six pregnant sheep were studied. Seven of these fetuses underwent surgery for tracheal balloon insertion at 118-120 days gestational age (GA) under 1.5-2.0% isoflurane for 2-3 h. Two weeks afterward, at balloon retrieval, a repeat anesthetic: 1.5-2% isoflurane for 6 h was administered. Five of these fetuses were also exposed to dexmedetomidine concurrently. Immunohistochemistry of fetal brains for apoptotic neurons using activated caspase-3 antibodies was compared to that of an unexposed control group at GA 109 and 122 days. RESULTS Neuroapoptosis was detected in the ovine fetus with GA- dependent variation observed in the hippocampus. Increased neuroapoptosis occurred in the isoflurane-only group. Fetuses with isoflurane-dexmedetomidine exposure exhibited decreased neuroapoptosis compared to isoflurane-only group. CONCLUSION The fetal ovine model is a suitable option for neuroapoptosis analysis. Isoflurane use appears to be associated with additional neuroapoptosis in ovine fetuses undergoing surgical stimulation. Possible amelioration of isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis by dexmedetomidine deserves further study. Further studies of the effect of gestational age, dose, duration of anesthesia and surgical stimulation on neuroapoptosis are needed.","Olutoye, Olutoyin A; Lazar, David A; Akinkuotu, Adesola C; Adesina, Adekunle; Olutoye, Oluyinka O",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-015-3751-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26164712/,31
123481,Ebola virus disease in West Africa--the first 9 months of the epidemic and forward projections.,2014,"There are bi-directional interactions between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain. This is likely underpinned by a substantial overlap between brain areas of the central autonomic network and areas involved in pain processing and modulation. To date, however, relatively little is known about the neuronal substrates of the ANS-pain association. Here, we acquired resting state fMRI scans in 21 healthy subjects at rest and during tonic noxious cold stimulation. As indicators of autonomic function, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) frequency measures were influenced by tonic noxious stimulation and how these variables related to participants' pain perception and to brain functional connectivity in regions known to play a role in both ANS regulation and pain perception, namely the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Our findings support a role of the cardiac ANS in brain connectivity during pain, linking functional connections of the dACC and PAG with measurements of low frequency (LF)-HRV. In particular, we identified a three-way relationship between the ANS, cortical brain networks known to underpin pain processing, and participants' subjectively reported pain experiences. LF-HRV both at rest and during pain correlated with functional connectivity between the seed regions and other cortical areas including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left anterior insula (AI), and the precuneus. Our findings link cardiovascular autonomic parameters to brain activity changes involved in the elaboration of nociceptive information, thus beginning to elucidate underlying brain mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relationship between autonomic and pain-related systems.","Hohenschurz-Schmidt, David Johannes; Calcagnini, Giovanni; Dipasquale, Ottavia; Jackson, Jade B; Medina, Sonia; O'Daly, Owen; O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan; de Lara Rubio, Alfonso; Williams, Steven C R; McMahon, Stephen B; Makovac, Elena; Howard, Matthew A",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041747/,31
123603,Intranasal administration of the chemotherapeutic perillyl alcohol results in selective delivery to the cerebrospinal fluid in rats.,2021-03-18,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate laryngopharyngeal sensation at specific subsites using a novel adaptation of a buckling force aesthesiometer for delivery of calibrated tactile stimuli. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional. METHODS Twenty-two healthy adults (12 men, 10 women) were tested for responses to tactile forces, using 30-mm 6-0, 5-0, and 4-0 nylon monofilaments to map sensation of the aryepiglottic (AE) fold, lateral pyriform sinus (PS), and medial PS bilaterally. The outcome measures were the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) and patient reported rating of perceptual strength. RESULTS Rates of triggered LAR response grew monotonically with increasing tactile force at a mean (SD) stimulus duration of 663 (164) msec across all three subsites. The AE fold and medial PS had similar profiles and were the most responsive, while the lateral PS was the least responsive. Low force (6-0) response rate was ≤14% for all subsites. High force (4-0) response rate was 91% for AE fold and medial PS, and 23% for lateral PS. The perceptual strength gradient was in the lateral to medial trajectory. CONCLUSION Normative data for LAR response rates to low, medium, and high stimulation forces will be useful to assess sensory dysfunction in a variety of laryngopharyngeal disorders, including aspiration, dysphagia, chronic cough, and spasmodic dysphonia. In turn, that information will guide the creation of innovative treatments. LAR response profiles to low and high force stimuli will inform the development of screening tools to diagnose laryngopharyngeal hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity conditions.

125550,An overview of proteomic methods for the study of 'cytokine storms'.,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular therapy (ET) is superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in selected patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions. However, it is unclear if this positive effect also applies to patients with extensive early ischaemic changes. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) on the CT angiography source images (SI) on outcome after ET or IVT. METHODS Using our prospectively obtained stroke database and the admission SI-ASPECTS divided into three groups (0-5, 6-7 and 8-10), primarily the rates of good outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at discharge] after either ET (n = 255) or IVT (n = 479) were compared. RESULTS A favorable SI-ASPECTS (8-10) was present in 501 patients, 132 patients had a moderately favorable SI-ASPECTS (6-7) and 101 patients had an unfavorable SI-ASPECTS (0-5). Irrespective of the treatment modality, no patient with an unfavorable SI-ASPECTS had a good outcome and 38% died during hospital stay. Whilst significantly more patients with a favorable SI-ASPECTS had a good outcome after ET than after IVT (51% vs. 35%, P < 0.01), there was only a non-significant trend towards a good outcome after ET than after IVT in patients with a moderately favorable ASPECTS (25% vs. 14%, P = 0.1). CONCLUSION Patients with extensive early ischaemic changes on CT scans (SI- ASPECTS ≤5) might not profit from ET. The impact of ET on outcome in patients with moderately favorable SI-ASPECTS should be addressed in further trials.","Wasser, K; Papanagiotou, P; Brunner, F; Hildebrandt, H; Winterhalter, M; Roth, C; Kastrup, A",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27414987/,31
125695,miR-129-5p ameliorates ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting HMGB1 in myocardium.,2020-09-01,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced and exacerbated stressors (e.g., job loss, poor mental health) for adults across the United States (US) since the first statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020. Limited research has evaluated if, and how, pandemic-related stressors are associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Objectives: This analysis aims to identify COVID-19-related stressors associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Methods: Data were collected on sociodemographics, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-related stressors (household composition, job status, essential worker, stay-at-home duration, and depression) using a web-based, self-report survey to US adults from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models were used to assess associations between COVID-19-related stressors and binge drinking and changes in alcohol consumption. Among 1,982 participants, 69% were female and 31% male. Results: Thirty-four percent of the sample reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. More binge drinkers increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic (60%) than non-binge drinkers (28%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, for every 1-week increase in time spent at home during the pandemic, there was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.08-1.35) greater odds of binge drinking. Additionally, binge drinkers with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression symptoms had greater odds of increased alcohol consumption compared to those reporting no depression (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.15-2.81). Conclusion: Specific COVID-19-related stressors are related to alcohol consumption. This highlights the ancillary and unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which could have long-lasting population health consequences.","Weerakoon, S M; Jetelina, K K; Knell, G",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2020.1832508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280423/,31

126710,The Evolving Challenge of Infections in Cirrhosis.,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND Scabies is an extremely fastidious infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It causes a persistent itch that can disrupt a person's mental health, sleep, and overall quality of life. In endemic areas, treatment by targeting symptomatic individuals and their contacts is often unsuccessful due to an asymptomatic period and high rates of re-infection. To overcome this, Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is often used to treat the whole community, irrespective of whether individuals presently have scabies. This review summarises the evidence for the effectiveness of MDA in treating scabies. METHODS An exhaustive literature review was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus. All peer-reviewed articles published in English January 1990 to March 2020 were eligible and only if the studies were primary and interventional. Furthermore, the intervention had to be a pharmacological MDA method involving human subjects. RESULTS TWELVE articles that qualified for inclusion were identified. MDA for scabies significantly reduced its prevalence in communities at follow up. Some of the drivers of success were communities with low levels of migration, an uptake of MDA of > 85%, the use of oral Ivermectin therapy, the treatment of children and pregnant women within the treated population, and repeated treatment for participants diagnosed with scabies at baseline. CONCLUSIONS The average absolute reduction in prevalence of scabies was 22.0% and the relative reduction average was 73.4%. These results suggest MDA is effective in treating scabies in the endemic community. Further evidence is needed surrounding MDA use in urban areas with increased levels of migration. Importantly, MDA should not substitute the tackling of socioeconomic factors which contribute to endemic disease such as good sanitation and hygiene.","Rinaldi, Giulia; Porter, Kholoud","Tropical diseases, travel medicine and vaccines",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-021-00143-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193305/,31
126764,A review on pharmacological activities and synergistic effect of quercetin with small molecule agents.,2021-09-13,"A new photosensitive dual-anisotropic conductive Janus film (PDCJF) is proposed for the first time. It is rationally designed and manufactured by facile electrospinning. PDCJF is firstly constructed using 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone (DBF) with photoconductive and luminescent properties. Janus nanofibers are respectively used as the building units to construct the top layer (T-PDCJF) and the bottom layer (B-PDCJF) of PDCJF. The two layers are tightly bonded to form PDCJF. Under light irradiation, there is photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction in PDCJF, but there is no anisotropic conduction without light. Thus, the transition of PDCJF from mono-functional magnetism to tri-functionalities is realized under light and without light. The luminescence color of PDCJF is tunable and it emits white-light. This is made possible by modulating the amounts of luminescent substances and excitation wavelength. The microscopic Janus nanofibers used as building units and macroscopic Janus film structure ensure high photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction and excellent fluorescence in PDCJF. The two-dimensional (2D) PDCJF is rolled to obtain three-dimensional (3D) Janus-type tubes and 2D plus 3D complete flag-like structures with exceptional multi-functionalities. The new findings can strongly guide in developing advanced multi-functional nanostructures.","Tang, Xuehua; Qi, Haina; Yang, Liu; Xie, Yunrui; Ma, Qianli; Yu, Wensheng; Dong, Xiangting; Li, Dan; Liu, Guixia; Wang, Jinxian",Journal of colloid and interface science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.05.141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118776/,31

127867,A review of antibody-based therapeutics targeting G protein-coupled receptors: an update.,2020-04-08,"PURPOSE The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 illness has had a major impact on all levels of society internationally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on prison staff and prisoners in England and Wales is unknown. Testing for COVID-19 both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as for antibodies, to date, has been minimal. The purpose of this paper is to explore the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisons poses philosophical and ethical questions around trust, efficacy and ethicacy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH This paper is both descriptive, providing an overview of the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisoners in England and Wales, and conceptual in that it discusses and argues the issues associated with large-scale testing. This paper provides a discussion, using comparative studies, of the issues associated with large-scale testing of prisoners across the prison estate in England and Wales (120 prisons). The issues identified in this paper are contextualised through the lens of COVID-19, but they are equally transferrable to epidemiological studies of any pandemic. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of information about its spread in prisons, at the time of writing this paper, there is a programme of asymptomatic testing of prisoners. However, there remains a paucity of data on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because of the progress with the ongoing testing programme. FINDINGS The authors argue that the widespread testing of prisoners requires careful consideration of the details regarding who is included in testing, how consent is gained and how tests are administered. This paper outlines and argues the importance of considering the complex nuance of power relationships within the prison system, among prisoner officers, medical staff and prisoners and the detrimental consequences. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The widespread testing of COVID-19 presents ethical and practical challenges. Careful planning is required when considering the ethics of who should be included in COVID-19 testing, how consent will be gained, who and how tests will be administered and very practical challenges around the recording and assigning of COVID-19 test kits inside the prison. The current system for the general population requires scanning of barcodes and registration using a mobile number; these facilities are not permitted inside a prison. ORIGINALITY/VALUE This paper looks at the issues associated with mass testing of prisoners for COVID-19. According to the authors' knowledge, there has not been any research that looks at the issues of testing either in the UK or internationally. The literature available details countries' responses to the pandemic rather and scientific papers on the development of vaccines. Therefore, this paper is an original review of some of the practicalities that need to be addressed to ensure that testing can be as successful as possible.","Lambert, Steve; Wilkinson, Dean",International journal of prisoner health,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijph-10-2020-0084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683835/,31

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this catheter in comparison to that of previous Penumbra catheters in patients with acute ischemic stroke related to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. METHODS Data of all eligible patients who received endovascular treatment (EVT) for ICA occlusion using Penumbra aspiration catheters between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. After dividing into two groups according to use of penumbra ACE68, baseline characteristics of patients, successful recanalization rate, puncture to recanalization time, and switch to stent base technique rate were assessed. Successful recanalization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score ≥2b and favorable functional outcome was defined according to modified Rankin scale (score, 0-2). RESULTS ACE68 reperfusion catheter was used in 29 of 75 eligible patients (39%). The puncture to recanalization time was significantly shorter (26±18.2 minutes vs. 40±24.9 minutes, p=0.011) and the rate of switch to stent-based retrieval was significantly lower (3% vs. 20%, p=0.046) in ACE68 catheter group. Moreover, although not statistically significant, the successful recanalization rate was higher (83% vs. 76%, p=0.492) in ACE68 catheter group. Favorable functional outcome was observed in 48% of patients treated with ACE68 reperfusion catheter and in 30% of patients treated using other Penumbra systems (p=0.120). Baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores ≥8 (odds ratio [OR], 9.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-54.99; p=0.010) and successful recanalization (OR, 10.20; 95% CI, 1.13-92.46; p=0.039) were independent predictors of favorable outcome. CONCLUSION EVT using ACE68 reperfusion catheter can be considered a first-line therapy in patients with acute ICA occlusion as it can achieve rapid recanalization and reduce the frequency of conversion to stent-retrieve therapy.","Jang, Hyoung-Gyu; Park, Jung-Soo; Lee, Jong-Myong; Kwak, Hyo-Sung",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2019.0108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484230/,31

METHODS A 42-year-old man with low rectal cancer required APR that was performed in a lithotomy position with transabdominal division of the levators. After the perineal phase, the robot was redocked and a bilayered composite mesh was sutured to the pelvic inlet using robotic needle drivers. RESULTS The specimen had a cylindrical shape, and there was no surgical waist or perforation. Histology revealed a ypT2N0 tumor without circumferential margin involvement. CONCLUSIONS The robotic interface can aid in APR by accurately transecting the levators from the top. Additionally, it allows suturing of mesh around the pelvic inlet to prevent perineal hernias.

129254,The threat of a support surface translation affects anticipatory postural control.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) is a variation in which trocar scars are hidden in the umbilicus. We sought to determine whether SILS cholecystectomy is a safe alternative to a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our series of 205 SIL cholecystectomies (SILC) performed between May 2008-June 2010. The first 50 cases were done by initially insufflating the abdomen with a veress needle through the umbilicus and then placing 3, 5 mm ports in the umbilicus. The remaining cases were performed using a cut down approach at the umbilicus, followed by placement of a three-trocar SILS port under direct vision. RESULTS Two hundred and five patients (M:F = 48:157) underwent SILC during the study period. Median age was 45 (range = 21-62). Mean BMI range was 35 (range = 21-44). Mean operative time was 60 min (range = 40-120 min) and a follow up period that ranges from 1 to 21 months. Patient pathologies included: Chronic cholecystitis (74%), Acute cholecystitis (17%), Choledocholithiasis (6.8%), Gallstone pancreatitis (2%) and gallbladder polyp (0.5%). An additional port was placed in the umbilicus in 3% of cases. No cases were converted to open. Complications occurred in 4% of cases including: 3 patients with retained stones, 2 patients with post-op wound infection, 2 patients with incisional hernias in the umbilical region and 1patient with a veress injury. CONCLUSION SIL cholecystectomy can be done safely. It offers a better cosmetic result, which may lead to greater patient satisfaction.","Vemulapalli, Pratibha; Agaba, Emmanuel Atta; Camacho, Diego",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2011.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21515426/,31
129255,The Death Throes of Mercy - Our Shared Responsibility When Hospitals Close.,2020-05-27,"Inferior olive (IO), a nucleus in the ventral medulla, is the only source of climbing fibers that form one of the two input pathways entering the cerebellum. IO has long been proposed to be crucial for motor control and its activity is currently considered to be at the center of many hypotheses of both motor and cognitive functions of the cerebellum. While its physiology and function have been relatively well studied on single-cell level in vitro, presently there are no reports on the organization of the IO network activity in living animals. This is largely due to the extremely challenging anatomical location of the IO, making it difficult to subject to conventional fluorescent imaging methods, where an optic path must be created through the entire brain located dorsally to the region of interest. Here we describe an alternative method for obtaining state-of-the-art -level calcium imaging data from the IO network. The method takes advantage of the extreme ventral location of the IO and involves a surgical procedure for inserting a gradient-refractive index (GRIN) lens through the neck viscera to come into contact with the ventral surface of the calcium sensor GCaMP6s-expressing IO in anesthetized mice. A representative calcium imaging recording is shown to demonstrate the feasibility to record IO neuron activity after the surgery. While this is a non-survival surgery and the recordings must be conducted under anesthesia, it avoids damage to life-critical brainstem nuclei and allows conducting large variety of experiments investigating spatiotemporal activity patterns and input integration in the IO. This procedure with modifications could be used for recordings in other, adjacent regions of the ventral brainstem.","Guo, Da; Gürkan Özer, Ayşen; Uusisaari, Marylka Yoe",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180883/,31

130072,Progress on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against HIV type 1 (HIV-1).,2009,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases of swine. PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection in the pig is characterized by a weak or absent host innate immune response. The underlying mechanisms of PRRSV pathogenesis are still unclear. The analysis of transcript levels represents an alternative to immunoassays for the detection of cytokines that sometimes are difficult to detect due to their low amounts. This study sets out to determine the differences in pathogenesis and the immune response between lung, tonsil, tracheobronchial lymph node (Tb-LN) and retropharyngeal LN (Rf-LN) of PRRSV 2982 strain infected pigs. PRRSV strain 2982 avoided the onset of an effective innate immune response, especially in PRRSV main target (lung) and reservoir (tonsil) organs. PRRSV lead to an impaired expression of IFN-α and TNF-α gene expression, which finally induced a weak and delayed adaptive immune response through an inefficient IL-12 and IFN-γ expression. Finally, PRRSV replication favored the expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in infected pigs.","García-Nicolás, Obdulio; Quereda, Juan José; Gómez-Laguna, Jaime; Salguero, Francisco Javier; Carrasco, Librado; Ramis, Guillermo; Pallarés, Francisco José",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726859/,31
130377,Thyroid hormone receptor α mutations cause heart defects in zebrafish.,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Lesion volume on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) before acute stroke therapy is a predictor of outcome. Therefore, patients with large volumes are often excluded from therapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of endovascular treatment in patients with large DWI lesion volumes (>70 mL). METHODS Three hundred seventy-two patients with middle cerebral or internal carotid artery occlusions examined with magnetic resonance imaging before treatment since 2004 were included. Baseline data and 3 months outcome were recorded prospectively. DWI lesion volumes were measured semiautomatically. RESULTS One hundred five patients had lesions >70 mL. Overall, the volume of DWI lesions was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome, survival, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P<0.001 each). In patients with DWI lesions >70 mL, 11 of 31 (35.5%) reached favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score, 0-2) after thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3 reperfusion in contrast to 3 of 35 (8.6%) after thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 0-2a reperfusion (P=0.014). Reperfusion success, patient age, and DWI lesion volume were independent predictors of outcome in patients with DWI lesions >70 mL. Thirteen of 66 (19.7%) patients with lesions >70 mL had symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage with a trend for reduced risk with avoidance of thrombolytic agents. CONCLUSIONS There was a growing risk for poor outcome and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage with increasing pretreatment DWI lesion volumes. Nevertheless, favorable outcome was achieved in every third patient with DWI lesions >70 mL after successful endovascular reperfusion, whereas after poor or failed reperfusion, outcome was favorable in only every 12th patient. Therefore, endovascular treatment might be considered in patients with large DWI lesions, especially in younger patients.","Gilgen, Marc D; Klimek, Dariusz; Liesirova, Kai T; Meisterernst, Julia; Klinger-Gratz, Pascal P; Schroth, Gerhard; Mordasini, Pasquale; Hsieh, Kety; Slotboom, Johannes; Heldner, Mirjam R; Broeg-Morvay, Anne; Mono, Marie-Luise; Fischer, Urs; Mattle, Heinrich P; Arnold, Marcel; Gralla, Jan; El-Koussy, Marwan; Jung, Simon",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.010250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251252/,31

131151,Interference of angiotensin II and enalapril with hepatic blood flow regulation.,2014,"The CB2 R agonist AM1710, examined in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, is effective in controlling aberrant light touch sensitivity, referred to as mechanical allodynia. However, nonspecific binding of AM1710 to CB1 R, either peripherally or centrally, could be partially responsible for the analgesic effects of AM1710. Thus, we sought to determine in mice whether spinal (intrathecal; i.t.) or peripheral AM1710 administration could lead to anti-allodynia by reducing the protein expression of spinal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) proinflammatory cytokines and elevating the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the absence of CB1 R. Macrophage cell cultures were examined to characterize AM1710-mediated suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Either i.p. or i.t. AM1710 reversed CCI-induced mechanical allodynia to sham levels in CB1 R (-/-), (+/-), (+/+) mice. CCI-induced neuropathy decreased IL-10 immunoreactivity (IR) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, with i.t. AM1710 restoring basal IL-10 IR. CCI-induced elevations in proinflammatory cytokine IR were decreased within the spinal cord only after i.t. AM1710 in all mouse genotypes. Meanwhile, within DRG tissue from neuropathic mice, proinflammatory cytokines were decreased following either i.p. or i.t. AM1710. Analysis of cultured supernatants revealed AM1710 decreased TNF-alpha protein. We conclude that CB1 R is dispensable for either peripheral or central anti-allodynic actions of AM1710 in neuropathic mice. Cannabinoid CB2 R agonists produce heightened spinal IL-10 which may be clinically relevant to successfully treat neuropathic pain.","Wilkerson, Jenny L; Alberti, Lauren B; Kerwin, Audra A; Ledent, Catherine A; Thakur, Ganesh A; Makriyannis, Alexandros; Milligan, Erin D",Brain and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977358/,31
131794,4D flow MRI applications for aortic disease.,2015,"BACKGROUND Granular cell tumors (GCT) in the gastrointestinal tract are rare. Herein, we describe a case of a gastric GCT diagnosed preoperatively by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) and successfully resected by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old Japanese woman had a tumor located in the angle of the stomach that was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT), which was finally diagnosed as a gastric GCT using EUS-FNAB. The tumor was not identified by CT 1 year and 4 months before diagnosis; therefore, because there was a possibility that the tumor was malignant, we performed surgical wedge resection using SILS. The patient had an uneventful recovery postoperatively and was discharged without complications 3 days after surgery. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a benign GCT that remained within the muscular layer. No recurrence or complications have occurred in the first 16 months since the surgery. CONCLUSION Because gastric GCTs are generally benign and are rarely associated with lymph node metastasis, SILS seems to be a safe and feasible surgical approach for treating GCTs.","Yasuda, Atsushi; Yasuda, Takushi; Imamoto, Haruhiko; Hiraki, Yoko; Momose, Kohta; Kato, Hiroaki; Iwama, Mitsuru; Shiraishi, Osamu; Shinkai, Masayuki; Imano, Motohiro; Kimura, Yutaka",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00809-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32107653/,31

In this essay, a patient recovering from COVID-19 analyzes how histories of epidemics often follow the logic proposed by the discipline of epidemiology itself: a focus on acute cases and on a tracking of the ""peak(s)"" often means that longer temporalities of suffering are hidden. In contrast, this essay follows ""Long Covid""-an illness collectively made and named by patients, which changed how the natural history of a new disease (COVID-19) was being mapped out by conventional scientific experts. Long Covid conceptualizes time differently from common categories and prefixes used in medicine and epidemiology, such as the ""chronic"" or the ""post-."" The collective labor of ill people thinking from the sickbed-both those with Long Covid and those working to bring to visibility other illnesses and the sequelae of other epidemics-has allowed other possible arrangements of sick bodies, symptoms, and diagnostic classifications to come into view.

133033,Long-term effects of antimicrobial drugs on the composition of the human gut microbiota.,2020-11-09,"INTRODUCTION It has been reported in the literature that upper gastrointestinal malignancies after bariatric surgery are mostly gastro-esophageal, although it is not clear whether bariatric surgery represents a risk factor for the development of esophageal and/or gastric cancer. We report a case of a de novo gastric adenocarcinoma occurring in a transplant patient 1 year after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 44 year-old woman with a BMI of 38kg/m(2), hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple malignancies and a pancreas transplant underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The patient presented with intense dysphagias during the follow up. Studies were performed and the diagnoses of grade 2/3 adenocarcinoma were made. The patient underwent a robotic assisted total gastrectomy with a roux-en-y intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy. The procedure resulted in multiple metastasic lymph nodes, focal and transmural invasions to multiple organs with a tumor free margin resection. The patient presented with a postoperative pleural effusion, with no further complications. DISCUSSION The diagnosis of gastroesophageal cancer after bariatric surgery is usually late since these patients have common upper gastrointestinal symptoms related to the procedure that could delay the diagnosis. De novo gastric cancer after sleeve gastrectomy has only been reported in one instance, in contrast with other bariatric surgery procedures. CONCLUSIONS No direct relation has been established between sleeve gastrectomy and the development of gastric cancer. Robotic procedures allow for complex multiorgan resections, while preserving the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.","Masrur, M; Elli, E; Gonzalez-Ciccarelli, L F; Giulianotti, P C",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.12.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774417/,31

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study retrospectively reviews 1132 patients who underwent 4 different laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomies: hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALDN), pure laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (PLDN), laparoendoscopic single-site plus 1-port donor nephrectomy (LESSOP-DN), and mini laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (MLDN). RESULTS The mean estimated blood loss (EBL) for the HALDN group was meaningfully higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (57.5±52.2 mL versus 21.0±30.0 mL versus 18.2±28.7 mL) (P<0.001). The EBL for PLDN (53.3±35.3 mL) was also significantly higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (P<0.001). Length of stay (LOS) for HALDN was longer than that for LESSOP-DN (4.2±1.2 day versus 4.0±1.4 days, P=0.002). There was 1 intraoperative open conversion in the HALDN group and 2 HALDN surgeries that required postoperative exploratory laparotomy. LESSOP-DN had 3 (0.8%) postoperative incisional hernias. For recipients, the results revealed no significant differences between all 4 groups in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the 1-year graft failure rate. CONCLUSIONS The LESSOP-DN group was associated with a shorter incision length than those of HALDN and PLDN and shorter LOS than that of HALDN.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with oxidative stress that can disturb NO-signaling. Here, we evaluated the influence of CKD on AV fistula maturation and NO-signaling. METHODS CKD was established in rats by a 5/6th nephrectomy and after 6 weeks, an AV fistula was created between the carotid artery and jugular vein, which was followed up at 3 weeks with ultrasound and flow assessments. Vessel wall histology was assessed afterwards and vasoreactivity of carotid arteries was studied in a wire myograph. The soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activator BAY 60-2770 was administered daily to CKD animals for 3 weeks to enhance fistula maturation. RESULTS CKD animals showed lower flow rates, smaller fistula diameters and increased oxidative stress levels in the vessel wall. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was comparable but vasorelaxation after sodium nitroprusside was diminished in CKD vessels, indicating NO resistance of the NO-receptor sGC. This was confirmed by stimulation with BAY 60-2770 resulting in increased vasorelaxation in CKD vessels. Oral administration of BAY 60-2770 to CKD animals induced larger fistula diameters, however; flow was not significantly different from vehicle-treated CKD animals. CONCLUSIONS CKD induces oxidative stress resulting in NO resistance that can hamper AV fistula maturation. sGC activators like BAY 60-2770 could offer therapeutic potential to increase AV fistula maturation.","Geenen, Irma L; Kolk, Felix F; Molin, Daniel G; Wagenaar, Allard; Compeer, Mathijs G; Tordoir, Jan H; Schurink, Geert W; De Mey, Jo G; Post, Mark J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26727368/,31

We use 1H NMR to show the reversibility of (E)-to-(Z) and (Z)-to-(E) TMAB photoisomerization, and evaluate the thermal stability of (Z)-TMAB and the comparatively rapid acid-catalyzed thermal (Z)-to-(E) isomerization. Important for its potential use as a functional material, we show the photoisomerization cyclability of the polymeric TMAB chromophore and calculate isomerization quantum yields by extinction spectroscopy. To verify self-inclusion of the polymeric TMAB and cyclodextrin, we use two-dimensional 1H NOESY NMR data to show proximity of TMAB and cyclodextrin in the (E)-state only; however, (Z)-TMAB is not locally correlated with cyclodextrin. Finally, the observed decrease in photoisomerization quantum yield for the dual-functionalized polymer compared to the isolated chromophore in an aqueous solution confirms TMAB and β-cyclodextrin not only are in proximity to one another, but also form the inclusion complex.","Lee, Daniel C; Guye, Kathryn N; Paranji, Rajan K; Lachowski, Kacper; Pozzo, Lilo D; Ginger, David S; Pun, Suzie H",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369796/,31

135186,Rigor before speculation in COVID-19 therapy.,2020-05-01,"Pulmonary melioidosis is a bacterial disease with high morbidity and a mortality rate that can be as high as 40% in resource-poor regions of South Asia. This disease burden is linked to the pathogen's intrinsic antibiotic-resistance and protected intracellular localization in alveolar macrophages. Current treatment regimens require several antibiotics with multi-month oral and intravenous administrations that are difficult to implement in the developing world. Herein, we report that a macrophage-targeted polyciprofloxacin prodrug acts as a surprisingly effective pre-exposure prophylactic in highly lethal murine models of aerosolized human pulmonary melioidosis. A single dose of the polymeric prodrug maintained high lung drug levels and targeted an intracellular depot of ciprofloxacin to the alveolar macrophage compartment that was sustained over a period of 7 days above minimal inhibitory concentrations. This intracellular pharmacokinetic profile provided complete pre-exposure protection in a BSL-3 model with a drug-resistant, aerosolized clinical isolate of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Thailand. This total protection was achieved despite the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin and where an equivalent dose of pulmonary-administered ciprofloxacin was ineffective. For the first time, we demonstrate that targeting the intracellular macrophage compartment with extended antibiotic dosing can achieve pre-exposure prophylaxis in a model of pulmonary melioidosis. This fully synthetic and modular therapeutic platform could be an important therapeutic approach with new or re-purposed antibiotics for melioidosis prevention and treatment, especially as portable inhalation devices in high-risk, resource-poor settings.","Chavas, Thomas E J; Su, Fang-Yi; Srinivasan, Selvi; Roy, Debashish; Lee, Brian; Lovelace-Macon, Lara; Rerolle, Guilhem F; Limqueco, Elaine; Skerrett, Shawn J; Ratner, Daniel M; West, Timothy Eoin; Stayton, Patrick S",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.11.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33221351/,31

The role and safety of pediatric prehospital intubation is controversial, particularly after prior research has shown varying degrees of intubation success. We report a series of consecutive prehospital pediatric intubations performed by air-transport providers. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed intubation flight records from an 89-rotorcraft, multistate emergency flight service during the time period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009. All patients younger than 15 years were included in our analysis. We characterized patient, flight, and operator demographics; intubation methods; success rates; rescue techniques; and adverse events with descriptive statistics. We report proportions with 95% confidence intervals and differences between groups with Fisher exact and χ tests; P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Two hundred sixty pediatric intubations were performed consisting of 88 medical (33.8%) and 172 trauma (66.2%) cases; 98.8% (n = 257) underwent an orotracheal intubation attempt as the first method. First-pass intubation success was 78.6% (n = 202), and intubation was ultimately successful in 95.7% (n = 246) of cases. Medical and trauma intubations had similar success rates (98% vs 95%, Fisher exact test P = 0.3412). There was no difference in intubation success between age groups (χ = 0.26, P = 0.88). Three patients were managed primarily with an extraglottic device. Rescue techniques were used in 11 encounters (4.2%), all of which were successful. Cricothyrotomy was performed twice, both successful.

135405,Effects of ketoisocaproic acid and inflammation on glucose transport in muscle cells.,2021-01-01,"Introduction Although bronchiolitis is a common reason for infant hospitalization, significant heterogeneity persists in its management. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends that inhaled albuterol not be used in routine care of children with bronchiolitis. Our objective was to identify factors associated with pre-admission (e.g., emergency department or primary care) use of albuterol among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Methods We analyzed data from a 17-center observational study of 1,016 infants (age <1 year) hospitalized with bronchiolitis between 2011-2014. Pre-admission albuterol use was ascertained by chart review, and data were available for 1,008 (99%) infants. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify infant characteristics independently associated with pre-admission albuterol use. Results Half of the infants (n=508) received at least one albuterol treatment before admission. Across the 17 hospitals, pre-admission albuterol use ranged from 23-84%. In adjusted analysis, independent predictors of albuterol use were the following: age ≥2 months (age 2.0-5.9 months [odds ratio (OR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) {1.45-3.01}] and age 6.0-11.9 months [OR 2.89, 95% CI {1.99-4.19}]); prior use of a bronchodilator (OR 1.89, 95% CI [1.24-2.90]); and presence of wheezing documented in pre-admission chart (OR 3.94, 95% CI [2.61-5.93]). By contrast, albuterol use was less likely among those with ≥7 days since the start of breathing problem (OR 0.66, 95% CI [0.44-1.00]) and parent-reported fever (OR 0.75, 95% CI [0.58-0.96]). Conclusion Variation in pre-admission albuterol use suggests that local practice had a strong influence on use, but that patient characteristics also influenced the decision. While we agree with current guidelines in recommending against albuterol for all infants with bronchiolitis, our understanding of possible subgroups of responders may improve through investigation of infants with the identified characteristics.","Condella, Anna; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Hasegawa, Kohei; Dayan, Peter S; Sullivan, Ashley F; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",The western journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2018.3.35837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760843/,31
135545,Circ-KIAA0907 inhibits the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the miR-96-5p/UNC13C axis.,2021-03-14,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) remains an underused treatment for choledocholithiasis, likely in part because of a lack of exposure to the procedure during surgery residency. In this study, we implemented a resident LCBDE curriculum using a previously validated procedural simulator. METHODS Senior surgery residents underwent a curriculum consisting of deliberate practice using the LCBDE simulator. Residents performed a simulated transcystic and transcholedochal LCBDE before and after completing the curriculum, which were rated by three faculty. Passing scores were determined using an Angoff method. RESULTS Ten residents participated. For transcystic LCBDE, all 10 residents failed the pretest. Assessment scores improved after the curriculum (20 ± 4 vs 41 ± 2; scale 0-45, P < .01), and all 10 residents passed the posttest. For transcholedochal LCBDE, all 10 residents failed the pretest. Transcholedochal scores improved after the curriculum (27 ± 6 vs 46 ± 4; scale 0-53, P < .01). Eight residents passed the initial posttest and two failed because they sutured the t-tube into the choledochotomy closure. Both underwent remedial training and passed a retest. Resident confidence in performing LCBDE clinically improved for both transcystic and transcholedochal approaches. CONCLUSION This curriculum improved the ability of surgery residents to perform both transcystic and transcholedochal LCBDE on a procedural simulator.","Teitelbaum, Ezra N; Soper, Nathaniel J; Santos, Byron F; Rooney, Deborah M; Patel, Pratik; Nagle, Alexander P; Hungness, Eric S",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2014.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239339/,31

Methods: We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking. Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. Results: Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal. The median duration of illness were 23 days (P(25)-P(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (P(25)-P(75): 15-27 days). For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (P(25)-P(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days P(25)-P(75): 4-14 days). Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission. In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88). The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (aHR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.43-2.46), older age (aHR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (aHR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (aHR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (aHR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.06-2.09). Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes. The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk. In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources.","Zhang, Y T; Deng, A P; Hu, T; Chen, X G; Zhuang, Y L; Tan, X H; Zhen, H Z; Sun, L M; Li, Y; Zhong, H J; He, J F; Song, T; Kang, M",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200318-00378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340095/,31

METHOD The sample comprised 1,386 schoolteachers (mean [M]age = 43; Myears taught = 15; 77% women) from 18 different U.S. states. We assessed burnout, using the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure, and depression, using the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire. RESULTS Treated dimensionally, burnout and depressive symptoms were strongly correlated (.77; disattenuated correlation, .84). Burnout and depressive symptoms were similarly correlated with each of 3 stress-related factors, stressful life events, job adversity, and workplace support. In categorical analyses, 86% of the teachers identified as burned out met criteria for a provisional diagnosis of depression. Exploratory analyses revealed a link between burnout and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that past research has underestimated burnout-depression overlap. The state of burnout is likely to be a form of depression. Given the magnitude of burnout-depression overlap, treatments for depression may help workers identified as ""burned out.""","Schonfeld, Irvin Sam; Bianchi, Renzo",Journal of clinical psychology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.22229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26451877/,31

137326,Luteolin ameliorates experimental lung fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro: implications for therapy of lung fibrosis.,2010,"Recycling of plastic from household waste (HHW) is crucial in the transition towards a circular plastic economy. Plastic from HHW consists of numerous immiscible polymers, product types and product designs (e.g. colour, polymer separability), which often lead to considerable physical losses during sorting, and low-quality recycled plastic. Consequently, recycling initiatives have been proposed to enhance the quantity and quality of plastic recycling from HHW. To quantify the potential effects of such initiatives, a detailed composition of plastic waste is necessary. The aim was to provide such detailed composition of Danish source-separated rigid plastic waste, including information regarding the polymer of the main product component, product type, polymer design and separability as well as colour. The potential effects on recycled quantity and quality from implementing selected recycling initiatives were quantified and recommendations provided. PET, PE and PP made up >90% of the source-separated plastic and both food- and non-food packaging existed in all three polymers. In total, 10-11% of the plastic was black, and around 44% consisted of multiple polymers, of which one-third was non-separable. Initiatives improving product design for recycling will likely result in increased quantity of recycled plastic. By effectively separating food from non-food packaging, e.g. by introducing two bins in the households or politically aligning polymers and product types (all food packaging in PET and PP, all non-food packaging in PE), 39-63% of the waste could potentially be recycled in a closed loop into food-grade quality packaging. The overall highest benefits were reached by combining initiatives.","Eriksen, M K; Astrup, T F",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109515/,31

Removal of cytokines by CytoSorb haemoperfusion has been used more and more frequently and with encouraging success in recent years to treat septic shock. In the case of hypoxaemia, which can no longer be treated with conventional mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled epoprostenol and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) are considered.

In March 2013, three urban residents of Shanghai or Anhui, China, presented with rapidly progressing lower respiratory tract infections and were found to be infected with a novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus. METHODS We obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiologic, and virologic data from these patients. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by means of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays, viral culturing, and sequence analyses. RESULTS A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was isolated from respiratory specimens obtained from all three patients and was identified as H7N9. Sequencing analyses revealed that all the genes from these three viruses were of avian origin, with six internal genes from avian influenza A (H9N2) viruses. Substitution Q226L (H3 numbering) at the 210-loop in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was found in the A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus but not in the A/Shanghai/1/2013 virus. A T160A mutation was identified at the 150-loop in the HA gene of all three viruses. A deletion of five amino acids in the neuraminidase (NA) stalk region was found in all three viruses. All three patients presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. Two of the patients had a history of recent exposure to poultry. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. All three patients died. CONCLUSIONS Novel reassortant H7N9 viruses were associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in three patients.

This article examines the coping mechanisms adopted by fertility patients during this time, focussing on the emotional support received from online fertility forums and fertility clinics during the indeterminate wait for treatment to resume. The study draws upon an online survey which assessed the mental health and wellbeing of 124 female fertility patients whose ART treatment was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The findings indicate a potential for improved communication between fertility clinics and patients in order to reduce psychological stress and isolation during the postponement of ART treatment, alongside better utilisation of online platforms as mechanisms for support.

Altered muscle mass may aggravate PCOS complications. Our systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether PCOS alters muscle mass and function. Databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus) were searched through September 2, 2020, for studies documenting skeletal muscle mass (lean tissue mass) and function (strength) in PCOS and control groups. The primary outcome was total lean body mass (LBM) or fat-free mass (FFM). Data were pooled by random-effects models and expressed as mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Forty-five studies (n = 3676 participants) were eligible. Women with PCOS had increased total (0.83 [0.08,1.58] kg; p = 0.03; I2 = 72.0%) yet comparable trunk (0.84 [-0.37,2.05] kg; p = 0.15; I2 = 73.0%) LBM or FFM versus controls. Results of meta-regression analyses showed no associations between mean differences between groups in total testosterone or homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and total or trunk LBM or FFM (All: p ≥ 0.75). Mean differences in body mass index (BMI) were associated with total (0.65 [0.23,1.06] kg; p < 0.01; I2 = 56.9%) and trunk (0.56 [0.11,1.01] kg; p = 0.02; I2 = 42.8%) LBM or FFM. The PCOS subgroup with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 had greater total LBM or FFM versus controls (1.58 [0.82,2.34] kg; p < 0.01; I2 = 64.0%) unlike the PCOS subgroup with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (-0.45 [-1.94,1.05] kg; p = 0.53; I2 = 69.5%). Appendicular lean mass and muscle strength data were contradictory and described narratively, as meta-analyses were impossible. Women with PCOS have higher total and trunk lean tissue mass attributed to overweight/obesity, unlike hyperandrogenism or insulin resistance.","Kazemi, Maryam; Pierson, Roger A; Parry, Stephen A; Kaviani, Mojtaba; Chilibeck, Philip D",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855800/,31

However, certain issues can reduce implant efficacy including intracochlear tissue response and delayed loss of residual acoustic hearing. We describe a mouse model of cochlear implantation with chronic electric stimulation that can be used to study cochlear implant biology and related pathologies. METHODS Twelve normal hearing adult CBA/J mice underwent unilateral cochlear implantation and were evenly divided into one group receiving electric stimulation and one not. Serial impedance and neural response telemetry (NRT) measurements were made to assess implant functionality. Functionality was defined as having at least one electrode with an impedance ≤ 35 kOhms. Mouse cochleae were harvested for histology and 3D x-ray microscopy 21 days post-operatively, or, in case the implant was still functional, at a later time point when the implant failed. A separate experiment measured the hearing preservation rate in 7 adult CBA/J mice undergoing unilateral cochlear implantation with serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). RESULTS Implants maintained functionality for a mean of 35 days in the non-stimulated group and 19.8 days in the stimulated group. Reliable NRT and behavioral responses to electric stimulation were recorded. A robust intracochlear peri-implant tissue response with neo-ossification was seen in all cochleae. Six of seven mice maintained intact low frequency hearing up to 6 weeks following cochlear implantation. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the feasibility of cochlear implantation and behaviorally significant electric stimulation in the mouse, with the potential for hearing preservation. This model may be combined with established mouse models of hearing loss and the large genetic and molecular research toolkit unique to the mouse for mechanistic and therapeutic investigations of cochlear implant biology.","Claussen, Alexander D; Vielman Quevedo, René; Mostaert, Brian; Kirk, Jonathon R; Dueck, Wolfram F; Hansen, Marlan R",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998726/,31

140460,Lessons from Ebola: Improving infectious disease surveillance to inform outbreak management.,2015,"Ebolavirus (EBOV) entry into cells requires proteolytic disassembly of the viral glycoprotein, GP. This proteolytic processing, unusually extensive for an enveloped virus entry protein, is mediated by cysteine cathepsins, a family of endosomal/lysosomal proteases. Previous work has shown that cleavage of GP by cathepsin B (CatB) is specifically required to generate a critical entry intermediate. The functions of this intermediate are not well understood. We used a forward genetic strategy to investigate this CatB-dependent step. Specifically, we generated a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing EBOV GP as its sole entry glycoprotein and used it to select viral mutants resistant to a CatB inhibitor. We obtained mutations at six amino acid positions in GP that independently confer complete resistance. All of the mutations reside at or near the GP1-GP2 intersubunit interface in the membrane-proximal base of the prefusion GP trimer. This region forms a part of the ""clamp"" that holds the fusion subunit GP2 in its metastable prefusion conformation. Biochemical studies suggest that most of the mutations confer CatB independence not by altering specific cleavage sites in GP but rather by inducing conformational rearrangements in the prefusion GP trimer that dramatically enhance its susceptibility to proteolysis. The remaining mutants did not show the preceding behavior, indicating the existence of multiple mechanisms for acquiring CatB independence during entry. Altogether, our findings suggest that CatB cleavage is required to facilitate the triggering of viral membrane fusion by destabilizing the prefusion conformation of EBOV GP.","Wong, Anthony C; Sandesara, Rohini G; Mulherkar, Nirupama; Whelan, Sean P; Chandran, Kartik",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01832-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19846533/,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, multicenter study was conducted in six hospitals in the city of Lima during 1 year of epidemiological surveillance. RESULTS The cumulative hospital incidence was 1.4 cases per 1000 live births. A total of 53 cases of neonatal meningitis were included, 34% (18/53) were early and 66% (35/53) late. The associated maternal factors were meconium-stained amniotic fluid and urinary tract infection. Insufficient prenatal check-ups were found in 58.8% (30/51). The most associated neonatal factor was sepsis. The main symptoms were fever, irritability, hypoactivity and respiratory distress. Pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was significant, without predominance of polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMN), hypoglycorrhagia and proteinorrhagia. The most frequent pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS The hospital incidence of neonatal meningitis was 1.4 per 1000 live births, being ten times higher in preterm infants. Breathing difficulty was the most frequent symptom in the early stage, while fever and irritability in the late stage. CSF showed pleocytosis without predominance of PMN. The most frequent germs were Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Ventriculitis and hydrocephalus were the most common neurological complications.","Guillén-Pinto, Daniel; Málaga-Espinoza, Bárbara; Ye-Tay, Joselyn; Rospigliosi-López, María Luz; Montenegro-Rivera, Andrea; Rivas, María; Stiglich, María Luisa; Villasante-Valera, Sonia; Lizama-Olaya, Olga; Tori, Alfredo; Cuba, Lizet; Florián, Luis; Vilchez-Fernández, Leidi; Eguiluz-Loaiza, Oscar; Dávila-Aliaga, Carmen Rosa; Medina-Alva, Pilar",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.372.4772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876208/,31

Considering the cost-effectiveness of the imaging used, ultrasound is a non-ionizing, portable and bedside imaging modality with a high diagnostic impact in emergencies and intensive care units in pandemics, but it is operator dependent. In our article, we provide a comprehensive review of the role of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and its impact on the lungs, cardiovascular system, eyes and abdominal organs. Moreover, ultrasound can provide real-time diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, such as the placement of a central catheter and aspiration of pericardial effusion. Awareness of health care professionals in the front-line fighting COVID-19 infection in emergency rooms, clinics, and in intensive care units is important and will help rapid and targeted management decisions.","Galluccio, Felice; Ergonenc, Tolga; Yamak Altinpulluk, Ece; Perez Herrero, Maria; De la Torre Carpente, Maria Del Mar; Capassoni, Marco; Espinoza, Karla; Aragon Benedi, Cristian; Allam, Abdallah El-Sayed; Orzalesi, Vanni; Fajardo Perez, Mario",Medical ultrasonography,https://doi.org/10.11152/mu-2614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905568/,31

143757,Beyond Tuskegee - Vaccine Distrust and Everyday Racism.,2021-01-20,"An effective vaccine that can protect against HIV infection does not exist. A major reason why a vaccine is not available is the high mutability of the virus, which enables it to evolve mutations that can evade human immune responses. This challenge is exacerbated by the ability of the virus to evolve compensatory mutations that can partially restore the fitness cost of immune-evading mutations. Based on the fitness landscapes of HIV proteins that account for the effects of coupled mutations, we designed a single long peptide immunogen comprising parts of the HIV proteome wherein mutations are likely to be deleterious regardless of the sequence of the rest of the viral protein. This immunogen was then stably expressed in adenovirus vectors that are currently in clinical development. Macaques immunized with these vaccine constructs exhibited T-cell responses that were comparable in magnitude to animals immunized with adenovirus vectors with whole HIV protein inserts. Moreover, the T-cell responses in immunized macaques strongly targeted regions contained in our immunogen. These results suggest that further studies aimed toward using our vaccine construct for HIV prophylaxis and cure are warranted.","Murakowski, Dariusz K; Barton, John P; Peter, Lauren; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Bondzie, Esther; Gao, Ang; Barouch, Dan H; Chakraborty, Arup K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022496118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514660/,31

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the susceptibility vessel sign seen on MR imaging before treatment on the clinical outcome after mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively included 73 consecutive patients who were treated for anterior circulation acute stroke by mechanical thrombectomy from December 2009 to September 2013. Each patient underwent MR imaging before mechanical thrombectomy. The presence (susceptibility vessel sign+) or absence of the susceptibility vessel sign (susceptibility vessel sign-) was recorded. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed either alone or in association with IV tPA according to the site and time after occlusion. Good functional outcome was defined by an mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months in susceptibility vessel sign+ and susceptibility vessel sign- groups. Patient clinical characteristics, initial NIHSS score and ASPECTS, site of occlusion, time between onset to groin puncture, TICI after mechanical thrombectomy, NIHSS score at day 1, and spontaneous hyperattenuation on CT at day 1 were also analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with susceptibility vessel sign+ and 20 with susceptibility vessel sign- were included in our study. mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months occurred in 65% patients in the susceptibility vessel sign+ group and 26% in the susceptibility vessel sign- group (P = .004). On multivariate analysis, the susceptibility vessel sign was the only parameter before treatment that could predict mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months (OR, 8.7; 95% CI, 1.1-69.4; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Our study strongly suggests that the susceptibility vessel sign on MR imaging before treatment is predictive of favorable clinical outcome for patients presenting with anterior circulation acute stroke and treated with mechanical thrombectomy.","Bourcier, R; Volpi, S; Guyomarch, B; Daumas-Duport, B; Lintia-Gaultier, A; Papagiannaki, C; Serfaty, J M; Desal, H",AJNR.

143915,Microbial genomics and infectious diseases.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To characterize the etiology of upper respiratory symptoms in elite athletes presenting to a sports physician for treatment. DESIGN Prospective clinical and laboratory investigations. SETTING Sports medicine clinic. PARTICIPANTS Seventy elite-level athletes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Physician-recorded symptoms and diagnosis; health/training questionnaires; laboratory investigations of respiratory pathogens, white blood cell differential counts, and immune parameters. RESULTS Physicians characterized 89% of presentations as viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract infection. Only 57% of presentations were associated with an identified pathogen or other laboratory parameters indicative of infection. Demographic information, previous illness, and training history did not distinguish between presentations with or without objective measures of infection. Elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts and lower vitamin D concentrations partially distinguished infectious episodes. The number of systemic symptoms/behaviors at presentation (cough, headache, earache, fatigue, fever/rigors, myalgia/arthralgia, or cessation of training before clinic attendance) had some predictive value for infection: odds ratio per symptom, 1.23 (90% confidence interval: 0.91 to 1.66); probability of infection, 48% with no symptoms to 77% with 6 symptoms. Laboratory investigation identified allergy in a considerable proportion of the cohort (39%). CONCLUSIONS The discrepancy between physician and laboratory diagnosed infection in elite athletes highlights the need for consideration of alternate diagnostic options when evaluating upper respiratory symptoms in athletes. A considerable proportion of episodes of respiratory symptoms in athletes were not associated with identification of a respiratory pathogen; other potentially treatable causes of upper respiratory symptoms should be considered, particularly in athletes with recurrent symptoms.","Cox, Amanda J; Gleeson, Maree; Pyne, David B; Callister, Robin; Hopkins, Will G; Fricker, Peter A",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jsm.0b013e318181e501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18806552/,31
144075,A review on proteomics analysis to reveal biological pathways and predictive proteins in sulfur mustard exposed patients: roles of inflammation and oxidative stress.,2019,"BACKGROUND Perioperative diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has important resource implications as screening questionnaires are overly sensitive, and sleep studies are expensive and time-consuming. Ultrasound (US) is a portable, noninvasive tool potentially useful for airway evaluation and OSA screening in the perioperative period. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the correlation of surface US with OSA diagnosis and to determine whether a point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) for OSA screening may help with improved screening in perioperative period. METHODS A search of all electronic databases including Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted from database inception to September 2017. Inclusion criteria were observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials of known or suspected OSA patients undergoing surface US assessment. Article screening, data extraction, and summarization were conducted by 2 independent reviewers with ability to resolve conflict with supervising authors. Diagnostic properties and association between US parameters (index test) and OSA diagnosis using sleep study (reference standard) were evaluated. The US parameters were divided into airway and nonairway parameters. A random-effects meta-analysis was planned, wherever applicable. RESULTS Of the initial 3865 screened articles, 21 studies (7 airway and 14 nonairway) evaluating 3339 patients were included. Majority of studies were conducted in the general population (49%), respirology (23%), and sleep clinics (12%). No study evaluated the use of US for OSA in perioperative setting. Majority of included studies had low risk of bias for reference standard and flow and timing. Airway US parameters having moderate-good correlation with moderate-severe OSA were distance between lingual arteries (DLAs > 30 mm; sensitivity, 0.67; specificity, 0.59; 1 study/66 patients); mean resting tongue thickness (>60 mm; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 0.59; 1 study/66 patients); tongue base thickness during Muller maneuver (MM; sensitivity, 0.59; specificity, 0.78; 1 study/66 patients); and a combination of neck circumference and retropalatal (RP) diameter shortening during MM (sensitivity, 1.0; specificity, 0.65; 1 study/104 patients). Nonairway US parameters having a low-moderate correlation with moderate-severe OSA were carotid intimal thickness (pooled correlation coefficient, 0.444; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.320-0.553; P value = .000, 8 studies/727 patients) and plaque presence (sensitivity, 0.24-0.75; specificity, 0.13-1.0; 4 studies/1183 patients). CONCLUSIONS We found that a number of airway and nonairway parameters were identified with moderate to good correlation with OSA diagnosis in the general population. In future studies, it remains to be seen whether PoCUS screening for a combination of these parameters can address the pitfalls of OSA screening questionnaires.","Singh, Mandeep; Tuteja, Arvind; Wong, David T; Goel, Akash; Trivedi, Aditya; Tomlinson, George; Chan, Vincent",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453874/,31

In this perspective, we propose the 'cut-point anti-drug antibody-reagents complex' (CP-ARC) concept for technical comparability of the bioanalytical methods. The feasibility and implementation in routine assay development is discussed as well as the potential improvement of reporting of bioanalytical immunogenicity data to allow comparison across drugs.

METHODS Between 2016 and 2019, a single surgeon performed RAPN for 128 patients with clinical T1a-b renal tumors at our institution, and the 70 most recent patients were included in this study to minimize the effects of surgical experience. PNF was defined as a fatty area around the kidney within the anatomical structures, including the lateroconal fascia, fusion fascia, psoas muscle, lumbar quadrate muscle and diaphragm, and its volume was calculated based on reconstructed three-dimensional computed tomography images using the SYNAPSE VINCENT system. RESULTS In this series, the trifecta and MIC (margin, ischemia and complications) score system outcomes were achieved in 69 (98.6%) and 64 patients (91.4%), respectively. The median PNF volume in the 70 patients was 166.05 cm3, which was significantly correlated with both the body mass index (BMI) and Mayo adhesive probability (MAP) score (correlation coefficient = 0.68 and 0.74, respectively). There was no significant difference in the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, PNF volume or console time during RAPN among 5 groups consisting of 14 consecutive patients. Of several factors examined, the console time was significantly affected by the sex, MAP score and PNF volume, and only the PNF volume was independently associated with the console time. CONCLUSION Even if performed by an experienced robotic surgeon beyond the initial learning curve, the PNF volume may influence the console time during RAPN.","Motoyama, Daisuke; Matsushita, Yuto; Watanabe, Hiromitsu; Tamura, Keita; Ito, Toshiki; Sugiyama, Takayuki; Otsuka, Atsushi; Miyake, Hideaki",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-019-0567-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830961/,31

Applicants report distress and have advocated for reform. However, there is a paucity of quantitative data to characterise applicant concerns. OBJECTIVE We quantified the interview scheduling experience for US allopathic medical students in the 2020 main residency match. METHODS An anonymous, 13 question survey was sent to student representatives from each Association of American Medical Colleges member institution. Recipients were asked to forward the survey to their entire fourth-year class. RESULTS Of 4314 applicants to whom the survey was sent, 786 (18.2%) responded. Overall, 20.4% reported missing the opportunity to interview at a programme because they did not have adequate time to respond to an invitation; applicants into surgical specialties were significantly more likely than their non-surgical peers to report this experience (26.4% vs 18.4%, p<0.05). Most (57.4%) respondents scheduled an interview knowing they would likely cancel it in the future. The most commonly cited reason for this behaviour was concern that applicants would not receive invitations from other programmes (85.6%). A majority (56.4%) of respondents did not believe the match interview process functions based on equity and merit. CONCLUSIONS About one in five respondents missed the opportunity to interview at a programme because they did not respond to an invitation in time. Most respondents scheduled interviews knowing that they were likely to cancel them in the future. Standardisation of the interview invitation timeline would address these concerns.","Mullen, Mark; Barnard, Amanda; Gavard, Jeffrey A; Miller, Chad; Thomure, Michael",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707292/,31

Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test).

146050,What robot for tomorrow and what improvement can we expect?,2018,"INTRODUCTION Barbed sutures are used in cesarean delivery with the intended benefits of better tissue approximation, hemostasis and strength, as well as reduced operative time. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of the use of barbed suture compared to conventional sutures in cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and three clinical trial registries, were searched from inception to December 2019, without restriction by language or publication year. Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of barbed suture with conventional sutures in closure of any layer (uterine/ fascial/ skin) during cesarean delivery were included. The safety outcomes included estimated blood loss, pain, mortality, other morbidity including infection, re-operation or re- admission. Effectiveness outcomes included closure time, need for additional suture and scar integrity. Study selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias and quality assessment were independently performed by two authors. Primary analysis compared outcomes for all layers of surgical closure, while subgroup analysis was performed by individual layer. Pooled mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Level of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020168859 RESULTS: The review included four trials (three comparing uterine closure and one comparing skin closure), at high risk-of-bias, representing 460 participants. Primary analysis showed no morbidity differences between two groups. The use of barbed suture for uterine closure was associated with shorter incision closure time [MD 110.58 seconds (95% CI 93.79 - 127.36)], total surgical time [MD 1.92 minutes (95% CI 0.03 - 3.80)], and a reduced need for additional hemostatic sutures [RR 0.39 (95% CI 0.28 - 0.54)], with no difference in estimated blood loss [MD 46.17 ml (95% CI 13.55 to -105.89)] or postoperative morbidity [RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.46 - 2.01)]. The level of evidence was deemed to be low-to-very-low, based on inconsistency and imprecision of results. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures may be a suitable alternative to conventional sutures for uterine closure as they reduce uterine repair time, total surgical time and the need for additional haemostatic sutures, without an increase in blood loss or maternal morbidity.","Agarwal, Sugandha; D'Souza, Rohan; Ryu, Michelle; Maxwell, Cynthia",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404082/,31
146352,COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis.,2020-06-26,"PURPOSE Stemming from a myriad of genetic and epigenetic alterations, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is tied to poor clinical outcomes and aspires for individualized therapies. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of co-inhibiting integrin-dependent signaling pathway and BRD4, a transcriptional and epigenetic mediator, for TNBC. METHODS Two independent patient cohorts were subjected to bioinformatic and IHC examination for clinical association of candidate cancer drivers. The efficacy and biological bases for co-targeting these drivers were interrogated using cancer cell lines, a protein kinase array, chemical inhibitors, RNAi/CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, and a 4 T1-Balb/c xenograft model. RESULTS We found that amplification of the chromosome 8q24 region occurred in nearly 20% of TNBC tumors, and that it coincided with co-upregulation or amplification of c-Myc and FAK, a key effector of integrin-dependent signaling. This co-upregulation at the mRNA or protein level correlated with a poor patient survival (p < 0.0109 or p < 0.0402, respectively). Furthermore, we found that 14 TNBC cell lines exhibited high vulnerabilities to the combination of JQ1 and VS-6063, potent pharmacological antagonists of the BRD4/c-Myc and integrin/FAK-dependent pathways, respectively. We also observed a cooperative inhibitory effect of JQ1 and VS-6063 on tumor growth and infiltration of Ly6G+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells in vivo. Finally, we found that JQ1 and VS-6063 cooperatively induced apoptotic cell death by altering XIAP, Bcl2/Bcl-xl and Bim levels, impairing c-Src/p130Cas-, PI3K/Akt- and RelA-associated signaling, and were linked to EMT-inducing transcription factor Snail- and Slug-dependent regulation. CONCLUSION Based on our results, we conclude that the BRD4/c-Myc- and integrin/FAK-dependent pathways act in concert to promote breast cancer cell survival and poor clinical outcomes. As such, they represent promising targets for a synthetic lethal-type of therapy against TNBC.","Zhang, Yang; Xu, Bingwei; Shi, Junfeng; Li, Jieming; Lu, Xinlan; Xu, Li; Yang, Helen; Hamad, Nevean; Wang, Chi; Napier, Dana; He, Shuixiang; Liu, Chunming; Liu, Zeyi; Qian, Hai; Chen, Li; Wei, Xiaowei; Zheng, Xucai; Huang, Jian-An; Thibault, Olivier; Craven, Rolf; Wei, Dongping; Pan, Yueyin; Zhou, Binhua P; Wu, Yadi; Yang, Xiuwei H",Cellular oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13402-020-00537-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006750/,31

Many recent publications report the discovery of compounds by screening that are most likely artifacts or promiscuous bioactive compounds, and these results are not placed into the context of previous studies. For HTS to be most successful, it is our contention that there must exist an early partnership between biologists and medicinal chemists. Their combined skill sets are necessary to design robust assays and efficient workflows that will weed out assay artifacts, false positives, promiscuous bioactive compounds and intractable screening hits, efforts that ultimately give projects a better chance at identifying truly useful chemical matter. Expertise in medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics and purification sciences (analytical chemistry) can enhance the post-HTS triage process by quickly removing these problematic chemotypes from consideration, while simultaneously prioritizing the more promising chemical matter for follow-up testing.

Traditionally, coil embolization was the treatment of choice for these lesions; however, recently flow diversion has become a viable, and in some cases superior, treatment option. The current single-center study presents results and trends of endovascular treatment with flow diversion and coil embolization in an unselected group of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms in a ""real world"" setting during the flow-diverter era. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three hundred ten patients with 318 treated unruptured aneurysms from June 2009 to May 2015 were included. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, aneurysm/treatment characteristics, and outcomes were collected prospectively. We studied the following: intensive care unit admission/reasons, perioperative and mid-/long-term complications, target aneurysm rupture, retreatment/recurrence rates, and long-term neurologic outcome using the mRS. RESULTS The flow-diverter group had a larger mean aneurysm size (12.3 ± 8.6 mm versus 8.7 ± 6.3 mm, P < .0001). There were no significant differences in the immediate (P = .43) and mid-/long-term complication rates (P = .54) between groups. Periprocedural neurologic morbidity and mortality rates were 2.1% and 0.5% in the coiling group and 2.5% and 1.6% in the flow-diverter group. Patients with coiling were more likely to be retreated than those with flow diversion (14.8% versus 5.7%, P = .009). Worsening of the mRS due to the target aneurysm was noted in only 3.2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms can be performed with very low rates of neurologic complications. Both flow-diverter and coil therapy were safe and effective.","Petr, O; Brinjikji, W; Cloft, H; Kallmes, D F; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

146468,The future of sepsis research: Time to think differently?,2020-08-05,"Kidney resident macrophages (KRM) are involved in maintaining renal homeostasis and in controlling the pathological outcome of acute kidney injury and cystic kidney disease in mice. In adult mice, KRM maintain their population through self-renewal with little or no input from the peripheral blood. Despite recent data suggesting that a transcriptionally similar population of KRM-like cells is present across species, the idea that they are self-renewing and independent of peripheral blood input in other species has yet to be proven due to the lack of an appropriate model and cross-species expression markers. In this study, we use our recently identified cross-species KRM cell surface markers and parabiosis surgery in inbred Lewis rats to determine if rat KRM are maintained independent of peripheral blood input, similar to their mouse counterparts. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that parabiosis surgery in the rat results in establishment of chimerism of T/B cells, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages in the blood, spleen, and kidney three weeks post parabiosis surgery. Analysis of KRM using the cell surface markers CD81 or C1q indicates that these cells have minimal chimerism and, therefore, receive little input from the peripheral blood. Thus, a putative KRM population in the rat identified using two novel cross-species markers is maintained with minimal input from the peripheral blood confirming that KRM properties are conserved in at least two different species.","Zimmerman, Kurt; Yang, Zhengqin; Lever, Jeremie M; Li, Zhang; Croyle, Mandy J; Agarwal, Anupam; Yoder, Bradley K; George, James",American journal of physiology.

146855,Fecal microbial transplantation and a high fiber diet attenuates emphysema development by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis.,2020-07-17,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a globally distributed alphacoronavirus that has re-emerged lately, resulting in large economic losses. During viral infection, interferon (IFN-I) plays a vital role in the antiviral innate immunity. However, PEDV has evolved strategies to limit IFN-I production. To suppress virus replication, the host must activate the IFN-stimulated genes and some host restriction factors to circumvent viral replication. This study observed that PEDV infection-induced early growth response gene 1 (EGR1) expression in PEDV-permissive cells. EGR1 overexpression remarkably suppressed PEDV replication. In contrast, depletion of EGR1 led to a significant increase in viral replication. EGR1 suppressed PEDV replication by directly binding to the IFN-regulated antiviral (IRAV) promoter and upregulating IRAV expression. A detailed analysis revealed that IRAV interacts and colocalizes with the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein, inducing N protein degradation via E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 to catalyze N protein ubiquitination. Knockdown of endogenous MARCH8 significantly reversed IRAV-mediated N protein degradation. The collective findings demonstrate a new mechanism of EGR1-mediated viral restriction, in which EGR1 upregulates the expression of IRAV to degrade PEDV N protein through MARCH8. IMPORTANCE PEDV is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that has rapidly emerged worldwide and caused severe economic losses. No currently available drugs or vaccines could effectively control PEDV. PEDV has evolved many strategies to limit IFN-1 production. We identified EGR1 as a novel host restriction factor and demonstrated that EGR1 suppresses PEDV replication by directly binding to the IRAV promoter and upregulating the expression of IRAV, which interacts and degrades the PEDV N protein via E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 to catalyze nucleocapsid protein ubiquitination, which adds another layer of complexity to innate antiviral immunity of this newly identified restriction factor. A better understanding of the innate immune response to PEDV infection will aid the development of novel therapeutic targets and more effective vaccines against virus infection.","Wang, Hua; Kong, Ning; Jiao, Yajuan; Dong, Sujie; Sun, Dage; Chen, Xiaoyong; Zheng, Hao; Tong, Wu; Yu, Hai; Yu, Lingxue; Zhang, Wen; Tong, Guangzhi; Shan, Tongling",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00645-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287043/,31

We aim to determine any beneficial or detrimental short-term effects of these changes. METHODS All patients referred to fracture clinic from the emergency department during the period March 24, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (national lockdown) were assessed for number of face to face and telephone appointments, number of radiographs performed, time to discharge, use of a removable cast, any cast complications, other complications, reattendance or re-referral after discharge. They were compared with patients referred in the same period in 2019. Follow-up was to 6 months for every patient. RESULTS In 2019, 240 patients were reviewed and 110 in 2020. Changes in practice resulted in significant differences in the number of face to face appointments per patient [2 (1 to 6) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 5) 2020 (P<0.00001)] and increase in telephone appointments [0 (0 to 1) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 2) 2020]. Number of radiographs per patient [1 (1 to 7) 2019 vs. 1 (1 to ) 2020 (P=0.0178)] and time to discharge [29 d (0 to 483) 2019 vs. 16 d (0 to 216) 2020 (P<0.00001)] also reduced significantly. Use of a self-removable casting technique increased significantly (2.4% of casts in 2019 vs. 91.8% in 2020 (P<0.00001). There were no significant differences in complications related to cast or otherwise, unplanned attendance or reattendance after discharge. Use of self-removable casts for supracondylar fractures and for simple injuries (including distal radius, forearm, Toddler's, and ankle fractures) also demonstrated no change in complication rate. Significant potential cost savings of >£185 000 per annum could be demonstrated through clinic appointment and cast removal reductions. DISCUSSION Changes to the normal management of pediatric orthopaedic trauma brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been demonstrated to be safe in the short term with no increase in complications demonstrated. Potential cost savings are possible both to the health care provider and also to the patient because of reduced hospital attendance. It is feasible to continue these practices for the potential benefits as they appear safe in the short term.

147770,Industry updates from the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine in March 2020.,2020-05-26,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy is a widely applied technique in the operative treatment of diverticular disease. Treatment guidelines recommend operation of complicated diverticulitis and after recurrent attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis. These guidelines have become subject to controversy. The objective of this study was to assess disease-related quality of life after laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively. Patients filled in a form describing their quality of life. All patients undergoing elective operation for diverticular disease between 1999 and 2006 at the Department of Surgery of the Uster Hospital, a regional medical center in Switzerland were included. The measurement tool we used is the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test or unpaired t-tests were applied to determine statistical significance of differences observed. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were included and 120 questionnaires were available for analysis. Mean follow-up was 40 months. Of the total, 48% reported a GIQLI >100 before the operation, which rose to 83% after the operation (p < 0.0001). Mean GIQLI was 95 before and 114 after the operation (p < 0.0001). Female patients reported lower GIQLI rates. Overall, 96% were satisfied with the operation. CONCLUSIONS The results in this study population show that in a majority of patients who underwent elective laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy for recurrent diverticulitis gastrointestinal quality of life improved with the operation.","Pasternak, Itai; Wiedemann, Nicole; Basilicata, Giacinto; Melcher, Gian A",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-011-1386-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22200793/,31

This possibility is appealing because of the known shift from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, that occurs in malignancy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations could either be maternally inherited and predispose to cancer (germ line mutations) or occur sporadically in the mtDNA of specific tissues (tissue- or tumor-specific somatic mutations) and contribute to the tumor initiation and progression process. High-throughput sequencing technologies now enable comprehensive detection of mtDNA variation in tissues and bodily fluids, with the potential to be used as an early detection tool that may impact the treatment of cancer. Here, we discuss insights into the roles of mtDNA mutations in carcinogenesis, highlighting the complexities involved in the analysis and interpretation of mitochondrial genomic content, technical challenges in studying their contribution to pathogenesis, and the value of mtDNA mutations in developing early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies for cancer.","Nguyen, Hieu; LaFramboise, Thomas",Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2020.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004308/,31

Routine provision will require major changes in service configuration and workforce. An important first step is to quantify the population of stroke patients that could benefit. We estimated the annual UK population suitable for endovascular thrombectomy using standard or advanced imaging for patient selection. Patients and methods Evidence from randomised control trials and national registries was combined to estimate UK stroke incidence and define a decision-tree describing the endovascular thrombectomy eligible population. Results Between 9620 and 10,920 UK stroke patients (approximately 10% of stroke admissions) would be eligible for endovascular thrombectomy annually. The majority (9140-9620) would present within 4 h of onset and be suitable for intravenous thrombolysis. Advanced imaging would exclude 500 patients presenting within 4 h, but identify an additional 1310 patients as eligible who present later. Discussion Information from randomised control trials and large registry data provided the evidence criterion for 9 of the 12 decision points. The best available evidence was used for two decision points with sensitivity analyses to determine how key branches of the tree affected estimates. Using the mid-point estimate for eligibility (9.6% of admissions) and assuming national endovascular thrombectomy coverage, 4280 patients would have reduced disability. Conclusion A model combining published trials and register data suggests approximately 10% of all stroke admissions in the UK are eligible for endovascular thrombectomy. The use of advanced imaging based on current published evidence did not have a major impact on overall numbers but could alter eligibility status for 16% of cases.","McMeekin, Peter; White, Philip; James, Martin A; Price, Christopher I; Flynn, Darren; Ford, Gary A",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987317733343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900409/,31

The results are based on a comprehensive literature search of all literature on this topic and our own experience in the treatment of patients with smell and taste disorders since the beginning of the pandemic.Current study results indicate that clinically less affected Covid-19 patients without inpatient treatment and who do not require ventilation often have disorders of the chemosensory system. In young patients and women in particular, they seem to be an indicator of a favorable prognosis for the course of the disease. Smell disorders can appear early, as the sole symptom or together with other symptoms of Covid-19 disease. It has not yet been clarified whether ageusia can occur independently or whether it is also felt in the context of anosmia. In the pandemic, the new occurrence of anosmia without congestion / obstruction/runny nose is probably an expression of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 and should always give rise to quarantine and testing for SARS-CoV-2. The smell disorder in Covid-19 mostly seems to be temporary; It is not yet possible to conclusively assess whether there is usually a full restitution. The therapeutic approaches already established for other postviral olfactory disorders (e. g. olfactory training) are also used here.","Isenmann, Stefan; Haehner, Antje; Hummel, Thomas",Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1375-0761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621990/,31

The selected aldehydes are typical secondary oxidation products from unsaturated fatty acids. Moisture content increased as aldehydes were added to soybean oil during thermal oxidation at a storage temperature of 50 or 100 °C. The CMC of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) increased as propanal and hexanal were added, whereas nonanal decreased the CMC of DOPC, which implies that aldehydes participate in forming association colloids in bulk oils. The addition of aldehydes increased the rates of lipid oxidation significantly in both 50 and 100 °C treatments (p < 0.05), with the effect being more evident in oils treated at 50 °C than at 100 °C.

150551,Bioinformatics and experimental findings reveal the therapeutic actions and targets of pachymic acid against cystitis glandularis.,2021-04-24,"Phenotypic plasticity can enable organisms to produce optimal phenotypes in multiple environments. A crucial life history trait that is often highly plastic is sex allocation, which in simultaneous hermaphrodites describes the relative investment into the male versus female sex functions. Theory predicts-and morphological evidence supports-that greater investment into the male function is favoured with increasing group size, due to the increasing importance of sperm competition for male reproductive success. Here, we performed a genome-wide gene expression assay to test for such sex allocation plasticity in a model simultaneous hermaphrodite, the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano. Based on RNA-Seq data from 16 biological replicates spanning four different group size treatments, we demonstrate that at least 10% of the >75,000 investigated transcripts in M. lignano are differentially expressed according to the social environment, rising to >30% of putative gonad-specific transcripts (spermatogenesis and oogenesis candidates) and tail-specific transcripts (seminal fluid candidates). This transcriptional response closely corresponds to the expected shift away from female and towards male reproductive investment with increasing sperm competition level. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we then confirm that many plastic transcripts exhibit the expected organ-specific expression, and RNA interference of selected testis- and ovary-specific candidates establishes that these indeed function in gametogenesis pathways. We conclude that a large proportion of sex-specific transcripts in M. lignano are differentially expressed according to the prevailing ecological conditions and that these are functionally relevant to key reproductive phenotypes. Our study thus begins to bridge organismal and molecular perspectives on sex allocation plasticity.","Ramm, Steven A; Lengerer, Birgit; Arbore, Roberto; Pjeta, Robert; Wunderer, Julia; Giannakara, Athina; Berezikov, Eugene; Ladurner, Peter; Schärer, Lukas",Molecular ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891857/,31

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-port mediastinoscope-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer. The perioperative outcomes of 60 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent this operation between March 2014 and June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The upper mediastinal dissection including lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, using a left cervical approach, was performed with a single-port mediastinoscopic technique, which was used to improve the visibility and handling in the deep mediastinum around the aortic arch. The lymphadenectomy along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve was performed under direct vision using a right cervical approach. Bilateral cervical approaches were followed by hand-assisted laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy in the middle and lower mediastinum. Tumors were mainly located in the middle thoracic esophagus (n = 33), and most tumors were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 58). Pretreatment diagnoses were stage I, 19; II, 13; III, 24; IV, 4. Preoperative chemotherapy was performed for 40 patients. The median operation time and blood loss were 363 minutes and 235 mL, respectively. There were two patients who underwent conversion to thoracotomy. Perioperative complications were evaluated and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo (CD) and the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG) classifications. Postoperatively, pneumonia was observed in four patients (CD, Grade II, 2; Grade IIIb, 2), although vocal cord palsy was more frequent (ECCG, Type I, 12; Type III, 8). The median number of thoracic lymph nodes resected was 21, and the R0 resection rate was 95%.

Though the laparoscopic Duhamel procedure is a favorable option in right-sided HD, the conventional laparoscopic technique is time consuming and has complications that are associated with the reservoir. In this study, we described a modified laparoscopic Duhamel technique with ex-anal rectal transection combined with the Deloyer's procedure for right-sided HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2010 and January 2015, 18 right-sided HD underwent this modified laparoscopic Duhamel procedure (MLDP). The main modifications were to mobilize the colon and to dissect the retrorectal space under laparoscopy, pull out, and transect ex-anally by using a linear stapling device through a transverse incision on posterior wall of the rectum. Seven age-matched patients who underwent a conventional laparoscopic Duhamel procedure (CLDP) between March 2008 and December 2010 were included as the control group. Demographics, surgical procedures, operative data, postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between these two groups. RESULTS Operative time was significantly shorter in the MLDP group (150 minutes versus 195 minutes; P = .03). There was no significant difference in mean timespan to obtain a normal defecation frequency (3.8 months versus 3.6 months), incidence of soiling (11.1% versus 14.3%; P = .34), and constipation (5.6% versus 14.3%; P = .69). Pouchitis were not found in the MLDP group, whereas 2 patients in the CLDP group (28.6%) presented with pouchitis and intractable diarrhea, requiring spur division. The incidence of postoperative enterocolitis was not significantly different in the two groups (11.1% in MLDP versus 14.3% in CLDP; P = .68). All 22 patients had a normal defecation over 4 years of age. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Duhamel with ex-anal rectal transection is a simple, easy-to-learn, and effective procedure for right-sided HD. It has low postoperative pouchitis because of a short pouch.","Zhang, Xi; Yang, Li; Tang, Shao-Tao; Cao, Guo-Qing; Li, Shuai; Jiang, Meng; Xiong, Meng; Yang, De-Hua; Chang, Xiao-Pan; Li, Kang; Ma, Ya-Zhen",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial with a noninferiority design. It was conducted between August 2011 and June 2017 at 7 sites in Korea. A total of 388 adults (aged 19-85 yrs) with clinical stage I, II, or III adenocarcinoma of the ascending or sigmoid colon were enrolled and randomized. The primary endpoint was 30-day postoperative complication rates. Secondary endpoints were the number of harvested lymph nodes, length of the resection margin, postoperative pain, and time to functional recovery (bowel movement and diet). Patients were followed for 30 days after surgery. RESULTS Among 388 patients, 359 (92.5%) completed the study (SPLS, n = 179; MPLS, n = 180). The 30-day postoperative complication rate was 10.6% in the SPLS group and 13.9% in the MPLS group (95% confidence interval, -10.05 to 3.05 percentage points; P < 0.0001). Total incision length was shorter in the SPLS group than in the MPLS group (4.6 cm vs 7.2 cm, P < 0.001), whereas the length of the specimen extraction site did not differ (4.4 cm vs 4.6 cm, P = 0.249). There were no significant differences between groups for all secondary endpoints and all other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Even though there was no obvious benefit to SPLS over MPLS when performing colectomy for cancer, our data suggest that SPLS is noninferior to MPLS and can be considered an option in selected patients, when performed by experienced surgeons.

PURPOSE To evaluate the success rates of various scoring methods utilized in order to predict survival periods, on the basis of the imaging findings of COVID-19. Another purpose, on the other hand, was to evaluate the agreements among the evaluating radiologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 100 cases of known COVID-19 pneumonia, of which 50 were deceased and 50 were living, were included in the study. Pre-existing scoring systems, which were the Total Severity Score (TSS), Chest Computed Tomography Severity Score (CT-SS), and Total CT Score, were utilized, together with the Early Decision Severity Score (ED-SS), which was developed by our team, to evaluate the initial lung CT scans of the patients obtained at their initial admission to the hospital. The scans were evaluated retrospectively by two radiologists. Area under the curve (AUC) values were acquired for each scoring system, according to their performances in predicting survival times. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 14.85 years (age range = 18-87 years). There was no difference in co-morbidities between the living and deceased patients. The survival predicted AUC values of ED-SS, CT-SS, TSS, and Total CT Score systems were 0.876, 0.823, 0.753, and 0.744, respectively. CONCLUSION Algorithms based on lung infiltration patterns of COVID-19 may be utilized for both survival prediction and therapy planning.","Dilek, Okan; Demirel, Emin; Akkaya, Hüseyin; Belibagli, Mehmet Cenk; Soker, Gokhan; Gulek, Bozkurt",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1177/02841851211006316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845610/,31

152686,Emerging child competencies and personality pathology: toward a Developmental Cascade model of BPD.,2020-07-13,"Background and purpose: Data concerning the learning curve for endovascular treatment (EVT) of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between operator experience and the outcome of EVT and to further identify the number of cases needed to acquire the ability to perform successful reperfusion. Materials and methods: Four hundred and thirty-four patients who underwent EVT by seven operators at a single center from January 2016 to September 2019 were enrolled. Procedural experience was defined by the number of cases performed by each operator. Multivariable backward regression analyses were used to investigate the association between procedural experience and functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2), 90-days mortality, successful reperfusion (defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3), and puncture-to-reperfusion time after adjusting for covariates. A risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) chart was utilized to identify the number of caseloads needed to overcome the learning curve effect. Results: Procedural experience was independently associated with functional independence, 90-days mortality, successful reperfusion, and puncture-to-reperfusion time reduction (per 10-case increment: OR 1.219, 95% CI: 1.079-1.383, P < 0.001; OR 0.847, 95% CI: 0.738-0.968, P = 0.016; OR 1.553, 95% CI: 1.332-1.830, P < 0.001 and β 8.087 min, 95% CI: 6.184-9.991, P < 0.001, respectively). The RA-CUSUM chart indicated that at least 29 cases were required to overcome the learning curve effect. Conclusions: There was a dose-response relationship between operator case volume and clinical outcome, procedure time, and successful reperfusion. The experience needed for successful EVT was at least 29 cases.","Cai, Qiankun; Zhu, Yuyou; Huang, Xianjun; Xiao, Lulu; Gu, Mengmeng; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Chao; Chen, Jixing; Hu, Wei; Wang, Guoping; Sun, Wen",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.587409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519672/,31

In this comprehensive review, the authors have explored the published evidence that has looked into the early effects of this impact on various aspects of delivering surgical services during the crises in the United Kingdom. MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic literature search of the databases (Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, NICE guidelines and Google Scholar). The key words used were COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus, pandemic, surgery, surgical services. The retrieved studies were systematically reviewed and critically analyzed to construct this comprehensive review. RESULTS The surgical interventions have been focused on emergency and cancer surgery during the pandemic. Since the service situation is changing quickly; surgeons should be up to date with the local and national guidelines. It is vital to safeguard the specialized clinical professionals to fulfill their tasks through the pandemic; especially that another wave of the pandemic is still a possibility in the horizon. Attention should be given to surgical training and medical education during the crises by the training providers. CONCLUSIONS The aftermath period is still going to be a serious challenge to the service. Therefore, a strategy of shared responsibility, planning ahead with consideration of developing a transitional period should be adapted.","Al Samaraee, A; Thwaini, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202010_23453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155252/,31

153575,Pediatric Asthma and Viral Infection.,2016,"In this study, we applied on-resonance variable delay multiple pulse (onVDMP) MRI to study D-glucose uptake in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) tauopathy and demonstrated its feasibility in discriminating AD mice from wild-type mice. The D-glucose uptake in the cortex of AD mice (1.70 ± 1.33%) was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type mice (5.42 ± 0.70%, p = 0.0051). Also, a slower D-glucose uptake rate was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD mice (0.08 ± 0.01 min-1) compared to their wild-type counterpart (0.56 ± 0.1 min-1, p < 0.001), which suggests the presence of an impaired glucose transporter on both blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers of these AD mice. Clearance of D-glucose was observed in the CSF of wild-type mice but not AD mice, which suggests dysfunction of the glymphatic system in the AD mice. The results in this study indicate that onVDMP MRI could be a cost-effective and widely available method for simultaneously evaluating glucose transporter and glymphatic function of AD. This study also suggests that tau protein affects the D-glucose uptake and glymphatic impairment in AD at a time point preceding neurofibrillary tangle pathology.","Chen, Lin; Wei, Zhiliang; Chan, Kannie Wy; Li, Yuguo; Suchal, Kapil; Bi, Sheng; Huang, Jianpan; Xu, Xiang; Wong, Philip C; Lu, Hanzhang; van Zijl, Peter Cm; Li, Tong; Xu, Jiadi",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x20941264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669023/,31

Two datasets (collected before [2018] and after the onset of [April, 2020] COVID-19) were combined (N = 2,131) for this research. The data provided support for the hypothesis that perceptions of Black-White intergroup competition, and subsequently perceptions of discrimination, behavioral avoidance, intergroup anxiety, and interracial mistrust would be higher after the onset of COVID-19. Three additional predictors, a perceived interracial competition manipulation, political orientation, and population density at the ZIP-code level were examined to test for main effects and moderation of COVID-19 effects. All three predictors exhibited main effects on focal outcomes, and political orientation moderated COVID-19 onset effects: effects were stronger for conservatives. Lastly, perceived intergroup competition mediated the effect of COVID-19 onset on the four focal outcomes.","Gordils, Jonathan; Elliot, Andrew J; Toprakkiran, Selin; Jamieson, Jeremy P",The Journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2021.1918617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960284/,31
153863,Emerging human coronaviruses--disease potential and preparedness.,2012,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Within the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) classification, TICI 2b has been historically considered successful recanalization. Recent studies have suggested that TICI 3 and a proposed TICI 2c should be separately reported from TICI 2b, in both the original (>66% reperfusion) and modified (>50% reperfusion) definitions, because of differences in clinical outcomes with greater reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in early neurological improvement and independence at 90 days using the original TICI, modified TICI, and modified TICI with 2c scales. METHODS A retrospective review of 129 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery, M1 segment or intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions. Patient angiograms were graded by 2 experienced readers by percentage recanalization. This was then categorized into original TICI, modified TICI (mTICI), and mTICI with TICI 2c (mTICI 2c) grading scales. Comparison of baseline demographics, early neurological improvement, and independence at 90 days was performed. RESULTS A significant difference in early neurological improvement was observed between 2b and 3 (P=0.032), as well as between 2b and 2c (P=0.028) under the mTICI 2c grading scale. Similarly, a significant difference in functional independence was observed between 2b and 3 (P=0.037), as well as between 2b and 2c (P=0.047) under the mTICI 2c scale. The difference in early neurological improvement or functional independence between 2b and 3 for the original TICI and mTICI scales was not significant. When combining the 2c and 3 groups under the mTICI 2c scale, there were significant differences between 2b and 2c/3 in regards to both early neurological improvement (P=0.011) and independence (P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS Using a TICI grading system that includes an additional category beyond TICI 2b allows for refined prediction of early neurological improvement and functional independence.","Tung, Eric L; McTaggart, Ryan A; Baird, Grayson L; Yaghi, Shadi; Hemendinger, Morgan; Dibiasio, Eleanor L; Hidlay, Douglas T; Tung, Glenn A; Jayaraman, Mahesh V",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.017182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28775136/,31

We evaluated this system in healthy subjects during induced hypoxemia. METHODS Hypoxemia was induced in 10 healthy subjects while breathing a gas mixture of variable F(IO(2)) (air + nitrogen). Each subject performed 3 hypoxemic challenges with the addition, in a random order, of either: air with constant flow (1.5 L/min); oxygen with constant flow (1.5 L/min); or automatic oxygen flow titration. Subjects were blinded to the intervention. Oxygen flow, S(pO(2)), end-tidal CO(2), respiratory rate, and heart rate were recorded every second. The primary outcome was the time with S(pO(2)) between 92% and 96%. RESULTS The S(pO(2)) target (92-96%) was achieved a median of 26.0%, 36.8%, and 66.5% (P < .001) of the time with air, constant oxygen, and automated oxygen titration, respectively. Severe oxygen desaturations (S(pO(2)) < 88%) were respectively observed at a median of 33.7%, 12.7%, and 0.4% of the time (P < .001). Hyperoxia was present a median of 4.1%, 39.1%, and 14.5% of the time (P < .001). Tachycardia was present with air and with constant oxygen flow, but not while using automated oxygen titration. These results were obtained with a mean and maximal oxygen flow of 1.3 L/min and 7.6 L/min with the automated titration. CONCLUSIONS In this model of induced hypoxemia, the FreeO(2) system that automatically titrates the oxygen flow was more efficient at maintaining the S(pO(2)) target, while ensuring a statistically significant reduction in the rates of severe hypoxemia and hyperoxia, in comparison with air or constant oxygen flow. These beneficial results were obtained with less oxygen, in comparison to a constant oxygen flow.","Lellouche, François; L'her, Erwan",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348812/,31

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples by using PCR is the standard laboratory diagnostic tool. Our aim was to perform a limited evaluation of the diagnostic performance and user-friendliness of eleven rapid tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Methods All participants were tested with PCR against SARS-CoV-2 at a clinical microbiology laboratory. Comparing with results from PCR tests, we evaluated the rapid tests' performances in three arms; 1) 20 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 2) 23 recovered outpatients with former PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 3) 49 participants with suspected COVID-19 presenting at a primary care emergency room. Results All eleven tests detected antibodies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, though with varying sensitivities. In former outpatients recovered from COVID-19, there were differences between tests in the immunoglobulin type G (IgG) sensitivity, with five tests having a sensitivity below 65%. In participants with suspected COVID-19 infection, the rapid tests had very low sensitivities. Most rapid tests were easy to perform and interpret. Conclusions Rapid tests were not suited as stand-alone tests to detect present infection in a Norwegian primary care emergency room population. All the rapid tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, although sensitivities varied and were generally higher in the study arm of more severely affected participants. Rapid tests with high IgG sensitivity (and specificity) may be useful for confirmation of past infection. An independent evaluation should be performed in the intended population before introducing a rapid test.","Tollånes, Mette C; Bakken Kran, Anne-Marte; Abildsnes, Eirik; Jenum, Pål A; Breivik, Anne C; Sandberg, Sverre",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32598303/,31

However, the small-airway disease in patients with COVID-19 has not been explored. AIM This study aimed to explore the small-airway disease in patients with COVID-19 using inspiratory and expiratory chest high-resolution computed tomography (CT). METHODS This multicenter study included 108 patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into five stages (0-IV) based on the CT images. The clinical and imaging data were compared among CT images in different stages. Patients were divided into three groups according to the time interval from the initial CT scan, and the clinical and air trapping data were compared among these groups. The correlation between clinical parameters and CT scores was evaluated. RESULTS The clinical data, including age, frequency of breath shortness and dyspnea, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2, and time interval between the onset of illness and initial CT, showed significant differences among CT images in different stages. A significant difference in the CT score of air trapping was observed between stage I and stage III. A low negative correlation was found between the CT score of air trapping and time interval between the onset of symptoms and initial CT. No significant difference was noted in the frequency and CT score of air trapping among different groups. CONCLUSIONS Some patients with COVID-19 developed small-airway disease. Air trapping was more distinguished in the early stage of the disease and persisted during the 2-month follow-up.

157926,Blunted cerebral vascular responsiveness to hypercapnia in obese individuals.,2017,"BACKGROUND Endogenous fibrinolytic activation contributes to coagulopathy and mortality after trauma. Administering tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, is one strategy to reduce bleeding; however, it must be given soon after injury to be effective and minimize adverse effects. Administering TXA topically to a wound site would decrease the time to treatment and could enable both local and systemic delivery if a suitable formulation existed to deliver the drug deep into wounds adequately. OBJECTIVES To determine whether self-propelling particles could increase the efficacy of TXA. METHODS Using previously developed self-propelling particles, which consist of calcium carbonate and generate CO2 gas, TXA was formulated to disperse in blood and wounds. The antifibrinolytic properties were assessed in vitro and in a murine tail bleeding assay. Self-propelled TXA was also tested in a swine model of junctional hemorrhage consisting of femoral arteriotomy without compression. RESULTS Self-propelled TXA was more effective than non-propelled formulations in stabilizing clots from lysis in vitro and reducing blood loss in mice. It was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously in mice up to 300 to 1000 mg/kg. When it was incorporated in gauze, four of six pigs treated after a femoral arteriotomy and without compression survived, and systemic concentrations of TXA reached approximately 6 mg/L within the first hour. CONCLUSIONS A formulation of TXA that disperses the drug in blood and wounds was effective in several models. It may have several advantages, including supporting local clot stabilization, reducing blood loss from wounds, and providing systemic delivery of TXA. This approach could both improve and simplify prehospital trauma care for penetrating injury.","Baylis, James R; Lee, Michael M; St John, Alexander E; Wang, Xu; Simonson, Eric; Cau, Massimo; Kazerooni, Amir; Gusti, Vionarica; Statz, Matthew L; Yoon, Jeff S J; Liggins, Richard T; White, Nathan J; Kastrup, Christian J",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145837/,31
158393,My Blue Sky.,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular treatment (EVT) is a powerful treatment for large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke if reperfusion can be achieved, while in cases with failed reperfusion, EVT may cause harm, as procedure-related complications may occur. We hypothesized that EVT with failed recanalization does not result in worse outcomes compared to best medical management and compared clinical outcomes of LVO stroke patients who underwent EVT with failed reperfusion to those who were treated with best medical management. METHODS We included patients with failed reperfusion from the control (EVT-only) arm of the ESCAPE-NA1 trial and the EVT arm of the ESCAPE trial and patients of the ESCAPE control arm who were treated with best medical management. Failed reperfusion following EVT was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 0-2a. Proportions of good outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2) were compared between patients who did and did not undergo EVT, and adjusted effect size estimates for EVT on outcomes were obtained. RESULTS We included 260 patients (110 failed EVT and 150 non-EVT patients). Proportions of good outcome were 38/110 (34.6%) with failed EVT vs.43/147 (29.3%) without EVT (adjusted odds ratio[aOR]: 1.48 [95%CI: 0.81-2.68]). Mortality and proportions of sICH in the failed EVT group vs. patients treated with best medical management were 26/110 (23.6%) vs. 28/147 (19.1%), aOR: 1.12 (95%CI: 0.56-2.24), and 7/110 (6.4%) vs. 4/150 (2.7%), aOR: 2.34 (95%CI: 0.00-22.97).

158905,In vivo white light and contrast-enhanced vital-dye fluorescence imaging of Barrett's-related neoplasia in a single-endoscopic insertion.,2016,"BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Persons with mental illness (PwMI) are prone to weight gain as a side effect of antipsychotics. Health counselling on diet, physical activity, medication adherence, expressed emotions and technology use, by health professionals, can help in managing these side-effects. AIM The aim of this study was to identify the pre-counselling profile of the subjects such as body mass index (BMI), diet, physical activity, medication adherence, expressed emotions and technology use among PwMI; to attend the Holistic Health Clinic as part of follow-up services in the psychiatry Outpatient Department (OPD) as well as to find correlation and association between the study variables. METHODS The study involved a cross-sectional descriptive design based on convenience sampling. The sample consists of 56 patients who are receiving antipsychotics under symptom control (self-reported) and were overweight. Data were collected with a patient assessment proforma and analysed using SPSS-22. RESULTS The patients referred to the holistic health counselling (HHC) had abnormal weight and BMI. The mean and SD of weight was 74.48 ± 14.07 and BMI 29.51 ± 5.15. All the participants received counselling on diet, 87.5% on physical activity, 62.5% on sleep hygiene, 55.4% on medication adherence, 8.9% on family emotional climate and only 5.4% on healthy use of technology. Weight has shown significant relation with gender (male = 80.84 ± 17.71, female = 71.09 ± 10.52, t = -2.52, p = .015) and near to significant relationship (χ2 = 7.685, p = .053) with educational status. CONCLUSION Patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) have lesser extra pyramidal side-effects; however, they are more prone to gain weight. Proper screening and counselling during the follow-up visit in the outpatient setting can help in identification, prevention and management of the obesity-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and motivate them to adopt healthy behaviours.","Gandhi, Sailaxmi; Mohanty, Krutideepa; Sahu, Maya; Naik, Shalini S; Pahuja, Erika; Gunasekaran, Durai Murukan; Prasad, M Krishna",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020946797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744115/,31

We report a case of successful treatment of a wide-necked basilar artery fenestration aneurysm with a novel double-barrel stent-assisted coiling technique. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 50-year-old woman presented with headaches. Evaluation revealed an unruptured 7-mm broad-based basilar artery fenestration aneurysm that incorporated both limbs of the basilar fenestration and both distal vertebral arteries. INTERVENTION A 4.5 mm × 22 mm Enterprise stent (Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, MA, USA) was deployed from the right limb of the basilar fenestration into the right distal vertebral artery. Similarly, a 2.5 mm × 20 mm Neuroform EZ stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was placed from the left limb of the basilar fenestration into the left distal vertebral artery. Following stent deployment, the aneurysm was treated with coil-embolization through a jailed microcatheter. CONCLUSION In the case presented, a double-barrel stent configuration enabled dense coil embolization of the aneurysm as well as preservation of both basilar fenestration limbs and both distal vertebral arteries.","Kan, Peter; Abla, Adib A; Dumont, Travis M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1552-6569.2012.00720.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22607550/,31

In particular, several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to find other more specific antiviral strategies.","Costanzo, Michele; De Giglio, Maria Anna Rachele; Roviello, Giovanni Nicola",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867327666200416131117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297571/,31

159774,Coronal reformatted CT images contribute to the precise evaluation of the radiofrequency ablative margin for hepatocellular carcinoma.,2014,"When nanoparticles interact with human blood, a multitude of plasma components adsorb onto the surface of the nanoparticles, forming a biomolecular corona. Corona composition is known to be influenced by the chemical composition of nanoparticles. In contrast, the possible effects of variations in the human blood proteome between healthy individuals on the formation of the corona and its subsequent interactions with immune cells in blood are unknown. Herein, we prepared and examined a matrix of 11 particles (including organic and inorganic particles of three sizes and five surface chemistries) and plasma samples from 23 healthy donors to form donor-specific biomolecular coronas (personalized coronas) and investigated the impact of the personalized coronas on particle interactions with immune cells in human blood. Among the particles examined, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated mesoporous silica (MS) particles, irrespective of particle size (800, 450, or 100 nm in diameter), displayed the widest range (up to 60-fold difference) of donor-dependent variance in immune cell association. In contrast, PEG particles (after MS core removal) of 860, 518, or 133 nm in diameter displayed consistent stealth behavior (negligible cell association), irrespective of plasma donor. For comparison, clinically relevant PEGylated doxorubicin-encapsulated liposomes (Doxil) (74 nm in diameter) showed significant variance in association with monocytes and B cells across all plasma donors studied. An in-depth proteomic analysis of each biomolecular corona studied was performed, and the results were compared against the nanoparticle-blood cell association results, with individual variance in the proteome driving differential association with specific immune cell types. We identified key immunoglobulin and complement proteins that explicitly enriched or depleted within the corona and which strongly correlated with the cell association pattern observed across the 23 donors. This study demonstrates how plasma variance in healthy individuals significantly influences the blood immune cell interactions of nanoparticles.","Ju, Yi; Kelly, Hannah G; Dagley, Laura F; Reynaldi, Arnold; Schlub, Timothy E; Spall, Sukhdeep K; Bell, Craig A; Cui, Jiwei; Mitchell, Andrew J; Lin, Zhixing; Wheatley, Adam K; Thurecht, Kristofer J; Davenport, Miles P; Webb, Andrew I; Caruso, Frank; Kent, Stephen J",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33112593/,31

The history of passive immunization with antibodies to prevent or treat infectious diseases is a story of different eras. There was an extraordinary era of discovery and clinical implementation before the chemical nature of antibodies was even known. This empirical process provided the resources and reagents used to describe and characterize humoral immunity, better define the chemical properties and structure of antibodies, and extend the clinical use of immunoglobulin products to treat or prevent multiple viral and bacterial diseases over the ensuing several decades. The next distinct era came with the discovery of processes to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and development of more specific therapies. Interestingly, mAb technology resulted in many products to treat autoimmune and allergic diseases, but only one common infectious disease, respiratory syncytial virus, and only in a restricted population of high-risk infants. RECENT FINDINGS The current era began in 2003 with a series of publications demonstrating processes for rapidly producing human mAbs. SUMMARY This technology combined with new sequencing technology, advances in structural biology, atomic-level molecular design, and increased capacity for synthetic biology, promises new opportunities to apply passive immunization to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.","Graham, Barney S; Ambrosino, Donna M",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760933/,31

160704,Correspondence: Ebola Virus Disease in ASEAN Countries.,2016,"During the past decade, various types of small non-coding RNAs were found to be expressed in all kingdoms and phyla of life. Intense research efforts have begun to shed light on their biological functions, although much remains to be determined in order to fully characterize their scope of biological action. Typically, small RNAs provide sequence specificity to a protein complex that is driven to silence a long target RNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that are coded in the genome of most eukaryotes, and contribute to the cellular identity by regulating cell-specific gene networks by translational repression or degradation of mRNA. These effects commonly fine-tune gene expression associated with developmental or environmental cues. Different cell types can be characterized by their distinctive cellular miRNA landscape. The human placenta expresses a unique set of miRNAs, a high proportion of which is derived from a large cluster located on chromosome 19, (termed chromosome 19 miRNA cluster, or C19MC). Interestingly, a fraction of these placenta-enriched miRNAs are released to the extracellular environment through exosomes that were recently found to induce an antiviral immunity. In this review, we explore relevant placental viral infections and discuss the antiviral role of exosome-packaged placental C19MC miRNAs in this context.","Mouillet, Jean-Francois; Ouyang, Yingshi; Bayer, Avraham; Coyne, Carolyn B; Sadovsky, Yoel",The International journal of developmental biology,https://doi.org/10.1387/ijdb.130349ys; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023694/,31

161538,Emerging infectious disease agents and their potential threat to transfusion safety.,2009,"BACKGROUND Frail older adults are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Yet, there is little evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants to treat depression with concomitant frailty. To better understand this issue, we examined the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression and then considered implications for frailty. METHODS Due to the absence of therapeutic studies of frail older adults with depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized controlled trials that compared antidepressants versus placebo for adults with depression, age 65 years or older. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, reference lists from meta-analyses/studies, hand searches of publication lists, and related articles on PubMed. Outcomes included rates of response, remission, and adverse events. After evaluating the data, we applied a frailty-informed framework to consider how the evidence could be applied to frailty. RESULTS Nine trials were included in the meta-analysis (n = 2704). Subjects had moderate to severe depression. For older adults with depression, there was no statistically significant difference in response or remission to second-generation antidepressants compared to placebo. Response occurred in 45.3% of subjects receiving an antidepressant compared to 40.5% receiving placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37, p = 0.12, I2 = 71%). Remission occurred in 33.1% with antidepressant versus 31.3% with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.31, p = 0.30, I2 = 56%) (Figure 2 and 3). There were more withdrawals due to adverse events with antidepressants, 13% versus 5.8% (RR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.45-3.63; p < 0.001; I2 = 61%; NNH 14, 95% CI:10-28). IMPLICATIONS FOR FRAILTY Subjects in the meta-analysis did not have obvious characteristics of frailty. Using framework questions to consider the implications of frailty, we hypothesize that, like older adults, frail individuals with depression may not respond to antidepressants. Further, observational studies suggest that those who are frail may be less responsive to antidepressants compared to the non-frail. Given the vulnerability of frailty, adverse events may be more burdensome. CONCLUSIONS Second-generation antidepressants have uncertain benefit for older adults with depression and cause more adverse events compared to placebo. Until further research clarifies benefit, careful consideration of antidepressant prescribing with frailty is warranted.","Mallery, Laurie; MacLeod, Tanya; Allen, Michael; McLean-Veysey, Pamela; Rodney-Cail, Natasha; Bezanson, Evan; Steeves, Brian; LeBlanc, Constance; Moorhouse, Paige",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-019-1327-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718566/,31

To date, there has been no systematic review on telerehabilitation for respiratory tract diseases, including COVID-19. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to determine what telerehabilitation for patients with respiratory tract diseases consists of, how safe telerehabilitation is for patients with respiratory tract diseases, and how feasible telerehabilitation is for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In May 2020, we conducted a search of the following publication databases on the use of telerehabilitation in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Literature, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Of the 208 articles identified, 23 studies were subsequently included in this scoping review. In 22 of the included studies, subjects had stable COPD and underwent telerehabilitation at home. The final included study was a case series of subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who underwent telerehabilitation in-hospital. Most telerehabilitation programs consisted of aerobic exercises using a cycle ergometer or a treadmill, walking, and muscle-strengthening exercises. The reported number of adverse events was low, and most studies reported that the average session adherence rate was > 70%. The majority of the telerehabilitation programs included a face-to-face rehabilitation assessment. Our findings indicate that, in its current state, telerehabilitation may be safe and feasible and may lead to reduced face-to-face rehabilitation therapy; in addition, remote rehabilitation assessment should be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research that targets a more diverse range of respiratory tract diseases and considers telerehabilitation in a hospital setting is required.","Taito, Shunsuke; Yamauchi, Kota; Kataoka, Yuki",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531356/,31

Therefore, we evaluated the safety and effect of combined immunotherapy and single agent chemotherapy in an elderly patient with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A 78-year-old male patients with a repeatedly recurrent gingival squamous cell carcinoma was admitted in our institute. Previously this patient underwent two consecutive surgical resections of recurrent tumors before the second rapid recurrence that resulted in extended tumor mass and lymph node metastasis. As the patient was in a relatively poor performance status (performance status =2), immunotherapy with PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab) combined with single agent chemotherapy (two cycle with albumin-bound paclitaxel and then six cycles with gemcitabine) was administrated, which led to clinical complete response after 8 cycles of treatment. The patient continued 4 cycles of maintenance immunotherapy with Toripalimab until the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient remained free from disease until the last follow up by June 2020, 16 months after the initiation of treatment. The success in this case indicated that the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and single chemotherapy agent may also be effective as well as safe in elderly patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","Wu, Qiuji; Zhang, Shuyuan; Hua, Xinying; Yu, Haijun; Zhong, Yahua",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183019/,31

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA. Importance The mononegavirus order contains major established and recently emerged human pathogens. Despite the threat to human health, antiviral therapeutics directed against this order remain understudied. The mononegavirus polymerase complex represents a promising drug target due to its central importance for both virus replication and viral mitigation of the innate host antiviral response. In this study, we have mechanistically characterized a clinical candidate small-molecule MeV polymerase inhibitor. The compound blocked all phosphodiester bond formation activity, a unique mechanism of action unlike all other known mononegavirus polymerase inhibitors. Photocrosslinking-based target site mapping demonstrated that this class-defining prototype inhibitor stabilizes a pre-initiation conformation of the viral polymerase complex that sterically cannot accommodate template RNA. Function-equivalent druggable sites exist in all mononegavirus polymerases. In addition to its direct anti-MeV impact, the insight gained in this study can therefore serve as a blueprint for indication spectrum expansion through structure-informed scaffold engineering or targeted drug discovery.","Cox, Robert M.; Sourimant, Julien; Govindarajan, Mugunthan; Natchus, Michael G.; Plemper, Richard K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.23.311043,31

163610,Towards a simulation framework for optimizing infectious disease surveillance: An information theoretic approach for surveillance system design,2020-04-10,"The COVID pandemic severely impacted mobility during lockdown as well as the period after that observing different phases of unlocking process. Lockdown has resulted in drastic mobility reduction and subsequent unlocking process brought back mobility gradually to a certain level, substantially lower than the Pre-COVID periods. However, this is expected to be back gradually to same level of Pre-COVID after certain period of time. While this change is planned to be gradual, it creates an opportunity to improve mobility towards non-motorised transport (NMT) which can influence travel behavior for present as well for the future covering Pre and Post-COVID periods. Apart from studying the influencing travel behavior during Pre and Post-COVID conditions, change in quantum of commuting population is required to be studied for various estimations related to transport planning. This quantum of commuting population is largely affected by the adopted locking/ unlocking strategies by Government of India. Commuting population and travel behavior got influenced by the large migration from metro cities to smaller towns, adopted work from home (WFH) styles, reduced commute of elderly and children and other restrictions on gatherings, etc. Considering the range of allowed activities, influenced by the phases of locking/ unlocking strategies, twelve different scenarios have been developed for various estimations. The developed scenarios have been named with alpha numeric style ranging from A0 to E5. A0 presenting the Pre-COVID scenario. Alphabet “A” represent Pre-COVID scenario, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” Scenarios represent the unlocking phases, while number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represents the different policy aspects related to the change on capacity of transport services (i.e. public transport capacity and change due to infrastructural improvement for NMT). Scenario A0 represents the Pre-COVID situation, while other ranges (viz., B1, B2, B3, C2, C3, C4, D2, D3, D5) represents various locking/unlocking levels. The Scenario E5 represents the situation without any movement restrictions, where public transport systems are assumed to be functioning with full capacity and infrastructure has been improved for NMT trips. Estimations for all the 12 scenarios include commuting population, their modal split, vehicle kilometers traveled by these vehicles and corresponding vehicular emission. Estimated modal split also includes the influence of improved NMT friendly infrastructure and reduced capacity of public transport systems. The results of developed scenarios provide a handy information for the policy makers to choose right policy to promote sustainable transportation with adequate emphasis on NMT. It is evident that as compared to the Pre-COVID scenario (A0), Post-COVID scenario with improved NMT infrastructure (E5) has VKT reduction of 19% in MTWs, 5% in Cars and 49% in Buses. Increase in bicycle trips have been estimated to be 5.88 million for Post-COVID scenario as compared to 1.1 million trips estimated for the Pre-COVID Scenario. Similar trend has also been observed for fuel consumption (reduction of 4.7% to 11.8%) and corresponding vehicular emission (reduction of 14 %). This study estimated the potential benefits of providing NMT friendly infrastructure considering the gradual shift influenced by locking/ unlocking phases of COVID pandemic.","Advani, Mukti Sharma Niraj Dhyani Rajni",Transport Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.07.008,31

To discover key molecular changes in HF, we analyzed next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of HF. In this investigation, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using limma in R package from GSE161472 of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, gene enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network construction, and topological analysis were performed on the DEGs by the Gene Ontology (GO), REACTOME pathway, STRING, HiPPIE, miRNet, NetworkAnalyst and Cytoscape. Finally, we performed receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of hub genes. A total of 930 DEGs 9464 up regulated genes and 466 down regulated genes) were identified in HF. GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment results showed that DEGs mainly enriched in localization, small molecule metabolic process, SARS-CoV infections and the citric acid (TCA) cycle and respiratory electron transport. Subsequently, the PPI network, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed, and 10 hub genes in these network were focused on by centrality analysis and module analysis. Furthermore, data showed that HSP90AA1, ARRB2, MYH9, HSP90AB1, FLNA, EGFR, PIK3R1, CUL4A, YEATS4 and KAT2B were good diagnostic values. In summary, this study suggests that HSP90AA1, ARRB2, MYH9, HSP90AB1, FLNA, EGFR, PIK3R1, CUL4A, YEATS4 and KAT2B may act as the key genes in HF.","Vastrad, Basavaraj; Vastrad, Chanabasayya",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.455244,31

The risks of getting infected with the novel coronavirus in Nigeria is high as evident by the increase in the daily number of confirmed cases. Objective: The objectives of this study were to assess the knowledge and risk perception of adult Nigerian population regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey in which five hundred and ten (510) adult participants consented and filled the questionnaire. The questionnaire is divided in to four sections: the first part was directed at the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, the second was dedicated to the assessment of knowledge, the third part assessed risk perception and the fourth section assessed preventive measures. Results: Almost all of the participants (95.9%) claimed to be aware of COVID-19 with majority through the traditional media (55.3%), and social media (41%) while only a small percentage (3.7%) gained the awareness through health officials. Knowledge of COVID-19 was significantly poor among participants with lower level of formal education, (p=0.0001). participants with higher income were found to have a good knowledge of the disease (p<0.00001). being a health worker was not associated with good knowledge of COVID-19 (p=0.00001). Risk perception was significantly high among the females (p=0.044), young adult participants (p=0.039) and healthcare workers (p=0.001). Preventive measures like avoiding eating out (p=0.001) and traveling to high risk areas (p=0.017), wearing face mask (p=0.01) and eating balanced diet (p=0.014) were statistically significant across gender. Conclusion: In general, participants were aware of COVID-19 with a low proportion having a good knowledge about the disease and preventive measures. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.

165220,Responses to covid-19 pandemic in a developing country: A scenario of bangladesh,2021,"Motivation Drug repurposing, where drugs originally approved to treat a disease are reused to treat other diseases, has received escalating attention especially in pandemic years. Structure-based drug design, integrating small molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and AI, has demonstrated its evidenced importance in streamlining new drug development as well as drug repurposing. To perform a sophisticated and fully automated drug screening using all the FDA drugs, intricate programming, accurate drug ranking methods and friendly user interface are very much needed. Results Here we introduce a new web server, DRDOCK, Drug Repurposing DOcking with Conformation-sampling and pose re-ranKing - refined by MD and statistical models, which integrates small molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for automatic drug screening of 2016 FDA-approved drugs over a user-submitted single-chained target protein. The drugs are ranked by a novel drug-ranking scheme using log-odds (LOD) scores, derived from feature distributions of true binders and decoys. Users can submit a selection of LOD-ranked poses for further MD-based binding affinity evaluation. We demonstrated that our platform can indeed recover one of the substrates for nsp16, a cap ribose 2′-O methyltransferase, and recommends that fluralaner, tegaserod and fenoterol could be repurposed for the COVID19 treatment with the latter two being confirmed in SARS-CoV2 suppression experiments. All the sampled docking poses and trajectories can be 3D-viewed and played via our web interface. This platform shall be easy-to-use for general scientists and medicinal researchers to carry out drug repurposing within a couple of days which should add value to our timely responses to, particularly, emergent disease outbreaks.

In recent years, researchers have proposed many excellent crowd counting methods, but these methods still have some problems such as insufficient information obtained in the output density map. Based on it, this paper proposed a crowd counting method based on Spatial Joint Upsampling(SJU). The method uses VGG-16 as the backbone of front-end. Meanwhile the back-end network extracts rich pixel details and spatial context information by adding cascaded joint upsampling model to combine multi-layer high-resolution feature maps, which ultimately have reached the effect of reducing the computational complexity and lifting the accuracy. Experimental results show that SJU has better performance than most crowd counting methods. This method has achieved MAE/MSE of 62.1/99.8 and 7.6/11.5 on the two parts of the public dataset ShanghaiTech A and B, respectively. The MAE/MSE after conducting curriculum learning on this dataset is 61.3/99.2. In addition, this method has also achieved excellent results on the large-scale complex crowd dataset NWPU-Crowd, with a MAE/MSE of 105.1/419.3, indicating that the Spatial Joint Upsampling(SJU) network has outstanding performance in the task of crowd counting in complex scenes.","Ding, X.

Small construction firms are believed to be an engine of growth in many developing countries, including Ghana;thus, their survival cannot be trivialized. This study explored the impact of the COVID-19 on the businesses of the small confirms in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. Open-ended interview questions were distributed via email to 45 small construction firms (D3K3 and D4K4) purposefully selected. Thematic contents analysis was used to analyze 30 interview questions received. Findings: This study has revealed that the COVID-19 has severely affected small construction firms in Ghana. Small construction firms are struggling in their finances;their cash flow/payments for work done are severely affected;they cannot secure contracts and management site efficiently. Their worker's productivity level has dwindled, which has subsequently escalated their project cost and completion time. These effects identified are significantly affecting the survival of these small construction firms. Research limitations/implications: The study included small construction operating in the Central, Western and Greater Accra regions of Ghana during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings may be applicable to construction sites outside these regions. Practical implications: The implication is the COVID-19 pandemic hugely impacts the small construction firm's business operations. Therefore, they must be mindful of the new norm (COVID-19) and institute strategies to help them overcome the challenges and sustain their businesses. Originality/value: The study gives insight into the effects of the COVID-19 on the businesses of small construction firms in Ghana and proposes strategies that they must implement to overcome their challenges and sustain their businesses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Amoah, C.; Bamfo-Agyei, E.; Simpeh, F.",Smart and Sustainable Built Environment,https://doi.org/10.1108/sasbe-02-2021-0025,31
168703,Sample Adequacy Controls for Infectious Disease Diagnosis by Oral Swabbing,2020-07-19,"Previous studies indicate a role of dopamine in hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation. Although neural representations of direction are an important aspect of spatial cognition, it is not well understood whether dopamine directly affects these representations, or only impacts other aspects of spatial brain function. Moreover, both dopamine and spatial cognition decline sharply during age, raising the question which effect dopamine has on directional signals in the brain of older adults. To investigate these questions, we used a double-blind cross-over L-DOPA/Placebo intervention design in which 43 younger and 37 older adults navigated in a virtual spatial environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied the effect of L-DOPA, a DA precursor, on fMRI activation patterns that encode spatial walking directions that have previously been shown to lose specificity with age. This was done in predefined regions of interest, including the early visual cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampus. Classification of brain activation patterns associated with different walking directions was improved in the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex following L-DOPA administration. This suggests that DA enhances the specificity of neural representations of walking direction in these areas. In the hippocampus these results were found in both age groups, while in the RSC they were only observed in younger adults. Taken together, our study provides evidence for a mechanistic link between DA and the specificity of neural responses during spatial navigation. Significance Statement The sense of direction is an important aspect of spatial navigation, and neural representations of direction can be found throughout a large network of space-related brain regions. But what influences how well these representations track someone’s true direction? Using a double-blind cross-over L-DOPA/Placebo intervention design, we find causal evidence that the neurotransmitter dopamine impacts the fidelity of direction selective neural representations in the human hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Interestingly, the effect of L-DOPA was either equally present or even smaller in older adults, despite the well-known age related decline of dopamine. These results provide novel insights into how dopamine shapes the neural representations that underlie spatial navigation.","Koch, Christoph; Bäuchl, Christian; Glöckner, Franka; Riedel, Philipp; Petzold, Johannes; Smolka, Michael; Li, Shu-Chen; Schuck, Nicolas W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456677,31

Five viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae, one to the Caliciviridae, one to the Parvoviridae, and one to the Adenoviridae families were identified. The fraction of reads matching each viral species was then used to estimate and compare viral loads in ICD cases versus healthy controls. None of the eukaryotic viruses detected in fecal swabs were strongly associated with ICD. Other potential causes of ICD are discussed.","Delwart, Eric; Tisza, Michael J.; Altan, Eda; Li, Yanpeng; Deng, Xutao; Hartigan-O’Connor, J.

To develop such a system, it would be necessary to identify physiological indicators of the difficulties, which can be identified by analyzing physiological datasets from people with dementia. However, there is no such data available to researchers. As such, it is vital that data is collected and made available in future. In this paper we perform a review of past physiological data collection experiments conducted with people with dementia and evaluate the methods used at each stage of the experiment. Consideration is also given to the impacts and limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns both on the people with dementia- such people being one of the most at risk and affected groups- and on the efficacy and safety of each of the methods. It is concluded that the choice of method to be utilized in future data collection experiments is heavily dependent on the type and severity of the dementia the participants are experiencing, and that the choice of remote or COVID-secure methods should be used during the COVID-19 pandemic;many of the methods reviewed could allow for the spread of the virus if utilized during a pandemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Harper, M.; Ghali, F.; Hussain, A.; Al-Jumeily, D.","17th International Conference on Intelligent Computing, ICIC 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84532-2_13,31

Five key findings noted: participants used creative strategies to attempt to gain attachment to a PHC provider; and to address their health needs in the absence of a regular PHC provider; participants experienced negative feelings about themselves and the healthcare system; stress related to the added work of being unattached, and health consequences from lost care. These findings may underestimate unattachment consequences for further at-risk populations not represented in the data.

171175,Heparin as an Anti-Inflammatory Agent,2020-07-29,"Background The emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases are driven by complex interactions between health, environmental, and socio-political systems. Human movement is considered a significant and increasing factor in these processes, yet forced migration remains an understudied area of zoonotic research, due in part to the complexity of conducting interdisciplinary research in these settings. Objectives We conducted a systematic review to identify and analyze theoretical frameworks and approaches used to study linkages between forced migration and zoonotic diseases. Methods We searched within eight electronic databases: ProQuest, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, PLoSOne, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Google Scholar, to identify a) research articles focusing on zoonoses considering forced migrants in their study populations, and b) forced migration literature which engaged with zoonotic disease. Both authors conducted a full-text review, evaluating the quality of literature reviews and primary data using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) model, while theoretical papers were evaluated for quality using a theory synthesis adapted from Bonell and Fletcher (2013). Qualitative data were synthesized thematically according to the method suggested by Noblit and Hare (1988). Results Analyses of the 23 included articles showed the increasing use of interdisciplinary frameworks and approaches over time, the majority of which stemmed from political ecology. Approaches such as EcoHealth and One Health were increasingly popular, but were more often linked to program implementation and development than broader contextual research. The majority of research failed to acknowledge the heterogeneity of migrant populations, lacked contextual depth, and insufficient acknowledgement of migrant agency in responding to zoonotic threats. Conclusions Addressing the emergence and spread of zoonoses in forced migration contexts requires more careful consideration and use of interdisciplinary research to integrate the contributions of social and natural science approaches. Robust interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks are an important step for better understanding the complex health, environment, and socio-political drivers of zoonotic diseases in forced migration. Lessons can be learned from the application of these approaches in other hard-to-reach or seldom-heard populations.","Tasker, A.; Braam, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253943v1?rss=1,31
171257,Transcriptional profiling of the Candida auris response to exogenous farnesol exposure,2021-08-24,"COVID-19 population vaccination programs are underway globally. In Australia, the federal government has entered into three agreements for the supply of vaccines, with roll-out beginning for the highest priority groups in February 2021. Expansion of the vaccination program throughout February and March failed to meet government targets and this has been attributed to international supply issues. However, Australia has local capacity to manufacture one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine weekly and once fully operational this will greatly increase the national vaccination capacity. Under current plans, these vaccine doses will be distributed primarily through a network of general practices, to be joined in later phases by community pharmacies. It remains unclear whether these small distribution venues have the logistical capacity to administer vaccines at the rate they will become available. To inform this discussion, we applied stochastic queue network models to estimate the capacity of vaccination sites based on assumptions about appointment schedules, service times and available staff numbers. We specified distinct queueing models for two delivery modes: (i) mass vaccination hubs located in hospitals or sports arenas and (ii) smaller clinics situated in general practices or community pharmacies. Based on our assumed service times, the potential daily throughput for an eight hour clinic at a mass vaccination hub ranged from around 500 vaccinations for a relatively small hub to 1,400 vaccinations a day for a relatively large hub. For GP vaccination clinics, the estimated daily throughput ranged from about 100 vaccinations a day for a relatively small practice to almost 300 a day for a relatively large practice. Stress tests showed that for both delivery modes, sites with higher staff numbers were more robust to system pressures, such as increased arrivals or staff absences, and mass vaccination sites were more robust that GP clinics. Our analysis is accompanied by an interactive web-based queue simulation applet, which allows users to explore queue performance under their own assumptions regarding appointments, service times and staff availability. Different vaccine delivery modes offer distinct benefits and may be particularly appealing to specific population segments. A combination of expanded mass vaccination hubs and expanded GP vaccination is likely to achieve mass vaccination faster than either mode alone.","Hanly, M.

We present an algorithm for this problem such that the algorithm is allowed to take diminishing time and space to solve the problem by setting the indexed genes with an incremental number. Although an incremental number of indexed genes were selected, the algorithm was verified definite to reach a solution whose length insistently comes very close to a real longest common exemplar subsequence of the two given genomes. Aiming at 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs, the algorithm was examined for use in questing for longest common exemplar subsequences whose basic units are annotated genes as well as pseudo genes, namely consecutive DNA subsequences. By contrasting the pseudo gene common exemplar subsequences the algorithm had reached for the human chromosomes 7 and 16 and their gorilla homologues with those annotated genes in the human and gorilla chromosomes, we found more than 1 000 and 500 pseudo genes in the human chromosomes 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the gorilla chromosomes 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene. Author summary There is a benefit of the algorithm: It can reach a long enough common exemplar subsequence of two linear genomes in as fast a speed as one requires even if the given genomes would be equipped with too many duplicated genes, which can be done by setting incremental number of indexed genes. We developed a Java software based on the algorithm, that has been available for download on https://github.com/ShuZhang-sdu/LCES. Only in need to set the indexed gene sequences as null, was it verified successful for our algorithm to obtain the longest common exemplar subsequences of the annotated gene summary pairs extracted from 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs. In convenience for researchers to find new motifs or conserved genes, we devoted for the algorithm to quest pseudo gene (i.e. consecutive DNA subsequences) summary pairs of the 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs for solutions. There are 20 pseudo gene summary pairs whose longest common exemplar subsequences have been found by the algorithm with null indexed gene sequences. The other 3 pseudo gene summary pairs were verified solvable for the algorithm to reach their longest common exemplar subsequences that have to admit subsequences identical to given indexed gene subsequences. There were informed to exist 2 353 and 1 148 pseudo genes in the gorilla chromosome 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the human chromosome 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene.

And CLI reflects the local manifestations of a lethal systemic disease - atherosclerosis. If left untreated, chronic limb ischemia can result in major limb loss. In this pandemic era, limb ischemia has become one of several clinical manifestations that occur in patients with COVID-19 infection. Systemic inflammation in COVID-19 infection, direct viral infection, hypercoagulable state, and hyperinflammatory response are responsible for damage to the arterial system, causing endothelial dysfunction. Diagnosing PAD has become a challenge especially in the early stage and in the asymptomatic phase. The untreated condition could lead to the development of CLI. The primary physicians in the primary health facilities hold an important role in the early diagnosis and management of patients with CLI symptoms or with risk factors of CLI, especially in patients who have experienced COVID-19 infection. Due to the limitation of diagnostic testing modalities at primary health facilities, the physician can assess the ankle-brachial index (ABI) to determine the presence of CLI. Management of the disease is different for every patient and is customized based on the other comorbidities. Risk factors should be controlled in order to achieve a better outcome. A good management strategy will improve the quality of life of the patient. This review will discuss the occurrence of CLI in COVID-19 infection.","Laksono, S.; Siregar, R.

ARMA-GARCH models have better forecasting power and are capable of capturing and quantifying volatility. Bootstrap prediction intervals can account for future uncertainty that arises through parameter estimation. The monthly international tourism data obtained from the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) (January 2000 to June 2017) is neither seasonal nor stationary and is made stationery by taking a logarithm transformation. An ARMA(1,1) model fits well to the data;with forecasts indicating a slow increase in international tourist arrivals (outside of the Covid-19 period). The GARCH(1,1) process indicated that unexpected tourism shocks will significantly impact the Zimbabwe international tourist arrivals for longer durations.

The virus is spreading rapidly around the world. Therefore, we crucially need quick diagnostic tests to identify affected patients and to minimize the spread of the virus. With the advancements of Machine Learning, the detection of Covid-19 in the early stage would facilitate taking precautions as early as possible. However, because of the lack of data-sets, especially chest X-ray images of Covid-19 affected patients, it has become challenging to detect this disease. In this paper, a deep transfer learning-based pre-trained model is named VGG16 along with adapt histogram equalization has been developed to diagnose Covid-19 by using X-ray images. An image processing technique named adaptive histogram equalization has been used to generate more images by using the existing data set. It can be observed that VGG-16 provides the highest accuracy which is 98.75% in comparison to two other pre-trained models such as VGG-19 and Mobilnenet-V2(97% accuracy for VGG-19, 92.65% accuracy for Mobilenet-V2).","Progga, N.

174515,DICE: Deep Significance Clustering for Outcome-Driven Stratification,2020-10-04,"Timor-Leste is one of the world's most malnourished nations where micronutrient-deficient diets are a contributing factor to the prevalence of child stunting, currently estimated to be 45.6% of children under five. Fish are an important source of micronutrients and one that may assist the country's predominantly rural population of agriculturalists to exit poverty and malnutrition. However, a small national fishing fleet producing low catch volumes place fish out of reach of most inland and upland populations where it is needed most. Fish consumption is very low in rural areas compared to coastal, regional, and global averages. This trial is a one-year, cluster-randomized, partially masked, controlled trial among families living in rural, inland Timor-Leste. This trial aims to test and compare the effects of two treatments, alone and in combination, on the frequency and volume of household fish consumption in upland areas as a proxy for improved dietary diversity and micronutrient intake. Treatment 1 is the installation of nearshore, moored fish aggregating devices (FADs) to improve catch rates with existing fishing gears. Treatment 2 is social and behaviour change (SBC) activities to promote fish consumption. Villages in inland communities will be randomized to receive treatment 1, treatment 2, both treatments, or neither treatment. Some households with one child under five will be recruited, and data will be collected at baseline (prior to the rollout of the treatments) and endline. Our study will determine the impact of an improved supply of fish, along with nutrition-oriented SBC activities, on the fish purchasing and consumption practices of rural, inland households. Findings from this study are urgently needed by small island developing states in order to make policy and investment decisions on how best to improve households' diets using locally available, nutrient-dense foods such as fish. Investments such as these are needed to break the cycle of malnutrition.","Tilley, A.; Byrd, K.

175315,"Genome-Wide Association Study of Estradiol Levels, and the Causal Effect of Estradiol on Bone Mineral Density",2021-07-05,"Systemic infections, especially in patients with chronic diseases, result in sepsis: an explosive, uncoordinated immune response that can lead to multisystem organ failure with a high mortality rate. Sepsis survivors and non-survivors oftentimes have similar clinical phenotypes or sepsis biomarker expression upon diagnosis, suggesting that the dynamics of sepsis in the critical early stage may have an impact on these opposite outcomes. To investigate this, we designed a within-subject study of patients with systemic gram-negative bacterial sepsis with surviving and fatal outcomes and performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected during the critical period between sepsis recognition and 6 hours. We observed that the largest sepsis-induced expression changes over time in surviving versus fatal sepsis were in CD14+ monocytes, including gene signatures previously reported for sepsis outcomes. We further identify changes in the metabolic pathways of both monocytes and platelets, the emergence of erythroid precursors, and T cell exhaustion signatures, with the most extreme differences occurring between the non-sepsis control and the sepsis non-survivor. Our single-cell observations are consistent with trends from public datasets but also reveal specific effects in individual immune cell populations, which change within hours. In conclusion, this pilot study provides the first single-cell results with a repeated measures design in sepsis to analyze the temporal changes in the immune cell population behavior in surviving or fatal sepsis. These findings indicate that tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell-types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes. We also identify molecular pathways that could be therapeutically controlled to improve the sepsis trajectory toward better outcomes.","Qiu, X.; Li, J.; Bonenfant, J.; Klein, W.; Jaroszewski, L.; Godzik, A.; Nair, M.

176118,A hypothetical design to inhibit COVID 19 disease disaster by diagrammatic model,2021,"Novel influenza strains to which humans have no pre-existing immunity can trigger global pandemics without warning. Current pandemic vaccines typically require two doses and up to 6 weeks to induce protective immunity. In addition, to their role in increasing vaccine-induced immune response, adjuvants may also play a part in reducing the time between immunization and vaccine protection, although this role has seldom been previously explored in literature. This study assessed the speed of protection achievable with a standard inactivated influenza vaccine when formulated with or without a novel delta-inulin adjuvant (Advax). When formulated with Advax adjuvant mice were protected even when the vaccine was administered intramuscularly contemporaneously with a lethal intranasal virus challenge. The protection was found to be B-cell dependent and transfer of day 6 immune serum from mice immunised with Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine conferred protection to naïve animals. This protection was shown to be mediated by vaccine induced IgM rather than IgG neutralising antibodies. The results show that influenza vaccine can be formulated to provide immediate protection following immunization with this novel concept warranting testing in human trials. IMPORTANCE In the past 100 years there have been several major influenza pandemics that resulted in significant loss of life. The time taken for individuals to develop vaccine protection is an important factor in curbing the spread of infection and reducing pandemic mortality rates. Current influenza vaccines can take up to 5-6 weeks to generate full protection leaving front-line heath care workers and others, at risk for an extended period of time. Our novel accelerated vaccine protection approach provides effectively immediate vaccine protection against lethal virus challenge. This would assist front-line workers to continue to provide essential services and maintain critical infrastructure during pandemic. The study also highlights the often-overlooked role that antigen-specific IgM plays in virus protection and provides a novel adjuvanted strategy for enlisting IgM to provide accelerated vaccine protection.","Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Li, Lei; Baldwin, Jeremy; Petrovsky, Nikolai",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431751,31
177300,Durability and Cross-Reactivity of Immune Responses Induced by an AS03 Adjuvanted Plant-Based Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for COVID-19,2021-08-09,"Decisions to adhere to health-protective behaviors (e.g. mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.) that impact the spread of COVID-19 are not made in isolation by each individual. They are instead the result of the social construction of perceived risks and resulting community norms. In populations in which disease is unlikely to spread throughout all communities simultaneously, community-driven perception of risk can drastically alter collective outcomes. A community could respond to a few infections by becoming fearful and adopting anticipatory behaviors that protect them from disease spread. Similarly, there could be false reassurance, in which low disease incidence over time leads to community consensus that protective actions are unnecessary (even if they are the reason cases remains rare). We therefore model COVID-19 spread with three synergistic dynamics governing individual behavioral choices: (1) Social construction of concern, (2) Awareness of disease incidence, and (3) Reassurance by lack of disease. We use a multiplex network approach that captures social communication and epidemiological spread. We find that effective protective policies enacted too early may backfire by allowing a community to become reassured and therefore unwilling to adopt or maintain further protective behaviors. Based on these insights, we propose that public health policies for which success relies on collective action should be designed to exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern as to foster adoption of novel protective behaviors and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.","Silk, M.

Juggling work from home and childcare has led to maternal burn out and depression.ObjectivesThe aim of the present study was to assess maternal burn-out rate during lockdown and its eventual relationship with depression and associated factorsMethods156 Tunisian mothers responded to online questionnaire posted on social network after 1 month of lockdown. The questionnaire evaluated burnout and depression as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and depression and anxiety symptoms (HADS) respectively.ResultsThe participants were aged between 24 and 64 years and 61.5% had more than one child. Mean score on the BMS10 was 4.11 out of 7 maximum score with 71.8% of participants fulfilling criteria for maternal burn-out. Among them, 30.1% had high level of burn out and 9.6% extreme burn out. The main factors associated with maternal burn out were age of children, financial difficulties and lack of leisure activities. Mother’s age, perceived husband support, medical or psychiatric history haven’t been associated with maternal burn out. HADS questionnaire indicated that 38.5% of mothers had moderate to severe anxiety disorder and 35,9% had moderate to severe depressive disorder. A postive correlation was found between burnout and anxiety (r=0.634, p<0.001) and burn out and depression (r=0.515, p<0.001).ConclusionsThe prevalence of maternal burn out during lockdown was significantly high resulting in higher rate of depression than ususal. However, severe forms of burnout may share several characteristics with depression raising the question of overlap of these two entities.","Bergaoui, E.; Lansari, R.; Karmous, A.; Larnaout, A.; Melki, W.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.701,31

Indoor locations have higher adherence of appropriately worn face masks, compared to outdoor locations. What are the implications for public health practice? Adherence with face mask mandates was very high, but many individuals wore fabric face masks with unknown filtration efficacy. In addition, it was common for individuals to mis-wear, adjust, or remove their masks. Public health policies requiring mask use should include messaging about appropriate type and best practices for use.","McLane, MPH; M., Casey; MS, S. M.; Gallagher, A.; Ohemeng-Tinyase, M.

However, fundamental value drivers of companies do not change drastically during pandemics. The sensitivity of firms' cash flows to lockdowns during pandemics depends on their cost structure. This paper develops a financial model incorporating information about value drivers and lockdown sensitivity of companies to find the enterprise value. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a financial model that estimates the effects of COVID-19 on enterprise value and helps to identify wrongly valued stocks. The authors apply the model to five Indian stocks from five different industries to study how firms belonging to various sectors get affected differently in this pandemic. Findings Companies belonging to civil aviation and retail sectors get more affected by COVID-19 compared to those in movie exhibition, automobile and hotel industries. The cost structure of the latter category of firms reduces their cash flow effect. Practical implications The model can be used by practitioners to understand any pandemic's effect on stock prices. Also, it explains how firms having different cost structures get affected by any crisis and help investors in taking appropriate buy/sell decisions. Originality/value The study has two contributions: first, the authors develop a financial model to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on the enterprise value.

Materials and methods. Two stages of patient management were compared: before and after the start of a widespread use of oral anticoagulants (OAC). The incidence of pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal bleeding during the compared time periods was analyzed to assess the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants. To assess the cost-effectiveness, we compared the cost of anticoagulants per day of treatment and per patient. Results. The incidence of pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal bleeding did not differ during the compared time periods.

183835,Glucocorticoids inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and prevent virus-potentiated extravasation in the rat trachea.,1990,"We highlight changes to cell signaling under virus invasion (with the example of SARS-CoV-2), involving disturbance of membranes (plasma, mitochondrial, endothelial-alveolar) and of nanodomains, modulated by the cytoskeleton. Virus alters the mechanical properties of the membranes, impairing mesophase structures mediated by the fractal architecture initiated by actomyosin. It changes the topology of the membrane and its lipid composition distribution. Mechano-transduction, self-organization and topology far from equilibrium are omnipresent. We propose that the actomyosin contractility generates the cytoskeletons fractal organization. We focus on three membranar processus: The transition from lamellar configuration in cell and viral membranes to a bi-continuous organization in the presence of ethanolamine. (The energy for this transition is provided by change of the folding of the viral fusion protein from metastable to stable state). The action of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein on the external mitochondrial envelope in contact with mitochondrial-associated membranes, modi¯ed by viral endoribonuclease, distorting innate immune response. The increased permeability of the epithelial-alveolar-pulmonary barrier involves the cytoskeleton membranes. The pulmonary surfactant is also perturbed in its liquid crystal state. Viral subversion disorganizes membrane structure and functions and thus the metabolism of the cell. We advocate systematic multidisciplinary exploration of membrane mesophases and their links with fractal dynamics, to enable novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Binot, C.; Sadoc, J.

184391,Psychological stress and susceptibility to the common cold.,1991,"Rhabdomeric Opsins (r-Opsins) are light-sensors in cephalic eye photoreceptors, but also function in additional sensory organs. This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-Opsins cells were non-photosensory. Our profiling of cephalic and non-cephalic r-opsin1-expressing cells of the marine bristleworm Platynereis dumerilii reveals shared and distinct features. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. We determine that Pdu-r-Opsin1 is a Gαq-coupled blue-light receptor. Profiling of cells from r-opsin1 mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells, light – mediated by r-Opsin1 – adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements, and identify a light-and r-Opsin-1-dependent fine-tuning of the worm’s undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results suggest an evolutionary concept in which r-Opsins act as ancient, light-dependent modulators of mechanosensation, and suggest that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-Opsins likely evolved secondarily.","Revilla-i-Domingo, Roger; Veedin Rajan, Vinoth Babu; Waldherr, Monika; Prohaczka, Günther; Musset, Hugo; Orel, Lukas; Gerrard, Elliot; Smolka, Moritz; Farlik, Matthias; Lucas, Robert J.; Raible, Florian; Tessmar-Raible, Kristin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.10.426124,31

To fight this disease, a global effort led to the development of several vaccines at an unprecedented rate. There have been, however, several logistic issues with its deployment, from their production and transport, to the hesitancy of the population to be vaccinated. For different reasons, an important amount of individuals is reluctant to get the vaccine, something that hinders our ability to control and - eventually - eradicate the disease. In this work, we analyze the impact that this hesitancy might have in a context in which a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern spreads through a partially vaccinated population. We use age-stratified data from surveys on vaccination acceptance, together with age-contact matrices to inform an age-structured SIR model set in the US. Our results clearly show that higher vaccine hesitancy ratios led to larger outbreaks. A closer inspection of the stratified infection rates also reveals the important role played by the youngest groups. Our results could shed some light on the role that hesitancy will play in the near future and inform policy-makers and the general public of the importance of reducing it.","Arribas, A. d.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the value of YouTube can be explained by Korean students’ learning needs and practice. This qualitative study attempts to add a new dimension to possible ways of using YouTube for educational purposes. Focusing on narratives of first-year Korean international students studying in the U.S., this study examines the ways in which using YouTube contributes to students’ linguistic and cultural diversity. Findings reveal that YouTube helps expand students’ perspectives on cross-cultural understanding. The educational use of YouTube also leads students to academic pursuits and engagement during studying abroad by developing content knowledge and skills in English. It further enables students to enhance their knowledge of English as a global language by taking ownership. Ultimately, YouTube plays an indispensable role in supporting Korean international students’ academic and social progress in the transitional phase from their home to host countries. From these findings, and in response to the post-COVID era, the implications for the new normal in education using social networking sites, YouTube in particular, are discussed for effective multilingual and multicultural education in South Korea.","Kim, Sumi Hyeon-Cheol Kim",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137365,31
184599,Studies from emerging countries: an encouraging development.,2007,"Real data often appear in the form of multiple incomplete views. Incomplete multi-view clustering is an effective method to integrate these incomplete views. Previous methods only learn the consistent information between different views and ignore the unique information of each view, which limits their clustering performance and generalizations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel View Variation and View Heredity approach (V3H). Inspired by the variation and the heredity in genetics, V3H first decomposes each subspace into a variation matrix for the corresponding view and a heredity matrix for all the views to represent the unique information and the consistent information respectively. Then, by aligning different views based on their cluster indicator matrices, V3H integrates the unique information from different views to improve the clustering performance. Finally, with the help of the adjustable low-rank representation based on the heredity matrix, V3H recovers the underlying true data structure to reduce the influence of the large incompleteness. More importantly, V3H presents possibly the first work to introduce genetics to clustering algorithms for learning simultaneously the consistent information and the unique information from incomplete multi-view data. Extensive experimental results on fifteen benchmark datasets validate its superiority over other state-of-the-arts.","Fang, Xiang; Hu, Yuchong; Zhou, Pan; Wu, Dapeng Oliver",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11194v3.pdf,31

We also assess their perceived stress and health challenges experienced since WFH. On average, workers perceive that productivity and meaning changed in opposite directions with the shift to WFH—productivity increased while the meaning derived from daily activities decreased. Stress was reduced while health problems increased. By investigating these changes, we identify important common sources of support and friction associated with remote work that affect multiple dimensions of work and life. For example, personal fortitude is an important source of support, and the intrusion of work into life is an important friction. Our findings lead to concrete recommendations for both organizational leaders and workers in setting key priorities for supporting remote work. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","George, T. J.; Atwater, L.

Since hospitals and health centers are used as vaccination centers, collecting people in one place can lead to the spread of other diseases. Therefore, the use of temporary vaccination clinics is encouraged for mass vaccination. In this study, the number of temporary clinics that need to be placed in candidate locations and the regions they serve are investigated. While the weights of the candidate places are determined by a single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy multi criteria decision-making method, the temporary vaccination clinics are assigned to the candidate locations via savings heuristic.

185539,[Effects of use of riboflavin and ultraviolet light for pathogen inactivation on quality of platelet concentrates].,2011,"Background: Several risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) have been described, some of which are genetically determined. The use of a polygenic risk score (PRS) could improve CAD risk assessment, but predictive accuracy according to age and sex is not well established. Methods: A PRSCAD including the weighted effects of >1.14 million SNPs associated with CAD was calculated in UK Biobank (n=408,422), using LDPred. Cox regressions were performed, stratified by age quartiles and sex, for incident MI and mortality, with a median follow-up of 11.0 years. Improvement in risk prediction of MI was assessed by comparing PRSCAD to the pooled cohort equation with categorical net reclassification index using a 2% threshold (NRI0.02) and continuous NRI (NRI>0). Results: From 7,746 incident MI cases and 393,725 controls, hazard ratio (HR) for MI reached 1.53 (95% CI [1.49-1.56], p=2.69e-296) per standard deviation (SD) increase of PRSCAD. PRSCAD was significantly associated with MI in both sexes, with a stronger association in men (interaction p=0.002), particularly in those aged between 40-51 years (HR=2.00, 95% CI [1.86-2.16], p=1.93e-72). This group showed the highest reclassification improvement, mainly driven by the up-classification of cases (NRI0.02=0.199, 95% CI [0.157-0.248] and NRI>0=0.602, 95% CI [0.525-0.683]). From 23,982 deaths, HR for mortality was 1.08 (95% CI [1.06-1.09], p=5.46e-30) per SD increase of PRSCAD, with a stronger association in men (interaction p=1.60e-6). Conclusion: Our PRSCAD predicts MI incidence and all-cause mortality, especially in men aged between 40-51 years. PRS could optimize the identification and management of individuals at risk for CAD.","Manikpurage, H. D.; Eslami, A.; Perrot, N.; Li, Z.; Couture, C.; Mathieu, P.; Bosse, Y.; Arsenault, B.

Severely deranged vital signs can identify critical illness, are simple to check and treatments that aim to correct derangements are established, basic and low-cost. The aim of the study was to estimate the unmet need of essential treatments for severely deranged vital signs in all adults admitted to hospitals in Malawi. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with follow-up of adult hospitalized patients in Malawi. All in-patients aged [≥]18 on single days Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and Chiradzulu District Hospital (CDH) were screened. . Patients with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <90%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90mmHg) and reduced conscious level (Glasgow Coma Score <9) were included in the study. The a-priori defined essential treatments were oxygen therapy for hypoxia, intravenous fluid for hypotension and an action to protect the airway for reduced consciousness (placing the patient in the lateral position, insertion of an oro-pharyngeal airway or endo-tracheal tube or manual airway protection). Results Of the 1135 hospital in-patients screened, 45 (4.0%) had hypoxia, 103 (9.1%) had hypotension, and 17 (1.5%) had a reduced conscious level. Of those with hypoxia, 40 were not receiving oxygen (88.9%). Of those with hypotension, 94 were not receiving intravenous fluids (91.3%).

186368,Parechovirus and enterovirus infections in neonates.,2019,"AIM: The present study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of the β-coronaviruses wages a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding atypical pneumonia being the primary symptom, the emergence of severe disease mainly resulting from the injury of non-pulmonary organs leaves no alternative, in some cases, other than a dreadful death. METHODS: To provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint representing the prognostic values of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed with the calculation of mean difference and 95% conﬁdence intervals of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Bili), and albumin (Alb) in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: While severe COVID-19 cases displayed higher values of ALT, AST, and Bili compared to non-severe patients (mean differences of 7.48, 12.07, and 3.07, respectively), the value of Alb was significantly lower in severe cases (mean differences of -6.15). There was also a correlation between alterations in all of the parameters; however, only correlations between ALT and Bili (R=0.98, p=0.0031), and Bili and Alb (R=-1, p=0.0012) were significant. CONCLUSION: Abnormal values of liver-related examinations outwardly contribute to reflect the progression of the disease toward an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, careful scrutiny of these parameters will provide clinicians with invaluable information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least in terms of liver injury.","Bashash, Davood; Olfatifar, Meysam; Hadaegh, Farzad; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682969/,31
186653,Endoscopic treatment of obesity.,2016,"Based solely on in vitro results, two contrasting models have been proposed for the recognition of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) subgenomic core promoter by the replicase. The first posits that the replicase recognizes at least four key nucleotides in the core promoter, followed by an induced fit, wherein some of the nucleotides base pair prior to the initiation of RNA synthesis (S. Adkins and C. C. Kao, Virology 252:1-8, 1998). The second model posits that a short RNA hairpin in the core promoter serves as a landing pad for the replicase and that at least some of the key nucleotides help form a stable hairpin (P. C. J. Haasnoot, F. Brederode, R. C. L. Olsthoorn, and J. Bol, RNA 6:708-716, 2000; P. C. J. Haasnoot, R. C. L. Olsthoorn, and J. Bol, RNA 8:110-122, 2002). We used transfected barley protoplasts to examine the recognition of the subgenomic core promoter by the BMV replicase. Key nucleotides required for subgenomic initiation in vitro were found to be important for RNA4 levels in protoplasts. In addition, additional residues not required in vitro and the formation of an RNA hairpin within the core promoter were correlated with wild-type RNA4 levels in cells. Using a template competition assay, the core promoter of ca. 20 nucleotides was found to be sufficient for replicase binding. Mutations of the key residues in the core promoter reduced replicase binding, but deletions that disrupt the predicted base pairing in the proposed stem retained binding at wild-type levels. Together, these results indicate that key nucleotides in the BMV subgenomic core promoter direct replicase recognition but that the formation of a stem-loop is required at a step after binding. Additional functional characterization of the subgenomic core promoter was performed. A portion of the promoter for BMV minus-strand RNA synthesis could substitute for the subgenomic core promoter in transfected cells. The comparable sequence from Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) could also substitute for the BMV subgenomic core promoter. However, nucleotides in the CCMV core required for RNA synthesis are not identical to those in BMV, suggesting that the subgenomic core promoter can induce the BMV replicase in interactions needed for subgenomic RNA transcription in vivo.","Sivakumaran, K; Choi, Seung-Kook; Hema, Masarapu; Kao, C Cheng",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15163702/,31

Electron microscopic examination revealed herpesviral particles within the lesions. Paraffin-embedded skin and tongue tissues were processed in a polymerase chain reaction, using primers to amplify a 306-bp region of the thymidine kinase gene of feline herpesvirus type 1, resulting in a distinct amplification product of the predicted size. The distribution of feline herpesvirus was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization. Positive immunostaining was found in nuclei and cytoplasm of numerous epithelial cells within and next to the lesions, whereas in situ hybridization, performed with a digoxigenin-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, revealed hybridization signal only in nuclei of intact epithelial cells.

188375,Surrogate viruses for testing virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants.,2004,"By reviewing the most significant zoonotic disease outbreaks that have occurred mostly during the past ten years, the author provides a clear idea of how varied these diseases can be in regard to their aetiological agent, size and direct impact on public health. Most examples involve emerging zoonotic diseases caused by viruses and prions and transmitted to humans by a bite, close contact with affected live animals or carcasses, or through the consumption of their tissues. These outbreaks vary from very small and localised clusters of individual cases to millions of deaths, as reported during the past influenza pandemics. The author also shows that even for the larger outbreaks, the direct impact on public health measured by the morbidity and mortality of zoonoses is largely inferior to that of major communicable diseases that affect only humans, particularly human tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS. However, it is very difficult to predict the outcome on public health of these emerging zoonotic diseases since transmission patterns are not always sufficiently understood to assess this impact accurately. In addition, new modes of agent transmission may compound the initial impact on public health. Finally, the author indicates additional reasons that explain why these diseases are important by placing special emphasis on the financial losses recorded in both human and animal health and also the societal non-monetary losses these diseases can incur. Lessons learnt following major crises generated by the emergence of zoonotic diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, are provided.","Meslin, F X",Veterinaria italiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20429071/,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS A microwire was selectively placed in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 16 consecutives rats during 90 minutes occlusion. Longitudinal 7-T MR imaging, including angiography, diffusion, and perfusion was performed during ischemia, immediately after reperfusion, 3 h and 24 h after subsequent reperfusion. RESULTS MCA occlusion was complete in 75 % and partial in 18.7 %. Hypoperfusion (mean ± SD) was observed in all animals during ischemia (-59 ± 18 % of contralateral hemisphere, area 31 ± 5 mm2). Infarction volume (mean ± SD) was 90 ± 64 mm3 during ischemia and 57 ± 67 mm3 at 24 h. Brain infarction was fronto-parietal cortical in five animals (31 %), striatal in four animals (25 %), and cortico-striatal in seven animals (44 %) at 24 h. All rats survived at 24 h. CONCLUSION This model is suitable to neuroprotection studies because of possible acute and close characterization of spatiotemporal evolution of brain infarction by MR imaging techniques, and evidence of ischemic penumbra, the target of neuroprotection agents. However, optimization of the brain infarct reproducibility needs further technical and neurointerventional tools improvements.

Total yield and biological efficiency of the mushroom cultivated on substrate containing 20% and 30% vegetable wastes mixed with 70% and 80% (w/w) of paddy straw was found to be better, when compared with yield and efficiency obtained with paddy straw alone (100%). The protein content in the fruit bodies was found to be higher in the mushroom grown on paddy straw mixed with vegetable wastes than that obtained with paddy straw alone. Similarly, six amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, Met and Phe) showed a significant increase when the mushroom was grown on a mixed substrate containing both vegetable wastes and paddy straw. On the contrary, the total sugar and reducing sugar content declined in the mushroom grown on the mixture of paddy straw and other wastes, when compared with the results obtained with paddy straw alone.","Singh, M P; Singh, V K",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273184/,31
190192,[Hemagglutination inhibition test for the diagnosis of coronavirus infection in cattle].,1986,"The association between exposure to Haemophilus somnus and Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly Pasteurella haemolytica) and the risk of undifferentiated bovine respiratory disease (UBRD) was investigated using serological evidence of exposure coupled with a factorial design vaccine field trial. Measures of previous exposure (titer at arrival) and current exposure (titer increase in the study period) to these agents were used. The vaccine field trial involved systematic allocation of animals into groups that received either a M. haemolytica vaccine, an H. somnus vaccine, a combined M. haemolytica and H. somnus vaccine, and an unvaccinated control group. Serum was collected from the 852 animals enrolled to determine titers to H. somnus, M. haemolytica, bovine coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Vaccination with H. somnus in combination with M. haemolytica and with M. haemolytica alone reduced the risk of UBRD. The odds ratio for vaccination with H. somnus alone and UBRD risk suggested some sparing effect, but the 95% confidence limits included unity. There was no association between serological evidence of concurrent exposure to M. haemolytica and UBRD occurrence. There was an association between titer change to H. somnus and UBRD risk. However, the association changed with time of BRD treatment; animals diagnosed and treated for UBRD on or after day 10 showed little evidence of exposure to H. somnus, despite evidence of natural H. somnus exposure in the unvaccinated group. The association between titer change to H. somnus and UBRD occurrence seen in this study may be a consequence of prolonged exposure to antibiotics, rather than a causal association.","O'Connor, A; Martin, S W; Harland, R; Shewen, P; Menzies, P",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11480518/,31
190285,Are there characteristics of infectious diseases that raise special ethical issues?,2004,"There have been many advances in the perfusion equipment used for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. A key component, the membrane oxygenator, has had a number of modifications in recent years and a recent clinical evaluation demonstrated disparity in various aspects of device performance. One difference among oxygenators, which to-date has received little attention, was the impact on the patient's immune cells, with some oxygenators producing a significantly greater increase in immune cell numbers after cross clamp. Such increases in immune cell proliferation may contribute to the development of a systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on patient outcomes. Although factors contributing to immune cell proliferation during CPB are recognized to be multi-factorial, the goal of the current communication was to perform an ad hoc analysis of these raw data for evidence that pressure gradients through an oxygenator contributes to this outcome. Despite the observation that higher-pressure gradient oxygenators appeared to associate with increased immune cell proliferation, no correlation was detected in this analysis. This finding, however, provides further evidence for the complex nature of inflammation during CPB, which deserves ongoing discussion and investigation.","Stanzel, Roger D P; Henderson, Mark",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28979039/,31

Serologic prevalence was high for murine cytomegalovirus (99%, n = 94), murine coronavirus (95%), and murine rotavirus (74%). Samples from mice collected at all sites contained antibody to these viruses. The serologic prevalence was lower for mouse adenovirus, strain K87 (37%), parvovirus (33%), and reovirus type 3 (28%), with substantial site-to-site variation. Plasma from mice collected at 12 sites contained mouse adenovirus or reovirus antibody, and samples from mice at eight sites contained parvovirus antibody. Parvovirus-antibody positive mice were typically from high density populations or from low density populations that had recently declined from high density. Antibody to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Sendai virus occurred at only three sites, and the serologic prevalence was very low (9.6% and 1.8%, respectively). All of the LCMV-positive mice were from northeastern New South Wales. The presence of this zoonotic virus in a mouse plague-prone region raises questions about human health risks resulting from cohabitation with large numbers of mice. It appeared that mouse populations at high density or declining from high density had higher prevalence of viral antibody than populations that had been at low or moderate density for some time. Thus, viral epizootics may occur among high-density populations and may be responsible for or precipitate declines in mouse density. These data raise the possibility of rodent viruses having potential as biological control agents.","Smith, A L; Singleton, G R; Hansen, G M; Shellam, G",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8487371/,31

The 14C labelled bovine enteric coronavirus was grown on HRT18 cell monolayers and purified. Virus adsorption was studied in relation to pH: optimal adsorption yield--between 50 to 75% (mean value: 62%)--was obtained at pH less than or equal to 3.5. Elution was made comparatively with a 0.05 M glycine solution and a 3% beef extract solution. Virus elution occurred mostly at alkaline pH with a maximum yield between 38 and 55% for pH values between 9 and 11. Owing to the sensitivity of coronavirus to acid (pH 3) and alkaline pH (pH greater than or equal to 10), adsorption was optimal at pH 3.3 and elution at pH 9. Under such conditions, the overall efficiency of the method appears to stand between 24 and 28%.","Collomb, J; Laporte, J; Vautherot, J F; Schwartzbrod, L",Virologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3727400/,31

The distribution of the segregating sites is not steady,the most variable region appears in S1 protein,and the nucleotide sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has very few mutation sites. The substitution bias of nucleotide acids and amino acids indicates the non-random drift products. The comparison of genome structures of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses shows that SARS-CoV and IBV share the same genome structure. Phylogenetic analyses of conserved genes of coronaviruses indicate that SARS-CoV is a new branch of coronaviruses and appears more close to the group II coronaviruses. Interestingly,SARS-CoV shares some different features with different groups of coronaviruses. Additional analyses show that the first ORFs between S and E genes of some coronaviruses are transmembrane proteins and share the common motif,indicating the possible common ancestor. From the host distribution of different groups of coronaviruses and the phylogeny of s2m,we can deduce that avian is the probable natural host of SARS-CoV.","Wu, Song-Feng; Du, Chun-Juan; Wan, Ping; Chen, Ting-Gui; Li, Jian-Qi; Li, Dong; Zeng, Yan-Jun; Zhu, Yun-Ping; He, Fu-Chu",Yi chuan = Hereditas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15639891/,31

195158,Hepatobiliary pathology.,2007,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel human coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV, is a highly contagious respiratory disease with the lungs as a major target. Although the exact mechanism of SARS-CoV pathogenesis remains unknown, an intense, ill-regulated local inflammatory response has been suggested as partially responsible for the devastating lung pathology. We investigated the interaction of SARS-CoV with human macrophages (Mphi) and dendritic cells (DC), two key innate immune cells of the host immune system, by focusing on their susceptibility to viral infection and subsequent responses (e.g., phenotypic maturation, T cell-priming activity, phagocytosis, and cytokine production). We found neither cell to be permissive for SARS-CoV replication. However, incubation of Mphi and DC with live, but not gamma irradiation-inactivated, viruses appeared to better sustain their viability. Also, exposure to infectious SARS-CoV led to the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC, with regard to MHC class II and costimulatory molecule expression, T cell-stimulatory capacity, and cytokine production, respectively. Cytokine production was also observed for Mphi, which were refractory to cell surface phenotypic changes. Strikingly, live SARS-CoV could further prime cell types to respond to a suboptimal dose of bacterial LPS (100 ng/ml), resulting in massive release of IL-6 and IL-12. However, the endocytic capacity (e.g., Ag capture) of Mphi was significantly compromised upon exposure to infectious SARS-CoV. This study is the first demonstration that although SARS-CoV does not productively infect human Mphi or DC, it appears to exert differential effects on Mphi and DC maturation and functions, which might contribute to SARS pathogenesis.","Tseng, Chien-Te K; Perrone, Lucy A; Zhu, Hongbing; Makino, Shinji; Peters, Clarence J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15944304/,31

Altogether, 135 postmenopausal Chinese female subjects aged 55 years and older participated in the study, and their bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were classified as osteoporotic if their femoral neck BMD T-score was -2.5 or lower. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the indices' cut-off points, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS OSTA had the highest discriminatory power, with an estimated area under the ROC curve of 0.82. This was followed by SCORE (0.80), WEIGHT (0.78), ORAI (0.76), and ABONE (0.70). At the cut-off point of -2, OSTA achieved sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 59%, respectively.

197616,"Emerging infections, transfusion safety, and epidemiology.",2003,"All plus-strand RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that functions as the catalytic subunit of the viral replication/transcription complex, directing viral RNA synthesis in concert with other viral proteins and, sometimes, host proteins. RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3' end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach. These studies suggest that the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the EAV genome play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis.","Beerens, Nancy; Selisko, Barbara; Ricagno, Stefano; Imbert, Isabelle; van der Zanden, Linda; Snijder, Eric J; Canard, Bruno",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17537850/,31

OBJECTIVES To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","Hidvégi, Máté; Nichelatti, Michele",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812718/,31

198022,Preparedness for Ebola Virus Disease.,2014,"The spike glycoprotein (S) of coronavirus, the major target for virus-neutralizing antibodies, is assumed to mediate the attachment of virions to the host cell. A 26-kilodalton fragment proteolytically cleaved from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) S protein was previously shown to bear two adjacent antigenic sites, A and B, both defined by high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing C-terminal truncations of the 26-kilodalton region were used to localize functionally important determinants in the S protein primary structure. Two overlapping 223- and 150-amino-acid-long products with serine 506 as a common N terminus expressed all of the site A and B epitopes and induced virus-binding antibodies. Coexpression of one of these truncated protein S derivatives with aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell surface molecule acting as a receptor for TGEV, led to the formation of a complex which could be immunoprecipitated by anti-S antibodies. These data provide evidence that major neutralization-mediating and receptor-binding determinants reside together within a domain of the S protein which behaves like an independent module. In spite of their ability to prevent S-APN interaction, the neutralizing antibodies appeared to recognize a preformed complex, thus indicating that antibody- and receptor-binding determinants should be essentially distinct. Together these findings bring new insight into the molecular mechanism of TGEV neutralization.","Godet, M; Grosclaude, J; Delmas, B; Laude, H",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7525985/,31

MBL deficiency has been shown to predispose to infectious diseases. We assess whether or not, the variant MBL alleles are associated with susceptibility to dengue infection. Patients with confirmed dengue infection who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during a calendar year were studied. Controls were patients without dengue infection. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from 50 μl of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) using the DNA Blood Mini Kit. The SNPs in the promoter (-221 X/Y) and exon 1 (codon 54 A/B) of MBL2 gene were genotyped by using 2 separate cycling reactions of the TaqMan allele discrimination system. Serum levels of MBL were determined by double-antibody sandwich ELISA. Chi-square was used for statistical analysis. Serum MBL levels and genotypes were determined in 110 dengue patients (mean age 18.1 years; 62 males and 48 females) and 42 controls (mean age 25.8 years; males: females = 1:1). Our study showed that YB haplotype is associated with low serum levels of MBL. There was no association between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to dengue infection.

Since 1997, inpatient data from all public hospitals under the Hospital Authority have been stored in a central computerized program and retrieved from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Clinical data have also been retrieved through the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System to ensure the completion of the registry, and these suspected cases have undergone the same diagnostic evaluation for autism spectrum disorder, as some of the new autism cases might be hospitalized in the public hospital. The incidence and prevalence of autism spectrum disorder have been calculated for the period of 1986 to 2005 using the population statistics available in the government for children less than 15 years old in Hong Kong. This study has included 4 247 206 person-years from 1986 to 2005 for children less than 15 years old and 1 174 322 person-years for those less than 5 years old in Hong Kong.

199914,The dynamic effects of infectious disease outbreaks: The case of pandemic influenza and human coronavirus,2020,"The coronavirus E1 membrane protein is confined to the Golgi after it is expressed in cells either by viral infection or via injection of synthetic RNA. We have investigated the features of the protein responsible for intracellular sorting and found that a C-terminal deletion of only 18 amino acids results in its transport to the plasma membrane. However, we have previously shown that this C-terminal region alone is not sufficient for Golgi retention. When E1 was fused to a cell-surface protein, Thy-1, the resulting molecule was retained in the Golgi. Various mutated forms of E1 whose destinations were the ER, cell surface or lysosomes were also fused to Thy-1, and in each case the fusion was sorted according to its E1 component alone. We argue that, in contrast to sorting signals for other membrane compartments, Golgi retention of E1 is not due to a single short peptide sequence. Instead, the Golgi 'signal' of E1 appears to require for its expression a domain comprising most of the sequence of the protein.","Armstrong, J; Patel, S",Journal of cell science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1860903/,31

Mechanisms by which air pollution might facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection include a possible link between upregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor by air pollution and the host being prone to more severe COVID-19. Although the data are not yet peer-reviewed and the potential association does not necessarily imply causality, these data do stress the need for further investigation. If air pollution plays a role in the severity of the corona pandemic, more vigorous legislation concerning air quality is pivotal.","In 't Veen, Johannes C C M; Kappen, Jasper H; van Schayck, Onno C P",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32749825/,31

This paper thus presents a thematic description of moments in therapy, which illustrate the influence of lockdown on their sense of self, and the emergence of new anxieties not encountered before. Such themes are: i) new anxieties about death and dying;ii) new anxieties about loss of contact with friends and family and the emergence of existential anxiety;iii) new anxieties about current household relationships and the emergence of object loss;iv) new anxieties about the unplanned shift to online therapy and the threat of internet disconnection, and finally;v) new anxieties about missing body parts of online therapy: Part-body-on-the-screen relating versus what-was-once-whole-body relating. As this paper is based on psychoanalytic theory, and the notion of intersubjectivity, my own experiences and thoughts are included in the therapeutic engagement. The core contribution of this paper is that it adds a voice to the other voices of other patients around the world who are also living under lockdown. Without this kind of narrative documentation, the world-wide therapeutic community may not know the extent of the anxieties of living under lockdown in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As we move forward through the next phases of the pandemic, we will need a decision-making system that allows us to remain nimble as clinicians to meet our patient's needs while also working with a new framework of healthcare operations. Here, we present our quality improvement process for the adaptation and application of the Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) toolto gynecologic surgical services beyond the initial COVID response and into recovery of surgical services; with analysis of the reliability of the modified-MeNTS tool in our multi-site safety net hospital network. This multicenter study evaluated the gynecology surgical case volume at three tertiary acute care safety net institutions within the LA County Department of Health Services: Harbor-UCLA (HUMC), Olive View Medical Center (OVMC), and Los Angeles County + University of Southern California (LAC+USC). We describe our modified-Delphi approach to adapt the MeNTS tool in a structured fashion and its application to gynecologic surgical services. Blinded reviewers engaged in a three-round iterative adaptation and final scoring utilizing the modified tool. The cohort consisted of 392 female consecutive gynecology patients across three Los Angeles County Hospitals awaiting scheduled procedures in the surgical queue.The majority of patients were Latina (74.7%) and premenopausal (67.1%). Over half (52.4%) of the patients had cardiovascular disease, while 13.0% had lung disease, and 13.8% had diabetes. The most common indications for surgery were abnormal uterine bleeding (33.2%), pelvic organ prolapse (19.6%) and presence of an adnexal mass (14.3%). Minimally invasive approaches via laparoscopy, robotic-assisted laparoscopy, or vaginal surgery was the predominant planned surgical route (54.8%). Modified-MeNTS scores assumed a normal distribution across all patients within our cohort (Median 33, Range 18-52). Overall, ICC across all three institutions demonstrated ""good"" interrater reliability (0.72). ICC within institutions at HUMC and OVMC were categorized as ""good"" interrater reliability, while LAC-USC interrater reliability was categorized as ""excellent"" (HUMC 0.73, OVMC 0.65, LAC+USC 0.77). The modified-MeNTS tool performed well across a range of patients and procedures with a normal distribution of scores and high reliability between raters. We propose that the modified-MeNTS framework be considered as it employs quantitative methods for decision-making rather than subjective assessments.","Saleeby, Erin; Acree, Rachel; Wieslander, Cecilia; Truong, Christina; Garcia, Lisa; Eckhardt, Sarah; Hari, Anjali; Al-Marayati, Laila; Greenwell, Lisa; Holschneider, Christine H",J Med Syst,,31

215103,Biocompatible melanin based theranostic agent for in vivo detection and ablation of orthotopic micro-hepatocellular carcinoma,2020,"In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 -COVID-19) associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, as well as in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs (72/104) corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host as well as strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","Karamitros, Timokratis; Papadopoulou, Gethsimani; Bousali, Maria; Mexias, Anastasios; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Mentis, Andreas",J Clin Virol,,31

This article aims at critically reviewing the key virulence factors of COVID-19 which are the viremia, cellular oxidation and immune dysfunction. The averse economic effect of certain disease control measures such as national lock-downs and social distancing, though beneficial, makes them unsustainable. Worse still is the fact that wild animals and domestic pets are carriers of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that the disease would take longer than expected to be eradicated globally. A better understanding of the pathological dynamics of COVID-19 would help the general populace to prepare for possible infection by the invisible enemy. While the world prospects for vaccines and therapeutic agents against the SARS-CoV-2, clinicians should also seek to modulate the immune system for optimum performance.

To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related design implications.","Krekhov, Andrey; Cmentowski, Sebastian; Waschk, Andre; Kruger, Jens",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04702v1.pdf,31

For the last two decades, HASTY (HST), the ortholog of human Exportin-5, has been considered as a candidate protein that exports plant miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report HST functions in the miRNA pathway independent of its cargo-exporting activity in Arabidopsis. We found that Arabidopsis mutants with impaired HST shuttling present normal subcellular distribution of miRNAs. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction and microscopy assays showed that HST directly interacts with the microprocessor core component DCL1 through its N-terminal domain. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that HST also interacts, independently of its N-terminal domain, with the mediator complex subunit MED37. Further experiments showed that HST could act as a scaffold to facilitate the recruitment of DCL1 to genomic MIRNA loci by stabilizing the DCL1-MED37 complex, which in turn promotes the transcription and proper processing of pri-miRNAs. In summary, our results suggest that HST is likely associated with the formation of the miRNA biogenesis complex at MIRNA genes, promoting the transcription and processing of pri-miRNAs, rather than with the direct export of processed miRNAs from the nucleus.","Cambiagno, Damian A; Giudicatti, Axel J; Arce, Agustin L; Gagliardi, Delfina; Li, Lei; Yuan, Wei; Lundberg, Derek S; Weigel, Detlef; Manavella, Pablo A",Molecular plant (Online),,31

227910,Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels in the blood of patients with COVID-19,2020,"In stocking program, the use of artificial incubation conditions in hatcheries from the fertilisation of eggs to the release of unfed fry could reduce their ability to adapt to the natural environment. This study evaluates the effects of three factors on the fitness and physiology of salmon fry at their emergence, the origin of water (river vs drilling), the type of support in the incubator (support matrix vs plastic sheets) and the type of incubators (Californian vs vertical trays), and compares them to a semi-natural incubation method in river. Key biological functions including nutritional and immune status were compared among experimental conditions using biometric parameters, lipid composition and gene expression analyses. Our findings demonstrated that fry incubated in vertical trays supplied with river water had no significant difference in growth and lipid composition compared to those in semi-natural incubators. Besides, fry incubated on a substrate matrix in Californian trays exhibited phenotypic characteristics closest to those incubated in river. This support matrix improved fish growth, lipid consumption and distribution compared to fry on plastic sheets. Moreover, the large amounts of several PUFAs in these fry could allow a better membrane fluidity ensuring a better adaptation to temperature variation under cold conditions. In addition, drilling water improved the survival rate compared to river water due to lower numbers of fine particles, known to be responsible for the clogging of eggs. To conclude, using a substrate combined with drilling water in artificial incubators could increase fry fitness and its adaption to wild life.","Cornet, Valérie; Geay, Florian; Erraud, Alexandre; Mandiki, Syaghalirwa N M; Flamion, Enora; Larondelle, Yvan; Rollin, Xavier; Kestemont, Patrick",,,31
228567,Potential Use of Alpha-1 Anti-trypsin in the Covid-19 Treatment,2020,"While biological warfare has classically been considered a threat requiring the presence of a distinct biological agent, we argue that in light of the rise of state-sponsored online disinformation campaigns we are approaching a fifth phase of biowarfare with a ""cyber-bio"" framing. By examining the rise of measles cases following disinformation campaigns connected to the US 2016 presidential elections, the rise of disinformation in the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the impact of misinformation on public health interventions during the 2014-2016 West Africa and 2019-2020 Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola outbreaks, we ask whether the potential impact of these campaigns-which includes the undermining of sociopolitical systems, the delegitimization of public health and scientific bodies, and the diversion of the public health response-can be characterized as analogous to the impacts of more traditional conceptions of biowarfare. In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns. By doing so, we anticipate the advent of a combined cyber and biological warfare. The latter is not dependent on the existence of a manufactured biological weapon; it manages to undermine sociopolitical systems and public health through the weaponization of naturally occurring outbreaks.","Bernard, Rose; Bowsher, Gemma; Sullivan, Richard; Gibson-Fall, Fawzia",Health Secur,,31

Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31-45 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II.

The convergence of pandemic resource limitation and clinical demand associated with delirium requires careful risk stratification for targeted prevention efforts. Objectives: To develop an incident delirium predictive model among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Methods: We applied supervised machine learning to electronic health records data available at the start coronavirus disease 2019 inpatients admissions at three hospitals to build an incident delirium predictive model. We validated this model in three different hospitals. Both hospital cohorts included academic and community settings. Results: Among 2907 patients across 6 hospitals, 488 (16.8%) developed delirium. Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71-0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1. At a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity was 56%, negative predictive value 92%, and positive predictive value 30%. Equivalent model performance was observed in subsamples stratified by age, sex, race, need for critical care and care at community vs. academic hospitals. Conclusion: Machine learning applied to electronic health records available at the time of inpatient admission can be used to risk-stratify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for incident delirium. Delirium is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and resource constraints during a pandemic demand careful attention to the optimal application of predictive models.","Castro, Victor M; Sacks, Chana A; Perlis, Roy H; McCoy, Thomas H",,,31
232265,A Study on the Improvement and Platformization of Prevention and Preparation System for Infectious Disease Disasters -Focusing on the Infectious Disease Prevention and Management Act and Disaster and Terrorism Legislation,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of people with diabetes. Use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) helped manage diabetes effectively. Some of these disruptions may be reflected in population-scale changes to metrics of glycemic control, such as time in range (TIR). METHODS: We examined data from 65,067 US-based users of the G6 rtCGM System (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) who had uploaded data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users associated with three counties that included the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York or with five regions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were compared. Public data were used to associate regions with pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic glycemic parameters, COVID-19 mortality, and median household income. RESULTS: Compared to an 8-week pre-pandemic interval before stay-at-home orders (06Jan2020 to 01Mar2020), overall mean (SD) TIR improved from 59.0 (20.1)% to 61.0 (20.4)% during the early pandemic period (20Apr2020 to 14Jun2020, p<0.001). TIR improvements were noted in all three counties and in all five CDC-designated regions. Higher COVID-19 mortality was associated with higher proportions of individuals experiencing TIR improvements of &#8805;5 percentage points. Users in economically wealthier zip codes had higher pre- and intra-pandemic TIR values and greater relative improvements in TIR. TIR and pandemic-related improvements in TIR varied across CDC-designated regions. CONCLUSIONS: Population-level rtCGM data may be used to monitor changes in glycemic control with temporal and geographic specificity. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with improvements in TIR, which were not evenly distributed across the US.","van der Linden, Joost; Welsh, John B; Hirsch, Irl B; Garg, Satish K",Diabetes technol. ther,,31

A computational chromatin model suggests that these blobs are dynamically associating chromatin fragments in close physical and genomic proximity and adopt topologically associated domain-like interactions in the time-average limit. Experimentally, we found that chromatin exhibits a spatiotemporal correlation over ~4 µm in space and tens of seconds in time, while chromatin dynamics are correlated over ~6 µm and last 40 s. Notably, chromatin structure and dynamics are closely related, which may constitute a mechanism to grant access to regions with high local chromatin concentration.","Barth, R; Bystricky, K; Shaban, H A",Sci.

236306,Dinitrosyl Iron Complexes with Thiol-Containing Ligands as Donors of Nitrosonium Cations Suppress Viral Infections (Hypothesis),2020,"Melatonin is a chronobiotic hormone, which can regulate human diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, respiratory disorders, and microbial infections by regulating redox system. Melatonin exhibits innate immunomodulation by communicating with immune system and influencing neutrophils to fight infections and inflammation. However, sustaining redox homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in neutrophils are critical during chemotaxis, oxidative burst, phagocytosis, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Therefore, endogenous antioxidant glutathione (GSH) redox cycle is highly vital in regulating neutrophil functions. Reduced intracellular GSH levels and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the neutrophils during clinical conditions like autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, and microbial infections lead to dysfunctional neutrophils. Therefore, we hypothesized that redox modulators like melatonin can protect neutrophil health and functions under GSH and GR activity-deficient conditions. We demonstrate the dual role of melatonin, wherein it protects neutrophils from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS generation; in contrast, it restores neutrophil functions like phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis in GSH and GR activity-deficient neutrophils by regulating ROS levels both in vitro and in vivo. Melatonin mitigates LPS-induced neutrophil dysfunctions by rejuvenating GSH redox system, specifically GR activity by acting as a parallel redox system. Our results indicate that melatonin could be a potential auxiliary therapy to treat immune dysfunction and microbial infections, including virus, under chronic disease conditions by restoring neutrophil functions. Further, melatonin could be a promising immune system booster to fight unprecedented pandemics like the current COVID-19. However, further studies are indispensable to address the clinical usage of melatonin.","NaveenKumar, Somanathapura K; Hemshekhar, Mahadevappa; Jagadish, Swamy; Manikanta, Kurnegala; Vishalakshi, Gopalapura J; Kemparaju, Kempaiah; Girish, Kesturu S",J Pineal Res,,31

To identify the best strategy to replace this full lockdown, sophisticated models that rely on mobility data have been developed. In this study, using the example of France as a case-study, we develop a simple model considering contacts between age classes to derive the general impact of partial lockdown strategies targeted at specific age groups. We found that epidemic suppression can only be achieved by targeting isolation of young and middle age groups with high efficiency. All other strategies tested result in a flatter epidemic curve, with outcomes in (e.g. mortality and health system over-capacity) dependent of the age groups targeted and the isolation efficiency. Targeting only the elderly can decrease the expected mortality burden, but in proportions lower than more integrative strategies involving several age groups. While not aiming to provide quantitative forecasts, our study shows the benefits and constraints of different partial lockdown strategies, which could help guide decision-making.","Roche, Benjamin; Garchitorena, Andres; Roiz, David",Epidemics,,31

An interventional study including all staff and patients in a rural nursing home was performed from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2021. Infection control measures against COVID-19 were initiated on 1 April 2020. The primary outcome was the frequency of patients' medical care visits to the outpatient and emergency departments. The secondary outcome was the number of days-off taken by staff. Each group (pre- and post-COVID-19 control groups) had 48 participants. The number of visits to the outpatient department reduced from the pre-COVID-19 to post-COVID-19 control period the difference in number of visits to the emergency department was not significant, due to the low statistical power. The number of days-off taken by the staff was increased from the pre-COVID-19 to post-COVID-19 control period. This is the first study investigating COVID-19 control measures in a rural nursing home.

246600,Summary of global surveillance data of infectious diseases in January 2021,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has led to a surge in the interest in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Disease transmission may be modeled as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments and has assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment to another. Usually, they are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations in time. A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model. However, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. In this work, we extend the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of partial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who return from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. We implement the whole model in libMesh, an open finite element library that provides a framework for multiphysics, considering adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We verify our model with standard SEIRD models and show several examples highlighting the present model's new capabilities.","Grave, Malú; Coutinho, Alvaro L G A",Comput Mech,,31

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow-up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P<0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS: The main findings of this study are that: 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001); and 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (ß=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018).

Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","Corradi, Francesco; Isirdi, Alessandro; Malacarne, Paolo; Santori, Gregorio; Barbieri, Greta; Romei, Chiara; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; Falcone, Marco; Bertini, Pietro; Guarracino, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Forfori, Francesco",Minerva Anestesiol,,31

248505,Investigation of the introduction and dissemination of vanB Enterococcus faecium in the Capital Region of Denmark and development of a rapid and accurate clone-specific vanB E. faecium PCR,2021,"BACKGROUND: Simulation study results suggest that COVID-19 contact-tracing apps have the potential to achieve pandemic control. Concordantly, high app adoption rates were a stipulated prerequisite for success. Early studies on potential adoption were encouraging. Several factors predicting adoption rates were investigated, especially pertaining to user characteristics. Since then, several countries have released COVID-19 contact-tracing apps. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary aim was to investigate the quality characteristics of national European COVID-19 contact-tracing apps, thereby shifting attention from user to application characteristics. Secondly, associations between app quality and adoption were investigated. Finally, app features contributing to higher app quality were identified. METHODS: Eligible COVID-19 contact-tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app-usage voluntariness. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was utilized to assess app quality. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two human-computer-interaction scientists, independently conducted MARS ratings. To investigate associations between app quality and adoptions rates and infection rates, a Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact-tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall, and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information-quality. However, the average app-adoption rate, of 22.9% (SD 12.5%), was below the level recommended by simulation studies. Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate (BCAR) was calculated by assuming apps achieve highest ratings. The mean BCARs for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. Overall, we identified five feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly-updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. These 14 features were: a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app usage, public health instructions/restrictions, information of burden on healthcare system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high-quality COVID-19 contact-tracing apps, with regards to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. Associations between higher app-adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app usage might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others. Various features were identified that could guide further engagement-enhancing app development.","Kahnbach, Leonie; Lehr, Dirk; Brandenburger, Jessica; Mallwitz, Tim; Jent, Sophie; Hannibal, Sandy; Funk, Burkhardt; Janneck, Monique",J. med. internet res,,31

We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","Walls, Alexandra C; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Wall, Abigail; McGuire, Andrew T; Veesler, David",Cell,,31

253108,Coronaviral infection,2020,"ABSTRACT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had resulted in a global pandemic. A comprehensive analysis of pediatric COVID-19 cases is essential to decipher the natural features of children under the risk of this disease.In the epidemic period, all the children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuxi, a city with a stable medical system during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, were enrolled for comprehensive data documenting their clinical, prognosis, follow-up, treatment and various tests results. Combing their family cluster characteristics, the epidemiological, hospitalization, and transmission features of children with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed and discussed.A total of 7 children were enrolled, including 4 mild cases, 1 moderate case, and 2 asymptomatic cases. The common symptoms were fever and dry cough. The length of viral nucleic acid duration in nasopharynx varied and was irrelevant to the severity of the symptom, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Two cases showed viral nucleic acid positive recurrence after discharge from the hospital. A child with type 1 diabetes was also focused, for the elevated blood sugar during hospitalization. All these children had close contacts with their family members, some of those were confirmed COVID-19 cases.We provided a holistic and detailed portrayal of the pediatric COVID-19 cases in a typical city of timely response to the epidemic. While the family cluster exhibits the major transmission mode, attention should be paid for the potential risk since the expanded social space of children in future.","Kang, Yanjun; You, Zhong; Wang, Kang; Dong, Zijuan; Zhang, Jiajia; Qiu, Yuanwang; Ge, Guizhi",Medicine (Baltimore),,31

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association between DM and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed from several electronic databases on subjects that assess DM and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and disease progression. RESULTS: There were a total of 6452 patients from 30 studies. Meta-analysis showed that DM was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 2.38 [1.88, 3.03], p < 0.001; I2: 62%) and its subgroup which comprised of mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11], p < 0.001; I2: 72%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3.35], p < 0.001; I2: 45%), ARDS (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11.58], p = 0.001; I2: 9%), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10.14], p = 0.04; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by age (p = 0.003) and hypertension (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age &#8805;55 years-old (RR 1.92) compared to <55 years-old (RR 3.48), and in prevalence of hypertension &#8805;25% (RR 1.93) compared to <25% (RR 3.06).

255785,Characterization of doxycycline-mediated inhibition of Marfan syndrome-associated aortic dilation by multiphoton microscopy,2020,"This case report describes a high school athlete with palpitation, myalgia, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion after SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), but echocardiography and troponin were normal. This case is unusual as the standard cardiac tests recommended by the American Heart Association for sports clearance, including ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers, were normal. Still, she continued to be symptomatic after mild COVID-19. The CMR was performed to evaluate her unexplained palpitation and showed patchy myocardial edema two months after her initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case, the diagnosis of myocardial involvement would be missed by normal echocardiograms and cardiac bio-markers without CMR. Because acute myocarditis is a risk factor for sudden death in competitive athletes, pediatric cardiologists should consider performing additional tests such as cardiac MRI in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, even if cardiac biomarkers and echocardiograms are normal.","Das, Bibhuti B.",Children,,31

However, only few of the genes are discriminatively expressed. How to identify these biomarkers precisely is significant for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Many studies utilized pathway information to identify the biomarkers. However, most of these studies only incorporate the group information while the pathway structural information is ignored. In this paper, we proposed a Bayesian gene selection with a network-constrained regularization method, which can incorporate the pathway structural information as priors to perform gene selection. All the priors are conjugated; thus, the parameters can be estimated effectively through Gibbs sampling. We present the application of our method on 6 microarray datasets, comparing with Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian Elastic Net, and Bayesian Fused Lasso. The results show that our method performs better than other Bayesian methods and pathway structural information can improve the result.","Cao, Ming; Fan, Yue; Peng, Qinke",Comput Math Methods Med,,31

260362,Age structured SIR model for the spread of infectious diseases through indirect contacts,2020-07-23,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that we will be able to detect change in motor outcome measures over time in a cohort with mutations in FKRP. METHODS: Individuals with documented FKRP mutations were evaluated annually with a battery of established motor outcome measures including limited quantitative myometry and timed function measures. Results were analyzed using random coefficient regression to determine annual change in each measure. Due to the non-linear progression through the lifespan of the study participants, pediatric (<19 years) and adult (>19 years) cohorts were analyzed separately. Effect of genotype was evaluated in each cohort. RESULTS: Sixty-nine participants (30 pediatric, 44 adult) with at least two evaluations were included. There was a small but statistically significant decline in timed motor function measures in both pediatric and adult cohorts. Genotype significantly affected rate of decline in the pediatric but not the adult cohort. Some pediatric patients who are homozygous for the c.826C>A mutation showed improving motor performance in adolescence. Performance on the 10-meter walk/run was highly correlated with other timed function tests. CONCLUSIONS: There is a slow annual decline in motor function in adults with FKRP mutations that can be detected with standard motor outcome measures, while the results in the pediatric population were more variable and affected by genotype. Overall, these analyses provide a framework for development of future clinical trials. The DG natural history study may be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00313677).","Gedlinske, Amber M; Stephan, Carrie M; Mockler, Shelley Rh; Laubscher, Katie M; Laubenthal, Karla S; Crockett, Cameron D; Zimmerman, M Bridget; Mathews, Katherine D",Neurology,,31

268915,JAK inhibitors: Ten years after,2021,"Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines However, the development of such immunogens may be complicated by inefficiencies in their production, especially with the metastable glycosylated trimeric type 1 fusion machines that are prevalent viral vaccine targets To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N- linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface Respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer - stabilized in the prefusion conformation by multiple disulfides and fused with SpyCatcher - could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or to ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric antigens from viral respiratory pathogens, including the recently identified SARS-CoV-2","Zhang, Baoshan; Chao, Cara W.; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Olia, Adam S.; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume; Verardi, Raffaello; Wang, Shuishu; Zhou, Tongqing; Kwong, Peter D.",,,31
268995,Forecasting Power of Infectious Diseases-Related Uncertainty for Gold Realized Variance,2021,"Extinction learning and recovery effects are known to be essential learning mechanisms. We investigated whether spontaneous recovery effects transfer to skill acquisition and play a role in the context of widely used but also criticized German orthography instruction methods that implement a prolonged phase of phonological spelling without correction. To test our hypothesis in a controlled manner, in the current experimental study, adult participants learned how to spell an artificial vocabulary with the help of a phonological spelling instruction method that emulates the criticized German orthography instruction methods. We compared participants (148 University students) who did not receive correction in the initial learning phase (delayed correction) with participants who received correction from the beginning (immediate correction). Although the incorrect spellings which were practiced in the initial learning phase (acquisition phase) were extinguished in the subsequent learning phase (extinction phase), the erroneous spellings recovered after a break of 24 hr in the delayed correction condition. The results indicate that learning with methods that emphasize phonological spelling, without correction in the initial learning phase, can lead to spontaneous recovery of initially learned incorrect spellings after the incorrect spellings have seemingly been extinguished.

270706,"Infectious Hospitality and Communicative Disease in Kleist's ""Der Findling"": The Disease Inside and Out",2020,"We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif sequentially and structurally similar to a staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) segment, near the S1/S2 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which might explain the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif at its polybasic (PRRA) insert to inhibit infection in live virus assays. The overlap between the superantigenic site of the spike and its proteolytic cleavage site suggests that the mAb prevents viral entry by interfering with the proteolytic activity of cell proteases (furin and TMPRSS2). The high affinity of 6D3 for this site originates from a polyacidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2. The study points to the potential utility of 6D3 for possibly treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common colds caused by human coronaviruses that also possess a furin-like cleavage site.","Cheng, Mary Hongying; Porritt, Rebecca A; Rivas, Magali Noval; Krieger, James M; Ozdemir, Asli Beyza; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Fries, Bettina C; Arditi, Moshe; Bahar, Ivet",,,31

272947,Dysregulation of COVID-19 related gene expression in the COPD lung,2021,"Background: Little is known about electronic consultation (e-consult) utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic when health systems rapidly implemented and scaled telehealth alternatives to in-person care. It is also unknown if e-consult utilization during the pandemic replaced or merely deferred the need for a specialty appointment. We evaluated if primary care providers' (PCPs) e-consult utilization and specialists' recommendations for specialty appointments changed after the transition to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cohort study used an interrupted time series analysis of e-consult utilization in a large, urban academic health care system between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020; the post-telemedicine time period began March 15, 2020. The primary outcome measure was the odds of an e-consult ordered during a PCP appointment; the secondary outcome measure was the odds of a specialist recommending a specialty appointment in an e-consult. Results: During 193,263 PCP appointments, 1,318 e-consults were placed to internal medicine subspecialties. Compared to the pre-telemedicine time period, the odds of a PCP ordering an e-consult increased (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02-1.07]) and the odds of specialists recommending specialty appointments increased (OR 1.11, 95% CI [1.06-1.15]). Conclusions: E-consult use increased following the transition to telemedicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PCPs consider the e-consult a valuable tool for patient care when there is limited availability of specialty appointments. However, recommendations for specialty appointments following an e-consult also increased, suggesting that the e-consult may not replace the need for a specialty appointment.","Leyton, Christopher; Zhang, Chenshu; Rikin, Sharon",Telemed. j. e. health,,31

DESIGN: A cross-sectional online thirty-six-item Google Survey. The survey queried demographics and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. SETTING: The survey was distributed to Israeli Dietetic Association (ATID) mailing list between 31 March and 5 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical dietitians, members of ATID, who consented to participated in the survey. RESULTS: Three hundred dietitians (12 % of ATID members; 95 % women; mean age 4·41 (sd 10·2) years) replied to the survey. Most dietitians reported a significant â¼30 % decrease in work hours due to the pandemic. The most prevalent form of alternative nutrition counselling (ANC) was over the phone (72 %); 53·5 % used online platforms. Nearly 45 % had no former ANC experience. Both ANC formats were reported inferior to face-to-face nutritional consultation (consultation quality median scores 8 and 7, on a 1-10 scale, for online and phone, respectively). ANC difficulties on either phone or online platforms were technical (56 and 47 %, respectively), lack of anthropometric measurements (28 and 25 %, respectively) and interpersonal communication (19 and 14·6 %, respectively). Older age and former phone counselling experience were associated with higher quality scores, respectively (OR = 1·046, 95 % CI 1·01, 1·08, P = 0·005), (95 % CI 1·38, 4·52, P = 0·02). Those who continued to work full time had five-time greater odds for a higher quality score using online platforms (OR = 5·33, 95 % CI 1·091, 14·89, P = 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest telemedicine holds considerable promise for dietary consultation; however, additional tools and training are needed to optimise remote ANC, especially in light of potential crisis-induced lockdown.","Kaufman-Shriqui, Vered; Sherf-Dagan, Shiri; Boaz, Mona; Birk, Ruth",Public Health Nutr,,31

The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to evaluate the local effects of various types of smokeless tobacco on periodontal health in tobacco pouch keratosis (TPK) patients in Mangalore city in the state of Karnataka. Materials and Methods: A total of 345 TPK patients were evaluated of which all were smokeless tobacco users. All the patients were clinically examined for different clinical periodontal parameters such as stains, gingival recession (GR), periodontal pocket, furcation involvement, and mobility and local effects of various types of smokeless tobacco on periodontal health in TPK sites were recorded. Results: The prevalence of GR was of 87.5%. Haathichaap was the most common smokeless tobacco used (35.9%) closely followed by nonpackaged type (loose tobacco) (19.4%). This was followed by Madhu (14.2%). Likewise, periodontal parameters were observed more in these patients in decreasing order. Conclusion: The results of the present study agree strongly with other smokeless tobacco user studies in terms of the strong association between GR and smokeless tobacco placement. The present cross-sectional study indicates that TPK lesions are positively associated with periodontal diseases. It is important to raise awareness of both oral cancer and periodontal risks and inform about its possible health consequences thereby working towards an improvement of oral and general health and related quality of life in these patients.","Bhandarkar, Gowri Pandarinath; Shetty, Kushal V; Jha, Kamakshi; Arati, Kulkarni; Thomas, Tanya",J Cancer Res Ther,,31

By considering the growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases, their propagation growth model is established. The parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models are obtained by nonlinear fitting. Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention. The infection inhibition constant in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, which reasonably explains the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei.","Liang, Kaihao",Infect Genet Evol,,31

286454,The Epistemic Threat of Deepfakes,2020,"Viral infections cause a host of fatal diseases and seriously affect every form of life from bacteria to humans. Although most viral infections can receive appropriate treatment thereby limiting damage to life and livelihood with modern medicine and early diagnosis, new types of viral infections are continuously emerging that need to be properly and timely treated. As time is the most important factor in the progress of many deadly viral diseases, early detection becomes of paramount importance for effective treatment. Aptamers are small oligonucleotide molecules made by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers are characterized by being able to specifically bind to a target, much like antibodies. However, unlike antibodies, aptamers are easily synthesized, modified, and are able to target a wider range of substances, including proteins and carbohydrates. With these advantages in mind, many studies on aptamer-based viral diagnosis and treatments are currently in progress. The use of aptamers for viral diagnosis requires a system that recognizes the binding of viral molecules to aptamers in samples of blood, serum, plasma, or in virus-infected cells. From a therapeutic perspective, aptamers target viral particles or host cell receptors to prevent the interaction between the virus and host cells or target intracellular viral proteins to interrupt the life cycle of the virus within infected cells. In this paper, we review recent attempts to use aptamers for the diagnosis and treatment of various viral infections.","Kim, Tae-Hyeong; Lee, Seong-Wook",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,31

303135,The DIOS framework for optimizing infectious disease surveillance: Numerical methods for simulation and multi-objective optimization of surveillance network architectures,2020,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tenofovir (TDF) and TDF combined with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with clinical suspicion of mild to moderate respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 who were treated at an outpatient clinic. Patients were randomly recruited to take 10 days of TDF (300 mg/day), TDF (300 mg/day) combined with FTC (200 mg/day) or placebo Vitamin C (500 mg/day). The primary parameter was the score of symptoms and predictive signs of COVID-19, assessed on the seventh day of patient follow-up. From a total of 309 patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, 227 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly distributed into the following groups: (a) 75 (one did not initiate treatment) in the TDF group; (b) 74 in the TDF combined with FTC group; and (c) 77 in the Vitamin C group (placebo). Of the 226 patients, 139 (62%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fever ([≥]37.8{degrees}C), ageusia or dysgeusia, anosmia or dysosmia, and two or more clinical symptoms or signs were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant change in clinical score based on clinical symptoms and signs between treatment groups. Patients with mild to moderate infection by SARS-CoV-2 had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF- compared to patients without infection. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory infection, with fever ([≥]37.8{degrees}C), loss of smell, loss of taste and two or more symptoms, have a better prediction for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed higher and more persistent proinflammatory cytokines profile compared to patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological intervention with TDF or TDF combined with FTC did not change the clinical signs and symptoms score in mild to moderate respiratory infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the Vitamin C group (placebo).","Lima, Aldo A M; Arruda, Erico A G; Pires-Neto, Roberto J; Medeiros, Melissa S; Quirino-Filho, J; Clementino, Marco A; Gondim, Rafhaella N D G; Magalhaes, Lyvia M C; Cavalcante, Kerene F; Viana, Vania A F; Perdigao, Liana; Magalhaes, Pedro J C; Santos, Armenio A; Martins, R B; Havt, Alexandre; Lopes, N P; Arruda-Neto, Eurico",,,31

314800,Kang-ai Injection () Inhibits Gastric Cancer Cells Proliferation through IL-6/STAT3 Pathway,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mandated implementation of a national suicide risk identification strategy (Risk ID). The goal of Risk ID is to improve the detection and management of suicide risk by standardizing suicide risk screening and evaluation enterprise-wide. In order to ensure continuous quality improvement (QI), ongoing evaluation and targeted interventions to improve implementation of Risk ID are needed. Moreover, given that facilities will vary with respect to implementation needs and barriers, the dose and type of intervention needed may vary across facilities. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an adaptive implementation strategy to improve the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation in VHA ambulatory care settings. In addition, this study will examine specific factors that may impact the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation and the adoption of different implementation strategies. This protocol describes the stepped implementation approach and proposed evaluation plan. METHODS: Using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, two evidence-based implementation strategies will be evaluated: (1) audit and feedback (A&F); (2) A&F plus external facilitation (A&F + EF). Implementation outcomes of interest include uptake of secondary suicide risk screening and uptake of comprehensive suicide risk evaluation (stages 2 and 3 of Risk ID). Secondary outcomes include rates of other clinical outcomes (i.e., safety planning) and organizational factors that may impact Risk ID implementation (i.e., leadership climate and leadership support). DISCUSSION: This national QI study will use a SMART design to evaluate whether an adaptive implementation strategy is effective in improving uptake of a mandated VHA-wide suicide risk screening and evaluation initiative. If this study finds that the proposed stepped implementation strategy is effective at increasing uptake and maintaining performance improvements, this approach may be used as an overarching QI strategy for other national suicide prevention programs.

Limited causal biomarkers exist for ARDS development. We sought to identify novel genetic susceptibility targets for ARDS to focus further investigation on their biological mechanism and therapeutic potential. METHODS: Meta-analyses of ARDS genome-wide association studies were performed with 1250 cases and 1583 controls in Europeans, and 387 cases and 387 controls in African Americans. The functionality of novel loci was determined in silico using multiple omics approaches. The causality of 114 factors potentially involved in ARDS development was assessed using Mendelian Randomization analysis. RESULTS: There was distinct genetic heterogeneity in ARDS between Europeans and African Americans. rs7967111 at 12p13.2 was functionally associated with ARDS susceptibility in Europeans (odds ratio = 1.38; P = 2.15 × 10-8). Expression of two genes annotated at this locus, BORCS5 and DUSP16, was dynamic but ultimately decreased during ARDS development, as well as downregulated in immune cells alongside COVID-19 severity. Causal inference implied that comorbidity of inflammatory bowel disease and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-10 causally increased ARDS risk, while vitamin D supplementation and vasodilator use ameliorated risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a novel susceptibility locus in ARDS pathophysiology that implicates BORCS5 and DUSP16 as potentially acting in immune-inflammatory processes. This locus warrants further investigation to inform the development of therapeutic targets and clinical care strategies for ARDS, including those induced by COVID-19.","Du, Mulong; Garcia, Joe G N; Christie, Jason D; Xin, Junyi; Cai, Guoshuai; Meyer, Nuala J; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Yuan, Qianyu; Zhang, Zhengdong; Su, Li; Shen, Sipeng; Dong, Xuesi; Li, Hui; Hutchinson, John N; Tejera, Paula; Lin, Xihong; Wang, Meilin; Chen, Feng; Christiani, David C",Intensive care med,,31
321387,Immune responses in genomically simple SWI/SNF-deficient cancers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emergency situations, as the Covid-19 pandemic that is striking the world nowadays, stress the national health systems which are forced to rapidly reorganizing their sources. Therefore, many elective diagnostic and surgical procedures are being suspended or significantly delayed. Moreover, patients might find it difficult to refer to physicians and delay the diagnostic and even the therapeutic procedures because of emotional or logistic problems. The effect of diagnostic and therapeutic delay on survival in patients affected by gastrointestinal malignancies is still unclear. METHODS: We carried out a review of the available literature, in order to determine whether the delay in performing diagnosis and curative-intent surgical procedures affects the oncological outcomes in patients with oesophageal, gastric, colorectal cancers, and colorectal liver metastasis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that for oesophageal, gastric and colon cancers delaying surgery up to 2 months after the end of the staging process does not worsen the oncological outcomes. Oesophageal cancer should undergo surgery within 7-8 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Rectal cancers should undergo surgery within 31 days after the diagnostic process and within 12 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy should start within 4 weeks after surgery, especially in gastric cancer; a delay up to 42 days may be allowed for oesophageal cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal malignancies can be safely managed taking into account that reasonable delays of planned treatments appear a generally safe approach, not having a significant impact on long-term oncological outcome.","DE Rosa, Michele; Pasculli, Alessandro; Rondelli, Fabio; Mariani, Lorenzo; Avenia, Stefano; Ceccarelli, Graziano; Testini, Mario; Avenia, Nicola; Bugiantella, Walter",,,31

Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. Methods: The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. Results: Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines.

325777,Animal species in SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Covid-19 özel sayi.),2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Awareness with paralysis is a devastating complication for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and risks long-term psychological morbidity. Data from the emergency department (ED) demonstrate a high rate of longer-acting neuromuscular blocking agent use, delayed analgosedation, and a lack of sedation depth monitoring. These practices are discordant with recommendations for preventing awareness with paralysis. Despite this, awareness with paralysis has not been rigorously studied in the ED population. Our objective is to assess the prevalence of awareness with paralysis in ED patients receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study on 383 mechanically ventilated ED patients. After extubation, we assessed patients for awareness with paralysis by using the modified Brice questionnaire. Three expert reviewers independently adjudicated awareness with paralysis. We report the prevalence of awareness with paralysis (primary outcome); the secondary outcome was perceived threat, a mediator for development of posttraumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: The prevalence of awareness with paralysis was 2.6% (10/383). Exposure to rocuronium at any point in the ED was significantly different between patients who experienced awareness with paralysis (70%) versus the rest of the cohort (31.4%) (unadjusted odds ratio 5.1; 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 20.1). Patients experiencing awareness with paralysis had higher mean values on the threat perception scale, denoting a higher degree of perceived threat, compared with patients who did not experience awareness with paralysis (13.4 [SD 7.7] versus 8.5 [SD 6.2]; mean difference 4.9; 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 8.8). CONCLUSION: Awareness with paralysis occurs in a significant minority of ED patients who receive mechanical ventilation. Potential associations of awareness with paralysis with ED care and increased perceived threat warrant further evaluation.","Pappal, Ryan D; Roberts, Brian W; Mohr, Nicholas M; Ablordeppey, Enyo; Wessman, Brian T; Drewry, Anne M; Winkler, Winston; Yan, Yan; Kollef, Marin H; Avidan, Michael S; Fuller, Brian M",Ann Emerg Med,,31

326715,Bacteriophage Cocktail-Mediated Inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm on Endotracheal Tube Surface,2021,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical component of the compensatory axis of the renin angiotensin system. Alterations in ACE2 gene and protein expression, and activity mediated by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), a member of the ""A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease"" (ADAM) family are implicated in several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that activation of kinin B1 receptor (B1R) in the brain increases neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and sympathoexcitation, leading to the development of neurogenic hypertension. We also showed evidence for ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in neurons. However, whether kinin B1 receptor (B1R) activation has any role in altering ADAM17 activity and its effect on ACE2 shedding in neurons is not known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of B1R upregulates ADAM17 and results in ACE2 shedding in neurons. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated wild-type and B1R gene-deleted mouse neonatal primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures with a B1R-specific agonist and measured the activities of ADAM17 and ACE2 in neurons. B1R stimulation significantly increased ADAM17 activity and decreased ACE2 activity in wild-type neurons, while pretreatment with a B1R-specific antagonist, R715, reversed these changes. Stimulation with specific B1R agonist Lys-Des-Arg9-Bradykinin (LDABK) did not show any effect on ADAM17 or ACE2 activities in neurons with B1R gene deletion. These data suggest that B1R activation results in ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in primary hypothalamic neurons. In addition, stimulation with high concentration of glutamate significantly increased B1R gene and protein expression, along with increased ADAM17 and decreased ACE2 activities in wild-type neurons. Pretreatment with B1R-specific antagonist R715 reversed these glutamate-induced effects suggesting that indeed B1R is involved in glutamate-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 activity and ACE2 shedding.","Parekh, Rohan Umesh; Sriramula, Srinivas",Int. j. mol. sci.

Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies and vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nanoimmunoassay (NIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1,024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultralow-volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 µL of whole blood easily obtainable from a simple finger prick. The NIA platform achieves high throughput, high sensitivity, and specificity based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples, and negligible reagent consumption. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility to combine NIA with decentralized and simple approaches to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker analysis in general.","Swank, Zoe; Michielin, Grégoire; Yip, Hon Ming; Cohen, Patrick; Andrey, Diego O; Vuilleumier, Nicolas; Kaiser, Laurent; Eckerle, Isabella; Meyer, Benjamin; Maerkl, Sebastian J",Proc.

Patients from private dental clinics answered an online questionnaire anonymously regarding their treatment, availability and willingness to attend dental appointments, and concerns about contamination. Descriptive statistics of the responses were performed with percentages and responses were compared between sexes, regions, and other aspects using the chi-squared test. Five hundred ninety-five patients (412 females and 183 males; mean age: 38.21 years) answered the questionnaire. Most patients reported they were receiving dental treatment (orthodontics) and would attend to a dental appointment; meanwhile, those patients not receiving treatment would not attend or would visit only in the case of an emergency. Males reported to be calmer than females, who were more anxious and afraid; as such, males reported more willing to go a dental appointment while, in general, females were not worried about how quarantine could affect dental treatment. Patients actively undergoing treatment and orthodontic patients were more concerned about a delay in treatment. There was a significant association between feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of willingness to attend a dental appointment. The quarantine recommended due to the COVID-19 pandemic was shown to have an impact on dental appointments and the anxiety levels of patients, since there was a significant association between patients' feelings and their willingness to attend a dental appointment. Overall, patients undergoing dental treatment and orthodontics were more willing to attend an appointment and were more concerned about an increase in treatment duration.","Peloso, Renan Morais; Pini, Nubia Inocencya Pavesi; Sundfeld Neto, Daniel; Mori, Aline Akemi; Oliveira, Renata Cristina Gobbi de; Valarelli, Fabricio Pinelli; Freitas, Karina Maria Salvatore",Braz Oral Res,,31

Little is known about the effects of a pandemic on non-elective neurosurgical practices, which have continued under modified conditions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This knowledge might be critical for the ongoing second coronavirus wave and potential restrictions on health care. We aimed to determine the incidence and 30-day mortality rate of various non-elective neurosurgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective, multi-centre observational cohort study among neurosurgical centres within Austria, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland was performed. Incidence of neurosurgical emergencies and related 30-day mortality rates were determined for a period reflecting the peak pandemic of the first wave in all participating countries (i.e. March 16th-April 15th, 2020), and compared to the same period in prior years (2017, 2018, and 2019). A total of 4,752 emergency neurosurgical cases were reviewed over a 4-year period. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a general decline in the incidence of non-elective neurosurgical cases, which was driven by a reduced number of traumatic brain injuries, spine conditions, and chronic subdural hematomas. Thirty-day mortality did not significantly increase overall or for any of the conditions examined during the peak of the pandemic. The neurosurgical community in these three European countries observed a decrease in the incidence of some neurosurgical emergencies with 30-day mortality rates comparable to previous years (2017-2019). Lower incidence of neurosurgical cases is likely related to restrictions placed on mobility within countries, but may also involve delayed patient presentation.","Grassner, Lukas; Petr, Ondra; Warner, Freda M; Dedeciusova, Michaela; Mathis, Andrea Maria; Pinggera, Daniel; Gsellmann, Sina; Meiners, Laura C; Freigang, Sascha; Mokry, Michael; Resch, Alexandra; Kretschmer, Thomas; Rossmann, Tobias; Navarro, Francisco Ruiz; Gruber, Andreas; Spendel, Mathias; Winkler, Peter A; Marhold, Franz; Sherif, Camillo; Wais, Jonathan P; Rössler, Karl; Pfisterer, Wolfgang; Mühlbauer, Manfred; Trivik-Barrientos, Felipe A; Rath, Sebastian; Voldrich, Richard; Krska, Lukas; Lipina, Radim; Kerekanic, Martin; Fiedler, Jiri; Kasik, Petr; Priban, Vladimir; Tichy, Michal; Krupa, Petr; Cesak, Tomas; Kroupa, Robert; Callo, Andrej; Haninec, Pavel; Pohlodek, Daniel; Krahulik, David; Sejkorova, Alena; Sames, Martin; Dvorak, Josef; Suchomel, Petr; Tomas, Robert; Klener, Jan; Juran, Vilem; Smrcka, Martin; Linzer, Petr; Kaiser, Miroslav",Sci Rep,,31

Point of Care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. They need to be easily usable by the general population in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO® POC test and the results were recently published. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by the general public in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use. METHODS: 143 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plant workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use, with or without a tutorial video, were made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users' ability to read the results. RESULTS: 88.4% of the test users judged the instructions for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3% of the users obtained a valid result and, according to the supervisors, 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the users. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback on the COVID PRESTO® as a potential self-test. Neither age nor education had an influence. CONCLUSION: COVID-PRESTO® was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its use was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This POC test can become an easy-to-use tool to help detect whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the context of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.","Prazuck, Thierry; Phan Van, Jean; Sinturel, Florence; Levray, Frederique; Elie, Allan; Camera, Denise; Pialoux, Gilles",PLoS One,,31

341811,Circulating CYTOR as a Potential Biomarker in Breast Cancer,2020,"The upsurge of the novel coronavirus has spread to many countries and has been declared a pandemic by WHO. It has shaken the most powerful countries across the world like the USA, UK, and has affected economies of various countries. The coronavirus or the 2019-nCoV causes the disease that has been named COVID-19. This disease transmits by inhaling droplets that are expelled by an infected person. It has been affecting people in different ways and has been found to be threatening for the older population or people with comorbidities. It has been seen that the virus 2019-nCoV spreads faster than the two of its antecedents namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). No cure or vaccine has been discovered as of now and taking precautions like staying at home are the only possible solutions. Our study analyzes the current trend of the disease in India and predicts future trends using time series forecasting. The official dataset provided by John Hopkins University through a GitHub repository has been used for the research for the time period of 22 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. The trend in cases, fatalities, and the people who have recovered until the date of 31 May 2020 has been discussed in the paper. It has been seen through the findings that the total number of cases is expected to rise to 2,15,000 by the end of May 2020 i.e. 31 May 2020 as per the AR (Autoregression) model. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model predicts the number of cases to be 2,05,000 until the same date. Actual data has shown that the number of confirmed cases is 1,90,609 as on 31 May 2020 giving a percentage error of 7.57% and 12.85% for ARIMA and AR model respectively. Comparison between the findings of the two models has been shown later in the paper. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Sobti, P.; Nayyar, A.; Nagrath, P.","3rd International Conference on Futuristic Trends in Network and Communication Technologies, FTNCT 2020",,31
342324,"Molecular detection of drug resistant polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Southwest, Nigeria",2020,"The rapid worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2, has created an urgent need for its diagnosis and treatment. As a result, many researchers have sought to find the most efficient and appropriate methods to detect and treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus over the past few months. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is currently used as one of the most reliable methods to detect the new virus; however, this method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires trained laboratory workers. Moreover, despite its high sensitivity and specificity, false negatives are reported, especially in non-nasopharyngeal swab samples that yield lower viral loads. Therefore, designing and employing faster and more reliable methods seems necessary. In recent years, many attempts have been made to fabricate various nanomaterial-based biosensors to detect viruses and bacteria in clinical samples. The use of nanomaterials plays a significant role in improving the performance of biosensors. Plasmonic biosensors, field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methods are only some of the effective ways to detect viruses. However, to use these biosensors to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, modifications must be performed to increase sensitivity and speed of testing due to the rapidly spreading nature of SARS-CoV-2, which requires an early point of care detection and treatment for pandemic control. Several studies have been carried out to show the nanomaterial-based biosensors' performance and success in detecting the novel virus. The limit of detection, accuracy, selectivity, and detection speed are some vital features that should be considered during the design of the SARS-CoV-2 biosensors. This review summarizes various nanomaterials-based sensor platforms to detect the SARS-CoV-2, and their design, advantages, and limitations.","Pishva, Parsa; Yüce, Meral",Emergent Mater,,31

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January - November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. RESULTS: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. CONCLUSION: Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality. Injury outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic should be addressed by timely public health responses.","Harmon, Katherine J; Fliss, Mike Dolan; Marshall, Stephen W; Peticolas, Kathy; Proescholdbell, Scott K; Waller, Anna E",Am J Emerg Med,,31

Wounding and fungal inoculation with Endoconidiophora polonica of spruce bark were carried out, and phloem tissues were frequently collected to follow the temporal and spatial progress of chemical and structural responses. The changes in (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, stilbene glucoside, and resin acid distribution, and accumulation patterns within the phloem, were mapped using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (cryo-ToF-SIMS), alongside detailed structural (LM, TEM, SEM) and quantitative chemical microanalyses of the tissues. Our results show that axial phloem parenchyma cells of Norway spruce contain (+)-catechins, the amount of which locally increases in response to fungal inoculation. The preformed, constitutive distribution and accumulation patterns of (+)-catechins closely follow those of stilbene glucosides. Phloem phenolics are not translocated but form a layered defense barrier with oleoresin compounds in response to pathogen attack. Our results suggest that axial phloem parenchyma cells are the primary location for (+)-catechin storage and synthesis in Norway spruce phloem. Chemical mapping of bark defensive metabolites by cryo-ToF-SIMS, in addition to structural and chemical microanalyses of the defense reactions, can provide novel information on the local amplitudes and localizations of chemical and structural defense mechanisms and pathogen-host interactions of trees.","Jyske, Tuula; Kuroda, Katsushi; Keriö, Susanna; Pranovich, Andrey; Linnakoski, Riikka; Hayashi, Noriko; Aoki, Dan; Fukushima, Kazuhiko",Molecules (Basel),,31

351394,Phase 1 Trial of a Therapeutic Anti-Yellow Fever Virus Human Antibody,2020,"Approximately 80 species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that cause disease are found environmentally and in animal reservoirs. Typically, pulmonary NTM infections are sporadic; extrapulmonary NTM (ENTM) infections are commonly outbreak associated. Recent sources of ENTM outbreaks in Minnesota include contaminated heater-cooler units used during cardiac surgery and contaminated hormone injections. We examined patient demographics and characteristics of ENTM isolates characterized by four Minnesota reference laboratories during 2013-2017 to assess potential value of systematic laboratory-based ENTM surveillance in Minnesota. Laboratories characterized 490 ENTM isolates, representing an estimated burden of 1.8/100,000 people/year in Minnesota. Thirty-one species or complexes were identified; most common were M. avium complex (31%), M. chelonae (22%), M. fortuitum (11%), and M. abscessus (4%). Most common specimen collection sites included skin and soft tissue (38%), blood (15%), neck lymph node or tissue (12%), sinus (8%), joint or bone (5%), device or implant (4%), and eye (3%). Median age of patients was 55 years (range: 2-98 years); 18% were from patients aged <18 years, 20% aged 18-44 years, 28% aged 45-64 years and 34% aged >65 years. Sex was documented for 238 (49%) patients; 127 (53%) were males. County information was available for 313 patients (64%); approximately half (49%) resided in metropolitan Minneapolis-Saint Paul. Laboratory data can be used for ENTM surveillance in Minnesota. Implementing laboratory-based surveillance can detect ENTM cases, provide a mechanism for obtaining clinical and epidemiological information, and enable earlier identification of potential health care transmission or community clusters.","Taylor, Joanne; Vagnone, Paula Snippes; Smith, Kirk; Walters, Jacy; Wengenack, Nancy; Deml, Sharon; Ferrieri, Patricia; Lynfield, Ruth",Minn Med,,31

The Covid-19 pandemic may have decreased PA and increased sedentariness for several reasons (e.g., closure of gyms, family-related time constraints, and reduced outdoor mobility). Yet, to date, there are no longitudinal studies that examined whether the pandemic affects PA levels and what factors help people remain physically active during lockdown. This study aims to investigate changes in U.S. residents' PA during (vs. before) the Covid-19 pandemic and predictors of changes, with a focus on PA smartphone applications (apps) and their features (i.e., motivational, educational, or gamification related). The study utilized a two-wave longitudinal survey design with an online panel. Healthy adults (N = 431) from 45 U.S. states self-reported their PA levels before and during lockdown. PA app use and app feature ratings were assessed. t-tests and regression analyses were conducted. Moderate PA, vigorous PA, and PA measured in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week decreased during lockdown (all p < .01). Controlling for PA before lockdown and individuals' PA intentions, PA app use was positively related to overall change in PA, measured in MET minutes per week (ß = 15.68, standard error = 7.84, p < .05). PA decreased less with increasing app use frequency. When app features were added to the model, a buffering effect for gamification features was identified. The Covid-19-caused lockdown decreased U.S. residents' PA levels by 18.2%. The use of PA apps may help buffer the decline, and gamification-related app features may be particularly helpful in this context.","Yang, Yanxiang; Koenigstorfer, Joerg",Transl Behav Med,,31

Docking studies suggest a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the ACE2-binding site. Both ACE2 and heparin can bind independently to spike protein in vitro, and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a scaffold. Electron micrographs of spike protein suggests that heparin enhances the open conformation of the RBD that binds ACE2. On cells, spike protein binding depends on both heparan sulfate and ACE2. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, heparin lyases, and lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and/or infection by pseudotyped virus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest a model in which viral attachment and infection involves heparan sulfate-dependent enhancement of binding to ACE2.

372567,Microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip for the point-of-care detection of emerging and re-emerging enteric coronaviruses in swine,2020,"IL-6 is involved both in immune responses and in inflammation, hematopoiesis, bone metabolism and embryonic development. IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1ß, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-&#954;B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is an NF-&#954;B target, simultaneous activation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-&#954;B activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases.","Hirano, Toshio",Int Immunol,,31

Individuals with substance use disorder have a higher risk of infection and may suffer from more severe forms of the disease. Our goal is to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity in individuals with different substance use and explore whether specific types of substance are potentially associated with more clinical risk factors which could increase morbimortality in this population. The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic.","Benzano, Daniela; Ornell, Felipe; Schuch, Jaqueline Bohrer; Pechansky, Flavio; Sordi, Anne Orgler; von Diemen, Lisia; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Psychiatry Res,,31
374608,MyD88 and beyond: a perspective on MyD88-targeted therapeutic approach for modulation of host immunity,2021,"Goal: COVID-19 has a drastic effect on world economic progress and different industries. As the main contributor to countries' economies, the construction industry faced multiple challenges due to pandemics. Therefore, it's essential to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the construction sector and develop safety practices in construction processes. This study proposed necessary construction practices and a crisis management framework needs to adopt in the COVID-19 scenario. Design / Methodology / Approach: At the first stage, data on negative impacts on the construction industry due to the pandemic was compiled. Then, experts were invited to propose emerging safety measures and practices to improve the safety of construction employees. Lastly, crises management framework was proposed, which provides an increased capability of taking measures during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Results showed that COVID-19 has an adverse effect on the construction sector of different developed and developing countries. Therefore, there is a need to incorporate proposed safety practices at construction sites and apply crises management framework to increase construction productivity during the pandemic. Limitations of the investigation: This study has certain limitations for instance the availability of data regarding construction sector was limited especially about small countries whose economies are not fully documented and construction sector is not regulated. The evaluation and assessment made in this study were generally subjective and it cannot be generalized to other sectors. This work could insist on enhancing the work plan for the future to encounter the uncertain circumstances for construction industry. Practical implications: This work will be useful for construction managers and policy makers to cope with COVID-19 and to adopt necessary safety measure for construction sector. This work also be helpful for other industry stakeholders to pinpoint risk management efforts that could be suitable for their firms. industrialists may use these research efforts to sort out the problem areas and propose an appropriate framework for industry. Originality / Value: This study will provide guidelines to construction professionals for taking necessary measures to cope with COVID-19 and to apply a crises management framework. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

374609,MyD88 and beyond: a perspective on MyD88-targeted therapeutic approach for modulation of host immunity,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The main objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of persistent dysphonia in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data were collected from those COVID-19 patients who, during the months of March to April 2020, were hospitalised in ward or intensive care unit at the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada. Patients with dysphonia prior to SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Informed consent was obtained orally by a telephone call, as well as clinical and epidemiological data. Patients who reported persistent dysphonia were assessed using the Voice Handicap Index 10, the maximum phonation time, the s/z ratio and a fibrolaryngoscope examination. Patients who reported persistent dysphagia were assessed with the Eating Assessment Tool 10. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were included in the study (48 men and 31 women). 10 ICU patients (25%) and 4 ward patients (10,3%) had dysphonia at least 3 months after hospital discharge, but no association was found between ICU admission and the presence of persistent dysphonia (P = 0.139). Persistent dysphonia in patients admitted to the ICU is associated with persistent dysphagia (P = 0.002), also the age of patients with persistent dysphonia is significantly higher than the age of non-dysphonic patients (P = 0.046). The most frequent exploratory finding was vocal cord paresis/paralysis (60.4%). CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies to show that persistence of dysphonia may be a consequence of COVID-19, so further studies are needed to assess the evolution and prognosis of these patients and the possible association of dysphonia with the severity of the disease.","Leis-Cofiño, Carlos; Arriero-Sánchez, Paula; González-Herranz, Ramón; Arenas-Brítez, Óscar; Hernández-García, Estefanía; Plaza, Guillermo",J. voice,,31
374765,"Type III, IV, and VI Collagens Turnover in Systemic Sclerosis - a Longitudinal Study",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the present study we aimed to create a model able to predict the short-term need of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. METHODS: We retrospectively revised data about all COVID-19 patients hospitalized at a University Hospital in Northern Italy, between March 1 and April 29, 2020. Several polynomial models (from first to fourth order) were fitted to estimate the relationship between the time and the number of occupied hospital beds during the entire period and after the local peak of the outbreak and to provide the prediction of short-term hospital beds demand. Model selection was based on the adjusted R-2 (aR(2)) Index and likelihood ratio test (LRT). RESULTS: We included 836 hospitalizations (800 COVID-19 patients). The median length of hospital in-stay was 12 days. According to the aR(2), the fourth order models best fitted the data considering the entire time period. When only the data after the peak was selected, no statistical improvement was found adding terms of order 3 and 4 and lower order polynomial models were considered for the forecasting of the hospital beds demand. Both approaches had a decreasing trend in the number of occupied beds along with time;however, the quadratic one showed a faster reduction in the predicted number of beds required by patients affected by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model to predict the hospital bed requirement during the descending phase of COVID-19 outbreak, the validation of which might contribute to decision makers policy in the next weeks of pandemic.","Hayden, E.; Airoldi, C.; Scotti, L.; Bellan, M.; Sottosanti, A.; Bergamasco, P.; Salamina, L.; Capponi, A.; Sainaghi, P.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progression in nine different countries (New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Sweden, and the USA). DESIGN: We conducted a cross-country comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with pharmacokinetic approaches. MAIN MEASURES: The rate of new daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in the nine countries was calculated from the World Health Organization's published data. Using a SIR-based model, we determined the infection (ß) and recovery (Î³) rate constants; their corresponding half-lives (t1/2ß and t1/2Î³); the basic reproduction numbers (R0 as ß/Î³); the rates of susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and recovered R(t) compartments; and the effectiveness of lockdown. Since this approach requires the epidemic termination to build the (I) compartment, we determined S(t) at an early epidemic stage using simple linear regressions. KEY RESULTS: In New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK, early-onset stay-at-home orders and restrictions followed by gradual deconfinement allowed rapid reduction in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (t1/2ß &#8804; 14 days) with R0 &#8804; 1.5 and rapid recovery (t1/2Î³ &#8804; 18 days). By contrast, in Sweden (no lockdown) and the USA (heterogeneous state-dependent lockdown followed by abrupt deconfinement scenarios), a prolonged plateau of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (terminal t1/2ß of 23 and 40 days, respectively) with elevated R0 (4.9 and 4.4, respectively) and non-ending recovery (terminal t1/2Î³ of 112 and 179 days, respectively) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lockdown with gradual deconfinement allowed shortening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and reducing contaminations. Lockdown should be considered as an effective public health intervention to halt epidemic progression.","Mégarbane, Bruno; Bourasset, Fanchon; Scherrmann, Jean-Michel",J. gen. intern. med,,31

The FCV-19S also showed good concurrent validity, as it was significantly and positively related to the Preventive Behaviors related to COVID-19 Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale as well as significantly and negatively related to the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. The scale also showed good internal consistency reliability. Further, the association of age with FCV-19S indicated that younger students experienced greater fear of COVID-19. The analyses of mean differences revealed that women as compared to men, bachelor's and master's students as compared to post-master's students, and unemployed students as compared to employed students experienced greater fear of the outbreak. Also, those suffering from severe anxiety experienced greater fear of COVID-19 followed by those suffering from moderate, mild, and minimal anxiety. Moreover, knowing someone suffering from the coronavirus, being afraid that someone close might contract the virus, and believing that the current COVID-19 situation adversely affects academic performance were linked to higher levels of fear of the pandemic.

To support the development of a COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30, 2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS: In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. INTERPRETATION: To date, persuasive evidence of important benefit in COVID-19 does not exist for any antiviral treatments, although for each treatment evidence has not excluded important benefit. Additional randomized controlled trials involving patients with COVID-19 will be needed before such treatments can be administered with confidence.","Liu, Wei; Zhou, Pengxiang; Chen, Ken; Ye, Zhikang; Liu, Fang; Li, Xiaotong; He, Na; Wu, Ziyang; Zhang, Qi; Gong, Xuepeng; Tang, Qiyu; Du, Xin; Ying, Yingqiu; Xu, Xiaohan; Zhang, Yahui; Liu, Jinyu; Li, Yun; Shen, Ning; Couban, Rachel J; Ibrahim, Quazi I; Guyatt, Gordon; Zhai, Suodi",CMAJ,,31
384425,COVID-19 - Recent advancements in identifying novel vaccine candidates and current status of upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,2020,"Radio synchrotron emission from the bridges of low-density gas connecting galaxy clusters and groups is a challenge for particle acceleration processes. In this work, we analyse the Coma radio bridge using new LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) observations at 144 MHz. LOFAR detects the bridge and its substructures with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. We find that the radio emission peaks on the NGC 4839 group. Towards the halo, in front of the NGC 4839 group, the radio brightness decreases and streams of radio emission connect the NGC 4839 group to the radio relic. Using X-ray observations, we find that thermal and non-thermal plasma are moderately correlated with a sub-linear scaling. We use archival radio data at 326 MHz to constrain the spectral index in the bridge, and quantify the distribution of particles and magnetic field at different frequencies. We find that the spectrum is steeper than $-1.4 \pm 0.2$, and that the emission could be clumpier at 326 MHz than at 144 MHz. Using cosmological simulations and a simplified approach to compute particle acceleration, we derive under which conditions turbulent acceleration of mildly relativistic electrons could generate the radio emission in the bridge. Assuming that the initial energy ratio of the seed electrons is $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ with respect to the thermal gas, we are able to reproduce the observed luminosity. Our results suggest that the seed electrons released by radiogalaxies in the bridge and the turbulence generated by the motion of gas and galaxies are essential to produce the radio emission.","Bonafede, A.; Brunetti, G.; Vazza, F.; Simionescu, A.; Giovannini, G.; Bonnassieux, E.; Shimwell, T.

METHODS: We performed a multiplex immune assay analysis and compared the plasma biomarkers of Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), acute COVID-19 infection (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and control children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital in Chennai, India. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotypes. FINDINGS: PIMS-TS children had significantly elevated levels of cytokines, IFNÎ³, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFNß, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IL-Ra; elevated chemokines, CCL2, CCL19, CCL20 and CXCL10 and elevated VEGF, Granzyme B and PDL-1 in comparison to COVID-19, seropositive and controls. COVID-19 children had elevated levels of IFNÎ³, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFNß, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-10, CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10 and VEGF in comparison to seropositive and/or controls.

We sought to describe the epidemiologic and clinical profile of newly admitted patient in chronic haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon and evaluate their survival between 90days of dialysis initiation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a cohort study of 6months from April to October 2020. End stage renal disease patients newly admitted in the haemodialysis facility of the General Hospital of Douala were included. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were identified. Socio-demographic, clinical and biological data at dialysis initiation as well as mortality between the 90days of dialysis initiation were registered. RESULTS: A total of 57 incident patients were recorded from April to October 2020 with a monthly mean of 9.5 patients. The mean age was 46.95±13.12years. Twenty-four COVID-19 were identified with a frequency of 49% among emergency admission. Pulmonary Ådema (79.2% vs. 42.4%; P=0.006) and uremic encephalopathy (83.4% vs. 53.6%; P=0.022) were more common in COVID-19. The overall survival at 90days was 48% with a tendency to poor survival among COVID-19 and patients with low socioeconomic level. In Cox regression, low socioeconomic level increase the risk of instant death by 3.08. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV2 seem to increase nephrology emergency and poor survival in haemodialysis at 90days.","Fouda Menye Epse Ebana, Hermine Danielle; Halle, Marie-Patrice; Mbele Onana, Charles; Mbatchou, Bertrand Hugo; Luma Namme, Henry; Ashuntantang Enow, Gloria",Nephrol. ther,,31

393902,Considerations for future novel human-infecting coronavirus outbreaks. LID - 260,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Marseille, France, following a first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in March-May 2020, a second epidemic phase occurred from June, involving 10 new variants. The Marseille-4 variant caused an epidemic that started in August and is still ongoing. METHODS: The 1038 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained in our laboratory by next-generation sequencing with Illumina technology were analysed using Nextclade and nextstrain/ncov pipelines and IQ-TREE. A Marseille-4-specific qPCR assay was implemented. Demographic and clinical features were compared between patients with the Marseille-4 variant and those with earlier strains. RESULTS: Marseille-4 harbours 13 hallmark mutations. One leads to an S477N substitution in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein targeted by current vaccines. Using a specific qPCR, it was observed that Marseille-4 caused 12-100% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Marseille from September 2020, being involved in 2106 diagnoses. This variant was more frequently associated with hypoxemia than were clade 20A strains before May 2020. It caused a re-infection in 11 patients diagnosed with different SARS-CoV-2 strains before June 2020, suggesting either short-term protective immunity or a lack of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Marseille-4 should be considered as a major SARS-CoV-2 variant. Its sudden appearance points towards an animal reservoir, possibly mink. The protective role of past exposure and current vaccines against this variant should be evaluated.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Devaux, Christian A; Gautret, Philippe; Bedotto, Marielle; Delerce, Jeremy; Brechard, Ludivine; Pinault, Lucile; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Fenollar, Florence; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,,31
393917,Identification of osalmid metabolic profile and active metabolites with anti-tumor activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells,2020,"Purpose of Review: Inflammatory signals have emerged as critical regulators of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. Specifically, HSCs are highly responsive to acute changes in systemic inflammation and this influences not only their division rate but also their lineage fate. Identifying how inflammation regulates HSCs and shapes the blood system is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underpinning these processes, as well as potential links between them. Recent Findings: A widening array of physiologic and pathologic processes involving heightened inflammation are now recognized to critically affect HSC biology and blood lineage production. Conditions documented to affect HSC function include not only acute and chronic infections but also autoinflammatory conditions, irradiation injury, and physiologic states such as aging and obesity. Summary: Recognizing the contexts during which inflammation affects primitive hematopoiesis is essential to improving our understanding of HSC biology and informing new therapeutic interventions against maladaptive hematopoiesis that occurs during inflammatory diseases, infections, and cancer-related disorders.","Hormaechea-Agulla, Daniel; Le, Duy T; King, Katherine Y",Curr Stem Cell Rep,,31

396391,Genetic Polymorphisms in the Host and COVID-19 Infection,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly within months despite global public health strategies to curb transmission by testing symptomatic patients and encouraging social distancing. Here, we summarize rapidly emerging evidence highlighting transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Viral load of asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients, viral shedding is highest before symptom onset suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms. Within universally tested subgroups, surprisingly high percentages of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic individuals were found. Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters. A Wuhan study showed an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission, and several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than the general population. This raises concern that health workers could act as silent disease vectors. Therefore, current public health strategies relying solely on 'symptom onset' for infection identification need urgent reassessment. Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients.","Huff, Hanalise V; Singh, Avantika",Clin. infect. dis,,31

412549,Increased Expression of the Multimerin-1 Gene in α-Synuclein Knokout Mice,2020,"Introduction: In addition to hand washing and wearing masks, social distancing and reducing exposure time to <15 minutes are the most effective measures against the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, three of these guidelines are very difficult, if not impossible, for nursing babies: they cannot wear masks, stay six feet away from the lactating breasts, nor consistently finish within 15 minutes while nursing. We report a case of a nursing mother with SARS-CoV-2 infection, documenting changes of immune cells and cytokines in breast milk with and without the infection. Case Description: With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we obtained expressed breast milk samples from a lactating mother before and during SARS-CoV-2 infection as documented by reverse transcription-PCR. Using flow cytometry analysis, we measured the immune cell profiles and expression of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) in milk leukocytes before and during infection. Results: There was an eightfold increase in IFN&#945;+ milk leukocytes, from 1% before SARS-CoV-2 infection to 8% when actively infected. The milk macrophages showed the highest increase in IFN&#945; expression. Both T and B lymphocytes showed mild increase. Innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells showed no increase in IFN&#945; expression and the dendritic cells actually showed a reduction. Conclusion: We document the presence and high expression of IFN&#945; in the breast milk macrophages of a lactating mother with confirmed COVID-19, compared with her milk before the infection.","Yu, Jack C; Khodadadi, Hesam; Salles, Évila Lopes; Pham, Quyen; Patel, Pinkal; Baban, Babak",Breastfeed Med,,31

The successes of mobility interventions demonstrate how policies can help limit the person-to-person interactions that are essential to infection. With significant community spread, experts predict this virus will continue to be a threat until safe and effective vaccines have been developed and widely deployed. We aim to understand mobility changes during the first major quarantine period in the United States, measured via mobile device tracking, by assessing how people changed their behavior in response to policies and to weather. Here, we show that consistent national messaging was associated with consistent national behavioral change, regardless of local policy. Furthermore, although human behavior did vary with outdoor air temperature, these variations were not associated with variations in a proxy for the rate of encounters between people. The independence of encounters and temperatures suggests that weather-related behavioral changes will, in many cases, be of limited relevance for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Both of these results are encouraging for the potential of clear national messaging to help contain any future pandemics, and possibly to help contain COVID-19.","Wu, Yihan; Mooring, Todd A; Linz, Marianna",Proc.

The whole process of vaccination was monitored by clinical pharmacists, and the occurrence, types, severity of adverse reactions were recorded in detail. Through the investigation and analysis on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination of the 2305 people, the important role and value of clinical pharmacists in the vaccination process was elaborated. Common adverse reactions included local pain, dizziness and fatigue, with the incidence rates of 2.09%, 0.67% and 0.49%, respectively. Others such as headache, nausea, skin itching, cough, palpitation, dry mouth, hand anesthesia, local induration, muscle soreness, local rash, and chill had incidence rates of less than 0.30%. Three cases of serious adverse events that occurred in this vaccination returned to normal after treatment, with no subsequent discomfort. Clinical pharmacists played an important role in the safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination. The safety of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is good. Most of the common adverse reactions were mild and tolerable, with generally low incidence.

The COVID-19 lockdown offered us a unique opportunity to test, in a quasi-experimental setting, the impact of lockdown movement restrictions on children's MC. We assessed the motor competence of 114 children aged 6-9 years using the motor competence assessment. All children were tested before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Chi-square and 2 × 2 ANOVA (sex by moment) were used to further analyze the data. Regardless of sex, motor performances in all tests (except for jumping sideways in boys) were lower when compared with performances before lockdown. There was a marked decreasing trend in children's levels of MC, shifting from an upper to a lower quartile in different tests. The results after the lockdown were always significantly inferior to the results before lockdown in all motor tests (except jumping sideways), in the three components of MC, and in global MC. Children's global MC score decreased by an average of 13 points in boys and 16 points in girls.

As is the case for all countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where the number of reported cases reached more than 392 K in the first week of April 2021, was heavily affected by this pandemic. In this study, we introduce a new simulation model to examine the pandemic evolution in two major cities in KSA, namely, Riyadh (the capital city) and Jeddah (the second-largest city). Consequently, this study estimates and predicts the number of cases infected with COVID-19 in the upcoming months. The major advantage of this model is that it is based on real data for KSA, which makes it more realistic. Furthermore, this paper examines the parameters used to understand better and more accurately predict the shape of the infection curve, particularly in KSA. The obtained results show the importance of several parameters in reducing the pandemic spread: the infection rate, the social distance, and the walking distance of individuals. Through this work, we try to raise the awareness of the public and officials about the seriousness of future pandemic waves. In addition, we analyze the current data of the infected cases in KSA using a novel Gaussian curve fitting method. The results show that the expected pandemic curve is flattening, which is recorded in real data of infection. We also propose a new method to predict the new cases. The experimental results on KSA’s updated cases reveal that the proposed method outperforms some current prediction techniques, and therefore, it is more efficient in fighting possible future pandemics.","Hassanat, Ahmad B.; Mnasri, Sami Aseeri Mohammed A.; Alhazmi, Khaled Cheikhrouhou Omar Altarawneh Ghada Alrashidi Malek Tarawneh Ahmad S.; Almohammadi, Khalid S.; Almoamari, Hani",Sustainability,,31

RESULTS: During the study period from March 14, 2020 to October 19, 2020, there was a total of 67 SARS-CoV-2 ICU admitted patients who underwent simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV testing by PCR. Of those patients, 8 (12%) tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. There were 6 (75%) males, the mean age ± SD was 44.4 ± 11.8 years, and 7 (87.5%) were obese. Of the patients, 7 (87.5%) were non-smokers, 1 (12.5%) had diabetes mellitus, 1 (12.5%) had heart failure, and 1 (12.5%) had been on anti-platelet therapy. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 21.1 ± 11.6 days and the average ICU LOS was 10.9 ± 6.03 days. All patients received supportive therapy and all were treated with corticosteroid. Of all the patients, 4 (50%) were discharged home and 3 (37.5%) died. CONCLUSION: This case series is an important addition to the medical knowledge as it showed the interaction of the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.","Elhazmi, Alyaa; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Sallam, Hend; Al-Omari, Awad; Alhumaid, Saad; Mady, Ahmad; Al Mutair, Abbas",Travel Med Infect Dis,,31
424411,Ecological Barrier Deterioration Driven by Human Activities Poses Fatal Threats to Public Health due to Emerging Infectious Diseases,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and laboratory findings in patients with SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) related acute pancreatitis. METHODS: This systematic review was based on a database search for articles of COVID-19 related acute pancreatitis in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection that included age, gender, presenting symptoms, the onset of symptoms, laboratory values, imaging findings and exclusion of common causes of pancreatitis. RESULTS: Altogether 35 articles comprising 37 patients were included. Acute pancreatitis was the first presentation of COVID-19 in 43% of patients, concurrent with general or respiratory symptoms in 14% of patients or delayed after general or pulmonary symptoms by an average of 10 ± 5 d (range, 1 - 19 d) in 43% of patients. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated in 87% and 100% of patients. In 50% and 84%, amylase and lipase levels exceeded three-fold the upper normal limit. Pancreatic necrosis was reported in 6% of patients and in 12% of patients, the pancreas appeared normal. Three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the bi-modal pattern of the onset of symptoms supports both the cytotoxic and the immune-related pathogenesis of the pancreatic injury. Acute pancreatitis may be the first symptom of COVID-19 infection. Necrosis of the pancreas is rare.","Bircakova, Bianka; Bruha, Radan; Lambert, Lukas; Grusova, Gabriela; Michalek, Pavel; Burgetova, Andrea",Scand J Gastroenterol,,31

Here, we evaluate the potency of a previously described mAb J08 against these variants using cell-based assays and delve into the molecular details of the binding interaction using cryo-EM. We show that mAb J08 has low nanomolar affinity against VoCs, binds high on the receptor binding domain (RBD) ridge and is therefore unaffected by most mutations, and can bind in the RBD-up and -down conformations. These findings further validate the phase II/III human clinical trial underway using mAb J08 as a monoclonal therapy.

431694,Potential Impacts of Prebiotics and Probiotics in Cancer Prevention,2020,"Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a time there is no preventive vaccine nor specific drug available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It would be an absolute tragedy if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined in any manner. Based on the genotyping of 7818 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to May 1, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have had mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most devastating mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been unfortunately used by countries around the world to diagnose COVID-19. Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrong with a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio and mutation $h$-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is the most non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings enable researchers to target the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02188v1.pdf,31

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, were assessed by neurologists. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included in the study, 63% were male; the median age was 58 years (IQR: 47-66). Forty-seven patients (64.4%) reported headaches, which had most frequently begun on the first day of symptoms, were bilateral (94%), presenting severe intensity (53%) and a migraine phenotype (51%). Twelve patients (16.4%) presented with headache triggered by coughing. Eleven (15%) patients reported a continuous headache. Twenty-eight patients (38.4%) presented with anosmia and 29 (39.7%) with ageusia. Patients who reported hyposmia/anosmia and/or hypogeusia/ageusia experienced headache more frequently than those without these symptoms (OR: 5.39; 95% CI:1.66-17.45; logistic regression). Patients with anosmia and ageusia presented headache associated with phonophobia more often compared to those with headache without these complaints (Chi-square test; p < 0.05). Headache associated with COVID-19 presented a migraine phenotype more frequently in those experiencing previous migraine (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Headaches associated with COVID-19 are frequent, are generally severe, diffuse, present a migraine phenotype and are associated with anosmia and ageusia.","Rocha-Filho, Pedro Augusto Sampaio; Magalhães, João Eudes",Cephalalgia,,31

437861,Phageome-based vaccination and human innate immune modulation could be a useful strategy to control human Coronavirus infections,2021,"In the last two decades, three unknown pathogens have caused outbreaks, generating severe global health concerns. In 2003, after nucleic acid genotyping, a new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). After nine years, another coronavirus emerged in the middle east and was named MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus). Finally, in December 2019, a new unknown coronavirus was isolated from a cluster of patients and was named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019). This review aims to propose a complete overview of autopsy in the three coronaviruses over the past two decades, showing its pivotal role in the management of unknown diseases. A total of 116 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 14 studies were collected concerning SARS-CoV (87 autopsy reports, from Asian and American countries), 2 studies for MERS-CoV (2 autopsy reports, from Middle-East Asian countries), and 100 studies on SARS-CoV-2 (930 autopsy reports). Analyzing the data obtained on COVID-19, based on the country criterion, a large number of post-mortem investigation were performed in European countries (580 reports), followed by American countries (251 reports). It is interesting to note that no data were found from the Oceanic countries, maybe because of the minor involvement of the outbreak. In all cases, autopsy provided much information about each unknown coronavirus. Despite advanced technologies in the diagnostic fields, to date, autopsy remains the gold standard method to understand the biological features and the pathogenesis of unknown infections, especially when awareness of a pathogen is restricted and the impact on the healthcare system is substantial. The knowledge gained through this technique may positively influence therapeutic strategies, ultimately reducing mortality.","Sessa, Francesco; Salerno, Monica; Pomara, Cristoforo",Medicina (Kaunas),,31

These are unintentionally overshadowing others such as food security, increase of human population, preservation of natural ecosystems, water scarcity and reliability of energy supply, amongst others. This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy. This new biodiplomacy should have the courage to develop and act in the interests of the human population overall, and not be undone by the legitimate but narrower interests of any single national priority.

Accurate and timely information can help the public understand the outbreak and manage their lives. Presented here is a study of how residents of Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, use media for information seeking, scanning, and sharing while under lockdown through in-depth interviews. We find that (1) individuals primarily acquire information through information scanning from official governmental sources, (2) information sharing is more frequent with family members through private channels than with one's extended social networks and the general public through pubic channels mostly due to concerns with censorship, and (3) individuals' information need and information use change substantially during different stages of the outbreak. These findings provide insights into how individuals in China use different media for information during an unprecedented public health crisis and make sense of the limited and often confusing and contradictory information that is available to them. Such findings can inform future health communication efforts during EID outbreaks.","Tang, Lu; Zou, Wenxue",Health Commun,,31

Movement of all close contact was restricted for 14 days and they underwent laboratory testing with polymerase chain reaction. The reproduction numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were estimated. RESULTS: The reproduction number for symptomatic cases was estimated to be 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-2.9). The relative infectiousness of asymptomatically infected cases was estimated to be 0.27 (95% CI: 0.03-0.81) of symptomatic cases.

Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging technique benefits from its high diagnostic accuracy and robustness, it has become an indispensable way for COVID-19 mass testing. Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot COVID-19 CT imaging based diagnostic tasks.","Jiang, Yifan; Chen, Han; Han, David K.; Ko, Hanseok",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00596v1.pdf,31

447003,Author Correction: Pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19: a key role for monocytes and macrophages,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to implement lockdown policies to curb the spread of the disease. These policies explicitly encouraged homeworking, hence reducing the number of commuters with the implicit assumption that restricting peoples' movement reduces risk of infection for travellers and other people in their areas of residence and work. Yet, the spatial interrelation of different areas has been rarely addressed both in the public discourse and in early accounts of the various consequences of COVID-19. METHODS: Our study proposes a spatial analysis of the association between commuting flows and COVID-19 mortality in England between March and June 2020, using a range of publicly available area-level data. To account for spatial correlation, we used a structural mobility gravity model to analyse commuting flows between Local Authority Districts. By accounting for these spatial dependencies, we temper concerns of bias and inefficiency affecting simple linear estimates. Additionally, we disentangle the direct and indirect (from other areas) influence of commuting on COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: The results of our spatial regression models suggest that higher commuting flows - in general and particularly by public transport - are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Our results are consistent with a reduction in COVID-related mortality after the introduction of a national lockdown in March. The spatial-lag term is statistically significant, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial dependencies. CONCLUSION: We suggest that considering spatial interactions through commuting or travel motivations may offer interesting perspectives on the trade-off between health and economic activity during lockdowns.","Francetic, Igor; Munford, Luke",Eur. j. public health,,31

A controlled human infection model (CHIM) would accelerate the efficacy assessment of candidate vaccines. This strategy would require deliberate exposure of volunteers to SARSCoV2 with no currently available treatment and a small but definite risk of serious illness or death. This raises complex questions about the social and ethical acceptability of risk to individuals, given the potential benefit to the wider population, and as such, a study cannot be done without public involvement. We conducted a structured public consultation with 57 individuals aged 20-40 years to understand public attitudes to a CHIM, and pre-requisites for enrolment. The overall response to this strategy was positive, and many would volunteer altruistically. Carefully controlled infection is viewed as safer than natural exposure to wild virus. The prolonged social isolation required for the proposed CHIM is considered an obstacle but not insurmountable, with reasonable compensation and supportive care. Given the significant level of public interest, a CHIM should be done as open science with regular, controlled dissemination of information into the public domain. Importantly, there was a strong view that the final decision whether to conduct a CHIM should be in the hands of qualified and experienced clinician-scientists and the authorities.","Gbesemete, D; Barker, M; Lawrence, W T; Watson, D; de Graaf, H; Read, R C",BMC Med,,31

We describe the change in neurosurgical workload at a tertiary neurosciences center in the United Kingdom after the first pandemic wave in comparison with the months before and during the first wave. METHODS: A retrospective review of theatre records and electronic referrals-between December 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020-was performed. The months of December 2019-February 2020 were designated as pre-COVID months and March-May 2020 were designated as COVID months. The time period from June to August 2020 was designated as post-wave months. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). RESULTS: Referrals declined from 572 in January to a nadir of 352 in April before a steady rise to August. Referral volumes for degenerative spinal disease and traumatic brain injuries showed a statistically significant change during the year. On average, 212 procedures per month were performed in the pre-COVID months, 167 procedures per month during COVID months, and 232 procedures per month in the post-wave months. The number of patients on the waiting list for scheduled operations rose from March (785 patients) onward to a peak of 997 patients in July.

457311,Plants derived therapeutic strategies targeting chronic respiratory diseases: Chemical and immunological perspective,2020,"We previously found that polydatin could attenuate renal oxidative stress in diabetic mice and improve renal fibrosis. Recent evidence shows that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to inflammatory and fibrotic processes in diabetic kidneys. In this study we investigated whether polydatin attenuated renal fibrosis by regulating Nox4 in vitro and in vivo. In high glucose-treated rat glomerular mesangial cells, polydatin significantly decreased the protein levels of Nox4 by promoting its K48-linked polyubiquitination, thus inhibited the production of ROS, and eventually decreasing the expression of fibronectin (FN) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the main factors that exacerbate diabetic renal fibrosis. Overexpression of Nox4 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on FN and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, the expression of Connexin32 (Cx32) was significantly decreased, which was restored by polydatin treatment. Cx32 interacted with Nox4 and reduced its protein levels. Knockdown of Cx32 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on the expression of FN and ICAM-1. In the kidneys of streptozocin-induced diabetic mice, administration of polydatin (100 mg·kg-1·d-1, ig, 6 days a week for 12 weeks) increased Cx32 expression and reduced Nox4 expression, decreased renal oxidative stress levels and the expression of fibrotic factors, eventually attenuating renal injury and fibrosis. In conclusion, polydatin promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Nox4 by restoring Cx32 expression, thereby decreasing renal oxidative stress levels and ultimately ameliorating the pathological progress of diabetic renal fibrosis. Thus, polydatin reduces renal oxidative stress levels and attenuates diabetic renal fibrosis through regulating the Cx32-Nox4 signaling pathway.","Chen, Zhi-Quan; Sun, Xiao-Hong; Li, Xue-Juan; Xu, Zhan-Chi; Yang, Yan; Lin, Ze-Yuan; Xiao, Hai-Ming; Zhang, Meng; Quan, Shi-Jian; Huang, He-Qing",Acta pharmacol.

The typical manifestation of kidney involvement is acute kidney injury (AKI); however, there is a lack of consensus data regarding AKI epidemiology in COVID-19. This systematic literature review aims to bridge this knowledge gap. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: MEDLINE and Cochrane library were systematically searched for the literature related to AKI in COVID-19 patients of all ages. MedRxIV was searched for relevant unpublished manuscripts. Two reviewers independently assessed the literature on the incidence of AKI and mortality, extracting the need for kidney replacement therapy (KRT). RESULTS: Sixty studies (n = 43,871 patients) were included in this review. The pooled incidence of AKI among COVID-19 patients was 19.45% (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 14.63-24.77%), while the pooled incidence of AKI COVID-19 patients requiring KRT was 39.04% (16.38-64.57%). The pooled proportion of COVID+ patients was significantly lower at 8.83% (5.64% to 12/66%). The overall mortality of COVID-19 patients was calculated to be 17.71% (95% CI: 11.49-24.93%), while the mortality among patients with AKI was higher at 54.24% (95% CI: 44.70-63.63%). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive systematic review summarizes the available literature pertaining to AKI epidemiology in COVID-19 patients and highlights the incidence, associated mortality, and the need for KRT in this susceptible population.","Raina, Rupesh; Mahajan, Zubin A; Vasistha, Prabhav; Chakraborty, Ronith; Mukunda, Krishna; Tibrewal, Abhishek; Neyra, Javier A",Blood Purif,,31

458965,Cytokines and inflammatory mediators as promising markers of polymyositis/dermatomyositis,2020,"For estimating the infection risk from virus-containing airborne droplets, it is crucial to consider the interplay of all relevant physical-chemical effects that affect droplet evaporation and sedimentation times. For droplet radii in the range 70 nm < R < 60 µm, evaporation can be described in the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion-limited. Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate, the time-dependent droplet size, and the sedimentation time, including evaporation cooling and solute osmotic-pressure effects. Evaporation makes the time for initially large droplets to sediment much longer and thus significantly increases the viral air load. Using recent estimates for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sputum and droplet production rates while speaking, a single infected person that constantly speaks without a mouth cover produces a total steady-state air load of more than 104 virions at a given time. In a midsize closed room, this leads to a viral inhalation frequency of at least 2.5 per minute. Low relative humidity, as encountered in airliners and inside buildings in the winter, accelerates evaporation and thus keeps initially larger droplets suspended in air. Typical air-exchange rates decrease the viral air load from droplets with an initial radius larger than 20 µm only moderately.","Netz, Roland R",J Phys Chem B,,31

461715,Identification of Monocytes Associated with Severe COVID-19 in the PBMCs of Severely Infected patients Through Single-Cell Transcriptome Sequencing,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on the eating habits, dietary intake, and purchasing behaviours of students. At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to identify the eating habits of school students, in particular, who live in low-income countries, during the lockdown period. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the influence of COVID-19 on the eating habits, quality and quantity of food intake among school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2398 primary and secondary school students aged 6-18 year old through an online questionnaire which included questions on socio-demographic, eating habits as well as quality and quantity of food intake. Students over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire on their own, whereas for students under the age of 12 years, the students' guardians were instructed to answer the questionnaire on their behalf. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and McNemar tests were applied to perform a comparison between general dietary habits before and during COVID-19. Also, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare the median scores of food quality and quantity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on student's sociodemographic. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in eating home-cooked foods (91.6%), avoiding ordering food from outside per week (93.3%) and buying groceries online (7.7%) (p < 0.001). There was a marked increase in the students reporting fear about food hygiene outside the home from 20.8% before COVID-19 to 72.9% during the COVID-19 period (p < 0.001). The results showed that the median score for food quality during the COVID-19 pandemic (11.0/6.0) was significantly higher than the before COVID-19 period (10.0, IQR = 8.0) (p < 0.001). The results revealed that the median score for food quantity before the COVID-19 pandemic (15.0, IQR = 5.0) was significantly higher than the during COVID-19 pandemic (14.0, IQR = 7.0) (p < 0.001). The results showed significant differences between the before and during COVID-19 period for food quality and quantity across socio-demographic variables (gender, age group, parent's highest level of education, monthly household income, and household size). During the COVID-19 pandemic, students from a high-income and a small size family had the highest score in terms of food quality and quantity among other counterparts when compared to other counterparts. CONCLUSION: Eating habits have significantly altered among school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of some good healthy habits enhanced among students, the quantity and the quality of the food was compromised. Therefore, the responsible officials at the Ministry of Education must focus on enhancing school students' awareness towards increased intake of healthy food and adopting good eating habits during the spread of pandemics and health diseases to avoid its negative effects on students.","Radwan, Afnan; Radwan, Eqbal; Radwan, Walaa",Appetite,,31

Thus far, the literature has not detailed the experience of stress testing in this patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients that recovered from COVID-19-related hospitalizations and underwent SPECT MPI studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. RESULTS: 15 patients (median age 60 years, 67% male) were identified with COVID-19-related hospitalization and then underwent SPECT MPI imaging after recovery. During COVID-19-related hospitalization (median length of stay 8 days), patients received various COVID-19 therapies; 3 required mechanical ventilation. Stress tests (4 Exercise, 11 Pharmacologic) were performed 65 days (interquartile range 31-94 days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19. None of the patients experienced serious adverse events during or after stress testing. One patient required regadenoson reversal using aminophylline due to chest pain. CONCLUSION: Over time, more patients that recover from COVID-19 infection will require MPI testing for myocardial ischemia evaluation. Our study provides some information regarding performing stress testing in patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization. Further studies are recommended to establish formal protocols for testing in this cohort.","Hasnie, Usman A; Hawi, Riem; Andrikopoulou, Efstathia; Iskandrian, Ami E; Hage, Fadi G",J. nucl. cardiol,,31

465511,Nanobiosystems for Antimicrobial Drug-Resistant Infections,2021,"The rapid adoption of online social media platforms has transformed the way of communication and interaction. On these platforms, discussions in the form of trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in real-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public awareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to manipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this article, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the manipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose 'Manipify', a framework for automatic detection and analysis of malicious users for Twitter trends. Our framework consists of three distinct modules: i) user classifier, ii) hashtag classifier, and ii) trend analyzer. The user classifier introduces a novel approach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user behaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the hashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting in examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the trend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach, linguistic features and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves 0.91 accuracy in classifying the manipulators. We further test Manipify on the dataset comprising of 665 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9 million users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly dominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher contribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots. Furthermore, we present two case studies of hashtag-wars and anti-state propaganda to implicate the real-world application of our research.","Kausar, Soufia; Tahir, Bilal; Mehmood, Muhammad Amir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14872v1.pdf,31

Study findings will be summarized in a CSC Model Adaptation Guide , which will identify modifications as fidelity consistent or not, and their impact on service utilization and care outcomes. Discussion : A CSC Model Adaptation Guide will inform CSC programs, and the state and local mental health authorities to which they are accountable, regarding modifications to CSC services and the impact of these changes on care process, and participant service utilization and outcomes. The guide will also inform the development of tailored technical assistance that CSC programs may need within OnTrackNY, the EPINET network, and CSC programs nationally.

To analyze changes in food consumption and eating behaviors in high-school adolescents during the first confinement, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the end of confinement in Spain. Changes in the frequency or quantity of consumption of different types of food and food-related behaviors were analyzed. Socioeconomic and health-related variables were also considered. To determine whether dietary changes were related to socioeconomic position (SEP), Poisson regression models with robust variance were estimated. Overall, there were some changes towards a healthier diet such as an increase in fruit consumption (38.9%) and a decrease in the consumption of soft drinks (49.8%), sweets and pastries (39.3%), and convenience foods (49.2%). Some changes, however, were related to less healthy behaviors, such as a more irregular pattern of meal distribution (39.9%) or an increase in snacking between meals (56.4%). Changes towards less healthy eating were also related to students' SEP. The risk of worsening the diet was found to be 21% higher in adolescents from a more disadvantaged SEP. Future public policies could be adapted to avoid increasing nutritional and health inequalities.","Aguilar-Martínez, Alicia; Bosque-Prous, Marina; González-Casals, Helena; Colillas-Malet, Ester; Puigcorbé, Susanna; Esquius, Laura; Espelt, Albert",Nutrients,,31

While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlighting the need for larger and well-annotated datasets.","Jiang, Xuan; Rayner, Simon; Luo, Min-Hua",J Med Virol,,31

Plants have given and continue to give compounds with great efficiency and low toxicity, some of them being a starting point for extremely effective synthetic substances. Although herbal remedies are used mainly for preventive purposes, there are also guidelines issued by some countries that indicate the use of traditional remedies for different stages of COVID-19 disease.Europe has a long and strong tradition of using medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes, but clinical trials for this type of approach are scarce, compared to Asia. In this regard, a bridge between tradition and science, would have a strong impact on the capacity for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The paper reviews compounds of plant origin that have previously proven effective in counteracting some coronaviruses but also some of their major effects - direct action on virus replicative apparatus (viral entry or replication, action on the viral enzymatic system), collateral action of natural compounds on the immune system and also the contribution of herbal medicine as vaccine adjuvants are tackled.","Grigore, Alice; Cord, Daniel; Tanase, Cristiana; Albulescu, Radu",J Immunoassay Immunochem,,31

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy of the administration of the dietary supplement ARBOX, a molecular blend of quebracho and chestnut tannins extract and Vit B12, in patients affected by COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: 18 years of age or older, admitted to Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Buenos Aires University (Argentina), meeting the definition of ""COVID-19 confirmed case"" ( https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/coronavirus-COVID-19/definicion-de-caso ). Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study if the following criteria apply: 1. Any gender 2. &#8805;18 years old 3. Informed consent for participation in the study 4. Virological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (real-time PCR) Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. Pregnant and lactating patients 2. Patients who cannot take oral therapy (with severe cognitive decline, assisted ventilation, or impaired consciousness) 3. Hypersensitivity to polyphenols 4. Patients already in ICU or requiring mechanical ventilation 5. Patients already enrolled in other clinical trials 6. Decline of consent INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Experimental: TREATED ARM Participants will receive a supply of 28 -- 390 mg ARBOX capsules for 14 days. Patients will be supplemented with 2 capsules of ARBOX per day. Placebo Comparator: CONTROL ARM Participants will receive placebo supply for 14 days. The placebo will be administered with the identical dose as described for the test product. All trial participants will receive standard therapy, which includes: Antipyretics or Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine, as appropriate (treatment currently recommended by the department of Infectious Diseases of the Hospital de Clínicas that could undergo to modifications). In addition, if necessary: supplemental O2, non-invasive ventilation, antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Outcome Measures: Time to hospital discharge, defined as the time from first dose of ARBOX to hospital discharge [ Time Frame: Throughout the Study (Day 0 to Day 28) ] Secondary Outcome Measures: 28-day all-cause mortality [ Time Frame: Throughout the Study (Day 0 to Day 28) ]-proportion Invasive ventilation on day 28 [ Time Frame: Throughout the Study (Day 0 to Day 28) ]-proportion Level of inflammation parameters and cytokines [ Time Frame: day 1-14 ] -mean difference Difference in fecal intestinal microbiota composition and intestinal permeability [ Time Frame: day 1-14 ] Negativization of COVID-PCR at day 14 [ Time Frame: day 14 ]-proportion RANDOMIZATION: Potential study participants were screened for eligibility 24 hours prior to study randomization. Patients were randomly assigned via computer-generated random numbering (1:1) to receive standard treatment coupled with tannin or standard treatment plus placebo (control group). BLINDING (MASKING): Study personnel and participants are blinded to the treatment allocation, as both ARBOX and placebo were packed in identical containers. Thus, all the used capsules had identical appearance. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Considering an alpha error of 5%, a power of 80% a sample size of 70 patients per branch was estimated. 140 patients in total. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version is number V2, dated May 23, 2020. The first patient, first visit was on June 12, 2020; the recruitment end date was October 6, 2020. The protocol was not submitted earlier because the enrollment of some patients took place after the closure of the recruitment on the clinicaltrials platform. In fact, due to the epidemiological conditions, due to the decrease of the cases in Argentina during the summer period, the recruitment stopped t before reaching the number of 140 patients (as indicated in the webpage). However, since there was a new increase in cases, the enrolment was resumed in order to reach the number of patients initially planned in the protocol. The final participant was recruited on February 14, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, number: NCT04403646 , registered on May 27th, 2020.

493348,COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis,2020,"In the 5 months since initial reports of COVID-19 came to light, the death toll due to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly increased. The morbidity and mortality of the infection varies based upon patient age, comorbid conditions, viral load, and the availability of effective treatments. Findings from limited autopsies, clinical observations, and laboratory data suggest that high cytokine levels and a procoagulant state can precipitate acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill patients. To complicate matters, comorbidities may affect the response to medical treatments currently in use, all of which are still in trial phase. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) merits consideration in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients and is an avenue for clinical trials to pursue. If efficacious, faster recovery of patients may lead to shorter intensive care unit stays and less time on mechanical ventilation. Herein, we briefly discuss some of the various approaches currently being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on potential benefits of TPE for selected critically ill patients.","Tabibi, Seena; Tabibi, Tara; Conic, Rosalynn R Z; Banisaeed, Nassim; Streiff, Michael B",J Intensive Care Med,,31

Design and Setting: A national longitudinal survey using a framework based on evidence-based behaviour change models. The survey was administered to a national sample representative across sex, age and location was undertaken at two time points: May 1st to 5th, 2020, and July 1st to 7th, 2020. Results: Overall 2,056 surveys were completed across the first and second rounds, with 63% (1,296/2,056) completing both. Age range was 18-99 years (median 53, IQR: 34-64). Suboptimal physical distancing and self-quarantining if unwell/diagnosed was reported in one in four respondents and not getting a test at onset of symptoms reported in one in three. Those non-adherent to all three behaviours (19%, 60/323), were mainly male, younger, lived in major cities and reported fewer concerns or motivators to change behaviour. Overall, government lockdown measures were considered very important by 81% (835/1,032) and appropriate by 75% (772/1,029). Conclusions: Prior to the suppression of a second COVID-19 wave, a significant minority of Australians reported suboptimal behavioural adherence to vital policy strategies to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread, mostly young adults and men. Successful wave 2 suppression required consistent communication from political and health leaders and supportive public health and economic strategies. Additional lockdown and punitive strategies were needed in Victoria and were generally well-supported and adhered to. To limit subsequent lockdown, this work reinforces the need for a mix of communication around saving lives of the vulnerable, and other strategies targeting high risk groups, facilitation of easy testing and minimisation of financial impacts.","Enticott, Joanne; Slifirski, William; Lavoie, Kim L; Bacon, Simon L; Teede, Helena J; Boyle, Jacqueline A",Front Public Health,,31

Since the adoption of the Directive 2000/31/EC (the E-Commerce Directive) in 2000 digital services have gained market dominance, and this has become especially evident during the Covid-19 virus crisis when the importance of digital technologies in all aspects of modern life became prominent. It has clearly shown the dependency of the economy and the society on digital services highlighting both the benefits and the risks that stem from the current framework for the functioning of the services provided by the digital platforms regardless of whether they are defined as digital services or not. In the European Commission (EC) Communication ""Shaping Europe's Digital Future"" the EC committed to update the horizontal rules that define the responsibilities and obligations of digital service providers, and online platforms in particular. Additionally, the European Parliament's ""Report on the Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues posed"" highlights the need for legal clarity of platforms and users, as well as respect for fundamental rights in the light of the rapid development of technology. According to the current data, the digital platforms account for over 10% of the EUs 45 million users. These platforms are subject not only to the specific obligations in controlling their own risks, but also to a new oversight structure. In 2020 the EC initiative was finalized by the ""Proposal for a Regulation on a Single Market for Digital Service"" which addresses the negative consequences arisingfrom certain behaviours on platforms. Since the EU Internal market is impacted significantly by platforms that serve as intermediaries for business users to reach their customers, sometimes these companies assume control over the entire platform ecosystems, which in turn can grant them the opportunity to regulate certain relations. The controlling power comes from the practices that platform companies exercise and from using the data of the businesses and users operating on these platforms. This paper aims to analyse the current regulation on digital platforms and digital service provisions in the EU Internal Market and offer some conclusions on its possible impact on the market's functioning especially in the times of the Covid-19pandemic and subsequently.","Dumančić, Kosjenka PhD Associate Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,31

It is apparent that businesses and institutions are increasingly affected. COVID-19 discussions often focus on intensive care units in hospitals. However, COVID-19 also effects life-saving and -prolonging radiotherapy for patients suffering from cancer. METHOD: We have conducted a structured online survey among medical physicists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland from March 23rd to 26th 2020. In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination. RESULTS: 72.4% of the respondent's state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%). 75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks. All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%). DISCUSSION: The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges. The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically. The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business.","Reuter-Oppermann, Melanie; Müller-Polyzou, Ralf; Wirtz, Holger; Georgiadis, Anthimos",PLoS One,,31

It may advance to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. Ultrasonography has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Objective Lack of sufficient information in this region on sonological prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, lead us to design the survey and may also serve as reference for further researches. Method This is a cross sectional study with 600 participants, conducted at Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Province 4 of Nepal, from September to October 2017. Ethical approval is taken from the Institutional review board. The study group includes the participants referred for abdominal sonography from outpatient department. Result In present survey, 367 (61.2%) are female and 233 (38.8%) are male participants. The mean age is 41.6 years and median age is 38 years. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver in our observation is 229 cases (38.2%) of which, 102 cases (44.5%) are male and 127 cases (55.4%) are female participants. Normal liver was seen in 61.8%, Grade one fatty liver was discovered in 24.8%, Grade one in 12.6% and Grade three in 0.6%. The mean liver size in those with fatty liver was 14.1 cm. Conclusion Province 4 of Nepal is not exempt from the growing epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with prevalence of 38.2%. The study shows that with higher grades of fatty liver, the size of liver is also increased and the mean age of the participants involved is also in the higher side of the spectrum.","Shrestha, M K; Ghartimagar, D; Jhunjhunwala, A K; Thapa, M",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,31

502420,Potential use of Citrus essential oils against acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Systemic vascular injury occurs in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: To clarify the role of inflammatory factors in COVID-19 vascular injury, we used a multiplex immunoassay to profile 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only 1 cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines/growth factors. Additionally, only matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. We further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and multiple endothelial cell (EC) activation markers (soluble forms of CD146, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1]) and found that they were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have a unique inflammatory profile, and excessive MMP-1 and hyperactivation of ECs are associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Syed, Fahim; Li, Wei; Relich, Ryan F; Russell, Patrick M; Zhang, Shanxiang; Zimmerman, Michelle K; Yu, Qigui",J Infect Dis,,31

502569,Age-related susceptibility to Coronavirus infections: role of impaired and dysregulated host immunity,2020,"During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be fundamental to reduce simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is very relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse Although these strategies can be recommended, or even imposed, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the risks associated with a potential infection The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated To better understand these dynamics, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory for combining in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading In particular, we consider a disease spreading through a population, whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent’s health state At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agent’s strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents Our results show recurrent infection waves, which are usually seen in previous historic epidemic scenarios with voluntary quarantine In particular, such waves re-occur as the population reduces disease awareness Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies","Amaral, Marco A.; Oliveira, Marcelo M. de Javarone Marco A.","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals",,31

Among them, convalescent plasma administered to hospitalized patients has been unsuccessful, perhaps because antibodies should be administered earlier in the course of illness. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within 72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients became virtually impossible. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization. In the intention-to-treat population, severe respiratory disease developed in 13 of 80 patients (16%) who received convalescent plasma and 25 of 80 patients (31%) who received placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.94; P = 0.03), with a relative risk reduction of 48%. A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded 6 patients who had a primary end-point event before infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo showed a larger effect size (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.81). No solicited adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of high-titer convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 to mildly ill infected older adults reduced the progression of Covid-19.

Results: A total of 983 patients with COVID-19 (female, 48%; male, 52%) were enrolled. Significantly higher odds of 60-day mortality (p = .017) were observed in the hypertensive group. In the hypertensive group, even after adjustment in multivariate analysis, the subgroup of patients 70 years old and older had higher 28-day mortality and total 60-day mortality rates than the other age subgroups (bothp < .05). A total of 297 (89%) COVID-19 patients with hypertension survived, and 35 (11%) died. In addition, compared with hypertensive patients who survived COVID-19, non-survivors had more pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and stroke, higher blood pressure on admission, more severe inflammation, and more liver and kidney damage.Conclusion: Hypertension does not affect the outcome of COVID-19, which is different than the conclusions drawn in other studies. However, the 28-day mortality and total 60-day mortality rates of hypertensive patients (age &#8805; 70) with COVID-19 were significantly elevated, and compared with the group of survivors, non-surviving COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older, had more basic diseases and had a more severe clinical condition.","Zhong, Li; Wu, Yuting; Gao, Jinghua; Zhang, Jinxia; Xie, Qifeng; He, Huang; Ji, Jingjing; Liu, Zheying; Wang, Conglin; Liu, Zhifeng",Ann Med,,31

A role for the vasa vasorum?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced further challenges into Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions. Existing evidence suggests success rates for CPR in COVID-19 patients is low and the risk to healthcare professionals from this aerosol-generating procedure complicates the benefit/harm balance of CPR. METHODS: The study is based at a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom where all DNACPR decisions are documented on an electronic healthcare record (EHR). Data from all DNACPR/TEAL status forms between 1st January 2017 and 30th April 2020 were collected and analysed. We compared patterns of decision making and rates of form completion during the 2-month peak pandemic phase to an analogous period during 2019. RESULTS: A total of 16,007 forms were completed during the study period with a marked increase in form completion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a form completed were on average younger and had fewer co-morbidities during the COVID-19 period than in March-April 2019. Several questions on the DNACPR/TEAL forms were answered significantly differently with increases in patients being identified as suitable for CPR (23.8% versus 9.05%; pâ¯<â¯0.001) and full active treatment (30.5% versus 26.1%; pâ¯=â¯0.028). Whilst proportions of discussions that involved the patient remained similar during COVID-19 (95.8% versus 95.6%; pâ¯=â¯0.871), fewer discussions took place with relatives (50.6% versus 75.4%; pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis on senior decision making and conversations around ceilings of treatment appears to have changed practice, with a higher proportion of patients having DNACPR/TEAL status documented. Understanding patient preferences around life-sustaining treatment versus comfort care is part of holistic practice and supports shared decision making. It is unclear whether these attitudinal changes will be sustained after COVID-19 admissions decrease.","Coleman, Jamie J; Botkai, Adam; Marson, Ella J; Evison, Felicity; Atia, Jolene; Wang, Jingyi; Gallier, Suzy; Speakman, John; Pankhurst, Tanya",Resuscitation,,31

The marriage promotion and “responsible father” initiatives of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) serve as the primary example for this argument.

520840,Endothelial dysfunction and immunothrombosis as key pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding factors impacting deaths from COVID-19 is of the highest priority. Seasonal variation in environmental meteorological conditions affects the incidence of many infectious diseases and may also affect COVID-19. Ultraviolet (UV) A (UVA) radiation induces release of cutaneous photolabile nitric oxide (NO) impacting the cardiovascular system and metabolic syndrome, both COVID-19 risk factors. NO also inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV2. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between ambient UVA radiation and COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: COVID-19 deaths at the county level, across the USA, were modelled in a zero-inflated negative-binomial model with a random effect for states adjusting for confounding by demographic, socioeconomic and long-term environmental variables. Only those areas where UVB was too low to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis were modelled. We used satellite-derived estimates of UVA, UVB and temperature and relative humidity. Replication models were undertaken using comparable data for England and Italy. RESULTS: The mortality rate ratio (MRR) in the USA falls by 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40% to 15%) per 100 kJ m-2 increase in mean daily UVA. We replicated this in independent studies in Italy and England and estimate a pooled decline in MRR of 32% (95% CI 48% to 12%) per 100 kJ m-2 across the three studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that higher ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19-specific mortality. Further research on the mechanism may indicate novel treatments. Optimized UVA exposure may have population health benefits.","Cherrie, M; Clemens, T; Colandrea, C; Feng, Z; Webb, D J; Weller, R B; Dibben, C",Br. j. dermatol,,31
522165,BCG-induced trained immunity: can it offer protection against COVID-19?,2020,"COVID-19 is not deadly early in life, but mortality increases exponentially with age, which is the strongest predictor of mortality. Mortality is higher in men than in women, because men age faster, and it is especially high in patients with age-related diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, because these diseases are manifestations of aging and a measure of biological age. At its deepest level, aging (a program-like continuation of developmental growth) is driven by inappropriately high cellular functioning. The hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging explains why COVID-19 vulnerability (lethality) is an age-dependent syndrome, linking it to other age-related diseases. It also explains inflammaging and immunosenescence, hyperinflammation, hyperthrombosis, and cytokine storms, all of which are associated with COVID-19 vulnerability. Anti-aging interventions, such as rapamycin, may slow aging and age-related diseases, potentially decreasing COVID-19 vulnerability.","Blagosklonny, Mikhail V",Aging (Albany NY),,31
523502,The Implications of COVID-19 to Ophthalmology,2021,"BACKGROUND: In Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus was detected. The virus causing COVID-19 was related to a coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The virus caused an epidemic in China and was quickly contained in 2003. Although coming from the same family of viruses and sharing certain transmissibility factors, the local health institutions in China had no experience with this new virus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on their prior experience with the 2003 SARS epidemic, health authorities in China recognized the need for personal protective equipment (PPE). Existing PPE and protocols were limited and reflected early experience with SARS; however, as additional PPE supplies became available, designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hubei Province adopted the World Health Organization guidelines for Ebola to create a protocol specific for treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This article describes the PPE and protocol for its safe and effective deployment and the implementation of designated hospital units for COVID-19 patients. To date, only 2 nurses working in China who contracted SARS-CoV-2 have died from COVID-19 in the early period of the epidemic (February 11 and 14, 2020).

How does COVID-19 compare with other emerging viral diseases of the past two decades? RECENT FINDINGS: Viral outbreaks differ in many ways, such as the individuals most at risk e.g. pregnant women for Zika and the elderly for COVID-19, their vectors of transmission, their fatality rate, and their transmissibility often measured as basic reproduction number. The risk of geographic spread via air travel differs significantly between emerging infectious diseases. SUMMARY: COVID-19 is not associated with the highest case fatality rate compared with other emerging viral diseases such as SARS and Ebola, but the combination of a high reproduction number, superspreading events and a globally immunologically naïve population has led to the highest global number of deaths in the past 20 decade compared to any other pandemic.","Wilder-Smith, A.",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517914/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-020-00129-9,31
591414,Advances in ER-Phagy and Its Diseases Relevance,2021-09-06,"With the spread of COVID-19 in China at the beginning of 2020, MOOCs, as a kind of currently popular online learning resource, have played a dominant role in higher education field. However, chiefly focusing on teaching organization and learning process in MOOCs, previous studies have paid inadequate attention to lecturers’ discourse. In order to provide some useful views on this issue, this study investigates EFL lecturers’ metadiscourse in Chinese university MOOCs to sketch its distinctive pattern across course types. Based on a self-built corpus, this research adopted interpersonal model as theoretical foundation and analyzed the frequency and functions of metadiscourse by AntConc 3.5.7 and IBM SPSS 23. Findings suggest that specific educational context in MOOCs leads to low frequency of metadiscourse and its use is mainly aimed at the enhancement of intelligibility, reliability, and interactivity. Besides, course types with different knowledge structures also exert certain influence on metadiscourse usage. Course types focusing on procedural knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to practical process) tend to apply metadiscourse to enhance intelligibility and interactivity, while the ones stressing declarative knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to explicit facts) attach more importance to reliability. Lastly, the paper concludes with implications for EFL lecturers’ metadiscourse in Chinese university MOOCs.","Zhang, Dongyun; Sheng, Diyun",Corpus Pragmat,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41701-021-00098-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527093/,31

Trust, important in all patient–provider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury. OBJECTIVES: In this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Within the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng. RESULTS: CHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs’ efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses’ insensitive behaviour, the CHWs’ attempts to repair patients’ institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system. CONCLUSION: Strategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.","Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Griffiths, Frances; Goudge, Jane",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011590/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044065,31

However, no study has evaluated the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients. Methods We analyzed the data from 62 healthcare facilities using the Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset. Results A total of 86 (0.1%) and 376 (0.2%) subarachnoid hemorrhage patients among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.7, p<.0001) after adjusting for gender, age strata, race, hypertension and nicotine dependence/tobacco use. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.1% versus 21.3%, p<.0001), acute kidney injury (43% versus 27.7%, p=0.0005), septic shock (44.2% versus 20.7%, p<.0001) and respiratory failure (64.0% versus 39.1%, p<.0001) were significantly higher among subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with those without COVID-19 (31.4% versus 12.2%, p<.0001). Conclusion The risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was not increased in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of systemic co-morbidities.","Qureshi, Adnan I.; Baskett, William I.; Huang, Wei; Shyu, Daniel; Myers, Danny; Lobanova, Iryna; Ishfaq, Muhammad F.; Naqvi, S.

Adolescents with disabilities have been isolated, and the burden on their families has been exacerbated. A cross-sectional survey was administered to adolescents with disability and to parents of disabled children to describe their experience during lockdown and their concerns or expectations about rehabilitation. A sample of 53 adolescents and 239 parents completed the survey. Adolescents were ages 13–18 years old (45.3% female). Most parents were between 35 and 55 years old (84.9% female). While 53.6% of the parents reported no positive effects of the lockdown, 92.5% of the adolescents expressed favorable consequences. The increased time spent with family members was judged positively by 27.2% of parents and by 64.2% of adolescents. Concern for their child’s disability was expressed by 47.3% of parents, while 73.6% of adolescents expressed concerns regarding the ban on meeting friends. In both groups, anxiety symptoms were correlated with the fear of contracting COVID-19 and with financial problems. Parents would have liked even more remote support from school and healthcare professionals, which was available for most participants. Thus, socioeconomic support, assistive technology and telerehabilitation strategies might help families with disabilities during a lockdown.","Faccioli, Silvia; Lombardi, Francesco; Bellini, Pierantonio; Costi, Stefania; Sassi, Silvia; Pesci, Maria Cristina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578678/,31

Children infected with MTB are more likely to progress to active TB (ATB); however, the molecular mechanism behind this process has long been a mystery. We employed the label-free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize differences in plasma proteins between ATB and latent TB infection (LTBI) in children. To detect differences that are indicative of MTB infection, we first selected proteins whose expressions were markedly different between the ATB and LTBI groups and the control groups (inflammatory disease control (IDC) and healthy control (HC) groups). A total of 521 proteins differed (> 1.5-fold or < 0.6-fold) in the LTBI group, and 318 proteins in the ATB group when compared with the control groups. Of these, 49 overlapping proteins were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed most proteins had a cellular and organelle distribution. The MTB infection status was mainly related to differences in binding, cellular and metabolic processes. XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A were selected and further verified by qPCR and western blot. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with LTBI. At the protein level, the expression of all these proteins by western blot in ATB/LTBI was consistent with the trends from proteomic detection. Our results provide important data for future mechanism studies and biomarker selection for MTB infection in children.","Li, Jieqiong; Sun, Lin; Xu, Fang; Xiao, Jing; Jiao, Weiwei; Qi, Hui; Shen, Chen; Shen, Adong",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262562/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.21179,31

Despite the global shortage of face masks, the public has adopted universal mask wearing as a preventive measure in many Asian countries. The COVID-19 mortality rate is higher among older people, who may find that wearing a face mask protects their physical health but jeopardizes their mental health. This study aimed to explore the associations between depressive symptoms, health beliefs, and face mask wearing behaviors among older people. By means of an online survey conducted between March and April 2020, we assessed depressive symptoms, health beliefs regarding COVID-19, and face mask use and reuse among community-dwelling older people. General linear models were employed to explore the associations among these variables. Of the 355 valid participants, 25.6% experienced depressive symptoms. Health beliefs regarding the perceived severity of disease (p = 0.001) and perceived efficacy of practicing preventive measures (p = 0.005) were positively associated with face mask use. Those who reused face masks (p = 0.008) had a stronger belief in disease severity (p < 0.001), had poorer cues to preventive measures (p = 0.002), and were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Mask reuse was significantly associated with depression only among those who perceived the disease as serious (p = 0.025) and those who had poorer cues to preventive measures (p = 0.004). In conclusion, health beliefs regarding perceived severity and efficacy contributed to more frequent face mask use, which was unrelated to depressive symptoms. Older people who had a stronger belief in disease severity had less adequate cues to preventive measures and reused face masks experienced greater depressive symptoms. A moderation effect of health beliefs (i.e., disease severity and cues to preventive measures) on face mask reuse and depression was observed.","Kwan, Rick Yiu Cho; Lee, Paul Hong; Cheung, Daphne Sze Ki; Lam, Simon Ching",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.590936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614680/,31
593365,Significant Publications on Infectious Diseases Pharmacotherapy in 2020,2021,"Objective: In March of 2020, at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in New York City (NYC) the Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) clinic at a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC), transitioned to the use of telehealth in order to implement social-distancing. We aimed to determine the impact of telehealth availability on patient access and adherence to MFM care at a FQHC during and after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Study Design: This is a retrospective, quality improvement project comparing non-adherence to scheduled visits over 3 timeframes: 1. ""Pre-COVID"" (11/1/2019-2/28/2020) 2. ""COVID"" (4/1-7/31/2020) - virtual telehealth fully implemented 3. ""Post-COVID"" (8/1-9/15/2020) - after NYC surge of SARS-Cov-2 with conversion back to in-person visits. All scheduled encounters in the MFM FQHC clinic were included. Non-adherence was defined as encounters cancelled prior to appointment time or a ""no-show."" Chi-square and logistic regression (SAS v9.4;Carey, NC) were used to compare differences between groups with p&lt;0.05 defined as significant. Result(s): A total of 511 encounters were evaluated. Encounter completion rates differed among groups (p &lt;0.001). (Table). During COVID, when telehealth was utilized, non-adherence rates were significantly lower than in both the pre-COVID and post-COVID timeframes (when telehealth was no longer utilized). (Figure) Conclusion(s): Adherence of women to telehealth encounters for MFM care was higher than pre-COVID and post-COVID in-person encounters. Telehealth expands access to MFM care in an FQHC and may improve access in the future as women face challenges managing the need for in-person visits with the demands of childcare and attempted infection risk-avoidance. This may serve as a model for increasing future access and adherence to care. Further work is needed to understand the impact of telehealth on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

However, a significant proportion of people report that they do not intend to have a vaccine, often because of concerns they have about vaccine side effects or safety. This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey. Participants starting the survey at 0-14 or 30-44 seconds in the minute are allocated to the intervention and 15-29 or 45-59 seconds to the comparator. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment but will not be informed of the purpose of the study until they have completed the follow-up survey.

594805,Extended short-range airborne transmission of respiratory infections,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Adventitious root formation is considered a major developmental step during the propagation of difficult to root plants, especially in horticultural crops. Recently, adventitious roots induced through plant tissue culture methods have also been used for production of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, anthocyanins and anthraquinones. It is rather well understood which horticultural species will easily form adventitious roots, but the factors affecting this process at molecular level or regulating the induction process in in vitro conditions are far less known. The present study was conducted to identify transcripts involved in in vitro induction and formation of adventitious roots using Arnebia euchroma leaves at different time points (intact leaf (control), 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d, 7 d, 10 d and 15 d). A. euchroma is an endangered medicinal Himalayan herb whose root contains red naphthoquinone pigments. These phytoconstituents are widely used as an herbal ingredient in Asian traditional medicine as well as natural colouring agent in food and cosmetics. RESULTS: A total of 137.93 to 293.76 million raw reads were generated and assembled to 54,587 transcripts with average length of 1512.27 bps and N50 of 2193 bps, respectively. In addition, 50,107 differentially expressed genes were identified and found to be involved in plant hormone signal transduction, cell wall modification and wound induced mitogen activated protein kinase signalling. The data exhibited dominance of auxin responsive (AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR8, IAA13, GRETCHEN HAGEN3.1) and sucrose translocation (BETA-31 FRUCTOFURANOSIDASE and MONOSACCHARIDE-SENSING protein1) genes during induction phase. In the initiation phase, the expression of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN16, EXPANSIN-B15, ENDOGLUCANASE25 and LEUCINE-rich repeat EXTENSION-like proteins was increased. During the expression phase, the same transcripts, with exception of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN16 were identified. Overall, the transcriptomic analysis revealed a similar patterns of genes, however, their expression level varied in subsequent phases of in vitro adventitious root formation in A. euchroma. CONCLUSION: The results presented here will be helpful in understanding key regulators of in vitro adventitious root development in Arnebia species, which may be deployed in the future for phytochemical production at a commercial scale.

Diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.98, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.20–18.58), glomerular filtration rate ≤50 mL/min (aOR 4.48, 95% CI 1.08–18.66), and BAL lymphocyte percentage ≤45% (aOR 9.25, 95% CI 2.47–34.58) were independently associated with the case group in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that BAL lymphocyte count may play some role during PCP treatment. Further studies should be followed to reveal what the role of BAL lymphocyte is in the PCP treatment.","Kim, Tark; Sung, Heungsup; Chong, Yong Pil; Kim, Sung-Han; Choo, Eun Ju; Choi, Sang-Ho; Kim, Tae Hyong; Woo, Jun Hee; Kim, Yang Soo; Lee, Sang-Oh",Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2018.50.2.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968978/,31
596833,Innate T cells in COVID-19: friend or foe?,2020-05-27,"INTRODUCTION: Particulate matter exposure has been associated with the appearance and severity of several diseases, including viral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths across Italian regions and provinces in March 2020 were linked to past exposure to fine and coarse particulate matter (namely, PM(2.5) and PM(10), respectively). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Geographical distributions of COVID-19 cases and deaths (105,792 and 12,428, respectively, up to 31(st) March 2020), PM(2.5) and PM(10) exposure, and demographic characteristics were extracted from publicly accessible databases. Adjusted regression models were performed to test the association between particulate matter exposure in different Italian regions and provinces and COVID-19 incidence proportions and death rates. RESULTS: A heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 cases/deaths and particulate matter exposure was observed in Italy, with the highest numbers in Northern Italy regions and provinces. Independent associations between regional PM(2.5)/PM(10) exposure and COVID-19 incidence proportion and death rate were observed (COVID-19 incidence proportion: β = 0.71, p = 0.003, β = 0.61, p = 0.031, respectively; COVID-19 death rate: β = 0.68, p = 0.004 and β = 0.61, p = 0.029, respectively). Similarly, PM(2.5)/PM(10) exposures were independently associated with COVID-19 incidence proportion (β = 0.26, p = 0.024 and β = 0.27, p = 0.006, respectively) at the provincial level. The number of days exceeding the provincial limit value of exposure to PM(10) (50 µg/m(3)) was also independently associated with the COVID-19 incidence proportion (β = 0.30, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM(2.5) and PM(10) is associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths, suggesting that particulate matter pollution may play a role in the COVID-19 outbreak and explain the heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 in Italian regions and provinces.","Bianconi, Vanessa; Bronzo, Paola; Banach, Maciej; Sahebkar, Amirhossein; Mannarino, Massimo R.; Pirro, Matteo",Arch Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863986/; https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2020.95336,31

Previously, researchers had developed a pseudotyped virus system for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on HIV-1 core, bearing virus spike protein. During the development of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system, a eukaryotic expression plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was constructed and then co-transfected with HIV-1 based plasmid which containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, into HEK293T cells to prepare the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus (ppSARS-2). We have successfully established the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system for neutralization and entry inhibition assays. Huh7.5 cell line was found to be the most susceptible to our pseudotyped virus model. Different levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples of COVID-19 patients using ppSARS-2. The recombinant, soluble, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein was found to inhibit the entry of ppSARS-2 in Huh7.5 cells effectively. Furthermore, the neutralization results for ppSARS-2 were consistent with those of live SARS-CoV-2 and determined using the serum samples from convalescent patients. In conclusion, we have developed an easily accessible and reliable tool for studying the neutralizing efficiency of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the entry process of the virus in a BSL-2 laboratory.","Yang, Ren; Huang, Baoying; Ruhan, A.; Li, Wenhui; Wang, Wenling; Deng, Yao; Tan, Wenjie",Biosaf Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.08.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053620300884; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053620300884?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864605/,31

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed in the presence of inflammation and aneurysms of the coronary arteries. The objectives of our study were to assess which CABG strategy provides better graft patency and early and long-term outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review using Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed in February 2020, incorporating a network meta-analysis, performed by random-effect model within a Bayesian framework, and pooled prevalence of adverse outcomes. Hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CI) were calculated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RESULTS: Among 581 published reports, 32 studies were selected, including 1,191 patients undergoing CABG for KD. Graft patency of internal thoracic arteries (ITAs), saphenous veins (SV), and other arteries (gastroepiploic artery and radial artery) was compared. ITAs demonstrated the best patency rates at long-term follow-up (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17–0.66). Pooled prevalence of early mortality after CABG was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.00–0.73%, I (2) = 0%, tau(2) = 0), with 63/1,108 and 56/1,108 patients, undergoing interventional procedures and surgical re-interventions during follow-up, respectively. Pooled prevalence was 3.97% (95% CI: 1.91–6.02%, I (2) = 60%, tau(2) = 0.0008) for interventional procedures and 3.47% (95% CI: 2.26–4.68%, I (2) = 5%, tau(2) <0.0001) for surgical re-interventions. Patients treated with arterial, venous, and mixed (arterial plus second venous graft) CABG were compared to assess long-term mortality. Mixed CABG (HR 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00–0.30) and arterial CABG (HR 0.13, 95% CI: 0.00–1.78) showed reduced long-term mortality compared with venous CABG. CONCLUSIONS: CABG in KD is a safe procedure. The use of arterial conduits provides better patency rates and lower mortality at long-term follow-up.","Salsano, Antonio; Liao, Jingda; Miette, Ambra; Capoccia, Massimo; Mariscalco, Giovanni; Santini, Francesco; Corno, Antonio F.",Open Med (Wars),https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2021-0242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748422/,31
599434,Acceptability of Telegenetics for Families with Genetic Eye Diseases,2021-02-15,"Background While there are no treatments with proven efficacy for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), tocilizumab has been proposed as a candidate therapy, especially among patients with higher systemic inflammation. Methods We conducted a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID 19 in Spain. The primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit admission (ICU) or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between tocilizumab use and the outcomes. Results A total of 1,229 and 10,673 person/days were analyzed. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between tocilizumab use and high C reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p=0.005) and ICU admission or death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81, p=0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L, but not among those with CRP [≤]150 mg/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. Conclusions In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID 19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials and support the use of tocilizumab among subjects with higher CRP levels.","Martinez-Sanz, J.; Muriel, A.; Ron, R.; Herrera, S.; Perez-Molina, J.

It is a new θ-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction θ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.","Ivorra, B.; Ferrández, M.R.; Vela-Pérez, M.; Ramos, A.M.",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570420301350?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355435/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570420301350; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105303,31
599854,Cough-generated aerosols of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria from patients with cystic fibrosis,2009-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Individuals’ stress in responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic may be exacerbated by information uncertainty driven by inconsistent, unverified, and conflicting news from various sources. The current study aims to test if information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak was related to acute stress disorder (ASD) over and above other psychosocial stressors. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 7800 college students throughout China from January 31 through February 11, 2020. Existing scales were modified to measure ASD and six potential stressors including information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to assess the unique association of information uncertainty with ASD. To minimize the effect of large sample size and also to get a sense of whether the effects of information uncertainty were similar to people at the center of the epidemic, we repeated the hierarchical regression among 10% of the students who were randomly selected from the entire sample (“10% random sample”; n = 780) and 226 students from Hubei Province where the outbreak started. RESULTS: Information uncertainty was highly prevalent among the respondents (64%). It was significantly associated with ASD beyond other key variables and potential stressors across three samples. In the hierarchical regression among the entire sample, demographic variables accounted for 9.4% of the variance in ASD. The other five stressors added 5.1% of the variance. The information uncertainty (β = .159; p < .001) explained an additional 2.1% of the variance. Likewise, the information uncertainty explained an additional 2.1 and 3.4% of the variance in ASD beyond all other variables among the 10% random sample (β = .165; p < .001) and the Hubei sample (β = .196; p < .01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Information uncertainty is a unique correlate of psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Reducing information uncertainty is essential not only for halting virus transmission but also for mitigating negative impacts of the pandemic on people’s psychosocial wellbeing. Transparent, timely, and accurate communication can reduce public confusion, fear, and stress. Capacity building in governments, communities, and media outlets to prevent, reduce and manage information uncertainty should be a critical part of the response to an emerging global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Danhua; Friedman, Daniela B.; Qiao, Shan; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoyan; Li, Xiaoming",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09952-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287780/,31

Identification of sustainable and effective measures to mitigate PRRSV transmission is a pressing problem. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV plays a crucial role in inhibiting host innate immunity during PRRSV infection. In the current study, a new host-restricted factor, tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), was identified as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the PRRSV N protein interferes with TRIM25–RIG-I interactions by competitively interacting with TRIM25. Furthermore, N protein inhibits the expression of TRIM25 and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress interferon β production. Furthermore, with increasing TRIM25 expression, the inhibitory effect of N protein on the ubiquitination of RIG-I diminished. These results indicate for the first time that TRIM25 inhibits PRRSV replication and that the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. This not only provides a theoretical basis for the development of drugs to control PRRSV replication, but also better explains the mechanism through which the PRRSV N protein inhibits innate immune responses of the host.","Zhao, Kuan; Li, Li-Wei; Jiang, Yi-Feng; Gao, Fei; Zhang, Yu-Jiao; Zhao, Wen-Ying; Li, Guo-Xin; Yu, Ling-Xue; Zhou, Yan-Jun; Tong, Guang-Zhi",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519301269; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519301269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176400/,31

Our aim was to exhibit the hemodynamic effect of the compacted LVIS stent. METHODS: Two patient-specific aneurysm models were constructed from three-dimensional angiographic images. The uniform LVIS stent, compacted LVIS and Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) with or without coil embolization were virtually deployed into aneurysm models to perform hemodynamic analysis. Intra-aneurysmal flow parameters were calculated to assess hemodynamic differences among different models. RESULTS: The compacted LVIS had the highest metal coverage across the aneurysm orifice (case 1, 46.37%; case 2, 67.01%). However, the PED achieved the highest pore density (case 1, 19.56 pores/mm2; case 2, 18.07 pores/mm2). The compacted LVIS produced a much higher intra-aneurysmal flow reduction than the uniform LVIS. The PED showed a higher intra-aneurysmal flow reduction than the compacted LVIS in case 1, but the results were comparable in case 2. After stent placement, the intra-aneurysmal flow was further reduced as subsequent coil embolization. The compacted LVIS stent with coils produced a similar reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow to that of the PED. CONCLUSIONS: The combined characteristics of stent metal coverage and pore density should be considered when assessing the flow diversion effects of stents. More intra-aneurysmal flow reductions could be introduced by compacted LVIS stent than the uniform one. Compared with PED, compacted LVIS stent may exhibit a flow-diverting effect comparable to that of the PED.","Tian, Zhongbin; Zhang, Mingqi; Li, Gaohui; Jin, Rongbo; Leng, Xiaochang; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Yisen; Yang, Xinjian; Xiang, Jianping; Liu, Jian",Interv Neuroradiol,https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920952903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830566/,31
601334,Jigsaw falling into place: A review and perspective of lymphoid tissue CD8+ T cells and control of HIV,2020-06-08,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: There is emerging, albeit still limited data, on the interaction between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB). Both infections can cause dysregulation of the immune system, suggesting a biological plausibility for one disease but also for COVID-19 infection leading to TB progression. A meta-analysis recently found an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease in the setting of tuberculosis, although this wasn't statistically significant. The second suggested biological plausibility for tuberculosis worsening or predisposing to COVID-19 infection but concluded that not enough evidence exists to understand the relationship between tuberculosis and COVID-19. Since the relationship remains uncertain, special attention should be paid to how infections from COVID-19 and tuberculosis interact, especially in endemic areas. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 21 year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She had no medical history besides recent diagnosis of COVID-19 four months prior to admission, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, she reported persistent cough, and suddenly presented with shortness of breath one day prior to admission and eventually prompted ED presentation. She had no other significant symptoms nor sick contacts. In the ED, she presented with a fever of 39.3 C, tachycardia, hypoxia and tachypnea. Computed Tomography of the chest revealed bilateral pulmonary consolidation and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. An extensive autoimmune and infectious workup was unrevealing. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, she progressed rapidly to multi-organ failure requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement therapy, culminating in death. Autopsy revealed alveolar hyalinization with necrotizing granulomatous infection of bilateral lungs, pleura, and pericardium, positive for acid fast bacilli. Cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. DISCUSSION: In this report, we highlight a case of a young, immunocompetent patient with no underlying risk factors who died from multi-organ failure and ARDS secondary to pulmonary and possibly disseminated tuberculosis. We suspect that her recent COVID-19 infection may have allowed latent tuberculosis to reactivate and rapidly progress to severe disease, which ultimately led to multi-organ failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for further studies to be completed on the deleterious effects of even mild COVID-19 infections, and its ability to exacerbate other types of pulmonary infections. The significance between COVID-19 and tuberculosis should be evaluated further. REFERENCE #1: Gao Y, Liu M, Chen Y, Shi S, Geng J, Tian J.

The most widely used vision assistance apps are magnifier apps. It is still largely unknown what the apps are used for. Lack of insight into the visual needs of individuals with visual impairment is a hurdle for the development of more effective assistive technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how needs for visual aids may vary with social activities, by observing the changes in the usage of a smartphone magnifier app when many users take breaks from work. METHODS: The number of launches of the SuperVision Magnifier app was determined retrospectively from 2018 to 2020 from among active users worldwide. The fluctuation in app usage was examined by comparing weekday vs weekend periods, Christmas and new year vs nonholiday seasons, and COVID-19 lockdowns vs the easing of restriction during the pandemic. RESULTS: On average, the app was used 262,466 times by 38,237 users each month in 2020 worldwide. There were two major trough points on the timeline of weekly app usage, one aligned with the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020 and another aligned with the Christmas and new year week in 2018 and 2019. The app launches declined by 6947 (11% decline; P<.001) during the lockdown and by 5212 (9% decline; P=.001) during the holiday weeks. There was no significant decline during March to May 2019. App usage compensated for seasonal changes was 8.6% less during weekends than during weekdays (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The need for vision assistance technology was slightly lower during breaks and lockdowns, probably because the activities at home were different and less visually demanding.

L’un d’eux a été pris en charge dans notre unité de Maladies Infectieuses (UMI). L’objectif de ce travail est de décrire et évaluer l’organisation pratique et les mesures de prévention mises en œuvre en situation d’alerte virus émergent. Matériels et méthodes L’UMI dispose de 20 lits dont 6 pouvant être une aile dédiée en cas d’épidémie ou d’alerte virus émergent. Dans ce travail, nous décrivons rétrospectivement la prise en charge des patients infectés par le MERS-CoV ainsi que des cas « contact » suspects d’infection, en collaboration avec le Service de Gestion des Risques Infectieux (SGRIVI), le laboratoire d’analyse médicale et le service de communication du CHR. Résultats Du 9 au 16 mai 2013, 4 patients ont été accueillis dans notre unité sans nécessité d’équipe dédiée : 1 patient «MERS-CoV positif » et 3 patients « contacts ».

603015,A Potent Leukocyte Transmigration Blocker: GT-73 Showed a Protective Effect against LPS-Induced ARDS in Mice,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Cases of concurrent immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis (IgG4-TIN) are rare and previous case reports have lacked important data. KDIGO suggests a treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in IgAN patients. Glucocorticoids are recommended as the first-line therapy for IgG4-TIN. The use of tacrolimus as a long-term maintenance treatment has not been described. We report the case of a man who developed IgAN and IgG4-TIN without abnormalities in extra-renal tissue, without renal function abnormalities or impairment as well, and was treated by tacrolimus as a long-term maintenance during 45 months follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Chinese man first presented to our hospital with the chief complaint of foamy urine for 1 year and hematuria for 3 months, with a medical history of hypertension. Testing revealed a notable increase in serum IgG4 level without abnormalities in renal function or imaging, or in dysfunction other organs. Renal biopsy showed mesangial extracellular matrix proliferation, increased mesangial cell numbers and infiltration of plasma cells. Immunofluorescence showed mesangial positivity for IgA and C3. Immunohistochemistry staining showed widespread IgG4 and increased CD38 and CD138 expression. Electron microscopy showed immune complexes located on the tubular basement membrane. He was diagnosed with IgAN and IgG4-TIN. He received glucocorticoids, leflunomide and tacrolimus to induce remission. He was given tacrolimus as long-term maintenance treatment. When tacrolimus was temporarily withdrawn, proteinuria recurred. After resuming tacrolimus therapy, he again entered complete remission. After 45 months of therapy, he remains in complete remission and the serum IgG4 level is normal. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of concurrent IgAN and IgG4-TIN without abnormalities in renal function, imaging or extra-renal tissue is rare and their coexistence may be coincidental. Long-term treatment with tacrolimus proved effective and he has remained in remission during 45 months follow-up.","Tian, Mi; Luan, Junjun; Jiao, Congcong; Chang, Qing; Kopp, Jeffrey B.; Zhou, Hua",BMC Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34384379/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02477-w,31

604284,A paradigm shift in cell-free approach: the emerging role of MSCs-derived exosomes in regenerative medicine,2021-07-12,"Dengue viruses (DENV) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as ∼19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.","Messer, William B.; Yount, Boyd; Hacker, Kari E.; Donaldson, Eric F.; Huynh, Jeremy P.; de Silva, Aravinda M.; Baric, Ralph S.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389731/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001486,31

Methods: In a single-center retrospective observational study, 50 patients infected with COVID-19 were studied. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Results: The mean age of the patients was 48.8 years, with male predominance. Dry cough, fever, and dyspnea were the most complaining symptoms on admission. Chronic medical illnesses before admission were present in 56% of the patients. The most common laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, high serum creatinine level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and increasing ESR and CRP levels. Bilateral mixed ground-glass opacity and consolidation were observed in chest CT scan of most patients. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and some needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Blood oxygen saturation was different between survivors and nonsurvivors. 10% of patients died, of whom 60% were men. 40% of dead cases had chronic medical illnesses; 60% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Among the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, the frequent clinical presentation was with a wide range of signs and symptoms. The laboratory changes suggest that COVID-19 infection may be related to cellular immune deficiency, myocardial, hepatic, and kidney injury. Additional research is needed to elucidate COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Jarineshin, Hashem; Saljoughi, Fateme; Estabraghnia Babaki, Hamideh; Hassaniazad, Mehdi; kheirandish, Masoumeh; Ghanbarnejad, Amin; Sohrabipour, Shahla",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.35.7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996658/,31

During the first wave of COVID-19, our department adopted a fully remote diagnostic (home cardiorespiratory polygraphy) and treatment (autoset continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP) approach. As a novel mode of service delivery, our aim was to evaluate our pathway and analyse factors associated with adherence to CPAP. We analysed the first 300 patients (51 ± 13 years, 48% men) who were set up on remote CPAP between 20 May 2020 and 11 September 2020. The associations between CPAP usage at 90 days and age, gender, body mass index, disease severity, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and comorbidities were investigated with linear and logistic regression analyses. A total of 124 patients (41.3%) were fully-adherent to CPAP therapy, defined as CPAP usage ≥ 4 h on ≥ 70% of the days. Only driving status was associated with adherence to CPAP. Patients who were adherent at 28 days were more likely to stay adherent at 90 days (3.77 odd ratio /3.10–4.45/ 95% confidence interval). We have shown that a fully remote diagnostic and treatment pathway for patients with OSA can be successfully delivered, and our preliminary outcomes of adherence to CPAP are comparable with published data.","Bikov, Andras; Khalil, Safia; Gibbons, Meg; Bentley, Andrew; Jones, David; Bokhari, Saba",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640326/,31

In the past weeks, the administration of vaccines has started in different parts of the world sustaining the hype of significantly containing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the rapid time lapse from vaccine development to distribution has raised several concerns on its safety and efficacy. This topic is particularly felt by patients with chronic conditions and immumodulating therapies that could compromise their immune system such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we explore the potential future implications of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines introduction in the IBD field, touching upon the clinical experience coming from available data on vaccinations against other infections. We also dissect the factors associated with the acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, describing the possible strategies that gastroenterologist should adopt to reach the highest rate of vaccinations in IBD patients.","Papa, Alfredo; Scaldaferri, Franco; Vetrone, Lorenzo Maria; Neri, Matteo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808983/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030248,31

As a result, the likelihood of incurring information overload is particularly notable for researchers, who can struggle to overcome the gap between information processing requirements and information processing capacity. We address this issue by adopting a multi-granulation approach to latent knowledge discovery and synthesis in large-scale research domains. The proposed methodology combines citation-based community detection methods and topic modeling techniques to give a concise but comprehensive overview of how the autonomous vehicle (AV) research field is conceptually structured. Thirteen core thematic areas are extracted and presented by mining the large data-rich environments resulting from 50 years of AV research. The analysis demonstrates that this research field is strongly oriented towards examining the technological developments needed to enable the widespread rollout of AVs, whereas it largely overlooks the wide-ranging sustainability implications of this sociotechnical transition. On account of these findings, we call for a broader engagement of AV researchers with the sustainability concept and we invite them to increase their commitment to conducting systematic investigations into the sustainability of AV deployment. Sustainability research is urgently required to produce an evidence-based understanding of what new sociotechnical arrangements are needed to ensure that the systemic technological change introduced by AV-based transport systems can fulfill societal functions while meeting the urgent need for more sustainable transport solutions.","Mora, Luca; Wu, Xinyi; Panori, Anastasia",J Clean Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124087; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620341329; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620341329?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934442/,31

610978,Author Correction: Complement as a target in COVID-19?,2020-06-12,"OBJECTIVES: We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection 6 months after the first infection in a young healthy female physician. Both episodes led to mild COVID-19. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infections was detected by RT-PCR on naso-pharyngeal specimens. Reinfection was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. Kinetics of total anti-S receptor binding domain immunoglobulins (Ig anti-S RBD), anti-nucleoprotein (anti-N) and neutralizing antibodies were determined in serial serum samples retrieved during both infection episodes. Memory B cells responses were assessed at day 12 post reinfection. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing identified two different SARS-CoV-2 genomes both belonging to clade 20A, with only one non-synonymous mutation in the spike protein, and clustered with viruses circulating in Geneva (Switzerland) at the time of each of the corresponding episodes. Seroconversion was documented with low level of total Ig anti-S RBD and anti-N antibodies at one month after the first infection whereas neutralizing antibodies quickly declined after the first episode and then were boosted by the reinfection, with high titers detectable 4 days after symptoms onset. A strong memory B cell response was detected at day 12 post onset of symptoms during reinfection, indicating that the first episode elicited cellular memory responses. CONCLUSION: Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies may put medical personnel at risk of reinfection as shown in this case. Reinfection however leads to a significant boosting of previous immune responses. Larger cohorts of reinfected subjects with detailed descriptions of their immune responses are needed to define correlates of protection and their duration after infection.","Vetter, Pauline; Cordey, Samuel; Schibler, Manuel; Vieux, Laure; Despres, Lena; Laubscher, Florian; Andrey, Diego O.; Martischang, Romain; Harbarth, Stephan; Cuvelier, Clémence; Bekliz, Meriem; Eckerle, Isabella; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Didierlaurent, Arnaud M.; Eberhardt, Christiane S.; Meyer, Benjamin; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618012/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21000859; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21000859?v=s5,31

Studies investigating the association between air pollution and academic attainment have been constrained by small sample sizes. METHODS: Cross sectional educational attainment data (2009–2015) from students aged 15–16 years in Cardiff, Wales were linked to primary health care data, modelled air pollution and measured pollen data, and analysed using multilevel linear regression models. Annual cohort, school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multi-pollutant/pollen models. We stratified by treatment of asthma and/or Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR). RESULTS: A unit (10μg/m3) increase of short-term exposure to NO(2) was associated with 0.044 (95% CI: −0.079, −0.008) reduction of standardised Capped Point Score (CPS) after adjusting for individual and household risk factors for 18,241 students. This association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen. There was no association of PM(2.5), O(3), or Pollen with standardised CPS remaining after adjustment. We found no evidence that treatment for asthma or SAR modified the observed NO(2) effect on educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution, specifically NO(2,) was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15–16. Longitudinal investigations in different settings are required to confirm this possible impact and further work may uncover the long-term economic implications, and degree to which impacts are cumulative and permanent.","Mizen, Amy; Lyons, Jane; Milojevic, Ai; Doherty, Ruth; Wilkinson, Paul; Carruthers, David; Akbari, Ashley; Lake, Iain; Davies, Gwyneth A.; Al Sallakh, Mohammad; Fry, Richard; Dearden, Lorraine; Rodgers, Sarah",Health Place,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829220300368?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32543438/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1353829220300368; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102355,31

Their use is now booming due to growing demand for online courses and for off-campus assessment options amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Online proctoring technologies purport to effectively oversee students sitting online exams by using artificial intelligence (AI) systems supplemented by human invigilators. Such technologies have alarmed some students who see them as a “Big Brother-like” threat to liberty and privacy, and as potentially unfair and discriminatory. However, some universities and educators defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring technologies is overdue. This essay provides one of the first sustained moral philosophical analyses of these technologies, focusing on ethical notions of academic integrity, fairness, non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, autonomy, liberty, and trust. Most of these concepts are prominent in the new field of AI ethics, and all are relevant to education. The essay discusses these ethical issues. It also offers suggestions for educational institutions and educators interested in the technologies about the kinds of inquiries they need to make and the governance and review processes they might need to adopt to justify and remain accountable for using online proctoring technologies. The rapid and contentious rise of proctoring software provides a fruitful ethical case study of how AI is infiltrating all areas of life.

The objectives were to analyse (1) how, and to what extent, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infection guidelines are considering antimicrobial resistance; (2) are of acceptable quality and (3) if they can be easily contextualised to fit the needs of specific populations and health systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from 1 January 2007 to 7 June 2019 for tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infection guidelines published in English. We also searched guideline databases, key websites and reference lists. We identified guidelines and recommendations that considered contextual factors including antimicrobial resistance, values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility. We assessed quality of the guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool focusing on the domains scope and purpose, rigour of development, and editorial independence. RESULTS: We screened 10 365 records, of which 74 guidelines met inclusion criteria. Of these guidelines, 39% (n=29/74) met acceptable quality scores. Approximately two-thirds of recommendations considered antimicrobial resistance at the population and/or outcome level. Five of the 29 guidelines reported all factors required for recommendation contextualisation. Equity was the least considered across guidelines. DISCUSSION: Relatively few guidelines for highly prevalent infectious diseases are considering resistance at a local level, and many do not consider contextual factors necessary for appropriate antimicrobial use.

In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the disease epidemic as a pandemic. Thus, a quarantine was imposed by many governments. As a consequence, and given that epidemiological outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, are associated with psychological disorders and symptoms of mental illness, researchers at the Shanghai Mental Health Center have created the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), in which the results are obtained: normal, mild/moderate distress and severe distress. The main objective of the study was based on the application of CPDI, in order to identify the health and well-being of Brazilian students from different undergraduate courses at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC/SP) during the Covid-19 pandemic and to test the hypothesis that medical students suffer more than students from other courses. The research is based on a cross-sectional observational study, in which we applied, using Google FormsR, the questions contained in CPDI, among with demographic data: age, sex, educational institution, undergraduate course and school year. The Index was applied online for seven days in which a total of 654 valid responses were obtained: 501 (76.6%) female and 149 (22.8%) male. Regarding age, 333 students (50.91%) were 17-20 years old, 279 (42.66%) between 21-25, 30 (4.59%) between 26-30 and 12 (1.84%) between 31-50. The results indicate that the participants reported significant psychological distress, according to the CPDI score. Practically 90% (87.92%) of the students experienced suffering, while only 12.08% did not suffer.

Many different policies and restrictive measures were implemented to prevent transmission outspread, to reduce the impacts of the outbreak (i.e., individual, social, and economic), and to provide effective control measures. Although it has been more than one year already after the outbreak, very little studies have been done to examine the long-term effects and impact of the pandemic, and to examine the government intervention variables that are most effective and least effective. Such analysis is critical to determine the best practices in support of policy decisions. Methods Visual exploratory data analysis (V-EDA) is highly recommended to evaluate the impact of the pandemic since it offers a user's friendly data visualization model that allows one to observe visual patterns on trends. The V-EDA was conducted on one-year data for the COVID-19 Pandemic- one year after the outbreak between 1st January and 31 December 2020. The data were analyzed using the student's t-test to verify if there was a statistical difference between two independent groups and the Spearman test was used to analyze the correlation coefficient between two quantitative data, as well as their positive or negative inclination. Findings We found that high-testing countries had more cases per million than low-testing countries. However, for low-testing countries, there was a positive correlation between the testing level and the number of cases per million. This suggests that countries that had tested more, did it in a preventive manner while countries with fewer tests may have a higher number of cases than confirmed. In the poorest developing countries, the reduced new cases coincide with the reduction in conducted tests, which was not observed in the high-testing countries. Among the restrictive measures analyzed, a higher population aged 70 or more and lower GDP per capita was related to a higher case fatality ratio. Restrictive measures reduce the number of new cases after four weeks, indicating the minimum time required for the measures to have a positive effect. Finally, public event cancellation, international travel control, school closing, contact tracing, and facial coverings were the most important measures to reduce the virus spread. As a result, it was observed that countries with the lowest number of cases had a higher stringency index.","Nazir, A.; Ulusoy, S.; Lotfi, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.04.21256635v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256635,31

Despite the wide range of manifestations and organ involvement in COVID‐19 patients, the exact pathogenesis of severe and fatal types of COVID‐19 and causes involved with the individual base of the disease is not yet understood. Several studies have reported clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data in favor of vascular injury in multiple organs of critically ill patients with COVID‐19 as a result of hyperactive immune response, inflammation, and cytokine storm. Also, both clinical and histopathological evidence points to such vascular involvements in the skin. Given the ease of clinical examinations and skin biopsy and the lower risks of transmission of COVID‐19 to healthcare workers, the present review article was conducted to investigate the vascular skin manifestations of COVID‐19 patients clinically and/or histopathologically as helpful clues for better understanding the pathogenesis and predicting the prognosis of the disease, especially in severe cases.","Sadeghzadeh‐Bazargan, Afsaneh; Rezai, Mahdi; Najar Nobari, Niloufar; Mozafarpoor, Samaneh; Goodarzi, Azadeh",J Cutan Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978234/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cup.14059,31

Approximately 10% of people who lose a loved one develop prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Internet-based and computer-based interventions (ie, internet-delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy, iCBT) are a cost-effective alternative that makes it possible to reach more people with PGD. The main aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a new iCBT—called GROw—for PGD. As a secondary objective, the potential effectiveness of GROw will be explored. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a two-arm feasibility randomised trial. A total of 48 adults with PGD who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomised to the experimental group (iCBT: GROw) or the active control group (face-to-face CBT treatment). The treatment is organised sequentially in eight modules in the iCBT format and 8–10 sessions in the face-to-face format, and both formats have the same therapeutic components. There will be five assessment points with qualitative and quantitative evaluations: screening, baseline, after the intervention, 3-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up. Consistent with the objectives, the measures are related to the feasibility outcomes for the main aim of the study (participant adherence, expectations and satisfaction with the treatment, preferences, alliance and utility) and psychological and mental health outcomes for secondary analyses (symptoms of grief, symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, affectivity, quality of life, work and social adaptation, post-traumatic growth, purpose in life, mindfulness and compassion). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee of the Universitat Jaume I (Castellón, Spain) granted approval for the study (CD/002/2019).

However, manifestations in other organs should not be ignored since they can also be a mode of transmission. We sought to describe the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 and investigate the association between ocular involvement and clinical presentation and laboratory outcomes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Ninety-three sequentially hospitalized and clinically confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The systemic and ocular symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 93 COVID-19 patients, 54 (58.1%) were male, and 39 (41.9%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 39.4 ± 21.9 (min 7, max 88) years. Twenty patients (n 21.5%) had at least one ocular abnormality. Most common findings included hyperemia (n = 20), epiphora (n = 9), increased secretion (n = 6), chemosis (n = 3), follicular conjunctivitis (n = 2), and episcleritis (n = 2). The most common symptom was photophobia (n 15). Patients with ocular involvement were more likely to have higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.001), and increased CRP (p < 0.001), PCT (p = 0.001), and ESR levels (p < 0.001). Mean lymphocyte count was statistically lower in patients with ocular manifestations (p = 0.001). Mean age and number of patients with fever over 37.3 °C in the ocular involvement group was found to be higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Older age, high fever, increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and high levels of acute phase reactants seemed to be risk factors for ocular involvement.","Bostanci Ceran, Basak; Ozates, Serdar",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04777-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504100/,31

At present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies delineating the knowledge and skills that family physicians should possess to effectively face diverse public health challenges. Using a multi-staged, iterative process that included a detailed literature review, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to primary care, identifying competencies relevant across four levels, from “post-MD” to “enhanced.” Feedback from family medicine and public health educator–practitioners regarding the set of proposed “essential” competencies indicated the need for a more limited, feasible set of “priority” areas to be highlighted during residency training. This focused set of public health competencies has begun to guide relevant components of the University of Toronto's Family Medicine Residency Program curriculum, including academic half-days; clinical experiences, especially identifying “teachable moments” during patient encounters; resident academic projects; and elective public health agency placements. These competencies will also be used to guide the development of a family medicine–public health primer and faculty development sessions to support family medicine faculty facilitating residents to achieve these competencies. Once more fully implemented, an evaluation will be initiated to determine the degree to which these public health competencies are being achieved by family medicine graduates, especially whether they attained the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to effectively face diverse public health situations—from common to emergent.","Harvey, Bart J.; Moloughney, Brent W.; Iglar, Karl T.",Am J Prev Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379711003576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21961672/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379711003576; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2011.06.002,31

The total frequency of ORVs was 2.6% (45/1,734) during the 2007–08 season and 99.7% (1,477/1,482) during the 2008–09 season, indicating a marked increase in ORVs in Japan during 1 influenza season. The NA gene of ORVs in the 2007–08 season fell into 2 distinct lineages by D354G substitution, whereas that of ORVs in the 2008–09 season fell into 1 lineage. NA inhibition assay and M2 sequencing showed that almost all the ORVs were sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine. The hemagglutination inhibition test showed that ORVs were antigenetically similar to the 2008–09 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007.

This prospective study was initiated to investigate if such an association exists for COVID-19. In this cohort study performed at Ankara University, 132 COVID-19 patients (56 asymptomatic, 51 mild-intermediate, and 25 patients with severe disease) were genotyped for KIR and ligands. Ankara University Donor Registry (n:449) KIR data was used for comparison. Clinical parameters (age, gender, comorbidities, blood group antigens, inflammation biomarkers) and KIR genotypes across cohorts of asymptomatic, mild-intermediate, or severe disease were compared to construct a risk prediction model based on multivariate binary logistic regression analysis with backward elimination method. Age, blood group, number of comorbidities, CRP, D-dimer, and telomeric and centromeric KIR genotypes (tAA, tAB1, and cAB1) along with their cognate ligands were found to differ between cohorts. Two prediction models were constructed; both included age, number of comorbidities, and blood group. Inclusion of the KIR genotypes in the second prediction model exp (-3.52 + 1.56 age group - 2.74 blood group (type A vs others) + 1.26 number of comorbidities - 2.46 tAB1 with ligand + 3.17 tAA with ligand) increased the predictive performance with a 92.9% correct classification for asymptomatic and 76% for severe cases (AUC: 0.93; P < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.88, 0.99). This novel risk model, consisting of KIR genotypes with their cognate ligands, and clinical parameters but excluding earlier published inflammation-related biomarkers allow for the prediction of the severity of COVID-19 infection prior to the onset of infection.

The adaptation of a more quantitative risk-based approach, with metrics such as Food safety Objectives (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO) necessitates quantitative inputs from all stages of the food value chain. The potential exists for utilization of big data, generated through digital transformational technologies, as inputs to a dynamic risk management concept for food safety microbiology. The industrial revolution in Internet of Things (IoT) will leverage data inputs from precision agriculture, connected factories/logistics, precision healthcare, and precision food safety, to improve the dynamism of microbial risk management. Furthermore, interconnectivity of public health databases, social media, and e-commerce tools as well as technologies such as blockchain will enhance traceability for retrospective and real-time management of foodborne cases. Despite the enormous potential of data volume and velocity, some challenges remain, including data ownership, interoperability, and accessibility.

Less job satisfaction and impaired health can have an impact on health care quality. Our aim was to examine the association of stressors (illegitimate tasks) and health related resources (work-related sense of coherence; recovery experience) with life satisfaction, happiness, job satisfaction and burnout among German general practitioners (GPs). We conducted a cross-sectional survey among general medical practices in Germany. Main outcome measures were life satisfaction, happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale), job satisfaction (Work Satisfaction Scale) and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory). 548 GPs from across Germany participated (53.6% males, 45.6% females; mostly representative of German GPs). One third (35.2%) of the participants reported a high prevalence of personal, and one quarter (26.5%) indicated a high prevalence of work-related burnout symptoms. Illegitimate tasks are negatively associated with life and job satisfaction and are positively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout among GPs. Work-SoC and recovery experience are positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and are negatively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout. Female physicians have a higher job satisfaction than male physicians. Being female and working as an employed physician is associated with a higher prevalence of personal burnout symptoms. GPs working in a group practice are happier and more satisfied with their job than GPs in single practices. Personal, work-related and patient-related burnout symptoms are stronger in GPs working in a single practice than in GPs in group practices. Our results highlight that Work-SoC, recovery experience and illegitimate tasks are important for creating work-related well-being among GPs. Introducing health promotion activities which aim to strengthen recovery experience and Work-SoC, as well as interventions to restructure tasks, may increase life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and reduce burnout symptoms in this health care profession.","Werdecker, Lena; Esch, Tobias",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143849/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253447,31

Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible. For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots. Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection & inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment & vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity & mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis & osteoarthritis patients alike. Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells.

In the United States, children represent 22% of the population but only 1.7% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases as of April 2, 2020. One possibility is that symptom-based viral testing is less likely to identify infected children, since they often experience milder disease than adults. Here, to better assess the frequency of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, we serologically screen 1,775 residual samples from Seattle Children’s Hospital collected from 1,076 children seeking medical care during March and April of 2020. Only one child was seropositive in March, but seven were seropositive in April for a period seroprevalence of ≈1%. Most seropositive children (6/8) were not suspected of having had COVID-19. The sera of seropositive children have neutralizing activity, including one that neutralized at a dilution > 1:18,000.

In response to this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) reexamined our capabies and agility to respond to a new and rapidly evolving environment. Maintaining the pivot to readiness, providing sustainable support and protecting our most valuable asset-our people-were and continues to be in the forefront of leaders’ thoughts as we faced this invisible adversary. With every new challenge, lessons learned provide an opportunity to re-examine challenges and successes of the response to COVID-19. Organizational restructuring, balancing risks, expanding capabilities and educational platforms were reassessed and adjusted to fill the needs of the environment as they evolved. The year 2020 will stand throughout history as another example where our readiness, resilience, and flexibility as an Army Nurse Corps was tried and tested. We demonstrated our ability to adapt and overcome-displaying our willingness to stand up as part of the Army Medicine Team and face an unknown adversary to protect the nation we vowed to serve.","Davis, Jack M",Mil Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469523/; https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab244,31
625650,The Current and Potential Therapeutic Use of Metformin—The Good Old Drug,2021-02-05,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with hesitancy in getting the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Maranhão, Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted from October 19 to 30, 2020. The estimates were calculated based on clustering, stratification, and non-response. A three-stage sampling was adopted, considering stratum, census tracts, and domicile. After systematic analysis, thirty sectors were selected in each stratum, totaling 150 sectors. Each sector contained a fixed number of 34 households, thus totaling 5,100 households. One individual within each household (resident for at least six months and aged one year or more) was selected by a simple random sampling. We questioned participants about their vaccination intention. Univariate association between independent variables and the outcome were verified using descriptive analysis (weighted frequencies) and Pearson's chi-square test (p < 0.05). Robust multivariate analysis was performed using a three-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found 17.5% (95%CI 16.1–19.1%) of the 4,630 individuals interviewed to report hesitancy to be vaccinated against covid-19. After final model adjustment, vaccination hesitancy was statistically higher among residents of the cities of Imperatriz (24.0%; RP = 1.48; IC95% 1.09–2.02) and municipalities of the Grande Ilha de São Luís (20.7%; RP = 1.34; 95%CI 1.02–1.76), female individuals (19.8%; RP = 1.44; 95%CI 1.20–1.75), older adults (22.8%; RP = 1.79; IC95% 1.30–2.46), evangelicals (24.1%; RP = 1.49; 95%CI 1.24–1.79), and those without reported symptoms (18.6%; RP = 1.24; 95%CI 1.02–1.51). We found no statistical differences for other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as variables related to the labor market, behaviors, and health conditions of the interviewees. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Maranhão and its association with individual, contextual, and clinical factors enable us to identify the groups and contexts of greatest resistance, requiring special attention from public strategies to ensure wide vaccination.","de Oliveira, Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves; Campos, Marcos Adriano Garcia; Queiroz, Rejane Christine de Sousa; Alves, Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e; de Souza, Bruno Feres; dos Santos, Alcione Miranda; da Silva, Antônio Augusto Moura",Revista de saude publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909868/; https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003417,31

METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study was conducted on 66 hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 in Hamadan in 2020. In the present study, demographic, clinical, and laboratory information and patients’ outcome were collected through a checklist and its impact on death was assessed. Data were analyzed in SPSS-24 software and the significance level of the tests was considered at 5%. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of patients was 61.6 (13.5) years. Forty patients (60.6%) were male. Twenty and five patients (37.9%) died at the end of study. The results of logistic regression model revealed that the nausea, mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, and length of hospital stay in the ward had a significant impact on the odds of death among cancer patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Owing to high mortality rate in cancer patients with COVID-19 and due to underlying diseases and more severe clinical symptoms than other patients with coronavirus, these patients need intensive care and specific treatments. However, screening these patients and early identifying and vaccinating of them can reduce the mortality rate in these patients.","Safari, Malihe; Faradmal, Javad; Bashirian, Saeid; Soltanian, Ali Reza; Khazaei, Salman; Roshanaei, Ghodratollah",J Gastrointest Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-021-00677-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347248/,31

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 may act as an effective target for drug development due to the conservation level. Herein, we have employed a rigorous literature review pipeline to enlist 3063 compounds from more than 200 plants from the Asian region. Therefore, the virtual screening procedure helps us to shortlist the total compounds into 19 based on their better binding energy. Moreover, the Prime MM-GBSA procedure screened the compound dataset further where curcumin, gartanin and robinetin had a score of (−59.439, −52.421 and − 47.544) kcal/mol, respectively. The top three ligands based on binding energy and MM-GBSA scores have most of the binding in the catalytic groove Cys145, His41, Met165, required for the target protein inhibition. The molecular dynamics simulation study confirms the docked complex rigidity and stability by exploring root mean square deviations, root mean square fluctuations, solvent accessible surface area, radius of gyration and hydrogen bond analysis from simulation trajectories. The post-molecular dynamics analysis also confirms the interactions of the curcumin, gartanin and robinetin in the similar binding pockets.

629865,Clinical manifestations of influenza and performance of rapid influenza diagnostic test: A university hospital setting,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Regulations on forgoing life-sustaining treatment (LST) have developed in Asian countries including Japan, Korea and Taiwan. However, other countries are relatively unaware of these due to the language barrier. This article aims to describe and compare the relevant regulatory frameworks, using the (more familiar) situation in England as a point of reference. We undertook literature reviews to ascertain the legal and regulatory positions on forgoing LST in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and England. MAIN TEXT: Findings from a literature review are first presented to describe the development of the regulatory frameworks surrounding the option of forgoing LST in each country. Based on the findings from the four countries, we suggest five ethically important points, reflection on which should help to inform the further development of regulatory frameworks concerning end-of-life care in these countries and beyond. There should be reflection on: (1) the definition of – and reasons for defining – the ‘terminal stage’ and associated criteria for making such judgements; Korea and Taiwan limit forgoing LST to patients in this stage, but there are risks associated with defining this too narrowly or broadly; (2) foregoing LST for patients who are not in this stage, as is allowed in Japan and England, because here too there are areas of controversy, including (in England) whether the law in this area does enough to respect the autonomy of (now) incapacitated patients; (3) whether ‘foregoing’ LST should encompass withholding and withdrawing treatment; this is also an ethically disputed area, particularly in the Asian countries we examine; (4) the family’s role in end-of-life decision-making, particularly as, compared with England, the three Asian countries traditionally place a greater emphasis on families and communities than on individuals; and (5) decision-making with and for those incapacitated patients who lack families, surrogate decision-makers or ADs. CONCLUSION: Comparison of, and reflection on, the different legal positions that obtain in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and England should prove informative and we particularly invite reflection on five areas, in the hope the ensuing discussions will help to establish better end-of-life regulatory frameworks in these countries and elsewhere.","Tanaka, Miho; Kodama, Satoshi; Lee, Ilhak; Huxtable, Richard; Chung, Yicheng",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33066771/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-00535-w,31

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of eleven pathogens that have previously caused cases of atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to “Disease X” (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. The probability (expressed as a percentage) that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 29% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 January 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 49%. We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, which uses only routinely observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments in advance of virological test results becoming available.","Jung, Sung-mok; Kinoshita, Ryo; Thompson, Robin N.; Linton, Natalie M.; Yang, Yichi; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32120913/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030637,31

Meanwhile, most countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (a lower number of fatalities). This holds true for an effective reproduction of [Formula: see text] and is reverted for [Formula: see text] . If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation.

630433,Extended Inflammation Parameters (EIP) as Markers of Immune System Cell Activation in Psoriasis,2021-06-14,"It is known that the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic SEIR epidemic models are structurally identifiable. For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series I(t) during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (pre-peak) is available. This fact can be explained using a long-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistinguishable to I(t) early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.","Sauer, T.; Berry, T.; Ebeigbe, D.; Norton, M.

However, many children perceive smartphones as a key barrier for engaging in physical activity during recess. The aim was to investigate if a ban on smartphone usage during recess changed children’s physical activity. During August–October 2020, children from grades 4–7 (10–14 years) at six Danish schools were banned from using their smartphones during recess for a four-week period. Questionnaire and systematic observation (SOPLAY) data were collected from 814 children before intervention (baseline) and 828 during the last week of intervention (follow-up). The mean frequency of physical activity significantly increased from baseline to follow-up (odds ratio = 1.370), as did physical activity on a moderate level (odds ratio = 1.387). Vigorous physical activity significantly decreased (odds ratio = 0.851). The increase in physical activity was found among both schools having outdoor and indoor recess, among both boys and girls, and nearly equally among grades 4–7. This suggests that implementing a ban on smartphone usage during recess would improve the everyday conditions for health among a broad range of schoolchildren. Future studies are needed to further investigate the association between recess physical activity and smartphone usage.","Pawlowski, Charlotte Skau; Nielsen, Jonas Vestergaard; Schmidt, Tanja",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669387/,31

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with COVID-19–related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity. METHODS: National survey data were obtained from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, an ongoing cross-sectional weekly survey. The sample was provided by Lucid, a web-based market research platform. Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) COVID-19–related concerns, (2) precautionary behaviors, and (3) willingness to return to activity. Key independent variables included age, gender, race or ethnicity, education, household income, political party support, religion, news consumption, number of medication prescriptions, perceived COVID-19 status, and timing of peak COVID-19 infections by state. RESULTS: The data included 125,508 responses from web-based surveys conducted over 20 consecutive weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (comprising approximately 6250 adults per week), between March 19 and August 5, 2020, approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board for analysis. A substantial number of participants were not willing to return to activity even after the restrictions were lifted. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions indicated the following groups had different outcomes (all P<.001): individuals aged ≥65 years (COVID-19–related concerns: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.93-2.18; precautionary behaviors: OR 2.38, 95% CI 2.02-2.80; return to activity: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.37-0.46 vs 18-40 years); men (COVID-19–related concerns: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.75; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.81; return to activity: OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.88-2.12 vs women); taking ≥4 medications (COVID-19–related concerns: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.40-1.54; precautionary behaviors: OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.555; return to activity: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.81 vs <3 medications); Republicans (COVID-19–related concerns: OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.38-0.42; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40-0.50; return to activity: OR 2.22, 95% CI 2.09-2.36 vs Democrats); and adults who reported having COVID-19 (COVID-19–related concerns: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.39; precautionary behaviors: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.81; return to activity: OR 3.99, 95% CI 3.48-4.58 vs those who did not).

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

Much recent published literature about the infection has indicated that a substantial number of patients with CAP, particularly those ill enough to be admitted to hospital, will suffer a cardiovascular event. While these may include events such as deep venous thrombosis and stroke, most of the events involve the heart and include the occurrence of an arrhythmia (most commonly atrial fibrillation), new onset or worsening of heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. While such cardiac events may occur, for example, in all-cause CAP and CAP due to influenza virus infection, and more recently described with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a significant amount of research work has been investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of these cardiac events in patients with CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and, more recently, COVID-19 infections. Such research has identified a number of mechanisms by which these microorganisms may cause cardiovascular events. Importantly, these cardiac events appear not only to be associated with in-hospital mortality, but they also appear to contribute to longer-term mortality of patients with CAP, even after their discharge from hospital.

634154,Oxidative tissue injury in multiple sclerosis is only partly reflected in experimental disease models,2014-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Social and physical distancing in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazarus’s transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. METHODS: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: “What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens” was distributed via Concordia University’s mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. RESULTS: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were “very stressed” and 452 were “slightly worried” about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (χ(2)(3)=11.76, P=.008), television (χ(2)(3)=12.40, P=.006), YouTube (χ(2)(3)=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (χ(2)(3)=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health “not good” were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F(1,637)=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F(1,637)=14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said “good” than others; F(1,637)=13.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between appraisal of media’s positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Amber; Khalili-Mahani, Najmeh",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701459/; https://doi.org/10.2196/20186,31

Over the past decade, this trend has broadened, increasing their use in other conditions such as diabetes, expanding the interest in this administration route. Thus, the bioequivalence of OIDPs is more important than ever, aiming to increase access to affordable, safe and effective medicines, which translates into better public health policies. However, regulatory agencies leading the bioequivalence process are still deciding the best approach for ensuring a proposed inhalable product is bioequivalent. This lack of agreement translates into less cost-effective strategies to determine bioequivalence, discouraging innovation in this field. The Next-Generation Impactor (NGI) is an example of the slow pace at which the inhalation field evolves. The NGI was officially implemented in 2003, being the last equipment innovation for OIDP characterization. Even though it was a breakthrough in the field, it did not solve other deficiencies of the BE process such as dissolution rate analysis on physiologically relevant conditions, being the last attempt of transferring technology into the field. This review aims to reveal the steps required for innovation in the regulations defining the bioequivalence of OIDPs, elucidating the pitfalls of implementing new technologies in the current standards. To do so, we collected the opinion of experts from the literature to explain these trends, showing, for the first time, the stakeholders of the OIDP market. This review analyzes the stakeholders involved in the development, improvement and implementation of methodologies that can help assess bioequivalence between OIDPs. Additionally, it presents a list of methods potentially useful to overcome some of the current limitations of the bioequivalence standard methodologies. Finally, we review one of the most revolutionary approaches, the inhaled Biopharmaceutical Classification System (IBCs), which can help establish priorities and order in both the innovation process and in regulations for OIDPs.","Gallegos-Catalán, Jonattan; Warnken, Zachary; Bahamondez-Canas, Tania F.; Moraga-Espinoza, Daniel",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13071051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371741/,31

We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is >24 hr at 10°C and 40% RH, but ∼1.5 hr at 27°C and 65% RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses. The results indicate scenarios of high transmission risk, point to mitigation strategies, and advance the mechanistic study of virus transmission.","Morris, Dylan H; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Gamble, Amandine; Rossine, Fernando W; Huang, Qishen; Bushmaker, Trenton; Fischer, Robert J; Matson, M Jeremiah; Van Doremalen, Neeltje; Vikesland, Peter J; Marr, Linsey C; Munster, Vincent J; Lloyd-Smith, James O",eLife (Cambridge),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904403/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.65902,31

With the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, POC has become critical in managing the spread of disease. Applicable diagnostics should be readily deployable, easy to use, portable, and accurate so that they fit mobile laboratories, pop-up treatment centers, field hospitals, secluded wards within hospitals, or remote regions, and can be operated by staff with minimal training. Complete blood count (CBC), however, has not been available at the POC in a simple-to-use device until recently. The HemoScreen, which was recently cleared by the FDA for POC use, is a miniature, easy-to-use instrument that uses disposable cartridges and may fill this gap. CONTENT: The HemoScreen’s analysis method, in contrast to standard laboratory analyzers, is based on machine vision (image-based analysis) and artificial intelligence (AI). We discuss the different methods currently used and compare their results to the vision-based one. The HemoScreen is found to correlate well to laser and impedance-based methods while emphasis is given to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and platelets (PLT) that demonstrate better correlation when the vision-based method is compared to itself due to the essential differences between the underlying technologies. SUMMARY: The HemoScreen analyzer demonstrates lab equivalent performance, tested at different clinical settings and sample characteristics, and might outperform standard techniques in the presence of certain interferences. This new approach to hematology testing has great potential to improve quality of care in a variety of settings.","Bransky, Avishay; Larsson, Anders; Aardal, Elisabeth; Ben-Yosef, Yaara; Christenson, Robert H",J Appl Lab Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274357/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfaa186,31
634687,The C-C Chemokine Receptor Type 4 Is an Immunomodulatory Target of Hydroxychloroquine,2020-08-28,"The placenta is a temporary organ that is discarded after birth and is one of the most promising sources of various cells and tissues for use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, both in experimental and clinical settings. The placenta has unique, intrinsic features because it plays many roles during gestation: it is formed by cells from two individuals (mother and fetus), contributes to the development and growth of an allogeneic fetus, and has two independent and interacting circulatory systems. Different stem and progenitor cell types can be isolated from the different perinatal tissues making them particularly interesting candidates for use in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The primary source of perinatal stem cells is cord blood. Cord blood has been a well-known source of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells since 1974. Biobanked cord blood has been used to treat different hematological and immunological disorders for over 30 years. Other perinatal tissues that are routinely discarded as medical waste contain non-hematopoietic cells with potential therapeutic value. Indeed, in advanced perinatal cell therapy trials, mesenchymal stromal cells are the most commonly used. Here, we review one by one the different perinatal tissues and the different perinatal stem cells isolated with their phenotypical characteristics and the preclinical uses of these cells in numerous pathologies. An overview of clinical applications of perinatal derived cells is also described with special emphasis on the clinical trials being carried out to treat COVID19 pneumonia. Furthermore, we describe the use of new technologies in the field of perinatal stem cells and the future directions and challenges of this fascinating and rapidly progressing field of perinatal cells and regenerative medicine.","de la Torre, Paz; Flores, Ana I.",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12010006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374593/,31

Previous work has focused on how to formulate messages in terms of style and content, rather than on who should send them. In particular, little is known about the impact of spokesperson selection on message propagation during times of crisis. We report on the effectiveness of different public figures at promoting social distancing among 12,194 respondents from six countries that were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of data collection. Across countries and demographic strata, immunology expert Dr. Anthony Fauci achieved the highest level of respondents’ willingness to reshare a call to social distancing, followed by a government spokesperson. Celebrity spokespersons were least effective. The likelihood of message resharing increased with age and when respondents expressed positive sentiments towards the spokesperson. These results contribute to the development of evidence-based knowledge regarding the effectiveness of prominent official and non-official public figures in communicating public health messaging in times of crisis. Our findings serve as a reminder that scientific experts and governments should not underestimate their power to inform and persuade in times of crisis and underscore the crucial importance of selecting the most effective messenger in propagating messages of lifesaving information during a pandemic.","Abu-Akel, Ahmad; Spitz, Andreas; West, Robert",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534800/,31

This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. METHODS: A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19–30 years (mean age, 20.7 ± 1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. RESULTS: Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57–17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03–2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03–1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01–1.19, p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with a reduced risk of weight gain were the GPAQ score during lockdown (OR: 0.16, 0.04–0.66, p = 0.01), coffee consumption (OR: 0.36, 0.19–0.67, p = 0.01), and total sleep time (OR: 0.70, 0.51–0.97, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight.","Al-Musharaf, Sara; Aljuraiban, Ghadeer; Bogis, Rania; Alnafisah, Ruyuf; Aldhwayan, Madhawi; Tahrani, Abd",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914800/,31
635528,Opportunities for respiratory disease transmission from people to chimpanzees at an East African tourism site,2021-01-05,"The Northern Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) is a key Australian agricultural region requiring efficient Agricultural Drought Management (ADM), focused on resilience. Although a need for resilience in local farming communities has long been recognised, previous studies assessing ADM in the Northern MDB did not consider two key elements of resilient management: proactivity (preparing for drought prior to a drought event) and suitability (localised drought management targeted at decision-makers). This study assessed the current ADM Strategy (ADMS) implemented within five selected Northern MDB Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Paroo Shire, Balonne Shire, Murweh Shire, Maranoa Region, and Goondiwindi Region), specifically investigating the extent of ADMS proactivity, effectiveness, and suitability. To investigate suitability, drought risk extent of each LGA was determined. A region-specific drought risk index consisting of hazard, vulnerability and exposure indices was developed; risk mapping was conducted. All LGAs displayed very high levels of drought risk due to hazardous climatic conditions, vulnerable socio-economic attributes, and drought-exposed geographical features. A Criteria-Based Ranking (CBR) survey produced a quantitative effectiveness and proactivity rank for each major ADMS used in the Northern MDB. Government Assistance was the most proactive and effective ADMS. Strategy effectiveness ranks of the major ADMS used and drought risk extent found in each LGA were correlated to determine ADMS suitability. Overall, Balonne Shire and the Goondiwindi Region were identified as high priority areas requiring improved ADM. A user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought could potentially increase ADM proactivity and suitability in such areas, strengthening drought resilience of farming communities.","Aitkenhead, Isabella; Kuleshov, Yuriy; Watkins, Andrew B.; Bhardwaj, Jessica; Asghari, Atifa",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04884-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188359/,31

635808,REACTing: the French response to infectious disease crises,2016-05-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition with increasing domestic and worldwide prevalence that burdens individuals and the healthcare system with high costs associated with long-term treatments and acute emergency room (ER) visits. It can be triggered by ambient microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In this review, we examine the outcomes of asthma patients in relation to environmental exposures to ambient microbe products, focusing on whether exposure leads to asthma development from birth to childhood and if particular microbes are associated with worsened asthma exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS: Bacterial endotoxin is more prominent in homes with pets and may cause cytokine cascades that lead to asthma exacerbation. However, some studies have demonstrated a protective effect with early exposure. Patients with positive Aspergillus skin testing are more prone to moderate-severe or severe-uncontrolled asthma. Fungal sensitization is also associated with earlier onset of asthma and demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship of symptom severity and duration. Among viruses, rhinovirus has the greatest association with decreased lung function, severe asthma, and asthma-related hospital admissions. Distribution of microbial products and associated asthma symptoms depends on the geographical climate. Genetic variations among individuals also mitigate the effects of microbial products on asthma development and symptom severity. SUMMARY: Microbial products of bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with the development of asthma, more severe asthma symptoms, and worse outcomes. However, some early exposure studies have also demonstrated a protective effect. Bacterial and fungal products are related to decreased lung function and earlier onset of asthma. Viral products are related to asthma-associated hospital admissions; and the climate and patient genetics can also temper or intensify the relationships between microbial products, asthma development, and asthma symptom severity. Further research should focus on the effects of early microbe exposure and its interaction with human immune systems and asthma-related outcomes.","Howard, Evin; Orhurhu, Vwaire; Huang, Lisa; Guthrie, Barbara; Phipatanakul, Wanda",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781873/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-019-0890-2,31
635929,Nidovirus Infections: Experimental Model Systems of Human Neurologic Diseases,1999-12-11,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has deeply modified healthcare seeking and services in Europe since February 2020 with delays in treatment delivery and changes in the standards of care. The organization of cancer centers (CC) has been transformed to minimize virus exposure in cancer patients (pts). Real-time assessment of the impact on cancer outcomes can optimize decision-making for future epidemic episodes. Methods: A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to model individual pt pathways during the pandemic in a context of constrained medical resources. Cancer pt care is modeled based on pandemic-adapted guidelines for medical practice. Pt flow is derived from medico-administrative databases using time series methods to estimate the proportion of punctual / late visits and associated delay and to extrapolate future flows. Finally, the impact of modified care on survival is estimated using literature data. Results: From March to December 2020, based on data from Gustave Roussy CC in France (n= 4877 included pts), estimated overall treatment delay is <= 7 days in 86,6% of pts and 5,2% of pts have a delay higher than 2 months. More than 94% of this duration is delay in pt request for care, causing 99 pts to suffer a major prognosis change upon arrival. Delayed pt flows result in a highly time-variable use of medical resources, with important queues forecast for surgery care and chemotherapy. The handling of such queues will require intensified healthcare professionals effort. Projections show that, in the best-case scenario, ie without a 2nd pandemic wave, treatment delays and modifications will result in around 49 additional 5-year cancer-specific deaths (+ 2,25% of 5-year deaths), mainly in liver, sarcomas and head and neck cancer pts. Conclusions: In a resource-constrained context, optimization of the benefit-risk ratio between COVID-19 and cancer care is key. Simulations of individual projections from actual hospital data, show a 2.25% increase of the 5-year risk of death and that pandemic-related cancer burden is mainly due to patient-induced lateness in seeking care. Defining optimal strategies in terms of screening, monitoring and prioritization for care could minimize the impact of future pandemic episodes. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

635940,Delivering the power of nanomedicine to patients today,2020-10-10,"Secreted phospholipases A(2) (sPLA(2)s) form a widespread group of structurally-related enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids to produce free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. In humans, nine catalytically active and two inactive sPLA(2) proteins have been identified. These enzymes play diverse biological roles, including host defence against bacteria, parasites and viruses. Several of these endogenous sPLA(2)s may play a defensive role in viral infections, as they display in vitro antiviral activity by both direct and indirect mechanisms. However, endogenous sPLA(2)s may also exert an offensive and negative role, dampening the antiviral response or promoting inflammation in animal models of viral infection. Similarly, several exogenous sPLA(2)s, most of them from snake venoms and other animal venoms, possess in vitro antiviral activities. Thus, both endogenous and exogenous sPLA(2)s may be exploited for the development of new antiviral substances or as therapeutic targets for antagonistic drugs that may promote a more robust antiviral response. In this review, the antiviral versus proviral role of both endogenous and exogenous sPLA(2)s against various viruses including coronaviruses is presented. Based on the highlighted developments in this area of research, possible directions of future investigation are envisaged. One of them is also a possibility of exploiting sPLA(2)s as biological markers of the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pungerčar, Jože; Bihl, Franck; Lambeau, Gérard; Križaj, Igor",Biochimie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097986/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908421001449; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2021.05.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908421001449,31

The current study examines COVID-19-specific anxiety and proactive coping as potential risk and resilience factors that may be differentially important for younger and older adults in understanding stress experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Five hundred and fifteen adults aged 20-79 in the U.S. reported on their anxiety about developing COVID-19, proactive coping, and stress related to COVID-19 in an online survey. RESULTS: Although there were no age differences in stress levels, anxiety about developing COVID-19 was associated with more COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults, but proactive coping was associated with less COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that anxiety might function as a risk factor whereas proactive coping may function as a resilience factor for older adults’ COVID-19 stress.

This highly contagious respiratory virus has overwhelmed healthcare systems. Many staff were redeployed and there was widespread cessation of non-urgent outpatient clinics and surgery. Outpatient clinics and theatre areas were converted to COVID wards and intensive care units. Following the first peak services began to recommence with new triaging and prioritisation guidance to safeguard patients and staff. Different countries and healthcare systems produced differing guidance and in particular, variation in the best approach to continuing acute and elective surgical procedures. This chapter collates and evaluates the increasing international literature concerning the surgical management of gynaecological conditions during the pandemic, such that clear inferences, recommendations and guidance can be generated to aid clinical practice and safeguard against further major disruption arising from further COVID-peaks. The available data are assessed within the context of the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Odejinmi, Funlayo; Egbase, Elizabeth; Clark, T Justin; Mallick, Rebecca",Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879364/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521693421000444?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521693421000444; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2021.03.005,31

An ELISA targeting the antibody against nucleocapsid identified eleven positive and two doubtful samples in cats, and five positive and five doubtful samples in dogs. A surrogate neutralization assay detecting antibodies blocking the attachment of the spike protein to ACE2 was positive with three of the ELISA positive and doubtful samples, and one of 463 randomly selected ELISA negative samples. These four positive samples were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization testing. All were from cats, in New York, Florida, and New Jersey (n=2).

The Old World (OW) arenavirus Lassa virus is endemic in West Africa and is estimated to cause up to 300,000 infections each year. The New World (NW) arenaviruses Junín and Machupo periodically cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in South America. While these arenaviruses are highly pathogenic in humans, recent evidence indicates that pathogenic OW and NW arenaviruses interact with the host immune system differently, which may have differential impacts on viral pathogenesis. Severe Lassa fever cases are characterized by profound immunosuppression. In contrast, pathogenic NW arenavirus infections are accompanied by elevated levels of Type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review aims to summarize recent findings about interactions of these pathogenic arenaviruses with the innate immune machinery and the subsequent effects on adaptive immunity, which may inform the development of vaccines and therapeutics against arenavirus infections.","Mantlo, Emily; Paessler, Slobodan; Huang, Cheng",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581720/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040138,31

We aim to highlight to what extent is neuropathology determined by SARS‐CoV‐2 or by pre‐existing conditions. Findings of 9 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) cases and 6 matched non‐COVID controls (mean age 79 y/o) were compared. Brains were analyzed through immunohistochemistry to detect SARS‐CoV‐2, lymphocytes, astrocytes, endothelium, and microglia. A semi‐quantitative scoring was applied to grade microglial activation. Thal‐Braak stages and the presence of small vessel disease were determined in all cases. COVID‐19 cases had a relatively short clinical course (0–32 days; mean: 10 days), and did not undergo mechanical ventilation. Five patients with neurocognitive disorder had delirium. All COVID‐19 cases showed non‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific changes including hypoxic‐agonal alterations, and a variable degree of neurodegeneration and/or pre‐existent SVD. The neuroinflammatory picture was dominated by ameboid CD68 positive microglia, while only scant lymphocytic presence and very few traces of SARS‐CoV‐2 were detected. Microglial activation in the brainstem was significantly greater in COVID‐19 cases (p = 0.046). Instead, microglial hyperactivation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was clearly associated to AD pathology (p = 0.001), regardless of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In COVID‐19 cases complicated by delirium (all with neurocognitive disorders), there was a significant enhancement of microglia in the hippocampus (p = 0.048). Although higher in cases with both Alzheimer's pathology and COVID‐19, cortical neuroinflammation is not related to COVID‐19 per se but mostly to pre‐existing neurodegeneration. COVID‐19 brains seem to manifest a boosting of innate immunity with microglial reinforcement, and adaptive immunity suppression with low number of brain lymphocytes probably related to systemic lymphopenia. Thus, no neuropathological evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific encephalitis is detectable. The microglial hyperactivation in the brainstem, and in the hippocampus of COVID‐19 patients with delirium, appears as a specific topographical phenomenon, and probably represents the neuropathological basis of the “COVID‐19 encephalopathic syndrome” in the elderly.","Poloni, Tino Emanuele; Medici, Valentina; Moretti, Matteo; Visonà, Silvia Damiana; Cirrincione, Alice; Carlos, Arenn Faye; Davin, Annalisa; Gagliardi, Stella; Pansarasa, Orietta; Cereda, Cristina; Tronconi, Livio; Guaita, Antonio; Ceroni, Mauro",Brain Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145669/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bpa.12997,31

To examine the disease-specific excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Methods. We used weekly death data from the National Center for Health Statistics to analyze the trajectories of excess deaths from specific diseases in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, at the national level and in 4 states, from the first to 52nd week of 2020. We used the average weekly number of deaths in the previous 6 years (2014-2019) as baseline. Results. Compared with the same week at baseline, the trajectory of number of excess deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) was highly parallel to the trajectory of the number of excess deaths related to COVID-19. The number of excess deaths from diabetes mellitus, influenza and respiratory diseases, and malignant neoplasms remained relatively stable over time. Conclusions. The parallel trajectory of excess mortality from CVD and COVID-19 over time reflects the fact that essential health services for noncommunicable diseases were reduced or disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the severer the pandemic, the heavier the impact.","Zhu, Dongshan; Ozaki, Akihiko; Virani, Salim",Am J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185569/; https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2021.306315,31

Currently, limited information exists surrounding the job demands and resources as experienced by academic employees in the higher education sector. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the job demands and job resources experienced by academic employees using qualitative methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 academic employees, using an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. Thematic analysis, specifically template analysis was used to categorize the themes. Job demands were divided into three categories: quantitative (publication pressure, overburdened with the load, and competing time demands), qualitative (work/home balance, complexity of student support, organizational politics, and lack of mental health support) and organizational demands (using technology-mediated learning and lack of structural resources). Job resources were organized into two categories: organizational (social support) and personal resources (autonomy, meaningful work, and personal support). Participant experiences are highlighted to provide a better understanding of the job demands and job resources encountered. The framework of job demands and job resources gleaned from the study could be used for further research to manage and monitor motivational processes for academic staff, and to reduce strain due to high job demands.","Naidoo-Chetty, Mineshree; du Plessis, Marieta",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248738/,31

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic–related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one’s mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","Sorkin, Dara H; Janio, Emily A; Eikey, Elizabeth V; Schneider, Margaret; Davis, Katelyn; Schueller, Stephen M; Stadnick, Nicole A; Zheng, Kai; Neary, Martha; Safani, David; Mukamel, Dana B",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822737/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26994,31

642448,Mouse Models of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis to Develop Clinical Applications,2021-02-25,"Black women bear the burden of a number of crises related to reproduction. Historically, their reproduction has been governed in relation to the slave economy, and connected to this, they have been experimented upon and subjected to exploitative medical interventions and policies. Even now, they are more likely to experience premature births and more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications. Their reproductive lives have been beleaguered by racism. This reality, as this article points out, shapes the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) by Black women. Using the framework of obstetric racism, I suggest that, in addition to the crisis of adverse maternal health outcomes, such as premature birth, low-birthweight infants and maternal death, Black women also face the crisis of racism in their medical encounters as they attempt to conceive through ART. Obstetric racism is enacted on racialized bodies that have historically experienced subjugation, especially, but not solely, reproductive subjugation. In my prior work, I delineated four dimensions of obstetric racism: diagnostic lapses; neglect, dismissiveness or disrespect; intentionally causing pain; and coercion. In this article, I extend that framework and explore three additional dimensions of obstetric racism: ceremonies of degradation; medical abuse; and racial reconnaissance. This article is based on ethnographic work from 2011 to 2019, during which time I collected narratives of US-based Black women and documented the circumstances under which they experienced obstetric racism in their interactions with medical personnel while attempting conception through ART.","Davis, Dána-Ain",Reprod Biomed Soc Online,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305027/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbms.2020.10.001,31

Since intact (socio-)psychological functioning and mental health are protective factors contributing to the immune system and preventing diseases, it is crucial to identify individuals with increased vulnerability. Methods: We conducted a German online survey from April until August 2020 investigating health-related, social, behavioral, and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and seventy three adults participating in the survey were analyzed (39.9% male, age: M = 44.81±13.31). We explored effects on mental health by (a) clustering participants in two clusters and (b) analyzing the clusters using correlations and regression models. Results: Participants belonged either to a cluster characterized by higher general well-being or to a more concerned cluster depending on their responses. The correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and well-being with younger participants revealing higher depression scores in the concerned cluster. Furthermore, multiple regression models revealed that the number of risk factors only has a significant influence on psychological well-being in the concerned but not in the comfortable cluster. Conclusion: We found that especially participants at (a) younger age and (b) greater risk of a severe course of disease reported reduced mental well-being and seemed to be weakened in their psychological protective factors in our sample. These insights allow to provide tailored recommendations for preventive and immediate actions to promote psychological well-being and reduce stress.","Lingelbach, Katharina; Piechnik, Daniela; Gado, Sabrina; Janssen, Doris; Eichler, Martin; Hentschel, Leopold; Knopf, Dennis; Schuler, Markus; Sernatinger, Daniel; Peissner, Matthias",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.655083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307274/,31

In this study, we investigated the potential of rhinovirus to survive on fingers. Rhinovirus-B14 was deposited on fingers for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Survival was defined as the ability of the virus to grow after 7 days, confirmed by immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus survival was not dependent on incubation time on fingers. Droplet disruption had no influence on survival. Survival was frequent with high rhinovirus concentrations, but rare with low-concentration droplets, which corresponded to the usual rhinovirus concentrations in mucus observed in children and adults, respectively. Our study confirms that rhinovirus infectiousness is related to the viral concentration in droplets and suggests that children represent the main transmission source, which occurs only rarely via adults.

METHODS: Present questionnaire‐based study was conducted on dermatology residents and specialists between January 5 and 20. A non‐validated online questionary evaluating the attitude of the participants about the COVID‐19 vaccine was performed. In the first step of the study, data related to the demographic features, all participants' clinical characteristics, and working conditions were recorded. Thereafter answers given to 12 specific questions were recorded. The study population was divided into two groups: dermatology residents (n = 138) and specialists (n = 159). Mentioned variables were compared between the two defined groups. Furthermore, a correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between vaccination acceptance and various study parameters. RESULTS: Majority of the cases had positive attitudes against COVID‐19 vaccines. However, there were significant differences between the resident and specialist groups related to the source of information, working conditions, degree of concern, and type of vaccines. Statistically significant negative, weak correlations were observed for age and duration of medical practice (r = −.128, P = .028; r = −.132, P = .041 respectively). Statistically significant positive weak correlations were observed for chronic diseases, level of knowledge about COVID‐19 vaccines, number of information sources about COVİD‐19, and previous COVİD‐19 infection (r = .133, P = .021; r = .207, P < .001; r = .335, P < .001; r = .176, P = .002 respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the two months period of March–April 2020 versus 2019 the authors analyzed the surgical procedures performed in elective and emergency surgery with hospitalization and Day or Outpatient surgery regime. Surgical treatments with no hospitalization were planned in the Day-Surgery Service. The financing system impacts were analyzed according to the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), the costs accounting method mostly used in European countries. RESULTS: An overall reduction of 68.5% was recorded in surgical procedures, with a more relevant reduction of 92.3% in elective surgery and a significantly less relevant reduction of 37.2% in urgent one. Replantation did not present a reduction in number of cases, while cutting lesions of tendons at the hand and fingers increased such as the bone and ligament injuries during domestic accidents. The negative impact in the financial system recorded a reduction of 32.5%. DISCUSSION: The epidemiology of hand trauma looks not only at the artisanal and industrial injuries, but also mostly at the accidents in daily life activities. The data of the study evidenced the significantly increase in the injuries occurring in the domestic environment. Elective surgery was canceled. The 86% of surgical procedures performed were urgent ones and the 72.8% of these were possible in Day and Outpatient surgery with significantly reduction in hospitalization. All procedures followed a rigid process for patient and healthcare workers with regard for personal protection and safety. Telemedicine was arranged in emergencies, and economic damage was analyzed also in the following rebound effect during summer period. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly less reduction recorded in urgent surgery vs the more relevant reduction in elective one showed how the hand injuries remained a major issue also during the lockdown. The data highlighted the relevant role of the organizational aspects of the surgical procedures and planning in hand trauma. Despite the financial impact of the elective surgery, the presence of a functional and skill Emergency Service and Day-Surgery Service resulted fundamental in the efficacy and efficiency of the patient management and in containment of economic damage. The telemedicine was significantly limited by liability and risk management issues.","Leti Acciaro, A .; Montanari, S.; Venturelli, M.; Starnoni, M.; Adani, R.",Musculoskelet Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528801/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-021-00700-3,31

Thus, we propose the replacement of existing boilers for heating and drinking hot water (DHW) production systems, with air / water heat pumps, as an intervention to improve urban air quality. We analyze the replacement scenarios, within the entire residential building stock in the Municipality of Rome, in terms of emissions reduction, primary energy savings and reduced CO2 production. Results show significant reductions in concentrations. Reduction in primary energy consumption varies between 12% and 56% for various scenarios, different for outdoor temperatures and mix of electricity generation. The intervention on the urban scale can reduce air pollution on a long-term basis, implying significant reductions of polluting emissions in urban areas, and entailed reduced energy (and therefore environmental) costs, with a significant step towards sustainable cities.","Carella, Alberta; D'Orazio, Annunziata",Sustain Cities Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721005904; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103314; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721005904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549022/,31
646265,Insights into Ebola and Other Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Disease Risks,2014-10-29,"There has been an increase in school mental health research aimed at producing generalizable knowledge to address longstanding science-to-practice gaps to increase children's access to evidence-based mental health services. Successful dissemination and implementation are both important pieces to address science-to-practice gaps, but there is conceptual and semantic imprecision that creates confusion regarding where dissemination ends and implementation begins, as well as an imbalanced focus in research on implementation relative to dissemination. In this paper, we provide an enhanced operational definition of dissemination; offer a conceptual model that outlines elements of effective dissemination that can produce changes in awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and motivation across different stakeholder groups; and delineate guiding principles that can inform dissemination science and practice. The overarching goal of this paper is to stimulate future research that aims to advance dissemination science and practice in school mental health.","Baker, Elizabeth A.; Brewer, Stephanie K.; Owens, Julie Sarno; Cook, Clayton R.; Lyon, Aaron R.",School Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897906/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12310-021-09446-6,31

647493,Design and study of nitric oxide portable producing device using continuous discharging arc plasma reaction keeping low energy efficiency for viral pneumonia emergency therapy,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 infodemic, a surge of information and misinformation, has sparked worry about the public’s perception of the coronavirus pandemic. Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: the United States. Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve people’s belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a 4-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting on April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the United States had peaked. Each week, we measured participants’ belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements: two false and two true statements. Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced regarding age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline (T0) wave survey. Retention rate for the follow-up waves— first follow-up wave (T1), second follow-up wave (T2), and final wave (T3)—was high (≥85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high for all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements; the belief accuracy scale ranged from –1, indicating completely inaccurate beliefs, to 1, indicating completely accurate beliefs (T0 mean 0.75, T1 mean 0.78, T2 mean 0.77, and T3 mean 0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (eg, social distancing) (r at all waves was between 0.26 and 0.29 and all P values were less than .001) and were associated with trust in scientists (ie, higher trust was associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (ie, liberal, Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative, Republican participants), and the primary news source (ie, participants reporting CNN or Fox News as the main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens’ beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the public’s susceptibility to misinformation.","van Stekelenburg, Aart; Schaap, Gabi; Veling, Harm; Buijzen, Moniek",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351776/,31

Measures such as donor selection and blood screening have contributed to increase the safety of these products, but pathogen transmission does still occur. Reasons for this include lack of sensitivity/specificity of current screening methods, lack of reliable screening tests for some pathogens (e.g. prions) and the fact that many potentially harmful infectious agents are not routinely screened for. Methods for the purification/inactivation of blood/plasma-derived products have been developed in order to further reduce the residual risk, but low concentrations of pathogens do not necessarily imply a low level of risk for the patient and so the overall challenge of minimising risk remains. This review aims to discuss the variable level of pathogenic risk and describes the current screening methods used to prevent/detect the presence of pathogens in blood/plasma-derived products.","Di Minno, Giovanni; Perno, Carlo Federico; Tiede, Andreas; Navarro, David; Canaro, Mariana; Güertler, Lutz; Ironside, James W.",Blood Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268960X15000594; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.blre.2015.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268960X15000594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26381318/,31

While inflammation is essential for a successful pregnancy, an excessive inflammatory response is implicated in several pathologies including pre-eclampsia (PE). This review focuses on the proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a critical regulator of the innate immune response and a major player of processes allowing normal placental development. PE is a severe pregnancy-related syndrome characterized by exaggerated inflammatory response and generalized endothelial damage. In some cases, usually of early onset, it originates from a maldevelopment of the placenta, and is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (placental PE). In other cases, usually of late onset, pre-pregnancy maternal diseases represent risk factors for the development of the disease (maternal PE). Available data suggest that low MIF production in early pregnancy could contribute to the abnormal placentation. The resulting placental hypoxia in later pregnancy could produce high release of MIF in maternal serum typical of placental PE. More studies are needed to understand the role of MIF, if any, in maternal PE.","Todros, Tullia; Paulesu, Luana; Cardaropoli, Simona; Rolfo, Alessandro; Masturzo, Bianca; Ermini, Leonardo; Romagnoli, Roberta; Ietta, Francesca",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22041823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673075/,31

We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective. Methods We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at GBP 20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. Findings The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, GBP 33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and GBP 1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at GBP 20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to GBP 1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total GBP 3075 GDP loss. Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes. Interpretation The benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

In this study, we assessed the pathogenic and antigenic characteristics of a K-IIb type field strain of IBV that emerged in Korea since 2003, such as Kr/Q43/06. Specific pathogen free 1-week-old chickens exhibited severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and nephropathogenic lesions (swollen kidneys with nephritis and urate deposits) following challenge with the recent IBV field strain. The antigenic relatedness (R value), based on a calculated virus neutralization index, of the K-IIb type field strain and K-IIa type strain KM91 (isolated in 1991) was 30%, which indicated that the recent strain, Kr/Q43/06, is a new variant that is antigenically distinct from strain KM91.

In this work we aimed to study SARS-CoV-2 capacity to infect pediatric human cortical neuronal HCN-2 cells, studying the changes in the transcriptomic profile by next generation sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in HCN-2 cells, that did not express ACE2, confirmed also with Western blot, and TMPRSS2. Looking for pattern recognition receptor expression, we found the deregulation of scavenger receptors, such as SR-B1, and the downregulation of genes encoding for Nod-like receptors. On the other hand, TLR1, TLR4 and TLR6 encoding for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were upregulated. We also found the upregulation of genes encoding for ERK, JNK, NF-κB and Caspase 8 in our transcriptomic analysis. Regarding the expression of known receptors for viral RNA, only RIG-1 showed an increased expression; downstream RIG-1, the genes encoding for TRAF3, IKKε and IRF3 were downregulated. We also found the upregulation of genes encoding for chemokines and accordingly we found an increase in cytokine/chemokine levels in the medium. According to our results, it is possible to speculate that additionally to ACE2 and TMPRSS2, also other receptors may interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mediate its entry or pathogenesis in pediatric cortical neurons infected with SARS-CoV-2. In particular, TLRs signaling could be crucial for the neurological involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gugliandolo, Agnese; Chiricosta, Luigi; Calcaterra, Valeria; Biasin, Mara; Cappelletti, Gioia; Carelli, Stephana; Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Avanzini, Maria Antonietta; Bramanti, Placido; Pelizzo, Gloria; Mazzon, Emanuela",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360824/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158059,31

We aimed to describe the data on secondary transmission of the virus among students and teachers/personnel after the reopening of preschools and schools in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Methods: This prospective population-based study included all consecutive cases leading to an investigation in 41 classes of 36 educational institutions (8 infant-toddler centres and preschools, 10 primary and 18 secondary schools) in the period from September 1 to October 15, 2020, in Reggio Emilia province, Italy. We report the characteristics of the school, of the index case, including the possible source of infection, the number of contacts (students and teachers/personnel) that were identified and tested and the characteristics of secondary cases. Results: In the study period, 994 students and 204 teachers were tested during related investigations due to notification of 43 primary cases (38 among students and 5 among teachers). Of these, 10 students and two teachers created 39 secondary cases, resulting in an attack rate of 3.9%. There were no secondary cases among teachers/stuff. Secondary transmission occurred in one primary school and 8 secondary schools. Except for two students and one teacher, the possible source of infection for all index cases was identified as they had all had previous contact with a positive case; the majority of secondary cases did not report any previous close contact with a positive case. The clusters ranged from one to 22 secondary cases. Conclusions: Transmission at school occurred in a non-negligible number of cases, particularly in secondary schools. Prompt testing and isolation of classmates could probably reduce the risk of transmission in school settings.","Larosa, E.; Djuric, O.; Cassinadri, M.; Cilloni, S.; Bisaccia, E.; Vicentini, M.; Venturelli, F.; Giorgi Rossi, P.; Pezzotti, P.; Bedeschi, E.; Group, Reggio Emilia Covid-19 Working",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.17.20229583; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.17.20229583v1?rss=1,31

METHODS: We present the first 2 years of data collected from a 5-year, prospective, cohort study of swine-exposed and -unexposed participants at 6 swine farms in China. We conducted serological and virological surveillance to examine evidence for swine influenza A virus infection in humans. RESULTS: Of the 658 participants (521 swine-exposed and 137 swine-unexposed), 207 (31.5%) seroconverted against at least 1 swine influenza virus subtype (swine H1N1 or H3N2). Swine-exposed participants’ microneutralization titers, especially those enrolled at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), were higher against the swine H1N1 virus than were other participants at 12 and 24 months. Despite elevated titers, among the 187 study subjects for whom we had complete follow-up, participants working at swine CAFOs had significantly greater odds of seroconverting against both the swine H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] 19.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.55–358.65) and swine H3N2 (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16–8.01) viruses, compared to unexposed and non-CAFO swine workers with less intense swine exposure.

The virus exerts its pathogenic activity through by mechanism and gains the entry via spike proteins (S) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins on host cells. The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the residual binding protein (RBP) on spike proteins (S), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins by probiotics namely Plantaricin BN, Plantaricin JLA-9, Plantaricin W, Plantaricin D along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Docking studies were designed in order to obtain the binding energies for Plantaricin metabolites. The binding energies for Plantaricin W were −14.64, −11.1 and −12.68 for polymerase, RBD and ACE2 respectively comparatively very high with other compounds. Plantaricin W, D, and JLA-9 were able to block the residues (THR556, ALA558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (VAL557) of RdRp making them more therapeutically active for COVID-19. Molecular dynamics studies further strengthen stability of the complexes of plantaricin w and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme, RBD of spike protein, and human ACE2 receptor. The present study present multi-way options either by blocking RBD on S proteins or interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by Plantaricin molecules paving a way that can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 until some better option will be available.

The walk2Wellness trial investigates effects of long-term, home-based daily use of a wearable sensory prosthesis on gait function, balance, quality of life and fall rates in PN patients. The device (Walkasins(®), RxFunction Inc., MN, United States) partially substitutes lost nerve function related to plantar sensation providing directional tactile cues reflecting plantar pressure measurements during standing and walking. We tested the null hypothesis that the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score would remain unchanged after 10 weeks of use. METHODS: Participants had PN with lost plantar sensation, gait and balance problems, an FGA score < 23 (high fall risk), and ability to sense tactile stimuli above the ankle. Clinical outcomes included FGA, Gait Speed, Timed Up&Go (TUG) and 4-Stage Balance Test. Patient-reported outcomes included Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale, PROMIS participation and satisfaction scores, pain rating, and falls. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Subjects were not made aware of changes in outcomes. No additional balance interventions were allowed. RESULTS: Forty-five participants of 52 enrolled across four sites completed in-clinic assessments. FGA scores improved from 15.0 to 19.1 (p < 0.0001), normal and fast gait speed from 0.86 m/s to 0.95 m/s (p < 0.0001) and 1.24 m/s to 1.33 m/s (p = 0.002), respectively, and TUG from 13.8 s to 12.5 s (p = 0.012). Four-Stage Balance Test did not improve. Several patient-reported outcomes were normal at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Interestingly, subjects with baseline ABC scores lower than 67% (high fall risk cut-off) increased their ABC scores (49.9% to 59.3%, p = 0.01), whereas subjects with ABC scores above 67% showed a decrease (76.6% to 71.8%, p = 0.019). Subjects who reported falls in the prior 6 months (n = 25) showed a decrease in the number of fall-risk factors (5.1 to 4.3, p = 0.023) and a decrease in fall rate (13.8 to 7.4 falls/1000 days, p = 0.014). Four pre-study non-fallers (n = 20) fell during the 10 weeks.

653381,Global Perspective on the Development of Genetically Modified Immune Cells for Cancer Therapy,2021-02-15,"Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in devastating consequences worldwide and infected more than 350,000 individuals and killed more than 16,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing. COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction. Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Mungroo, Mohammad Ridwane; Khan, Naveed Ahmed; Siddiqui, Ruqaiyyah",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316618/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9040297,31

The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre- and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and is then extended to a three-stage version to explore relaxations. The results show the extent to which each country was successful in reducing the reproductive number and demonstrate how the approach is able to model recent increases in the number of cases in all six countries, including the second peak in the US. The results also indicate that the current levels of relaxation in all five European countries could lead to significant second waves that last longer than the corresponding first waves. While there is uncertainty about the implications of these findings at this stage, they do suggest that a lot of vigilance is needed.","Glass, David H.",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32980417/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420301292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108472; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420301292,31

However, the accumulative influence of meeting recommendations for these 24-h movement behaviors on the mental health of Alaskan adolescents has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between movement behaviors, loneliness, and sadness within Alaskan adolescents. Data were obtained from the 2019 Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). The number of adolescents participating in the 2019 Alaska YRBS was 1897. Associations between meeting recommendations for movement behaviors with loneliness and sadness were examined using weighted logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). Approximately 5.0% of the sample met recommendations for all three movement behaviors. Meeting 2 or 3 movement behavior recommendations was associated with lower odds of loneliness (odds ratio (OR) range = 0.23 to 0.44, p < 0.01). Additionally, meeting 1 to 3 movement behavior recommendations was associated with lower odds of sadness (OR range = 0.29 to 0.52, p < 0.05). Joint association analyses determined that these relationships were primarily driven by meeting the sleep recommendation for loneliness and meeting the screen use recommendation for sadness. The results support use of multiple movement-based behavior programming to attenuate feelings of loneliness and sadness within Alaskan adolescents.","Burns, Ryan D.; Bai, Yang; Pfledderer, Christopher D.; Brusseau, Timothy A.; Byun, Wonwoo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962220/,31

654920,Multiple bioimaging modalities in evaluation of an experimental osteonecrosis induced by a combination of lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone,2006-06-12,"Both bacteria and fungi produce extracellular proteinases since they need aminoacids for optimal reproduction. This may also occur inside host cells. Viral proteinases are produced during propagation inside host cells to supply amino acids for rapid synthesis of viral proteins, and/or to split poly-protein molecules into single protein molecules, e.g., capside, and matrix and/or envelope proteins. In host cells the most profound, microbial proteinase-mediated effect is thought to be damage of the mitochondria, the site of oxidative energy generation. Two major effects can be imagined: (i) damage of proteinase-susceptible extra-mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins (razor blade effect), e.g., of mitochondrial transport proteins and of ATP:ADP translocase, and (ii) damage of intra-mitochondrial proteinase-susceptible proteins that are involved in the energy-generating processes. Although proteinases are not thought to invade and destroy mitochondria and essential intra-mitochondrial structures involved in energy generation, they can destroy non-mitochondrial encoded mitochondrial proteins during transport to the mitochondria, i.e., before incorporation inside the mitochondria in intra-mitochondrial structures. A secondary effect may be damage of liver cells that effect hepatic gluconeogenesis, the process that is involved in the synthesis of glucose from lactic acid. The proteinase may bring about inactivation of specific gluconeogenesis enzymes. This means that accumulated amounts of lactic acid cannot rapidly be reduced and consequently, such inactivation will increase intracellular and later even systemic acidification that may finally result in death. We postulate that both direct and indirect proteinase-mediated damage of mitochondria and gluconeogenesis enzymes, and consequently of human cellular energy generation, is an essential element in acute (e.g., influenza) and chronic (e.g., hepatitis B) intracellular infections.","Bongaerts, Ger P.A.; van den Heuvel, Lambert P.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698770700477X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17825998/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698770700477X,31

The population dense regions of Southeast Asia are the epicenter of many emerging diseases, as evidenced by the outbreak of Nipah, SARS, avian influenza (H5N1), Dengue, and enterovirus 71 in this region in the past decade. Rapid identification, epidemiologic surveillance, and mitigation of transmission are major challenges in ensuring public health safety. Here we describe a powerful new approach for infectious disease surveillance that is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI‐MS) for accurate mass measurements of the PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. This approach is capable of automated analysis of more than 1,500 PCR reactions a day. It is applicable to the surveillance of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens and will facilitate rapid characterization of known and emerging pathogens.","SAMPATH, RANGARAJAN; HALL, THOMAS A.; MASSIRE, CHRISTIAN; LI, FENG; BLYN, LAWRENCE B.; ESHOO, MARK W.; HOFSTADLER, STEVEN A.; ECKER, DAVID J.",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470915/,31
656351,"SARS Knowledge, Perceptions, and Behaviors: a Comparison between Finns and the Dutch during the SARS Outbreak in 2003",2009-01-31,"BACKGROUND: The ORF1 of hepatitis E virus (HEV) encodes a nonstructural polyprotein of ~186 kDa that has putative domains for four enzymes: a methyltransferase, a papain-like cysteine protease, a RNA helicase and a RNA dependent RNA polymerase. In the absence of a culture system for HEV, the ORF1 expressed using bacterial and mammalian expression systems has shown an ~186 kDa protein, but no processing of the polyprotein has been observed. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the ORF1 polyprotein does not undergo processing into functional units. We have studied ORF1 polyprotein expression and processing through a baculovirus expression vector system because of the high level expression and post-translational modification abilities of this system. RESULTS: The baculovirus expressed ORF1 polyprotein was processed into smaller fragments that could be detected using antibodies directed against tags engineered at both ends. Processing of this ~192 kDa tagged ORF1 polyprotein and accumulation of lower molecular weight species took place in a time-dependent manner. This processing was inhibited by E-64d, a cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor. MALDI-TOF analysis of a 35 kDa processed fragment revealed 9 peptide sequences that matched the HEV methyltransferase (MeT), the first putative domain of the ORF1 polyprotein. Antibodies to the MeT region also revealed an ORF1 processing pattern identical to that observed for the N-terminal tag. CONCLUSION: When expressed through baculovirus, the ORF1 polyprotein of HEV was processed into smaller proteins that correlated with their proposed functional domains. Though the involvement of non-cysteine protease(s) could not be be ruled out, this processing mainly depended upon a cysteine protease.","Sehgal, Deepak; Thomas, Saijo; Chakraborty, Mahua; Jameel, Shahid",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16725054/,31
656387,Infectious disease and red wolf conservation: assessment of disease occurrence and associated risks,2015-08-03,"Three strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) were isolated from dead or diseased pigs at different swine farms in Guangdong during 2011–2013, and their S genes were sequenced. In the same period, seven PEDV strains were also isolated in Guangdong by other laboratories. The spike sequences of 10 Guangdong isolates were compared with vaccine strains and reference pathogenic isolates using six bioinformatics tools. The results revealed that 10 Guangdong strains, excluding strain GDS03, had distinct characteristics in terms of primary structure, secondary structure, high-specificity N-glycosylation sites, potential phosphorylation sites, and palmitoylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed these findings and revealed that all PEDV strains were clustered into three distinct groups. Ten Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, belong to Group 1, whereas four vaccine strains and GDS03 belong to Group 3, which is evolutionarily distant from Group 1. Alignment analysis of the neutralizing region amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions of Y/D766S, T549S, and G594S that are present in the Guangdong strains, not including GDS03, were a sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. GDS03 is closely related to the 83P-5 vaccine strain, which suggests that it might represent re-isolation of the vaccine strain or vaccine variants. Taken together, these results indicate that there have been predominant new strains circulating in Guangdong from 2011 to 2013, and the circulating PEDV strains have a genetic composition that is distant from reference strains, especially the vaccine strains; however, the vaccinations might also provide some level of cross-protection, as there have been no changes in the neutralizing epitopes of SS2 and 2C10. This explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks recently in comparison to late 2010 in which PEDV outbreaks were more frequent and severe. In addition, the USA-Colorado-2013 strain had the same amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing regions as the Guangdong strains except GDS03, which suggests that the information and strategies in this study may play role in PEDV variant research in other countries.","Hao, Jianwei; Xue, Chunyi; He, Liangliang; Wang, Yang; Cao, Yongchang",Virus Genes,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-014-1055-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771495/,31

The method is mathematically based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the inter-fragment interaction energy (IFIE) matrix obtained by the FMO calculation, and can be applied to a comprehensive description of protein-protein interactions in the context of molecular recognition. In the present study we apply the proposed method to a complex of measles virus hemagglutinin and human SLAM receptor, thus finding a usefulness for efficiently eliciting the correlated interactions among the amino-acid residues involved in the two proteins.

In this study, we employed two bivalve molluscan species from the genus Ruditapes as sentinel organisms to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 signals in the marine coastal environment. Estuarine sediments from the natural clam banks were also analyzed. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR, targeting IP4, E and N1 genomic regions. Positive samples were also subjected to a PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay in order to discriminate between intact and altered capsids, obtaining indirect information about the viability of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces were detected in 9/12 clam samples by RT-qPCR, from which 4 were positive for two different target regions. Viral quantification ranged from <LoQ to 4.48 Log genomic copies/g of digestive tissue. Regarding the sediment samples, 3/12 were positive by RT-qPCR, but only IP4 region was successfully amplificated. Quantification values for sediment samples ranged from <LoQ to 3.60 Log genomic copies/g of sediment. RNA signals disappeared in the PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay, indicating non-infectious potential. In addition, the recently discovered human-specific gut associated bacteriophage crAssphage was also quantified as a biomarker for the presence of human-derived wastewater contamination on the study area. CrAssphage was detected in 100% of both types of samples with quantification values ranging from <LoQ to 5.94 LOG gc/g digestive tissue and from <LoQ to 4.71 LOG gc/g sediment. Statistical analysis also showed that quantification levels for the crAssphage in clams are significantly higher than in sediments. These findings represent the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the marine environment, demonstrating that it can reach these habitats and make contact with the marine life.","Polo, David; Lois, Marta; Fernández-Núñez, María Teresa; Romalde, Jesús L.",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147534; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972102605X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984699/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972102605X?v=s5,31

We classified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) plaque morphology and analyzed the relationship between plaque morphology as compared to subgroup, viral load and clinical severity of infection in infants and children. METHODS: We obtained respiratory secretions from 149 RSV-infected children. Plaque morphology and viral load was assessed within the first culture passage in HEp-2 cells. Viral load was measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as was RSV subgroup. Disease severity was determined by hospitalization, length of stay, intensive care requirement, and respiratory failure. RESULTS: Plaque morphology varied between individual subjects; however, similar results were observed among viruses collected from upper and lower respiratory tracts of the same subject. Significant differences in plaque morphology were observed between RSV subgroups. No correlations were found among plaque morphology and viral load. Plaque morphology did not correlate with disease severity. CONCLUSION: Plaque morphology measures parameters that are viral-specific and independent of the human host. Morphologies vary between patients and are related to RSV subgroup. In HEp-2 cells, RSV plaque morphology appears unrelated to disease severity in RSV-infected children.

657275,"Application of nanomaterials in treatment, anti-infection and detection of coronaviruses",2020-05-07,"The tumultuous inception of an epidemic is usually accompanied by difficulty in determining how to respond best. In developing nations, this can be compounded by logistical challenges, such as vaccine shortages and poor road infrastructure. To provide guidance towards improved epidemic response, various resource allocation models, in conjunction with a network-based SEIRVD epidemic model, are proposed in this article. Further, the feasibility of using drones for vaccine delivery is evaluated, and assorted relevant parameters are discussed. For the sake of generality, these results are presented for multiple network structures, representing interconnected populations—upon which repeated epidemic simulations are performed. The resource allocation models formulated maximise expected prevented exposures on each day of a simulated epidemic, by allocating response teams and vaccine deliveries according to the solutions of two respective integer programming problems—thereby influencing the simulated epidemic through the SEIRVD model. These models, when compared with a range of alternative resource allocation strategies, were found to reduce both the number of cases per epidemic, and the number of vaccines required. Consequently, the recommendation is made that such models be used as decision support tools in epidemic response. In the absence thereof, prioritizing locations for vaccinations according to susceptible population, rather than total population or number of infections, is most effective for the majority of network types. In other results, fixed-wing drones are demonstrated to be a viable delivery method for vaccines in the context of an epidemic, if sufficient drones can be promptly procured; the detrimental effect of intervention delay was discovered to be significant. In addition, the importance of well-documented routine vaccination activities is highlighted, due to the benefits of increased pre-epidemic immunity rates, and targeted vaccination.","Matter, Dean; Potgieter, Linke",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667263/,31

This study aimed to determine a baseline estimate of the number of consultations completed in general practice in Ireland annually to facilitate evidence-based healthcare planning. METHODS: A survey was emailed to all 3378 individual members of the Irish College of General Practitioners in February 2020 asking each practice to report on consultations by general practitioners and practice nurses occurring on the previous day of practice. RESULTS: A total of 507 practices responded to the survey, reporting 34,594 general practitioner consultations and 13,161 nurse consultations on one day. Extrapolating this figure nationally, we estimate 21,353,731 GP consultations and 7,749,615 practice nurse consultations occur in Ireland annually.

Understanding facilitators and challenges to adoption and perceptions of the quality of virtual care when delivered at scale can inform service planning post-pandemic. OBJECTIVE We sought to understand consistent facilitators and persistent challenges to adoption of virtual care and perceived impact on quality of care, in an initial pilot phase prior to the pandemic and then during scaled use during the pandemic in the mental health department of an ambulatory care hospital. METHODS This study took place at Women's College Hospital, an academic ambulatory hospital located in Toronto, Canada. We utilized a multi-methods approach to collect quantitative data through aggregate utilization data of phone, video and in-person visits prior to and during COVID-19 lockdown measures, and through a provider experience survey administered to mental health providers (n=30). Qualitative data was collected through open-ended questions on provider experience surveys, focus groups (n=4) with mental health providers, and interviews with clinical administrative and implementation hospital staff (n=3). RESULTS Utilization data demonstrated the slower uptake of video visits at launch and prior to COVID-19 lockdown measures in Ontario (pre-March 2020), and subsequent increased uptake of phone and video visits during COVID-19 lockdown measures (post-March 2020). Mental health providers and clinic staff highlighted barriers and facilitators to adoption of virtual care at the operational, behavioural, cultural and system/policy levels such as required changes in workflows and scheduling, increased provider effort, provider and staff acceptance, and billing codes for physician providers. Much of the described provider experiences focused on perceived impact on quality of mental health care delivery, including perceptions on providing appropriate and patient-centered care, virtual care effectiveness, and equitable access to care for patients. CONCLUSIONS Continued efforts to enhance suggested facilitators, reduce persistent challenges, and address provider concerns about care quality based on these findings can enable a hybrid model of patient-centered and appropriate care to emerge in the future, with options for in-person, video and phone visits being used to meet patient and clinical needs as required.

Due to the lack of medical countermeasures, effective and safe vaccines against MERS-CoV infection are urgently required. Although different types of candidate vaccines have been developed, their immunogenicity is limited, and the dose and administration route need optimization to achieve optimal protection. We here investigated the potential use of human β-defensin 2 (HBD 2) as an adjuvant to enhance the protection provided by MERS-CoV vaccination. We found that immunization of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice with spike protein receptor-binding domain (S RBD) conjugated with HBD 2 (S RBD-HBD 2) induced potent antigen (Ag)-specific adaptive immune responses and protected against MERS-CoV infection. In addition, immunization with S RBD-HBD 2 alleviated progressive pulmonary fibrosis in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice and suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling activation upon viral infection. Compared to intramuscular administration, intranasal administration of S RBD-HBD 2 induced more potent mucosal IgA responses and was more effective for protecting against intranasal MERS-CoV infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HBD 2 potentiates Ag-specific immune responses against viral Ag and can be used as an adjuvant enhancing the immunogenicity of subunit vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV.","Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jeong, Yongsu; Jang, Yong-Suk",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139653/,31

Both subtests had 52 trials, each of which required participants to determine whether standard and comparison auditory sequences were identical. The testing session also included the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), a test of general cognitive ability, and self-report questionnaires that measured basic demographics (age, education, gender), mind-wandering, and personality. Approximately 20% of the participants were excluded for incomplete responding or failing to finish the testing session. For the final sample (N = 608), findings were similar to those from in-person testing in many respects: (1) the internal reliability of the MET was maintained, (2) construct validity was confirmed by strong associations with Gold-MSI scores, (3) correlations with other measures (e.g., openness to experience, cognitive ability, mind-wandering) were as predicted, (4) mean levels of performance were similar for individuals with no music training, and (5) musical sophistication was a better predictor of performance on the Melody than on the Rhythm subtest.

Geroscience explores biological mechanisms of aging as targets for intervention that may delay the physiological consequences of aging, maintain function, and prevent frailty and disability. Priorities for clinical practice and research include identifying and validating a range of biomarkers of the hallmarks of aging. Potential biomarkers discussed included markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostasis, stem cell dysfunction, nutrient sensing, genomic instability, telomere dysfunction, cellular senescence, and epigenetic changes. The FRAILOMICS initiative is exploring many of these through various omics studies. Translating this knowledge into new therapies is being addressed by the U.S. National Institute on Aging Translational Gerontology Branch. Research gaps identified by the Task Force include the need for improved cellular and animal models as well as more reliable and sensitive measures.","Lebrasseur, Nathan K.; de Cabo, R.; Fielding, R.; Ferrucci, L.; Rodriguez-Manas, L.; Viña, J.; Vellas, B.",J Frailty Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105701/; https://doi.org/10.14283/jfa.2021.5,31

This article explores the causes behind cyber violence and provides empirical data for developing means for effective prevention. Using elements of the stimulus–organism–response theory, we constructed a model of cyber-violence behavior. A closed-ended questionnaire was administered to collect data through an online survey, which results in 531 valid responses. A proposed model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling using SmartPLS 3.0, v (3.2.8). Research findings show that information inequality is a strong external stimulus with a significant positive impact on digital distrust and negative emotion. However, the effects of information overload on digital distrust and the adverse effects of communication overload on negative emotions should not be ignored. Both digital distrust and negative emotions have significant positive impacts on cyber violence and cumulatively represent 11.5% changes in cyber violence. Furthermore, information overload, communication overload, information inequality, and digital distrust show a 27.1% change in negative emotions. This study also presents evidence for competitive mediation of digital distrust by information overload, information inequality, and cyber violence. The results of this study have implications for individual practitioners and scholars, for organizations, and at the governmental level regarding cyber-violence behavior. To test our hypotheses, we have constructed an empirical, multidimensional model, including the role of specific mediators in creating relationships.","Fan, Mingyue; Huang, Yuchen; Qalati, Sikandar Ali; Shah, Syed Mir Muhammad; Ostic, Dragana; Pu, Zhengjia",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959073/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643981,31

High adaptive plasticity on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across different host species. In the present study, we collected 2092 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny. We also analyzed the polymorphic interaction between spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is probably originated from a recombination event on the spike protein between a bat coronavirus and a pangolin coronavirus that endows it humans infectivity. Compared with other regions in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, the direct-binding sites of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is more conserved. We focused on 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 and simulated their differential stability and binding affinity to hACE2 (S19-D615). The results indicate no preference for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on people of different ethnic groups. The variants in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may also be a good indicator demonstrating the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 from its natural reservoir to human hosts.","Xue, Xia; Shi, Jianxiang; Xu, Hongen; Qin, Yaping; Yang, Zengguang; Feng, Shuaisheng; Liu, Danhua; Jian, Liguo; Hua, Linlin; Wang, Yaohe; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Xueyong; Zhang, Xiaoju; Li, Xinxin; Chen, Chunguang; Guo, Jiancheng; Tang, Wenxue; Liu, Jianbo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82938-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542420/,31
662345,A two year serological surveillance of coronavirus infections in Hamburg,1980,"HIV‐1 matrix protein p17 activates a variety of cell responses which play a critical role in viral replication and infection. Its activity depends on the expression of p17 receptors (p17R) on the surface of target cells. Whether p17 also plays a role in stimulating human monocytes, a major HIV‐1 reservoir, is not known. Here we show that human monocytes constitutively express p17Rs and that p17 selectively triggers these cells to produce MCP‐1. The effect of p17 on MCP‐1 expression was observed at the transcriptional level and was primarily dependent on the activation of the transcription factor AP‐1. p17 increased the binding activity of AP‐1 complexes in a time‐ and dose‐dependent manner. Deletion of the AP‐1 binding sites in the MCP‐1 promoter resulted in the lack of p17‐induced MCP‐1 transcription. In particular, the P3 binding site located between −69 and −63 position seems to be essential to MCP‐1 mRNA induction in p17‐treated monocytes. An ever increasing amount of evidences shows a tight link between biologically dysregulated monocytes, AP‐1 activation, MCP‐1 release and HIV‐1 pathogenesis. Overall our results suggest that p17 may play a critical role in the monocyte‐mediated inflammatory processes, which are suspected to be major precipitating events in AIDS‐defining diseases.","Marini, Elena; Tiberio, Laura; Caracciolo, Sonia; Tosti, Giorgio; Guzman, Carlos A.; Schiaffonati, Luisa; Fiorentini, Simona; Caruso, Arnaldo",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18042260/,31

The lack of paid sick leave is potentially a threat not only to workers' well-being but also to public health. However, the literature on the effects of paid sick leave in the US is surprisingly limited, in large part because instances of paid sick leave expansion are relatively uncommon. We exploit the fact that large firms in the US were not required to expand paid sick leave during the COVID-19 pandemic but that one casual dining restaurant in particular, Olive Garden, faced intense public pressure to do so. We drew on data collected from 2017 through fall 2020 from 10,306 food service-sector workers in the US by the Shift Project, which include employer identifiers.

Humoral immune responses likely play an important role in containing SARS-CoV-2, however, the determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are unclear. Methods Using immunoassays specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including patients with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus severe COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers (n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without symptoms and tested negative or positive by RT-qPCR. Findings On average, SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19 cases became positive eight days after symptom onset and were often transient, whereas serum IgG levels remained negative or reached positive values 9–10 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers as a function of duration since symptom onset, independent of patient age and comorbidities. Very high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some of the SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG serum titers had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in their nasal fluids and tears. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids of these healthcare workers were inversely correlated with patient age. Interpretation These data show that systemic IgA and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA levels seen in patients with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient serum titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion. The findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on COVID-19 severity.","Cervia, Carlo; Nilsson, Jakob; Zurbuchen, Yves; Valaperti, Alan; Schreiner, Jens; Wolfensberger, Aline; Raeber, Miro E.; Adamo, Sarah; Emmenegger, Marc; Hasler, Sara; Bosshard, Philipp P.; De Cecco, Elena; Bächli, Esther; Rudiger, Alain; Stüssi-Helbling, Melina; Huber, Lars C.; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Schaer, Dominik J.; Aguzzi, Adriano; Held, Ulrike; Probst-Müller, Elsbeth; Rampini, Silvana K.; Boyman, Onur",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.108308,31

We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad, and polyfunctional S-specific CD4(+) (mainly Th1) and CD8(+) T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic. IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of 23 December 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs.

Most cytokines utilize the JAK-STAT and Ras-ERK pathways to promote gene transcription and proliferation; however, this signaling is tightly regulated. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family and SPRED family are a representative negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway and the Ras-ERK pathway, respectively. The SOCS family regulates the differentiation and function of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and regulatory T cells, and is involved in immune tolerance, anergy, and exhaustion. SPRED family proteins have been shown to inactivate Ras by recruiting the Ras-GTPase neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) protein. Human genetic analysis has shown that SOCS family members are strongly associated with autoimmune diseases, allergies, and tumorigenesis, and SPRED1 is involved in NF1-like syndromes and tumors.

Pathologic examinations revealed that apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent.

Sixty-six isolates (23.72%) possessed the STI gene and categorized into entrotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Nine isolates (3.1%) and five isolates (1.72%) were positive for the cnf1 and cnf2 genes which categorized into necrotoxic E. coli (NTEC). Hundred and seventeen isolates (40.34%) harbored stx (1) and/or stx (2) and classified as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Thirteen isolates (4.48%) were assigned to atypical entropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) and possessed eae gene. Two isolates (0.68%) were positive for ipaH gene and were assigned to entroinvasive E. coli (EIEC). Statistical analysis showed a specific association between eae gene and STEC pathotype (P < 0.0001). The most prevalent resistance was observed against lincomycin (96.5%) and the lowest resistance was against kanamycine (56.02%), respectively. The high prevalence of STEC and ETEC indicates that diarrheic lambs represent an important reservoir for humans. ETEC may play an important role for frequent occurrence of diarrhea in lambs observed in this region.

The risk of this occurring depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, transmission from pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to as non-symptomatic) infectious hosts can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. Here, by using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when non-symptomatic transmission can occur. We construct a branching process model that includes non-symptomatic transmission and explore the effects of interventions targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. We consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. We find that seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate non-symptomatic infected hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.","Lovell-Read, Francesca A.; Funk, Sebastian; Obolski, Uri; Donnelly, Christl A.; Thompson, Robin N.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.1014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006127/,31

However, changes in the distribution of immunoglobins (Igs), including immunoglobulin-A (IgA), that have an important function in mucosal immunity in the intestinal tract, are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impaired immune functions in the context of a diet-induced obese murine model via the assessment of the Igs in the intestinal villi. We used mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) from four to 12 or 20 weeks of age. The distributions of IgA, IgM, and IgG1 were observed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, we observed that IgA was immunolocalized in many cells of the lamina propria and that immunopositive cells increased in mice aged 12 to 20 weeks. Notably, mice fed HFD showed a reduced number of IgA-immunopositive cells in the intestinal villi compared to those fed standard chow. Of note, the levels of IgM and IgG1 were also reduced in HFD fed mice. These results provide insights into the impaired mucosal immune function arising from diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Sakamoto, Yuta; Niwa, Masatoshi; Muramatsu, Ken; Shimo, Satoshi",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503874/,31

A multinational, cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in six European countries between April and July 2020. The anonymous survey was promoted via social media. In total, 16,063 women participated (including 6661 pregnant and 9402 breastfeeding women). Most responses were collected from Belgium (44%), Norway (18%) and the Netherlands (16%), followed by Switzerland (11%), Ireland (10%) and the UK (3%). Despite differences between countries, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified among 40–50% of the respondents at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and was higher among pregnant women. Education level and employment status were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The first wave had an adverse impact on pregnancy experiences and disrupted access to health services and breastfeeding support for many women. In the future, access to health care and support should be maintained at all times.

Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a cytokine storm syndrome with subsequent multiple organ failure (MOF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to intensive care unit and increased risk of death. While awaiting a vaccine, targeting COVID-19-induced cytokine storm syndrome appears currently as the efficient strategy to reduce the mortality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The stress-responsive enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is largely known to protect against inflammatory response in animal models. HO-1 is induced by hemin, a well-tolerated molecule, used for decades in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Experimental studies showed that hemin-induced HO-1 mitigates cytokine storm and lung injury in mouse models of sepsis and renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, HO-1 may also control numerous viral infections by inhibiting virus replication. In this context, we suggest the hypothesis that HO-1 cytoprotective pathway might be a promising target to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigate COVID-19-induced cytokine storm and subsequent ARDS.","Rossi, Maxime; Piagnerelli, Michael; Van Meerhaeghe, Alain; Zouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim",Med Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254548/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720316005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720316005?v=s5,31

671724,Emerging Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance (EIDAR),2019-04-20,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for the largest pandemic in recent decades. After seemingly being in control due to consequent lock-downs and social distancing, the majority of countries faces currently a second wave of exponentially increasing infections, hospital referrals and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2-mediated disease (COVID-19). To date, no effective vaccination has been found, and wearing masks and social distancing are the only effective approaches to reduce further spreading. However, unwillingness in the societies to distance again and consequently wear masks might be reasons for the second SARS-CoV-2 infection wave. User-friendly chemicals interfering at the host site with viral entry might be an approach to contain the pandemic. In addition, such an approach would work synergistic with vaccinations that miss new virus mutants. Nafamostat (NM) has been shown in vitro to interfere with cellular virus entry by inhibition of the host transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), an enzyme required for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cleavage, a prerequisite for cell entry. We hypothesized that nasal application of NM in a liposomal layer (as additional mechanical barrier) could lower the nasal viral load and subsequently reduce the severity of COVID-19. We found, indeed, that nasal viral load one day post single NM application, was lowered in a hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. However, severity of subsequent local tissue destruction and weight loss due to pneumonitis was not favorably altered. In conclusion, a single NM application reduced nasal viral load, but did not favorably improve the outcome of COVID-19, likely due to the short half-time of NM. Improvement of NM stability or repetitive application (which was not permitted in this animal model according to Dutch law) might circumvent these challenges.","Cornelissen, Lisette; Hoefsmit, Esmee; Rao, Disha; Lijnsvelt, Judith; Keulen, Lucien ven; Es, Marieke van; Grimm, Volker; Medema, Rene H; Blank, Christian U",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.372375,31

This study aimed to describe the parameters of coagulation function of patients with COVID-19 and reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease. This study retrospectively analyzed 113patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taizhou Public Health Center. Clinical characteristics and indexes of coagulation function were collected. A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, a Nomogram was built and the predictive accuracy was evaluated through the calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve, and Kaplan–Meier analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated to assess the clinical value. The data showed that Fibrinogen, FAR, and D-dimer were higher in the severe patients, while PLTcount, Alb were much lower. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for disease progression. The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*10(9)/L, respectively. The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610–0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression.

671873,Human Avian Influenza: How Ready Are We?,2007-03-02,"At the time of this writing, August 2021, potential emergence of vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a grave global concern. The interface between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the host receptor (ACE2) overlap with the binding site of principal neutralizing antibodies (NAb), limiting the repertoire of viable mutations. Nonetheless, variants with multiple mutations in the RBD have rose to dominance. Non-additive, epistatic relationships among RBD mutations are apparent, and assessing the impact of such epistasis on the mutational landscape is crucial. Epistasis can substantially increase the risk of vaccine escape and cannot be completely characterized through the study of the wild type (WT) alone. We employed protein structure modeling using Rosetta to compare the effects of all single mutants at the RBD-NAb and RBD-ACE2 interfaces for the WT, Gamma (417T, 484K, 501Y), and Delta variants (452R, 478K). Overall, epistasis at the RBD surface appears to be limited and the effects of most multiple mutations are additive. Epistasis at the Delta variant interface weakly stabilizes NAb interaction relative to ACE2, whereas in the Gamma variant, epistasis more substantially destabilizes NAb interaction. These results suggest that the repertoire of potential escape mutations for the Delta variant is not substantially different from that of the WT, whereas Gamma poses a moderately greater risk for enhanced vaccine escape. Thus, the modest ensemble of mutations relative to the WT shown to reduce vaccine efficacy might constitute the majority of all possible escape mutations.","Rochman, Nash D.; Faure, Guilhem; Wolf, Yuri I.; Freddolino, Peter L.; Zhang, Feng; Koonin, Eugene V.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494024/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.30.458225,31

672444,Updating changes in human gut microbial communities associated with Clostridioides difficile infection,2021-09-05,"Pigs play an important role in the interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses (IAV). The porcine airway epithelium contains binding sites for both swine/human IAV (α2,6-linked sialic acids) and avian IAV (α2,3-linked sialic acids) and therefore is suited for adaptation of viruses from other species as suggested by the “mixing vessel theory”. Here, we applied well-differentiated swine airway epithelial cells to find out whether efficient infection by avian IAV requires prior adaption. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of the sialic acid-binding activity and the virus-induced detrimental effects. Surprisingly, an avian IAV H1N1 strain circulating in European poultry and waterfowl shows increased and prolonged viral replication without inducing a strong innate immune response. This virus could infect the lower respiratory tract in our precision cut-lung slice model. Pretreating the cells with poly (I:C) and/or JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors revealed that the interferon-stimulated innate immune response influences the replication of avian IAV in swine airway epitheliums but not that of swine IAV. Further studies indicated that in the infection by IAVs, the binding affinity of sialic acid is not the sole factor affecting the virus infectivity for swine or human airway epithelial cells, whereas it may be crucial in well-differentiated ferret tracheal epithelial cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of pigs being the vessel of interspecies transmission should be reconsidered, and the potential of avian H1N1 viruses to infect mammals needs to be characterized in more detail.","Shin, Dai-Lun; Yang, Wei; Peng, Ju-Yi; Sawatsky, Bevan; von Messling, Veronika; Herrler, Georg; Wu, Nai-Huei",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32481674/,31

Nevertheless, C3 can efficiently enter intact cells, including neurons, but the mechanism of C3 binding and uptake is not yet understood. Previously, we identified the intermediate filament vimentin as an extracellular membranous interaction partner of C3. However, uptake of C3 into cells still occurs (although reduced) in the absence of vimentin, indicating involvement of an additional host cell receptor. C3 harbors an Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) motif, which is the major integrin-binding site, present in a variety of integrin ligands. To check whether the RGD motif of C3 is involved in binding to cells, we performed a competition assay with C3 and RGD peptide or with a monoclonal antibody binding to β1-integrin subunit and binding assays in different cell lines, primary neurons, and synaptosomes with C3-RGD mutants. Here, we report that preincubation of cells with the GRGDNP peptide strongly reduced C3 binding to cells. Moreover, mutation of the RGD motif reduced C3 binding to intact cells and also to recombinant vimentin. Anti-integrin antibodies also lowered the C3 binding to cells. Our results indicate that the RGD motif of C3 is at least one essential C3 motif for binding to host cells and that integrin is an additional receptor for C3 besides vimentin.","Rohrbeck, Astrid; Höltje, Markus; Adolf, Andrej; Oms, Elisabeth; Hagemann, Sandra; Ahnert-Hilger, Gudrun; Just, Ingo",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882889/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.798231,31

METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed with Veterans in the CLC prior to discharge (to explore experiences during the CLC stay and expectations regarding discharge and returning home) and in the home 2–4 weeks postdischarge (to explore daily routines and perceptions of overall health, mental health, and social functioning). Caregivers participated in 1 interview, completed postdischarge. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Brief Interview for Mental Status were administered postdischarge. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions revealed 3 inter-related themes: (1) Veterans may experience improved social connectedness in CLCs by nature of the unique care environment (predominantly male, shared military experience); (2) Experiences of social engagement and connectedness varied after discharge and could be discordant with Veterans’ expectations for recovery prior to discharge; and (3) Veterans may or may not describe themselves as “lonely” after discharge, when physically isolated. Veterans lacked moderate to severe cognitive impairment (Brief Interview for Mental Status: range = 14–15); however, they reported a wide range in depressive symptom severity postdischarge (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire: mean = 4.9, SD = 6.1, median/mode = 3, range = 0–23). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study identified a potential for increased social isolation and disengagement after discharge from Veterans Affairs nursing homes. Nursing homes should integrate social functioning assessment for their residents, while extending care planning and transitional care to address patient-centered social functioning goals.","Simons, Kelsey V.; Bower, Emily S.; Gillespie, Suzanne M.; Mills, Whitney L.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.07.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152586102030654X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32943341/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152586102030654X,31
674391,Mechanism of duplex unwinding by coronavirus nsp13 helicases,2020-08-03,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae. A binding domain that mediates the attachment of the virus to its receptor has been identified in the S1 protein of prototype IBV strain M41. In this study, we identified this binding domain in a different strain, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with it. First, we expressed the S1(N) proteins (residues 19-270) of M41 and another isolate, SCZJ3, and compared the binding capacities of recombinant S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 to host tissues. Protein histochemistry showed that both S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 could bind to lung and kidney, and that recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 displayed a distinctive staining pattern in the proventriculus. Recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 was then employed to purify binding-associated proteins in lung, kidney, and proventriculus. Using an affinity chromatography assay, two common bands of about 60 kDa and 70 kDa were obtained from the total tissue proteins. These protein bands were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Finally, infection of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells by SCZJ3 was found to be inhibited by anti-HSP70 but not anti-PDI polyclonal antibody. These data indicate that HSP70 is part of the receptor complex of IBV and might help to understand the mechanism of S-mediated cell entry of IBV.

675530,Nitric oxide dosed in short bursts at high concentrations may protect against Covid 19,2020-10-01,"Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common problem in children. The condition most commonly represents a transient response to a benign local or generalized infection. Acute bilateral cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection or streptococcal pharyngitis. Acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases. Common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis include cat-scratch disease and mycobacterial infection. Generalized lymphadenopathy is often caused by a viral infection, and less frequently by malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, and medications. Laboratory tests are not necessary in most children with cervical lymphadenopathy. Most cases of cervical lymphadenitis are self-limited and require no treatment. The treatment of acute bacterial cervical lymphadenitis without a known primary source should provide adequate coverage for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.","Leung, Alexander K.

Despite the critical role of monitoring these multisectoral programs to enable data-informed adaptive programming, information to guide program implementers is scant. This manuscript provides an overview of how monitoring indicators can be selected across a SHN program's logical framework, with specific examples across five SHN implementation models. Adaptation of SHN programs in times of school closures, such as those currently being experienced globally due to the emergence of COVID-19, is also addressed. Key aspects of SHN program monitoring are explored, including: (1) why monitor; (2) what to measure; (3) how to measure; and (4) who measures. In situations of school closures, strategies to shift both program activities and corresponding monitoring mechanisms are critical to understanding the rapidly evolving situation and subsequently guiding policy actions to protect vulnerable populations.","Schultz, Linda; Ruel-Bergeron, Julie",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.645711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336757/,31
675950,Beyond the gut bacterial microbiota: The gut virome,2016-03-11,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a modulator of adipose tissue metabolism. However, human data of adipose ACE-2 is rarely available. Considering that, ACE-2 is believed to be the receptor responsible for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a better understanding of its regulation is desirable. We therefore characterized the modulation of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression during weight loss and the impact of ACE-2 expression on weight loss induced short- and long-term improvements of glucose metabolism. METHODS: 143 subjects (age > 18; BMI ≥ 27 kg/m(2)) were analyzed before and after a standardized 12-week dietary weight reduction program. Afterwards subjects were randomized to a 12-month lifestyle intervention or a control group (Maintain-Adults trial). Insulin sensitivity (IS) was estimated by HOMA-IR (as an estimate of liver IS) and ISI(Clamp) (as an estimate of skeletal muscle IS). ACE-2 mRNA expression (ACE-2(AT)) was measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after weight loss. RESULTS: ACE-2(AT) was not affected by obesity, but was reduced in insulin resistant subjects. Weight loss resulted in a decline of ACE-2(AT) (29.0 (20.0–47.9) vs. 21.0 (13.0–31.0); p = 1.6 ∗ 10(−7)). A smaller reduction of ACE-2 (AT) (ΔACE-2(AT)) was associated with a larger improvement of ISI(Clamp) (p = 0.013) during weight reduction over 3 months, but not with the extend of weight loss. The degree of changes in insulin resistance were preserved until month 12 and was also predicted by the weight loss induced degree of ΔACE-2(AT) (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression correlates with insulin sensitivity. Weight loss induced decline of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression might affect short- and long-term improvement of myocellular insulin sensitivity, which might be also relevant in the context of ACE-2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2.

Here we report interim results for round 6 of observations for swabs collected from the 16th to 25th October 2020 inclusive. Methods REACT-1 round 6 aims to collect data and swab results from 160,000 people aged 5 and above. Here we report results from the first 86,000 individuals. We estimate prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reproduction numbers (R) and temporal trends using exponential growth or decay models. Prevalence estimates are presented both unweighted and weighted to be representative of the population of England, accounting for response rate, region, deprivation and ethnicity. We compare these interim results with data from round 5, based on swabs collected from 18th September to 5th October 2020 inclusive. Results Overall prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.28% or 128 people per 10,000, up from 60 per 10,000 in the previous round. Infections were doubling every 9.0 (6.1, 18) days with a national reproduction number (R) estimated at 1.56 (1.27, 1.88) compared to 1.16 (1.05, 1.27) in the previous round. Prevalence of infection was highest in Yorkshire and The Humber at 2.72% (2.12%, 3.50%), up from 0.84% (0.60%, 1.17%), and the North West at 2.27% (1.90%, 2.72%), up from 1.21% (1.01%, 1.46%), and lowest in South East at 0.55% (0.45%, 0.68%), up from 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Clustering of cases was more prevalent in Lancashire, Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire, West Midlands and East Midlands. Interim estimates of R were above 2 in the South East, East of England, London and South West, but with wide confidence intervals. Nationally, prevalence increased across all age groups with the greatest increase in those aged 55-64 at 1.20% (0.99%, 1.46%), up 3-fold from 0.37% (0.30%, 0.46%). In those aged over 65, prevalence was 0.81% (0.58%, 0.96%) up 2-fold from 0.35% (0.28%, 0.43%). Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%). Conclusion The co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 are to be avoided.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K.

JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a ubiquitous constituent of the human virome. With altered immunological status, JCPyV can cause the oft-fatal brain demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). JCPyV is a human-only pathogen. Using the mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) encephalitis model, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells regulate development of functional antiviral brain-resident CD8 T cells (bT(RM)) and renders their maintenance refractory to systemic CD8 T cell depletion. Acquired CD4 T cell deficiency, modeled by delaying systemic CD4 T cell depletion until MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells have infiltrated the brain, impacted the stability of CD8 bT(RM), impaired their effector response to reinfection, and rendered their maintenance dependent on circulating CD8 T cells. This dependence of CD8 bT(RM) differentiation on CD4 T cells was found to extend to encephalitis caused by vesicular stomatitis virus. Together, these findings reveal an intimate association between CD4 T cells and homeostasis of functional bT(RM) to CNS viral infection.","Mockus, Taryn E.; Shwetank,; Lauver, Matthew D.; Ren, Heather M.; Netherby, Colleen S.; Salameh, Tarik; Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura; Yue, Feng; Broach, James R.; Lukacher, Aron E.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372487/,31

In the present work, we discuss the theoretical impact of introducing a vaccine across a range of scenarios. In particular, we investigate how vaccination coverage, efficacy and delivery time affect the control of the transmission dynamics in comparison to mobility restrictions. The analysis is based on a metapopulation epidemic model structured by risk. We perform a global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method. Our analysis suggest that the reduction of mobility among patches plays a significant role in the mitigation of the disease close to the effect of immunization coverage of 30% achieved in four months. Moreover, for an immunization coverage between 20% and 50% achieved in the first half of 2021 with a vaccine efficacy between 70% and 95%, the percentage reduction in the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is between 30% and 50% by the end of 2021 in comparison with the no vaccination scenario.","Saldaña, Fernando; Velasco-Hernández, Jorge X.",Royal Society open science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.202240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109037/,31

Key to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development is unraveling the mechanisms that drive high infectivity, broad tissue tropism, and severe pathology. Our 2.85-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein reveals that the receptor binding domains tightly bind the essential free fatty acid linoleic acid (LA) in three composite binding pockets. A similar pocket also appears to be present in the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). LA binding stabilizes a locked S conformation, resulting in reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction in vitro. In human cells, LA supplementation synergizes with the COVID-19 drug remdesivir, suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our structure directly links LA and S, setting the stage for intervention strategies that target LA binding by SARS-CoV-2.","Toelzer, Christine; Gupta, Kapil; Yadav, Sathish K.

This study used microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs from experimentally infected pigs to explore the patterns of immune dysregulation after infection with two East European PRRSV strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI) in comparison to a Danish subtype 1 strain (DAN). Transcriptional profiles were determined at day 7 post infection in three tested groups of pigs and analysed in comparison with the expression profile of control group. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (> 1.5-fold change) of 4253 and 7335 genes in groups infected with BOR and ILI strains, respectively, and of 12518 genes in pigs infected with Danish strain. Subtype 2 PRRSV strains showed greater induction of many genes, especially those involved in innate immunity, such as interferon stimulated antiviral genes and inflammatory markers. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in processes such as acute phase response, granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, as well as down-regulation of genes enrolled in pathways engaged in protein synthesis, cell division, as well as B and T cell signaling.

Recent studies show that CT scan images contain useful information to detect the COVID-19 disease. However, the scarcity of large and well balanced datasets limits the possibility of using detection approaches in real diagnostic contexts as they are unable to generalize. Indeed, the performance of these models quickly becomes inadequate when applied to samples captured in different contexts (e.g., different equipment or populations) from those used in the training phase. In this paper, a novel ensemble-based approach for more accurate COVID-19 disease detection using CT scan images is proposed. This work exploits transfer learning using pre-trained deep networks (e.g., VGG, Xception, and ResNet) evolved with a genetic algorithm, combined into an ensemble architecture for the classification of clustered images of lung lobes.

The impacts on mortality are likely to vary, in both magnitude and timing, by age and sex. Our aim was to estimate the total mortality impacts of the pandemic, by sex, age group and week. Methods: We developed an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models that probabilistically estimate the weekly number of deaths that would be expected had the Covid-19 pandemic not occurred. The models account for seasonality of death rates, medium-long-term trends in death rates, the impact of temperature on death rates, association of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s), and the impact of bank holidays. We used data from January 2010 through mid-February 2020 (i.e., week starting 15th February 2020) to estimate the parameters of each model, which was then used to predict the number of deaths for subsequent weeks as estimates of death rates if the pandemic had not occurred. We subtracted these estimates from the actual reported number of deaths to measure the total mortality impact of the pandemic. Results: In the week that began on 21st March, the same week that a national lockdown was put in place, there was a >92% probability that there were more deaths in men and women aged [≥]45 years than would occur in the absence of the pandemic; the probability was 100% from the subsequent week. Taken over the entire period from mid-February to 8th May 2020, there were an estimated [~] 49,200 (44,700-53,300) or 43% (37-48) more deaths than would be expected had the pandemic not taken place. 22,900 (19,300-26,100) of these deaths were in females (40% (32-48) higher than if there had not been a pandemic), and 26,300 (23,800-28,700) in males (46% (40-52) higher). The largest number of excess deaths occurred among women aged >85 years (12,400; 9,300-15,300), followed by men aged >85 years (9,600; 7,800-11,300) and 75-84 years (9,000; 7,500-10,300). The cause of death assigned to the majority (37,295) of these excess deaths was Covid-19. There was nonetheless a >99.99% probability that there has been an increase in deaths assigned to other causes in those aged [≥]45 years. However, by the 8th of May, the all-cause excess mortality had become virtually equal to deaths assigned to Covid-19, and non-Covid excess deaths had diminished to close to zero, or possibly become negative, in all age-sex groups. Interpretation: The death toll of Covid-19 pandemic, in middle and older ages, is substantially larger than the number of deaths reported as a result of confirmed infection, and was visible in vital statistics when the national lockdown was put in place. When all-cause mortality is considered, the mortality impact of the pandemic on men and women is more similar than when comparing deaths assigned to Covid-19 as underlying cause of death.","Kontis, V.; Bennett, J.

681745,Tackling COVID-19 with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies,2021-05-26,"The cumulative incidence of urticaria in children is close to 10%. Two forms are described: the superficial form and the deep form, or angioedema. In young children aged under 3 years, urticaria is commonly annular and ecchymotic, and is mistaken for erythema multiforme or acute hemorrhagic edema. Serum sickness-like reaction is a particular form of urticaria characterized by angioedema of the extremities, fever and arthralgia, and it is chiefly drug-induced (cephalosporins). With children, questioning and clinical examination are essential and, in most cases, reveal an etiology. The main causes of acute or recurrent urticaria are viral infections and/or drugs (non-specific histamine release), whereas chronic urticaria is mostly due to physical causes. In developed countries, parasitic infections are rarely the cause. Arguments in favor of a food allergy are as follows: a setting of atopy, onset within one hour of taking the suspect food, absence of fever or infection, a duration of less than 24 hours, possible association with other signs of anaphylaxis, and further recurrence with each new intake of the suspect food. First-line treatment of urticaria without signs of severity consists solely of non-sedating antihistamine (associated with removal of the cause where the latter has been determined). Nearly one-third of cases of urticaria in children progress over a prolonged period of more than 6 weeks, thus constituting chronic urticaria (most often a form of mild recurrent urticaria during episodes of infection and/or medication). Chronic urticaria is very rarely due to an underlying inflammatory disease or a genetic disease such as cryopyrinopathy, and first-line etiological assessment is usually limited to the following tests: CBC, sedimentation speed and/or CRP, and transaminases.","Boralevi, F.; Léauté-Labrèze, C.",Rev Fr Allergol (2009),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877032020303134; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877032020303134,31

Empirical studies that use microfluidic chemotaxis-chip devices with two opposing chemoattractants showed differential neutrophil migration after challenge with different LPS doses. The epigenetic alterations responsible for changes in neutrophil migratory behavior are unknown. We developed two mathematical models that evaluate the mechanistic interactions responsible for neutrophil migratory decision-making when exposed to competing chemoattractants and challenged with LPS. The first model, which considers the interactions between the receptor densities of two competing chemoattractants, their kinases, and LPS, displayed bistability between high and low ratios of primary to intermediary chemoattractant receptor densities. In particular, at equilibrium, we observe equal receptor densities for low LPS (< 15ng/mL); and dominance of receptors for the primary chemoattractant for high LPS (> 15ng/mL). The second model, which included additional interactions with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, has an additional dynamic outcome, oscillatory dynamics for both receptors, as seen in the data. In particular, it found equal receptor densities in the absence of oscillation for super-low and high LPS challenge (< 0.4 and 1.1 <LPS< 375 ng/mL); equal receptor densities with oscillatory receptor dynamics for super-low LPS (0.5 < LPS< 1.1ng/mL); and dominance of receptors for the primary chemoattractant for super-high LPS (>376 ng/mL). Predicting the mechanisms and the type of external LPS challenge responsible for neutrophils migration toward pro-inflammatory chemoattractants, migration toward pro-tolerant chemoattractants, or oscillatory movement is necessary knowledge in designing interventions against immune diseases, such as sepsis.","Ciupe, Stanca M.; Boribong, Brittany P.; Kadelka, Sarah; Jones, Caroline N.",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708241/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.633963,31

The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials so far is the time to viral clearance assessed by qPCR of viral nucleic acid in eluates from serial nasopharyngeal swabs. We posited that the rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance data from 46 uncomplicated COVID-19 infections in a cohort of prospectively followed adults, we simulated qPCR viral load data to compare type 2 errors when using time to clearance and rate of clearance under varying antiviral effects, sample sizes, sampling frequencies and durations of follow-up. The rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error, and it is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. For greatest efficiency pharmacometric assessments should be conducted in early illness and daily qPCR samples should be taken over 7 to 10 days in each patient studied. Adaptive randomisation and early stopping for success permits more rapid identification of active interventions.","Watson, J. A.; Kissler, S.; Day, N. P.; Grad, Y. H.; White, N.

Most of the tested workers were women, but we found higher relative frequency of positivity for men, even after adjustment for age, working area, and occupation. The higher frequency of positive tests in the medicine area is probably explained by the higher concentration in that area of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, the low frequency of positive HCWs in intensive care units is probably explained by the diffuse and continuous use of PPD.

In the current study, we aimed to simultaneously evaluate the prospective influence of life change stress, personal COVID-19 impact, prior mental health, worry about COVID-19, state-level indicators of pandemic threat, and socio-demographic factors on mood and anxiety symptoms in November 2020 among adults and children in the US and UK. We used a longitudinal cohort study using the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) collected at 3 time points: an initial assessment in April 2020 (April), a reassessment 3 weeks later (May), and a 7-month follow-up in November 2020 (November). Online surveys were collected in the United States and United Kingdom by Prolific Academic, a survey recruitment service, with a final sample of 859 Adults and 780 children (collected via parent report). We found subtypes of pandemic-related life change stress in social and economic domains derived through Louvain Community Detection. We assessed recalled mood and perceived mental health prior to the pandemic; worries about COVID-19; personal and family impacts of COVID-19; and socio-demographic characteristics. Levels of mood symptoms in November 2020 measured with the circumplex model of affect. We found 3 life change stress subtypes among adults and children: Lower Social/Lower Economic (adults and children), Higher Social/Higher Economic (adults and children), Lower Social/Higher Economic (adults), and Intermediate Social/Lower Economic (children). Overall, mood symptoms decreased between April and November 2020, but shifting from lower to higher-stress subtypes between time points was associated with increasing symptoms. For both adults and children, the most informative predictors of mood symptoms in November identified by conditional random forest models were prior mood and perceived mental health, worries about COVID, and sources of life change. The relative importance of these predictors was the most prominent difference in findings between adults and children, with lifestyle changes stress regarding friendships being more predictive of mood outcomes than worries about COVID in children. In the US, objective state-level indicators of COVID-19 threat were less predictive of November mood than these other predictors. We found that in addition to the well-established influences of prior mood and worry, heterogeneous subtypes of pandemic-related stress were differentially associated with mood after the initial phase of the pandemic. Greater research on diverse patterns of pandemic experience may elucidate modifiable targets for treatment and prevention.","Nikolaidis, A.; DeRosa, J.; Kass, M.; Droney, I.; Alexander, L.; Di Martino, A.; Bromet, E.; Merikangas, K.; Milham, M.; Paksarian, D.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401891/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.10.21261860v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261860,31

It influences the way how social interaction unfolds online and affects learning and social outcomes. However, what precisely social presence is has been under debate, as presently a plethora of different definitions and measures exist preventing the development of a coherent research field regarding social presence and its defining role in online group learning. To solve the issue, we went back to the original social presence theory as devised by the communication researchers Short et al. (1976) to show that although they had a clear idea of social presence—namely “realness” of other persons in the interaction—their definition is ambiguous, not operationalizable, and the measurement of it questionable. We, therefore, disentangled their social presence theory and (1) reformulated the social presence definition to enable an operationalization in line with the previous conceptualization of social presence; (2) departed from the technological determinism of social presence; and (3) identified two other constructs closely linked to social presence, namely, sociability (as a medium attribute) and social space (as a group attribute). By reformulating the definition of social presence and by linking it to social space and sociability, we hope to contribute to a more coherent line of social presence research and to better understand interpersonal communication, group learning, and group dynamics when learning and working together in an online setting.","Kreijns, Karel; Xu, Kate; Weidlich, Joshua",Educ Psychol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177204/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-021-09623-8,31
684711,Neutrophil Recruitment and Participation in Severe Diseases Caused by Flavivirus Infection,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: DNA-launched infectious system is a useful tool with high rescue efficiency that allows the introduction of mutations in specific positions to investigate the function of an individual viral element. Rescued virus particles could be harvested by directly transfecting the DNA-launched recombinant plasmid to the host cells, which will reduce labor and experimental cost by skipping the in vitro transcription assay. METHODS: A total of four overlapping fragments covering the entire viral genome were amplified and then were assembled into a transformation vector based on pIRES2-EGFP to establish the DNA-launched infectious system of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1), named pIR-DHAV-1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting assay and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) were conducted for rescued virus identification. A total of 4.0 μg of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 μg of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze the rescue efficiency. Following that, tissue tropism of rescued virus (rDHAV-1) and parental virus (pDHAV-1) were assayed for virulence testing in 1-day-old ducklings. RESULTS: Rescued virus particles carry the designed genetic marker which could be harvested by directly transfecting pIR-DHAV-1 to BHK-21 cells. The qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics with pDHAV-1. Furthermore, DNA-launched infectious system possessed much higher rescue efficiency assay compared to RNA-launched infectious system. The mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. From 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, the viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among the six tested tissues (with an exception of thymus at 6 hpi), while the viral RNA copy numbers in heart and kidney were alternately the lowest. CONCLUSION: We have constructed a genetically stable and highly pathogenic DNA-launched infectious clone, from which the rescued virus could be harvested by direct transfection with recombinant plasmids. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1. The DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 possessed higher rescue efficiency compared to the traditional RNA-launched infectious system.","Chen, Junhao; Zhang, Ruihua; Lin, Shaoli; Li, Pengfei; Lan, Jingjing; Xie, Zhijing; Wang, Yu; Jiang, Shijin",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0883-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100535/,31

Candidate studies up to May 24, 2020 were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv. Treatment outcomes included mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the requirement of mechanical ventilation (MV). A total of 7 retrospective studies involving 593 adult patients with severe COVID-19, including 241 in the tocilizumab group and 352 in the control group were enrolled. All-cause mortality of severe COVID-19 patients among the tocilizumab group was 16.2% (39/241), which was lower than that in the control group (24.1%, 85/352). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance (risk ratio [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-1.22, I(2) = 68%). In addition, the risk of ICU admission was similar between the tocilizumab and control groups (35.0% vs. 15.8%, RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.33-6.78, I(2) = 86%).

However, these nonsignificant differences between the tocilizumab and control groups may have been the result of the baseline characteristics of the tocilizumab group, which were more severe than those of the control group. Based on low-quality evidence, there is no conclusive evidence that tocilizumab would provide any additional benefit to patients with severe COVID-19.

Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation.

687191,Protective immunity and susceptibility to infectious diseases: lessons from the 1918 influenza pandemic,2007-10-19,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the health system around the world. It is necessary to facilitate health care services with useful parameters in patient follow-up. In this study, we wanted to determine whether platelet indices can be used as an assistant parameter in the clinician's decision-making process regarding which of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be treated by hospitalization. METHODS This retrospective study was performed in a secondary care hospital in Mugla, Turkey. Demographic information such as age, gender, and comorbidities of patients admitted to the emergency pandemic outpatient clinic within five months and diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as discharge, hospitalization, or intensive care needs (ICU), and thirty-day mortality were noted. Also, patients with platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), thrombocytocrit (PCT), MPV/PLT, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT values for outpatient follow-up, hospitalization, intensive care unit need, and 30-day mortality relationships were examined. RESULTS A total of 93 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. It was observed that those with comorbidity had a statistically significant higher rate of hospitalization (p = 0.013). No statistically significant difference was found between outpatients and inpatients in terms of PLT, MPV, PDW, PCT, MPV/PLT, MPV/ PCT, PDW/PLT, and PDW/PCT (p > 0.05 for each). CONCLUSIONS Platelet indices such as PLT, MPV, PDW, PCT, MPV/PLT, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, and PDW/PCT are not useful parameters for the clinician to distinguish between outpatient and inpatient treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Polat, Esra; Demir, Mehmet C",Clinical laboratory,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258979/; https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.201144,31
688835,Combination treatments with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses,2020-07-08,"Twenty two patients who had developed an adverse cutaneous reaction to the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine underwent biopsies. Each case was assessed light microscopically and in select biopsies spike glycoprotein and cytokine assessment were also conducted. The patients developed self-limited cutaneous reactions often described clinically as urticarial or eczematous within one day to 4 weeks after receiving the first or second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Classic clinical and morphologic depictions of type IV cutaneous hypersensitivity with features of dermatitis, interface dermatitis, granulomatous inflammation and/or lymphocytic vasculitic component were observed. Clinical and/or histologic features of perniosis, pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rubra pilaris and guttate psoriasis were seen in select cases. In two cases the dominant picture was urticarial vasculitis, possibly reflective of an Arthus type III immune complex action. The biopsies of normal skin post-vaccine and skin affected by the post vaccine eruption showed rare deep microvessels positive for spike glycoprotein without complement deposition contrasting with greater vascular deposition of spike protein and complement in skin biopsies from severe COVID-19 patients. It is concluded that self-limited hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine occur possibly due to a substance found in the vaccine vehicle such as polyethylene glycol. An immune response that is directed against human-manufactured spike has to be considered since some of the reactions clinically and or histologically closely resemble mild COVID-19. Finally, vaccine associated immune enhancement largely attributable to the adjuvant properties of the vaccine may unmask certain inflammatory milieus operational in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and subclinical hypersensitivity.","Magro, Cynthia; Crowson, A.

689378,Roles of BTLA in Immunity and Immune Disorders,2021-03-29,"Monoclonal anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulins represent a treatment option for COVID‐19. However, their production in mammalian cells is not scalable to meet the global demand. Single‐domain (VHH) antibodies (also called nanobodies) provide an alternative suitable for microbial production. Using alpaca immune libraries against the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein, we isolated 45 infection‐blocking VHH antibodies. These include nanobodies that can withstand 95°C. The most effective VHH antibody neutralizes SARS‐CoV‐2 at 17–50 pM concentration (0.2–0.7 µg per liter), binds the open and closed states of the Spike, and shows a tight RBD interaction in the X‐ray and cryo‐EM structures. The best VHH trimers neutralize even at 40 ng per liter. We constructed nanobody tandems and identified nanobody monomers that tolerate the K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, and L452R immune‐escape mutations found in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, and Delta/Kappa lineages. We also demonstrate neutralization of the Beta strain at low‐picomolar VHH concentrations. We further discovered VHH antibodies that enforce native folding of the RBD in the E. coli cytosol, where its folding normally fails. Such “fold‐promoting” nanobodies may allow for simplified production of vaccines and their adaptation to viral escape‐mutations.","Güttler, Thomas; Aksu, Metin; Dickmanns, Antje; Stegmann, Kim M.; Gregor, Kathrin; Rees, Renate; Taxer, Waltraud; Rymarenko, Oleh; Schünemann, Jürgen; Dienemann, Christian; Gunkel, Philip; Mussil, Bianka; Krull, Jens; Teichmann, Ulrike; Groß, Uwe; Cordes, Volker C; Dobbelstein, Matthias; Görlich, Dirk",EMBO J,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021107985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302370/,31

This study focused on the spatial transmission of the pandemic among the 640 districts in India over time, and aimed to understand the urban-centric nature of the infection. The connectivity context was emphasized that possibly had inflicted the outbreak. Using the modes of transmission data for the available cases, the diffusion of this disease was explained. Metropolitans contributed three-fourths of total cases from the beginning. The transport networks attributed significantly in transmitting the virus from the urban containment zones. Later, there was a gradual shift of infections from urban to rural areas; however, the numbers kept increasing in the former. The massive reverse migration after lockdown spiked the infected cases further. Districts with airports reported more with influx of international passengers. A profound east–west division in April with higher infections in the southern and western districts existed. By mid-May eastern India saw a steep rise in active cases. Moran’s I analysis showed a low autocorrelation initially which increased over time. Hotspot clustering was observed in western Maharashtra, eastern Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and around Kolkata by the second week of August. The diffusion was due to travel, exposure to infected individuals and among the frontline workers. Spatial regression models confirmed that urbanization was positively correlated with higher incidences of infections. Transit mediums, especially rail and aviation were positively associated. These models validated the crucial role of spatial proximity in diffusion of the pandemic.","Gupta, Devarupa; Biswas, Dibyendu; Kabiraj, Pintu",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678946/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10394-6,31

The early epidemic ""wave"" affected countries which now report a few sporadic cases, achieving a stable late phase of the epidemic. Other countries are beginning their epidemic expansion phase. The objective of our study is to characterize the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread. Data science methods were applied to pandemic, focusing on the daily fatality in 24 countries with more than 2,000 deaths, our analysis kin the end retaining 14 countries that have completed a full cycle. The analysis demonstrates a COVID-19 dynamic similar in these studied countries. This 3-phase dynamic is like that of common viral respiratory infections. This pattern, however, shows variability and therefore specificity which the method categorizes into clusters of ""differentiated epidemic patterns"". Among the 5 detected clusters, 2 main ones regroup 11 of these countries, representing 65% of the world deaths (as of June 24, 2020). The pattern seems common to a very large number of countries, and congruent with that of epidemics of other respiratory syndromes, opens the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic would have developed its ""natural history"" by spreading spontaneously despite the measures taken to contain it. The diversity highlighted by the classification into ""formal clusters"" suggests explanations involving the notion of demographic and geographic epicenters.","Krywyk, J.; Oettgen, W.; Messier, M.; Mulot, M.; Toubiana, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.20155390v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20155390,31
