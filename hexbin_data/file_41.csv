50,50,50,Markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,15.16695,10.386527,2006-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can experience 'exacerbations' of their conditions. An exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms, namely dyspnoea, cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. There is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies. Little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. In an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations, we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event. METHODS: We have searched standard databases between 1966 to July 2004 using major keywords and terms. Studies that provided demographics, spirometry, potential markers, and clear eligibility criteria were included in this study. Central tendencies and dispersions for all the variables and markers reported and collected by us were first tabulated according to sample size and ATS/ERS 2004 Exacerbation Severity Levels I to III criteria. Due to the possible similarity of patients in Levels II and III, the data was also redefined into categories of exacerbations, namely out-patient (Level I) and in-patient (Levels II & III combined). For both approaches, we performed a fixed effect meta-analysis on each of the reported variables. RESULTS: We included a total of 268 studies reported between 1979 to July 2004. These studies investigated 142,407 patients with COPD. Arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate were statistically different between all levels of exacerbation severity and between in out- and in-patient settings. Most other measures showed weak relationships with either level or setting, or they had insufficient data to permit meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Arterial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting. Many other measures showed weak correlations that should be further explored in future longitudinal studies or assessed using suggested mathematical modelling techniques.","Franciosi, Luigi G; Page, Clive P; Celli, Bartolome R; Cazzola, Mario; Walker, Michael J; Danhof, Meindert; Rabe, Klaus F; Pasqua, Oscar E Della",Respir Res,41,17
329,329,329,Relapsing macrophage activating syndrome in a 15-year-old girl with Still's disease: a case report,15.085949,10.582883,2009-11-19,"INTRODUCTION: Macrophage activating syndrome is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition that may accompany Still's disease. It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver dysfunction, coagulopathy and neurologic involvement. The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period. Cases of relapse of macrophage activating syndrome are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl with Still's disease who developed macrophage activating syndrome with acute respiratory distress syndrome that required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Following intensive treatment, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine, the patient improved significantly. Two weeks after cyclosporine was discontinued, however, she was readmitted with an acute relapse of macrophage activating syndrome manifested by spiking fever, arthralgias, maculopapular rash and leukocytosis. This time the patient recovered following the reintroduction of treatment with cyclosporine and the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). CONCLUSION: We believe that cyclosporine is a cornerstone for the treatment of Still's disease. We recommend continuing this medication for several weeks following the patient's clinical recovery in order to prevent macrophage activating syndrome relapses.","Mizrahi, Meir; Ben-Chetrit, Eldad",J Med Case Reports,41,0

For the first time, post-mortem findings from a fatal case of knowlesi malaria are reported here. CASE PRESENTATION: A formerly healthy 40 year-old male became symptomatic 10 days after spending time in the jungle of North Borneo. Four days later, he presented to hospital in a state of collapse and died within two hours. He was hyponatraemic and had elevated blood urea, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and amino transferase values; he was also thrombocytopenic and eosinophilic. Dengue haemorrhagic shock was suspected and a post-mortem examination performed. Investigations for dengue virus were negative. Blood for malaria parasites indicated hyperparasitaemia and single species P. knowlesi infection was confirmed by nested-PCR. Macroscopic pathology of the brain and endocardium showed multiple petechial haemorrhages, the liver and spleen were enlarged and lungs had features consistent with ARDS. Microscopic pathology showed sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells in the vessels of the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart and kidney without evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain or any other organ examined. Brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1. The spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells. The kidney had evidence of acute tubular necrosis and endothelial cells in heart sections were prominent. CONCLUSIONS: The overall picture in this case was one of systemic malaria infection that fit the WHO classification for severe malaria. Post-mortem findings in this case were unexpectedly similar to those that define fatal falciparum malaria, including cerebral pathology. There were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain. These results suggest that further study of knowlesi malaria will aid the interpretation of, often conflicting, information on malaria pathophysiology in humans.","Cox-Singh, Janet; Hiu, Jessie; Lucas, Sebastian B; Divis, Paul C; Zulkarnaen, Mohammad; Chandran, Patricia; Wong, Kum T; Adem, Patricia; Zaki, Sherif R; Singh, Balbir; Krishna, Sanjeev",Malar J,41,0

The genes of these collectins (SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD) are located in a cluster at 10q21-24. The objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these genes, and the association of variability at these genes with susceptibility and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We also studied the effect of genetic variability on SP-D serum levels. METHODS: Seven non-synonymous polymorphisms of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD were analyzed. For susceptibility, 682 CAP patients and 769 controls were studied in a case-control study. Severity and outcome were evaluated in a prospective study. Haplotypes were inferred and LD was characterized. SP-D serum levels were measured in healthy controls. RESULTS: The SFTPD aa11-C allele was significantly associated with lower SP-D serum levels, in a dose-dependent manner. We observed the existence of LD among the studied genes. Haplotypes SFTPA1 6A(2 )(P = 0.0009, odds ration (OR) = 0.78), SFTPA2 1A(0 )(P = 0.002, OR = 0.79), SFTPA1-SFTPA2 6A(2)-1A(0 )(P = 0.0005, OR = 0.77), and SFTPD-SFTPA1-SFTPA2 C-6A(2)-1A(0 )(P = 0.00001, OR = 0.62) were underrepresented in patients, whereas haplotypes SFTPA2 1A(10 )(P = 0.00007, OR = 6.58) and SFTPA1-SFTPA2 6A(3)-1A (P = 0.0007, OR = 3.92) were overrepresented. Similar results were observed in CAP due to pneumococcus, though no significant differences were now observed after Bonferroni corrections. 1A(10 )and 6A-1A were associated with higher 28-day and 90-day mortality, and with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) respectively. SFTPD aa11-C allele was associated with development of MODS and ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD are associated with susceptibility to CAP, and that several haplotypes also influence severity and outcome of CAP.","García-Laorden, M Isabel; Rodríguez de Castro, Felipe; Solé-Violán, Jordi; Rajas, Olga; Blanquer, José; Borderías, Luis; Aspa, Javier; Briones, M Luisa; Saavedra, Pedro; Marcos-Ramos, J Alberto; González-Quevedo, Nereida; Sologuren, Ithaisa; Herrera-Ramos, Estefanía; Ferrer, José M; Rello, Jordi; Rodríguez-Gallego, Carlos",Crit Care,41,12
1460,1460,1460,Clinical characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome,15.284574,10.614003,2014-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has become an important public health concern because of the high incidence and mortality rates, and limited treatment and vaccination. Until now, clinical studies on characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with HFRS have been limited. The aim of this study was to observe the clinical characteristics and cumulative proportions surviving and explore the predictive effects and risk factors for prognosis. METHODS: A detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records for critical HFRS patients was conducted. The patients enrolled were treated in the centre for infectious diseases, Tangdu Hospital, between January 2008 and August 2012. The clinical characteristics between the survivors and non-survivors were compared by Student’s t-test or Chi-square test. The risk clinical factors for prognosis were explored by logistic regression analysis. The predictive effects of prognosis in clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The cumulative proportions surviving at certain intervals in the critical patients were observed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Of the 75 patients enrolled, the cumulative proportion surviving was 70.7% at the second week interval, with a 28-day mortality rate of 36.3%. The non-survivors tended to have higher frequencies of agitation, dyspnea, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and encephalopathy (P < .05). ARDS, conjunctival hemorrhage and coma were risk factors for death in the critical patients with HFRS. The non-survivors were found to have lower serum creatinine (Scr) levels (P < .001) and higher incidences of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (P = .006), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = .003) and elevated white blood cells (WBC) levels (P = .005), and the laboratory parameters mentioned above reached statistical significance for predicting prognosis (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The high fatality in critical patients with HFRS underscores the importance of clinicians’ alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications and changes in biochemical status to ensure that timely and systematically supportive treatment can be initiated when necessary.","Du, Hong; Wang, Ping-Zhong; Li, Jing; Bai, Lu; Li, Huan; Yu, Hai-Tao; Jiang, Wei; Zhang, Ye; Wang, Jun-Ning; Bai, Xue-Fan",BMC Infect Dis,41,3
2119,2119,2119,Efficacy of oseltamivir-peramivir combination therapy compared to oseltamivir monotherapy for Influenza A (H7N9) infection: a retrospective study,15.285357,10.643612,2016-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Since the novel H7N9 avian influenza outbreak occurred in China in 2013, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir and peramivir have been used as first-line drugs to treat the influenza virus infection. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of oseltamivir-peramivir combination therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective study of 82 H7N9 confirmed patients was conducted by reviewing medical charts at the First Affiliated Hospital of ZheJiang University in China from April 1, 2013 to Feb 28, 2014. The patients’ clinical information was collected systematically, and we compared the virology and clinical data between oseltamivir monotherapy group (43 patients) and oseltamivir-peramivir combination group (39 patients). RESULTS: The median duration from NAIs administration to H7N9 virus-negative in oseltamivir monotherapy group and oseltamivir-peramivir combination group was 6.50 and 7.00 days (p >0.05), respectively. The median decline of Day 2 to Day 0 (initiation of NAIs therapy) viral load was 0.00 and 0.69 log10 copies/μl (p >0.05) respectively in the monotherapy vs. combination therapy groups. The incidence of new Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome during NAI administration was 63.89 and 77.78 % (p >0.05); while the mortality rates were 25.58 and 43.59 % (p >0.05) in the oseltamivir group vs. oseltamivir-peramivir group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in adults with H7N9 virus infection, the use of oseltamivir-peramivir combination therapy was not superior to oseltamivir monotherapy.","Zhang, Yan; Gao, Hainv; Liang, Weifeng; Tang, Lingling; Yang, Yida; Wu, Xiaoxin; Yu, Liang; Chen, Ping; Zheng, Shufa; Ou, Huilin; Li, Lanjuan",BMC Infect Dis,41,3
2477,2477,2477,Viral-bacterial coinfection affects the presentation and alters the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia,15.14565,10.499789,2016-10-25,"BACKGROUND: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) enables recovery of viruses from airways of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although their clinical impact remains uncertain. METHODS: Among consecutive adult patients who had undergone a mPCR within 72 hours following their admission to one intensive care unit (ICU), we retrospectively included those with a final diagnosis of CAP. Four etiology groups were clustered: bacterial, viral, mixed (viral-bacterial) and no etiology. A composite criterion of complicated course (hospital death or mechanical ventilation > 7 days) was used. A subgroup analysis compared patients with bacterial and viral-bacterial CAP matched on the bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Among 174 patients (132 men [76 %], age 63 [53–75] years, SAPSII 38 [27;55], median PSI score 106 [78;130]), bacterial, viral, mixed and no etiology groups gathered 46 (26 %), 53 (31 %), 45 (26 %) and 30 (17 %) patients, respectively. Virus-infected patients displayed a high creatine kinase serum level, a low platelet count, and a trend toward more frequent alveolar-interstitial infiltrates. A complicated course was more frequent in the mixed group (31/45, 69 %), as compared to bacterial (18/46, 39 %), viral (15/53, 28 %) and no etiology (12/30, 40 %) groups (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the mixed (viral-bacterial) infection was independently associated with complicated course (reference: bacterial pneumonia; OR, 3.58; CI 95 %, 1.16–11; p = 0.03). The subgroup analysis of bacteria-matched patients confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Viral-bacterial coinfection during severe CAP in adults is associated with an impaired presentation and a complicated course.

2870,2870,2870,Risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations,15.142448,10.47182,2017-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a chronic structural lung condition that courses with recurrent infectious exacerbations that lead to frequent antibiotic treatment making this population more susceptible to acquire pathogens with antibiotic resistance. We aimed to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary-care hospitals, enrolling patients when first exacerbation appeared. Multidrug-resistance was determined according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control classification. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty three exacerbations were included and microorganisms were isolated in 159 episodes. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were found in 20.1% episodes: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.5%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%) and Extended spectrum betalactamase + Enterobacteriaceae (6.1%), and they were more frequent in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (24.5% vs. 10.2%, p: 0.016). Three independent multidrug-resistant risk factors were found: chronic renal disease (Odds ratio (OR), 7.60, 95% CI 1.92–30.09), hospitalization in the previous year (OR, 3.88 95% CI 1.37–11.02) and prior multidrug-resistant isolation (OR, 5.58, 95% CI 2.02–15.46). The proportion of multidrug-resistant in the 233 exacerbations was as follows: 3.9% in patients without risk factors, 12.6% in those with 1 factor and 53.6% if ≥2 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation are risk factors for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in exacerbations. This information may assist clinicians in choosing empirical antibiotics in daily clinical practice.","Menéndez, Rosario; Méndez, Raúl; Polverino, Eva; Rosales-Mayor, Edmundo; Amara-Elori, Isabel; Reyes, Soledad; Sahuquillo-Arce, José Miguel; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Alcaraz, Victoria; Torres, Antoni",BMC Infect Dis,41,3

This study observed the expression of plasma sCD138, a soluble component shedding from the glycocalyx (GCX) to the circulating blood, and evaluated its predictive value on disease severity and prognosis of HFRS. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with HFRS who were treated at our center between January 2011 and December 2013 were randomly enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Thirty-five blood samples from healthy subjects were obtained as the controls. The concentrations of sCD138 were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fib), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of sCD138 among the different types were compared; the correlation among sCD138 and the laboratory parameters mentioned above were analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of sCD138 was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Except for the mild-type, the levels of sCD138 in the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients during the acute stage were significantly higher than that of the convalescent stage and the control (P<0.05). With the aggravation of the disease, the levels of sCD138 during the acute stage had an increasing tendency, while demonstrated no significant difference among the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients (P>0.05). sCD138 was negatively correlated with Fib, PLT and ALB, and was positively correlated with WBC and AST (P<0.05). sCD138 demonstrated predictive effectiveness for prognosis with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Dynamic detection of plasma sCD138 might be benefit to evaluating the disease severity and prognosis of the patients with HFRS.","Li, Jing; Du, Hong; Bai, Xue-Fan; Wang, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Ying; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Ping-Zhong",BMC Infect Dis,41,3

In the absence of systemic immunodeficiency, decision of NTM lung disease treatment must relies on a careful risk/benefit assessment, given the requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies supported by limited evidence. The primary objective was to identify the factors associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation. Clinical and radiological outcome upon treatment were studied. METHODS: This retrospective, single center study (2013–2016, 45 months) addressed the criteria supporting treatment decision among adults with NTM lung disease without systemic immunodeficiency at our institution, with the assigned goal to harmonize the practice. All patients matched the current international definitions of NTM lung disease according to the American Thoracic Society criteria. Factors associated with anti-NTM treatment were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Clinical and radiological outcomes of treated and untreated NTM-disease cases were examined. Mortality rate was assessed. An expert radiologist conducted a blinded computed tomography (CT)-scan review of the treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: Among 51 cases of NTM lung diseases, 25 (49%) received anti-NTM treatment. In univariate analysis, a body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m(2) (odds ratio (OR), 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–15.2]; p = 0.042), hemoptysis (OR, 11.8 [95% CI 1.35–12.9]; p = 0.026), excavation(s) (OR, 4.8 [95% CI 1.4–16.4], p = 0.012), prior anti-NTM treatment (OR, 5.65 [95% CI 1.06–29.9]; p = 0.042), Aspergillus spp. co-infection (OR, 6.3 [95% CI 1.8–22.2]; p = 0.004) were associated with treatment initiation. In multivariate analysis, Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the only independent determinant of treatment initiation (OR, 5.3 [95% CI 1.1–25.4]; p = 0.036). Twenty-one (81%) patients received ≥3 anti-NTM drugs. Median treatment duration and follow-up were 36.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 13.1–64.4) weeks and 17.1 (IQR, 8.7–27.1) months, respectively. Regarding radiological outcome, 85 CT-scans were reviewed, showing similar rates of regression or stabilization in treated and untreated patients. Overall mortality rate was not different in treated and untreated patients. CONCLUSION: The most relevant variable associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation was Aspergillus spp. co-infection.

Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patient’s hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/μl, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.","Chaughtai, Saira; Khan, Ijaz; Gupta, Varsha; Chaughtai, Zeeshan; Ong, Raquel; Asif, Arif; Hossain, Mohammad A.",J Med Case Rep,41,0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan between January 2014 and December 2016. To analyze the clinical characteristics of these patients, data was extracted from their medical records. K. pneumoniae strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, capsular genotyping and detection of the rmpA and rmpA2 genes to identify hypervirulent strains. RESULTS: We identified 276 patients with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, of which 68 (24.6%), 74 (26.8%), and 134 (48.6%) presented with CAP, HCAP, and HAP, respectively. The 28-day mortality was highest in the HAP group (39.6%), followed by the HCAP (29.7%) and CAP (27.9%) groups. The HAP group also featured the highest proportion of multi-drug resistant strains (49.3%), followed by the HCAP (36.5%) and CAP groups (10.3%), while the CAP group had the highest proportion of hypervirulent strains (79.4%), followed by the HCAP (55.4%) and HAP groups (41.0%). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae was associated with a high mortality. Importantly, multi-drug resistant strains were also detected in patients with CAP. Hypervirulent strains were prevalent in all 3 groups of pneumonia patients, even in those with HAP.","Juan, Chih-Han; Fang, Shih-Yu; Chou, Chia-Hsin; Tsai, Tsung-Ying; Lin, Yi-Tsung",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,41,17

Therefore, determining the risk factors of LCOS has clinical significance for the management of CHD. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were extracted from the health data resource center of the hospital, which integrates clinical routine data including medical records, diagnoses, orders, surgeries, laboratory tests, imaging, nursing, and other subsystems. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. RESULTS: Overall, 8660 infants with CHD were included, and 864 (9.98%) had LCOS after surgery. The multivariate regression analysis identified that age (OR 0.992, 95% CI: 0.988–0.997, p = 0.001), tricuspid regurgitation (1.192, 1.072–1.326, p = 0.001), Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 risk grade (1.166, 1.011–1.345, p = 0.035), aortic shunt (left-to-right: 1.37, 1.005–1.867, p = 0.046; bi-directional: 1.716, 1.138–2.587, p = 0.01), atrial shunt (left-to-right: 1.407, 1.097–1.805, p = 0.007; right-to-left: 3.168, 1.944–5.163, p < 0.001; bi-directional: 1.87, 1.389–2.519, p < 0.001), ventricular level shunt (left-to-right: 0.676, 0.486–0.94, p = 0.02; bi-directional: 2.09, 1.611–2.712, p < 0.001), residual shunt (3.489, 1.502–8.105, p = 0.004), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.934, 1.673–9.254, p = 0.002), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.638, 1.225–10.798, p = 0.02), circulating temperature (mild hypothermia: 1.526, 95% CI: 1.205–1.934, p < 0.001; middle and low temperature: 1.738, 1.236–2.443, p = 0.001), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (1.009, 1.006–1.012, p < 0.001), myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (1.677, 1.298–2.167, p < 0.001), and mitral insufficiency (1.714, 1.239–2.37, p < 0.001) were independent risk predictors of LCOS. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative LCOS in CHD children remains high. Circulation temperature, myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, and usage of residual shunt after surgery were independent risk predictors for LCOS.","Du, Xinwei; Chen, Hao; Song, Xiaoqi; Wang, Shunmin; Hao, Zedong; Yin, Lifeng; Lu, Zhaohui",BMC Pediatr,41,17

Proinflammatory mediators released by damaged liver after liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury might contribute to this form of ALI, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well characterized. High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a recently identified proinflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly higher in the serum after liver I/R injury. This study investigated whether HMGB1 was involved as a stimulating factor, and whether its downstream Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways act as mediators in the development of liver I/R injury-induced ALI. Extensive ALI and lung inflammation was induced in a rat model of liver I/R injury. Serum HMGB1 was significantly higher after liver I/R injury, and more importantly, expression of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in the lung tissue was also significantly increased. We further found that liver I/R injury enhanced the expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein, and the activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. Inhibition of TLR4 expression in the lung tissue by infection with pGCSIL-GFP-lentivirus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting the TLR4 gene (TLR4-shRNA lentivirus) significantly attenuated ALI, lung inflammation, and activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. These findings indicate that HMGB1 might contribute to the underlying mechanism for liver I/R injury-induced ALI and that its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways are potentially important mediators in the development of ALI.","Yang, Zhongwei; Deng, Yuxiao; Su, Diansan; Tian, Jie; Gao, Yuan; He, Zhengyu; Wang, Xiangrui",Lab Invest,41,0

Compared to the control group, significantly higher IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1b, TNF-α and VEGF levels were found in severe cases, while in non-severe cases, IL-13 and TNF-α levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05). In all groups, IP-10 was increased and RANTES was decreased. Significant and time- (after onset of illness) dependent differences among fatal, severe and non-severe cases were seen. VEGF was positively associated with disease severity. A strong immune response was seen during the first week of illness, especially in severe cases, while the response in non-severe cases was weaker and delayed.

This device has specific properties such as (1) deactivation of airborne microbial-contaminants, (2) neutralization of indoor OH radicals and (3) being harmless to the human body. It consists of a ceramic plate as a positive ion generation electrode and a needle-shaped electrode as an electron emission electrode. Release of atomic hydrogen from the device has been investigated by the spectroscopic method. Optical emission of atomic hydrogen probably due to recombination of positive ions, H(+)(H(2)O)n, generated from the ceramic plate electrode and electrons emitted from the needle-shaped electrode have been clearly observed in the He gas (including water vapour) environment. The efficacy of the device to reduce airborne concentrations of influenza virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens has been evaluated. 99.6% of airborne influenza virus has been deactivated with the operation of the device compared with the control test in a 1 m(3) chamber after 60 min. The neutralization of the OH radical has been investigated by spectroscopic and biological methods. A remarkable reduction of the OH radical in the air by operation of the device has been observed by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. The cell protection effects of the device against OH radicals in the air have been observed. Furthermore, the side effects have been checked by animal experiments.

The two major outbreaks of the virus in 1918 and 2009 had a great impact both on human health and social development. Though data on their complete genome sequences have recently been obtained, the evolution and mutation of A/H1N1 viruses remain unknown to this day. Among many drivers, the impact of environmental factors on mutation is a novel hypothesis worth studying. Here, a geographically disaggregated method was used to explore the relationship between environmental factors and mutation of A/H1N1 viruses from 2000–2019. All of the 11,721 geo-located cases were examined and the data was analysed of six environmental elements according to the time and location (latitude and longitude) of those cases. The main mutation value was obtained by comparing the sequence of the influenza virus strain with the earliest reported sequence. It was found that environmental factors systematically affect the mutation of A/H1N1 viruses. Minimum temperature displayed a nonlinear, rising association with mutation, with a maximum ~15 °C. The effects of precipitation and social development index (nighttime light) were more complex, while population density was linearly and positively correlated with mutation of A/H1N1 viruses. Our results provide novel insight into understanding the complex relationships between mutation of A/H1N1 viruses and environmental factors.","Jiang, Dong; Wang, Qian; Bai, Zhihua; Qi, Heyuan; Ma, Juncai; Liu, Wenjun; Ding, Fangyu; Li, Jing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,41,1

There are concerns, however, that publishing the findings of such research might sometimes increase the risk of a pandemic caused by a laboratory accident or the deliberate release of a deadly virus. This article addresses the challenge of governing scientific information sharing, with regard to public health benefits and risks, from an export-control perspective. The discussion focuses on research findings produced in 2011 by a team of influenza virologists in the Netherlands, and on the Dutch Government’s unprecedented decision to regard the intended publication of these findings as being subject to European Union regulations on the export of ‘dual-use’ items. I argue that, when a government is uncertain about whether the benefits of publishing particular research findings in a scientific journal outweigh the risks, a process of selectively disseminating those findings should be available as an alternative to official censorship.","Enemark, Christian",Med Law Rev,41,22

No vaccine or cure exists, although symptomatic onset may be delayed with some chemoprophylactics. Other response and management strategies have focused on nutritional status, cleanliness and biosecurity. We undertook a systematic review of observational studies to identify risk or protective factors that could prevent Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. Included studies used multivariate analysis within cohort, cross-sectional or case-control designs, of risk factors among young calves, assessing C. parvum specifically. We tabulated data on characteristics and study quality and present narrative synthesis. Fourteen eligible studies were found; three of which were higher quality. The most consistent evidence suggested that risk of C. parvum infection increased when calves had more contact with other calves, were in larger herds or in organic production. Hard flooring reduced risk of infection and calves tended to have more cryptosporidiosis during warm and wet weather. While many other factors were not found to be associated with C. parvum infection, analyses were usually badly underpowered, due to clustering of management factors. Trials are needed to assess effects of manipulating calf contact, herd size, organic methods, hard flooring and temperature. Other factors need to be assessed in larger observational studies with improved disaggregation of potential risk factors.

The impact of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) monotherapy or combination on long-term complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus was studied. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with DPP-4i or SGLT2i during a 3-year period were identified in the database of the National Institute of Health Insurance Fund in Hungary. All-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), lower limb amputation (LLA) and cancer were assessed. Outcomes of add-on SGLT2i to DPP-4i treatment in comparison with switching DPP-4i therapy to SGLT2i were also evaluated. After propensity score matching, survival analysis was performed with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, both SGLT2i and DPP-4i groups included 18 583 patients. All-cause mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94; p=0.0057), HHF (HR, 0.81; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92; p=0.0018), and risk of cancer (HR, 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; p<0.0001) were lower in the SGLT2i population compared with DPP-4i. Risk of LLA was higher in the SGLT2i group (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; p=0.0315). SGLT2i in combination with DPP-4i results in lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.46; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.67; p=0.0001), with a lower trend in stroke, LLA, HHF and cancer, but without any statistical difference. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i treatment leads to a lower risk of overall mortality, HHF and cancer when compared with DPP-4i treatment. Adding SGLT2i to DPP-4i instead of switching from DPP-4i to SGLT2i further lowers the risk of all-cause mortality.","Sütő, Gábor; Molnár, Gergő A; Rokszin, Gyorgy; Fábián, Ibolya; Kiss, Zoltan; Szekanecz, Zoltán; Poór, Gyula; Jermendy, György; Kempler, Peter; Wittmann, István",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,41,1

We hypothesize that excess maintenance fluid is a significant contributor to non-resuscitation fluid and that non-resuscitation fluid administered beyond hydration requirements is associated with worse clinical outcomes in critically ill children. METHODS: We evaluated all patients admitted to two large urban pediatric intensive care units (PICU) between January 2010–August 2016 and January 2010–August 2018, respectively, who survived and remained in the hospital for at least 3 days following PICU admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Association of excess fluid with outcomes was adjusted for confounders (age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, study site, day 3 acute kidney injury, PICU era, resuscitation volume, and volume output) using multivariable regression. RESULTS: We evaluated 14,483 patients; 52% received non-resuscitation fluid in excess of hydration requirements. Non-resuscitation fluid in excess of hydration requirements was associated with higher in-hospital mortality after adjustment for confounders (adjusted odds ratio 1.01 per 10 mL/kg in excess fluid, 95% confidence interval: 1.002–1.02). CONCLUSIONS: Non-resuscitation fluid in excess of hydration requirements is associated with increased mortality in critically ill children. Excess maintenance fluid is a modifiable contributor to this fluid volume. Strategies to reduce excess maintenance fluids warrant further study. IMPACT: Critically ill children frequently receive non-resuscitation fluid in excess of their estimated hydration requirements. Non-resuscitation fluid volume in excess of estimated hydration requirements is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Critically ill children receive a large volume burden from maintenance fluid. Maintenance fluid represents a modifiable contributor of non-resuscitation fluid in excess of hydration requirements. Strategies focused on limitation of maintenance fluid warrant further study.","Barhight, Matthew F.; Nelson, Delphine; Chong, Grace; Basu, Rajit K.; Sanchez-Pinto, L. Nelson",Pediatr Res,41,3

Induction of these ISGs must be regulated for an efficient and controlled antiviral response, but post-transcriptional of these genes have not been well defined. Here, we identify a role for the RNA base modification N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in the regulation of ISGs. Using ribosome profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, coupled with m(6)A-immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we identify a subset of ISGs, including IFITM1, whose translation is enhanced by m(6)A and the m(6)A methyltransferase proteins METTL3 and METTL14. We further determine that the m(6)A reader YTHDF1 increases the expression of IFITM1 in an m(6)A-binding-dependent manner.

Alteration of this communication (i.e., due to obesity) is related to the development of several comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer. Within the adipose depot, adipocytes are the main cell type and thus the main source of secreted molecules, which exert modulating effects not only at a local but also at a systemic level. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as important mediators in cell–cell communication and account for part of the cellular secretome. In recent years, there has been a growing body of research on adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Ad-EVs). However, there is still a lack of standardized methodological approaches, especially regarding primary adipocytes. In this review, we will provide an outline of crucial aspects when working on adipose-derived material, with a special focus on primary adipocytes. In parallel, we will point out current methodological challenges in the EV field and how they impact the transcriptomic, proteomic and functional evaluations of Ad-EVs.","Gómez-Serrano, María; Ponath, Viviane; Preußer, Christian; Pogge von Strandmann, Elke",Int J Mol Sci,41,0

Subsequent studies revealed that NF-κB plays important roles in development, organogenesis, immunity, inflammation, and neurological functions by spatiotemporally regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in several cell types. Furthermore, studies on the signal pathways that activate NF-κB led to the discovery of TRAF family proteins with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which function downstream of the receptor. This discovery led to the proposal of an entirely new signaling mechanism concept, wherein K63-ubiquitin chains act as a scaffold for the signaling complex to activate downstream kinases. This concept has revolutionized ubiquitin studies by revealing the importance of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin not only in NF-κB signaling but also in a variety of other biological systems. TRAF6 is the most diverged among the TRAF family proteins, and our studies uncovered its notable physiological and pathological functions.","YAMAMOTO, Mizuki; GOHDA, Jin; AKIYAMA, Taishin; INOUE, Jun-ichiro",Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,41,0

Here we examine if the Sig-1R may relate to neuropathic pain at the level of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We focus on the neuronal excitability of DRG in a “spare nerve injury” (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in rats and find that Sig-1Rs likely contribute to the genesis of DRG neuronal excitability by decreasing the protein level of voltage-gated Cav2.2 as a translational inhibitor of mRNA. Specifically, during SNI, Sig-1Rs translocate from ER to the nuclear envelope via a trafficking protein Sec61β. At the nucleus, the Sig-1R interacts with cFos and binds to the promoter of 4E-BP1, leading to an upregulation of 4E-BP1 that binds and prevents eIF4E from initiating the mRNA translation for Cav2.2. Interestingly, in Sig-1R knockout HEK cells, Cav2.2 is upregulated. In accordance with those findings, we find that intra-DRG injection of Sig-1R agonist (+)pentazocine increases frequency of action potentials via regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Conversely, intra-DRG injection of Sig-1R antagonist BD1047 attenuates neuropathic pain. Hence, we discover that the Sig-1R chaperone causes neuropathic pain indirectly as a translational inhibitor.

Nevertheless, it carries a real risk of acquisition of blood-borne virus infections, especially viral hepatitis. The purpose of the current study is to present an Egyptian update on blood-borne hepatitis C & B viruses (HCV & HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) among multi-transfused Egyptian children with hereditary hemolytic anemias, especially after implementation of national preventive programs in Egypt. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All pediatric patients with hereditary hemolytic anemias who have regular follow-up and received frequent blood transfusion at the Pediatric Hematology Units, Menuofia and Zagazig Universities Hospitals, Egypt, during the study period, were recruited. They were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg), hepatitis C antibody (HCVab), and CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology. Those with positive results were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-seven hereditary hemolytic anemia patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Their ages ranged from 2 to 18 years, 54.9% of them were males. Seroprevalence of HCVab and CMV-IgM were (14.7% & 6.7% respectively) and they were confirmed by PCR. None of the studied cases were HBVsAg positive. Seropositivity for HCV was significantly associated with older age of the patients, higher transfusion frequency, longer disease duration, and higher mean serum ferritin. CONCLUSION: HCV followed by CMV infections still represent a significant problem for patients with hereditary hemolytic anemias. Nationwide plans should be taken to ensure meticulous and highly sensitive methods of blood screening before transfusion. On the other hand, it seems that HBV compulsory vaccination had succeeded to eliminate HBV infection.","Sherief, Laila M.; Ragab, Seham M.; Helwa, Mohamed A.; Kamal, Naglaa M.; Afify, Mona R.; Mohammed, Rasha T.

Forty-two patients were included in the study. Median age was 29 mo and, weight 13 kg. After fluid bolus, the complications were not different among groups. However, in the RLS group, the patients who received large dose of the fluid showed significant reduction in urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) level.

Protein HAP2, recognized as the primordial eukaryotic gamete fusogen, is a structural homolog of viral class II fusion proteins. The mechanisms that regulate HAP2 function, and whether virus-fusion-like conformational changes are involved, however, have not been investigated. We report here that fusion between plus and minus gametes of the green alga Chlamydomonas indeed requires an obligate conformational rearrangement of HAP2 on minus gametes from a labile, prefusion form into the stable homotrimers observed in structural studies. Activation of HAP2 to undergo its fusogenic conformational change occurs only upon species-specific adhesion between the two gamete membranes. Following a molecular mechanism akin to fusion of enveloped viruses, the membrane insertion capacity of the fusion loop is required to couple formation of trimers to gamete fusion. Thus, species-specific membrane attachment is the gateway to fusion-driving HAP2 rearrangement into stable trimers.","Zhang, Jun; Pinello, Jennifer F.; Fernández, Ignacio; Baquero, Eduard; Fedry, Juliette; Rey, Félix A.; Snell, William J.",Nat Commun,41,1

The presence of known protective antigens on the surface of Cryptococcus EVs, resembling the morphology of encapsulated virus structures, suggested their potential as a vaccine.

METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological hermeneutical design was used. We conducted personal interviews with a narrative approach with 11 older people recovering from hip fracture surgery and 12 nurses working in an orthopaedic ward. RESULTS: The results show that for older people, participation meant being a co-creator in their own care, founded on being met with sensitivity and support, being told what is going to happen, taking responsibility and asking questions and being able to influence care. For nurses, patient participation meant meeting the patients’ needs and requests by being open and allowing them to influence care while at the same time recognizing that the patients’ possibility to influence care was limited. CONCLUSION: The study shows that for older people and nurses, the phenomenon of participation has similar meanings but also differences. When older people participate in their care, they become a co-creator in care and confirmed as a person. This highlights the importance of a nurse-patient relationship built on trust, connectedness and communication based on a shared understanding.","Segevall, Cecilia; Björkman Randström, Kerstin; Söderberg, Siv",,41,0

A total of 16 relevant articles spanning three decades were included in this review. Among studies reviewed, S. pneumoniae was the causative agent of meningitis in 21–30% of cases among hospitalized children between 1983 and 2003. One study showed that serotypes 6A and 6B predominated among meningitis cases of pediatric patients aged < 5 years. This review also revealed that S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacterial pathogen of acute mastoiditis, a severe complication of acute OM, among children aged 9 months to 11 years. NPC studies showed that approximately 30% of Egyptian children were carriers of S. pneumoniae. AMR, especially to penicillin, continues to be a growing concern in low- and middle-income countries, including among Egyptian children. Several predominant serotypes were identified to be associated with penicillin resistance, such as 6B, 1, 19A, 23F, and 6A.

This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses.

This information provides an opportunity to design inhibitors against the viral 3C proteinase. Effective inhibitors of the picornaviral 3C proteinase have the potential to become effective antiviral drugs against human diseases such as the common cold, HAV, enteroviral infections, and diseases caused by related + RNA viruses.","Bergmann, Ernst M.; James, Michael N.G.",Proteases of Infectious Agents,41,17

SOURCES: A search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases, between the years 2002 and 2013, using the following descriptors: asthma exacerbation, virus, child, and acute respiratory infection. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: A total of 42 original articles addressing the identification of respiratory viruses during episodes of asthma exacerbation were selected, mostly cross‐sectional studies. There was a wide variation in the methodology of the assessed studies, particularly in relation to the children's age and methods of collection and viral detection. The results indicate that, in up to 92.2% of exacerbations, a viral agent was potentially the main triggering factor, and human rhinovirus was the most frequently identified factor. The pattern of viral circulation may have been responsible for the seasonality of exacerbations. The association between viral infections and allergic inflammation appears to be crucial for the clinical and functional uncontrolled asthma, but few studies have evaluated other triggering factors in association with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are present in the majority of asthmatic children during episodes of exacerbation. The involved physiopathological mechanisms are yet to be fully established, and the synergism between allergic inflammation and viral infection appears to determine uncontrolled disease. The role of other triggering and protective agents is yet to be clearly determined.","Costa, Lusmaia D.C.; Costa, Paulo Sucasas; Camargos, Paulo A.M.",,41,1

However, methodological limitations have made many of these studies difficult. Recently, molecular based methods have demonstrated that DNA from prey species can be used to identify zooplankton gut contents, and further, quantitative gut content estimates by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeted to the 18S rRNA gene have been used to estimate feeding rates in appendicularians and copepods. However, while standard single primer based qPCR assays were quantitative for the filter feeding appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, feeding rates were consistently underestimated in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In this study, we test the hypothesis that prey DNA is rapidly digested after ingestion by copepods and describe a qPCR-based assay, differential length amplification qPCR (dla-qPCR), to account for DNA digestion. The assay utilizes multiple primer sets that amplify different sized fragments of the prey 18S rRNA gene and, based on the differential amplification of these fragments, the degree of digestion is estimated and corrected for. Application of this approach to C. finmarchicus fed Rhodomonas marina significantly improved quantitative feeding estimates compared to standard qPCR. The development of dla-qPCR represents a significant advancement towards a quantitative method for assessing in situ copepod feeding rates without involving cultivation-based manipulation.","Troedsson, Christofer; Simonelli, Paolo; Nägele, Verena; Nejstgaard, Jens C.; Frischer, Marc E.",Mar Biol,41,0

METHODS: In 16 Bama pigs, asphyxial cardiac arrest was induced by endotracheal tube clamping and remained untreated for another 4 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), animals were randomly assigned to mild hypercapnia (end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)): 45 ~ 50 mmHg) and normocapnia (EtCO(2): 35 ~ 40 mmHg) groups for 12 h. Intracranial pressure (ICP), Pbto(2), and brain tissue temperature were invasively measured by multimodality monitors. Blood gas analysis, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and S100β were tested at baseline, ROSC 1 h, 6 h, and 12 h. Generalized mixed model with a compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to compare the time-variables of the two groups. RESULTS: Twelve (75%) pigs had ROSC and 11 pigs survived for the study period, with 6 pigs in mild hypercapnia group and 5 in the normocapnia group. The mean EtCO(2) in the mild hypercapnia was significantly higher than normocapnia group (48 vs 38 mmHg, p < 0.001). Compared with normocapnia, mild hypercapnia group had higher Pbto(2) (p < 0.001), slightly higher mean arterial pressure (p = 0.012) and ICP (p = 0.009). There were no differences in cerebral perfusion pressure (p = 0.106), gradient of partial pressure of jugular venous bulb oxygen (Pjvo(2)) and Pbto(2) (p = 0.262), difference of partial pressure of jugular venous CO(2) and arterial CO(2) (p = 0.546), cardiac output (p = 0.712), NSE (p = 0.822), and S100β (p = 0.759) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Short term mild hypercapnia post-resuscitation could improve Pbto(2). However, no corresponding improvements in the gradient of Pjvo(2) to Pbto(2) and biomarkers of neurological recovery were observed in the porcine asphyxial cardiac arrest model.","Zhou, Dawei; Li, Zhimin; Zhang, Shaolan; Wu, Lei; Li, Yiyuan; Shi, Guangzhi; Zhou, Jianxin",BMC Anesthesiol,41,1

Early work focused on rapid sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequent in-vitro and in-silico work, along with greater understanding of the different clinical phases of the infection, have helped identify a catalogue of potential therapeutic agents requiring assessment. In a pandemic, there is a need to quickly identify efficacious treatments, and reject those that are non-beneficial or even harmful, using randomised clinical trials. Whilst each potential treatment could be investigated across multiple, separate, competing two-arm trials, this is a very inefficient process. Despite the very large numbers of interventional trials for COVID-19, the vast majority have not used efficient trial designs. Well conducted, adaptive platform trials utilising a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) approach provide a solution to overcome limitations of traditional designs. The multi-arm element allows multiple different treatments to be investigated simultaneously against a shared, standard-of-care control arm. The multi-stage element uses interim analyses to assess accumulating data from the trial and ensure that only treatments showing promise continue to recruitment during the next stage of the trial. The ability to test many treatments at once and drop insufficiently active interventions significantly speeds up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This article provides an overview of the benefits of MAMS designs and successes of trials, which have used this approach to COVID-19. We also discuss international collaboration between trial teams, including prospective agreement to synthesise trial results, and identify the most effective interventions. We believe that international collaboration will help provide faster answers for patients, clinicians, and health care systems around the world, including for future waves of COVID-19, and enable preparedness for future global health pandemics.","Noor, Nurulamin M.; Pett, Sarah L.; Esmail, Hanif; Crook, Angela M.; Vale, Claire L.; Sydes, Matthew R.; Parmar, Mahesh K.B.",F1000Res,41,1

Efficacy and safety of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), nivolumab (Niv) plus atezolizumab (Atz), were compared with those of ramucirumab (Ram) plus docetaxel (Doc), and the efficacy and safety of these two ICIs were compared with each other, using patient groups without programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) constraint. Additionally, efficacy and safety of, Niv, Atz, and pembrolizumab (Pem) were compared using a PD-L1 positive (≥1%) subgroup with refractory or relapsed advanced NSCLC. Niv or Atz was found to be more effective and safer than Ram plus Doc in groups without PD-L1 constraint. In the PD-L1 positive subgroup, Pem (10 mg/kg) showed the highest efficacy for ensuring overall survival, followed by Niv, Pem (2 mg/kg), Atz, and Doc. These results may help clinicians select and evaluate treatment options for relapsed or refractory advanced NSCLC. ABSTRACT: The efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in refractory or relapsed advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not yet been compared with those of ramucirumab (Ram) plus docetaxel (Doc). Furthermore, comprehensive comparisons between ICIs have not been conducted to date. In the current study, a Bayesian network meta-analysis of related phase III clinical trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ram+Doc, Niv, Atz, and Doc treatments in patient groups lacking the PD-L1 constraint. Surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) revealed that the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with Niv was the highest, followed by Atz, Ram+Doc, and Doc. Regarding grades 3–5 treatment-related adverse events (G3–5AEs), the use of Niv was ranked the safest, followed by Atz, Doc, and Ram+Doc. Significant differences in OS were observed between Niv and Ram+Doc, while significant differences in G3–5AEs were observed between Ram+Doc and Niv or Atz. In the PD-L1 positive (≥1%) patient subgroup, Pem (10 mg/kg) ranked the highest in efficacy for OS, followed by Niv, Pem (2 mg/kg), Atz, and Doc. These findings may expectedly provide oncologists with useful insights into therapeutic selection for refractory or relapsed advanced NSCLC.","Ando, Koichi; Manabe, Ryo; Kishino, Yasunari; Kusumoto, Sojiro; Yamaoka, Toshimitsu; Tanaka, Akihiko; Ohmori, Tohru; Ohnishi, Tsukasa; Sagara, Hironori",Cancers (Basel),41,1

Its ambiguous binding target has, however, hindered the next development phase. Our study thus applied molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to predict the protein target from the pathways. Among various candidates, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) was finally identified as a (−)-kusunokinin receptor. The predicted binding affinity of (−)-kusunokinin was better than the selected aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) and substrates. The compound also had no significant effect on AKR1B1 conformation. An intriguing AKR1B1 efficacy, with respect to the known inhibitors (epalrestat, zenarestat, and minalrestat) and substrates (UVI2008 and prostaglandin H(2)), as well as a similar interactive insight of the enzyme pocket, pinpointed an ARI equivalence of (−)-kusunokinin. An aromatic ring and a γ-butyrolactone ring shared a role with structural counterparts in known inhibitors. The modeling explained that the aromatic constituent contributed to π–π attraction with Trp111. In addition, the γ-butyrolactone ring bound the catalytic His110 using hydrogen bonds, which could lead to enzymatic inhibition as a consequence of substrate competitiveness. Our computer-based findings suggested that the potential of (−)-kusunokinin could be furthered by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments to consolidate (−)-kusunokinin as a new AKR1B1 antagonist in the future.","Tanawattanasuntorn, Tanotnon; Thongpanchang, Tienthong; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada; Hanpaibool, Chonnikan; Graidist, Potchanapond; Tipmanee, Varomyalin",ACS Omega,41,0

Smartphone-based systems can locate and alert nearby rescuers. OBJECTIVES: Implementation of a first responder system, technical development and adaption to regional structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system “Region der Lebensretter” was successfully established in July 2018 in Freiburg. The need of optimization was evaluated every half year and realized according to the PDCA (plan–do–check–act) cycle. The necessary functions were specified (plan), programmed, tested and released (do). Afterwards the changes were evaluated (check) and, if necessary, further optimizations were implemented (act). RESULTS: The number of registered rescuers increased from 276 (2nd half year 2018) to 794 (1st half year 2020). The rate of alarm acceptance increased from 30% (2nd half year 2018) to 49% (1st half year 2020). The following features were designed and released: dynamic adjustment of the alarm radius (DAA), critical alert function, connection to automated external defibrillator (AED) database, digital rescuer identification (ID), feedback button “arrived on scene”, choice of means of transport for algorithm optimization. The number of existing AEDs increased from 190 to 270. CONCLUSION: The resuscitation-free interval can be shortened by smartphone-based alerting systems. For successful operation, the total number of rescuers and the technical realization is crucial. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can be increased. It appears extremely appropriate to adapt these systems to databases of quality management or research registers.","Ganter, Julian; Damjanovic, Domagoj; Trummer, Georg; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Baldas, Klemens; Steuber, Thomas; Niechoj, Jan; Müller, Michael P.",Notf Rett Med,41,1

Significant differences were observed in the mean number of intelectin 2 immunolabelled cells between the three histopathological types and the control. Specifically, the mean number of intelectin 2 labelled cells was indicative of disease progression as the focal group had the highest number of intelectin 2 secreting cells followed by the multifocal, diffuse and control groups indicating that intelectin 2 is a good biomarker for the different stages of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection. Quantification of bovine intelectin 2 secreting cells could constitute a good post-mortem tool, complementary to histopathology, to improve detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis infections, especially latent forms of infection. ABSTRACT: Paratuberculosis (PTB), a chronic granulomatous enteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is responsible for important economic losses in the dairy industry. Our previous RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed that bovine intelectin 2 (ITLN2) precursor gene was overexpressed in ileocecal valve (ICV) samples of animals with focal (log2 fold-change = 10.6) and diffuse (log2 fold-change = 6.8) PTB-associated lesions compared to animals without lesions. This study analyzes the potential use of ITLN2, a protein that has been described as fundamental in the innate immune response to infections, as a biomarker of MAP infection. The presence of ITLN2 was investigated by quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of ICV samples of 20 Holstein Friesian cows showing focal (n = 5), multifocal (n = 5), diffuse (n = 5) and no histological lesions (n = 5). Significant differences were observed in the mean number of ITLN2 immunostained goblet and Paneth cells between the three histopathological types and the control. The number of immunolabelled cells was higher in the focal histopathological type (116.9 ± 113.9) followed by the multifocal (108.7 ± 140.5), diffuse (76.5 ± 97.8) and control types (41.0 ± 81.3). These results validate ITLN2 as a post-mortem biomarker of disease progression.","Blanco Vázquez, Cristina; Balseiro, Ana; Alonso-Hearn, Marta; Juste, Ramón A.; Iglesias, Natalia; Canive, Maria; Casais, Rosa",Animals (Basel),41,1

In the wake of this, to assist medical specialists, these images can be used and trained in an intelligent system in order to aid the determination of the different diseases that can be identified from analyzing these images. Classification plays an important role in this regard; it enhances the grouping of these images into categories of diseases and optimizes the next step of a computer-aided diagnosis system. The concept of classification in machine learning deals with the problem of identifying to which set of categories a new population belongs. When category membership is known, the classification is done on the basis of a training set of data containing observations. The goal of this paper is to perform a survey of classification algorithms for biomedical images. The paper then describes how these algorithms can be applied to a big data architecture by using the Spark framework. This paper further proposes the classification workflow based on the observed optimal algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning as drawn from the literature. The algorithm for the feature extraction step during the classification process is presented and can be customized in all other steps of the proposed classification workflow.","Tchito Tchapga, Christian; Mih, Thomas Attia; Tchagna Kouanou, Aurelle; Fozin Fonzin, Theophile; Kuetche Fogang, Platini; Mezatio, Brice Anicet; Tchiotsop, Daniel",J Healthc Eng,41,20

Orally administered FMT capsules may improve patient tolerability and facilitate maintenance therapy while it is unclear if pre-FMT antibiotics enhance therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: We performed a dual-centre randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral lyophilised FMT in adults with mild-moderately active UC (total Mayo 4–10). All subjects received 2-weeks of pre-FMT antibiotics (amoxycillin, metronidazole and doxycycline) before 1:1 randomisation to either oral FMT (0.(35)g stool content per capsule from 1 of 2 healthy donors) or identical placebo for 8 weeks. Enforced tapering and cessation of corticosteroids was mandated. The primary endpoint was week 8 steroid-free clinical remission with endoscopic remission or response (total Mayo score ≤2 with subscores ≤ 1 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency and endoscopic appearance, and ≥1-point reduction from baseline in endoscopy subscore). Responders to FMT induction were re-randomised to either continue maintenance FMT or withdrawal of FMT with final outcomes assessed at week 56. RESULTS: Recruitment was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 37 patients were randomised. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were balanced between the randomised groups. The primary outcome was achieved in 8/16 (50%) receiving FMT versus 3/19 (16%) receiving placebo (OR: 4.63; 95%CI: 1.74–12.30; P=0.002). Steroid-free clinical remission rates and endoscopic remission rates were 69% vs 26% (P=0.012) and 44% vs 16% (P=0.074) in the FMT and placebo arms, respectively. Reported SAE were worsening colitis (2 FMT, 1 placebo) and PR bleeding relating to previous anal surgery (placebo). Ten patients entered the maintenance withdrawal study. Steroid-free clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission was achieved in 4/4 patients who continued daily oral FMT, with all 6 patients randomised to FMT withdrawal having a flare of disease with a median time to relapse of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Oral lyophilised FMT following antibiotic pre-treatment for mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis was associated with a significant increased rate of clinical remission with endoscopic remission or response versus antibiotic treatment alone at week 8. Pre-treatment antibiotics had an additive impact upon treatment efficacy compared with previous studies utilising FMT. Maintenance FMT therapy was associated with sustained clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission at week 56. Treatment was well tolerated and there were no new safety signals related to FMT therapy.","Haifer, C; Saikal, A; Paramsothy, S; Borody, T J; Ghaly, S; Kaakoush, N O; Leong, R",J Crohns Colitis,41,1

Due to mouse-other mammal differences, there is a desperate need to develop relevant tissue models that can more closely recapitulate the host tissue during disease and repair. Whereas organoids and organs-on-a-chip technologies have their benefits, they still cannot provide the cellular and structural complexity of the host tissue. Here, precision cut tissue slices (PCTS) may provide invaluable models for complex ex-vivo generated tissues to assess host-pathogen interaction as well as potential vaccine responses in a “whole organ” manner. In this mini review, we discuss the current literature regarding PCTS in veterinary species and advocate that PCTS represent remarkable tools to further close the gap between target identification, subsequent translation of results into clinical studies, and thus opening avenues for future precision medicine approaches.","Majorova, Dominika; Atkins, Elizabeth; Martineau, Henny; Vokral, Ivan; Oosterhuis, Dorenda; Olinga, Peter; Wren, Brendan; Cuccui, Jon; Werling, Dirk",Front Vet Sci,41,1

In spite of some scepticism in the financial area, cryptocurrencies are a relevant subject of academic research. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, several tools are adopted as an instrument that can help market agents and investors to more clearly assess the cryptocurrencies price dynamics and, thus, guide investment decisions more assertively while mitigating risks. METHODS: We consider three methods, namely the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Auto-Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and three indices given by the Hurst and Lyapunov exponents or the Fractal Dimension. This information allows assessing the behaviour of the time series, such as their persistence, randomness, predictability and chaoticity. RESULTS: The results suggest that, except for the Bitcoin, the other cryptocurrencies exhibit the characteristic of mean reverting, showing a lower predictability when compared to the Bitcoin. The results for the Bitcoin also indicate a persistent behavior that is related to the long memory effect. CONCLUSIONS: The ARFIMA reveals better predictive performance than the ARIMA for all cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the obtained residual values for the ARFIMA are smaller for the auto and partial auto correlations functions, as well as for confidence intervals.","David, S.A.; Inacio Jr., C.M.C.; Nunes, R.; Machado, J.A.T.",J Adv Res,41,0

The similarity of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and RaTG13 is about 76% and 97% respectively. Also its potential receptor-binding domain (RBD) shows similarity with approximately 74% and 90.1% for SARS-CoV and RaTG13. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein.

Interactions of siglecs with their ligands play an important role in modulating immune cell functions activities as their regulators. Therefore, while Siglecs helps immune cells to distinguish between self and non-self, non-self ligands of some sialylated pathogens can recognize siglecs and reduce immune cell responses or escape from immune surveillance.

It is unclear whether this is driven by an increased risk of infection or complications. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence of clinically diagnosed influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) by ethnicity in England from 2008-2018. Methods: We used linked primary and secondary healthcare data (from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and Aurum databases and Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care [HES APC]). We included patients with recorded ethnicity who were aged 40-64 years and did not have a chronic health condition that would render them eligible for influenza vaccination. ILI infection was identified from diagnostic codes in CPRD and HES APC. We calculated crude annual infection incidence rates by ethnic group. Multivariable Poisson regression models with random effects were used to estimate any ethnic disparities in infection risk. Our main analysis adjusted for age, sex, and influenza year. Results: A total of 3,735,308 adults aged 40-64 years were included in the study; 87.6% White, 5.2% South Asian, 4.2% Black, 1.9% Other, and 1.1% Mixed. We identified 102,316 ILI episodes recorded among 94,623 patients. The rate of ILI was highest in the South Asian (9.6 per 1,000 person-years), Black (8.4 per 1,000 person-years) and Mixed (6.9 per 1,000 person-years) ethnic groups. The ILI rate in the White ethnic group was 5.7 per 1,000 person-years. After adjustment for age sex and influenza year, higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ILI were seen for South Asian (1.70, 95% CI 1.66-1.75), Black (1.48, 1.44-1.53) and Mixed (1.22, 1.15-1.30) groups compared to White ethnicity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that influenza infection risk differs between White and non-White groups who are not eligible for routine influenza vaccination.","Davidson, Jennifer; Banerjee, Amitava; Mathur, Rohini; Ramsay, Mary; Smeeth, Liam; Walker, Jemma; McDonald, Helen; Warren-Gash, Charlotte",Wellcome open research,41,8

Most published evidence focuses on symptoms of mental health problems (such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety) and psychosocial factors increasing the risk of such symptoms. However, a recent shift in the literature has moved to exploring resilience and the absence of adverse lasting mental health effects following a disaster. This paper undertakes a qualitative review of the literature to explore factors affecting psychological resilience, as well as the potential positive impact of experiencing a disaster (post-traumatic growth) by examining the literature on employees in disaster-exposed organisations. We identify several protective factors: training, experience, and perceived (personal) competence; social support; and effective coping strategies. Post-traumatic growth frequently appeared to occur at both personal and professional levels for those rescue staff after a disaster, giving employees a greater appreciation of life and their relationships, enhancing their self-esteem and providing a sense of accomplishment and better understanding of their work. Implications, in terms of how to build a resilient workforce, are discussed.","Brooks, Samantha; Amlôt, R; Rubin, G J; Greenberg, N",Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps,41,31

Adenosine is released by myocardial, endothelial and immune cells during hypoxia, ischaemia or inflammation, each condition being present in coronary artery disease (CAD). While activation of A2AR improves coronary blood circulation and leads to anti-inflammatory effects, downregulation of A2AR has many deleterious effects during CAD. A decrease in the level and/or activity of A2AR leads to: i) lack of vasodilation, which decreases blood flow, leading to a decrease in myocardial oxygenation and tissue hypoxia; ii) an increase in the immune response, favouring inflammation; and iii) platelet aggregation, which therefore participates, in part, in the formation of a fibrin-platelet thrombus after the rupture or erosion of the plaque, leading to the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Inflammation contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, leading to myocardial ischaemia, which in turn leads to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, a vicious circle is created that maintains and aggravates CAD. In some cases, studying the adenosinergic profile can help assess the severity of CAD. In fact, inducible ischaemia in CAD patients, as assessed by exercise stress test or fractional flow reserve, is associated with the presence of a reserve of A2AR called spare receptors. The purpose of this review is to present emerging experimental evidence supporting the existence of this adaptive adenosinergic response to ischaemia or inflammation in CAD. We believe that we have achieved a breakthrough in the understanding and modeling of spare A2AR, based upon a new concept allowing for a new and non-invasive CAD management.","Paganelli, Franck; Gaudry, Marine; Ruf, Jean; Guieu, Régis",Cardiovascular research,41,16

While MR-proADM is useful for risk stratification in patients with sepsis, clinical data about prediction accuracy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) is currently missing. Methods We included consecutively adult patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at a tertiary care center in Switzerland between February and April 2020. We investigated the association of MR-proADM levels with in-hospital mortality in logistic regression and discrimination analyses. Results Of 89 included COVID-19 patients, 19% (n=17) died while in the hospital. Median admission MR-proADM levels (nmol/L) were increased almost 1.5-fold increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (1.3 [interquartile range IQR 1.1-2.3]) vs. 0.8 [IQR 0.7-1.1]) and showed good discrimination (area under the curve 0.78). An increase of 1 nmol/L of admission MR-proADM was independently associated with a more than fivefold increase in in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 5.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-21.4, p=0.015). An admission MR-proADM threshold of 0.93 nmol/L showed the best prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 60% and a negative predictive value of 97%. Kinetics of follow-up MR-proADM provided further prognostic information for in-hospital treatment. Conclusions Increased levels of MR-proADM on admission and during hospital stay were independently associated with in-hospital mortality and may allow a better risk stratification, and particularly rule-out of fatal outcome, in COVID-19 patients.","Gregoriano, Claudia; Koch, Daniel; Kutz, Alexander; Haubitz, Sebastian; Conen, Anna; Bernasconi, Luca; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Saeed, Kordo; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,41,24

We report the experience of two children's hospitals that utilize this technique to identify sentinel lymph nodes for lymph-node biopsy and dissection. METHODS We identified 56 patients (median age 10.8 years) who underwent 58 lymphoscintigraphy procedures. There were 33 patients with melanoma and melanocytic lesions, and 23 with sarcomas. RESULTS Of 58 lymphoscintigraphy procedures, sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 52 (90% success rate). Using the combination of intraoperative blue dye injection and lymphoscintigraphy, the success rate was 95% (55/58). Metastatic disease was found in 14 sentinel lymph nodes (13 patients with melanoma and melanocytic lesions, and 1 patient with rhabdomyosarcoma). CONCLUSION We have found that lymphoscintigraphy with SLNB is an effective method to identify patients who may benefit from more extensive lymph-node dissection and to identify those patients who are unlikely to benefit from further lymph-node exploration.","Parida, Lalit; Morrisson, Griffin T; Shammas, Amer; Hossain, A K M Moinul; McCarville, M Beth; Gerstle, J Ted; Charron, Martin; Rao, Bhaskar N; Shulkin, Barry L",Pediatric surgery international,41,31

There are many reasons to be concerned but, as health care workers, we want to emphasize something particular. We reacted with enormous sacrifices during the first pandemic wave, despite the uncertainty, despite the inexperience, despite the structural and managerial inadequacies (partly unavoidable). In the following months the overwhelming wave turned into a slow but continuous dripping, we had to deal with. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the term ""pandemic fatigue"" to indicate the widespread feeling of distress in the entire population as a reaction to a prolonged state of crisis whose end cannot be foreseen. Health workers are no stranger to the general population, although they perceive the world from a particular standpoint. The first concern is that doctors and nurses might not be able to make up for the flaws (largely avoidable at this point) of the health care system in case of further waves. Because the strengths are breaking down and because public support, crucial in previous months, is waning. The second concern relates to the discomfort that could affect a large part of health care workers. A state of discontent and anger never seen before between doctors and nurses is spreading all around us.

AIM Assessing simulated BLS/AED performance in Flemish lifeguards and identifying factors affecting this performance. METHODS Six hundred and sixteen (217 female and 399 male) certified Flemish lifeguards (aged 16-71 years) performed BLS with an AED on a Laerdal ResusciAnne manikin simulating an adult victim of drowning. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with BLS/AED performance as outcome variable and demographic data as explanatory variables. RESULTS Mean BLS/AED performance for all lifeguards was 66.5%. Compression rate and depth adhered closely to ERC 2010 guidelines. Ventilation volume and flow rate exceeded the guidelines. A significant regression model, F(6, 415)=25.61, p<.001, ES=.38, explained 27% of the variance in BLS performance (R2=.27). Significant predictors were age (beta=-.31, p<.001), years of certification (beta=-.41, p<.001), time on duty per year (beta=-.25, p<.001), practising BLS skills (beta=.11, p=.011), and being a professional lifeguard (beta=-.13, p=.029). 71% of lifeguards reported not practising BLS/AED. DISCUSSION Being young, recently certified, few days of employment per year, practising BLS skills and not being a professional lifeguard are factors associated with higher BLS/AED performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS People, aged 45 years and older, newly treated for T2D in 2008 and 2013 were identified in the French NHI Data System. Treatment changes were collected for each year of follow-up. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with metformin discontinuation. RESULTS Respectively, 157 940 and 160 670 beneficiaries (mean age: 63 and 64 years; men proportion: 53 and 52 %) of the French NHI general scheme initiated a diabetes treatment in 2008 and 2013. Metformin was the first monotherapy and increased in use: 67% of monotherapies in 2008 versus 77% in 2013. Monotherapy percentage decreased from the second year onwards in both cohorts. A marked increase of metformin-DPP4i combination therapy was observed (14% of dual therapies in 2008 versus 46% in 2015 in the first cohort), replacing the metformin-sulfonylureas combination as a second-line treatment. Metformin discontinuation was statistically associated with female gender, social deprivation, age, and anti-diabetic polypharmacy. Discontinuation of diabetes treatment was observed after 5-years for, respectively, 10% and 13% in the first and second cohorts. CONCLUSION Descriptive analysis of 2 consecutive national cohorts showed an evolution in the prescription patterns of anti-diabetic treatments over a short period. With early treatment intensification, increasing rate of metformin monotherapy, and changes in dual-therapy strategy.","Aguadé, Anne-Sophie; Gastaldi-Ménager, Chrystelle; Fontaine, Pierre; Karsenty, Diane; Fagot-Campagna, Anne; Amadou, Coralie",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,41,33

Access to solid organs located deep in the left hypochondrium can be difficult using this technique but the transvaginal approach with the patient positioned in full lateral decubitus may be an option. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the case of a 60-year-old woman with a symptomatic splenic polycystic tumor. The procedure was carried out by a multidisciplinary team using a standard flexible videogastroscope and endoscopic instruments. Transvaginal visualization of the spleen and standard dissection of attachments were feasible, and splenectomy was completed using transvaginal stapling of the splenic hilum. The organ was extracted transvaginally. RESULTS The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient had minimal postoperative pain and minimal scars, and was discharged on the second postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal access can be safely used for operative visualization, hilum transection, and spleen removal with conventional instrumentation, reducing parietal wall trauma to a minimum. The clinical, esthetic, and functional advantages require further analysis.","Targarona, Eduardo M; Gomez, Cristina; Rovira, Ramon; Pernas, Juan Carlos; Balague, Carmen; Guarner-Argente, Carlos; Sainz, Sergio; Trias, Manuel",Surgical innovation,41,1

In the current study, data from 41 respondents from 23 countries were reported. METHODS Data regarding the activity of each cytopathology laboratory during 4 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown were collected and compared with those obtained during the corresponding period in 2019. The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. RESULTS Overall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%). The percentage of samples from the cervicovaginal tract, thyroid, and anorectal region was significantly reduced (P < .05). Conversely, the percentage of samples from the urinary tract, serous cavities, breast, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, salivary glands, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and biliary tract increased (P < .05). An overall increase of 5.56% (95% CI, 3.77%-7.35%) in the malignancy rate in nongynecological samples during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed. When the suspicious category was included, the overall increase was 6.95% (95% CI, 4.63%-9.27%). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drastic reduction in the total number of cytology specimens regardless of anatomic site or specimen type. The rate of malignancy increased, reflecting the prioritization of patients with cancer who were considered to be at high risk. Prospective monitoring of the effect of delays in access to health services during the lockdown period is warranted.","Vigliar, Elena; Cepurnaite, Rima; Alcaraz-Mateos, Eduardo; Ali, Syed Z; Baloch, Zubair W; Bellevicine, Claudio; Bongiovanni, Massimo; Botsun, Pavlina; Bruzzese, Dario; Bubendorf, Lukas; Büttner, Reinhard; Canberk, Sule; Capitanio, Arrigo; Casadio, Chiara; Cazacu, Eugeniu; Cochand-Priollet, Beatrix; D'Amuri, Alessandro; Eloy, Catarina; Engels, Marianne; Fadda, Guido; Fontanini, Gabriella; Fulciniti, Franco; Hofman, Paul; Iaccarino, Antonino; Ieni, Antonio; Jiang, Xiaoyin Sara; Kakudo, Kennichi; Kern, Izidor; Kholova, Ivana; Liu, Chinhua; Lobo, Anandi; Lozano, Maria D; Malapelle, Umberto; Maleki, Zahra; Michelow, Pamela; Musayev, Jamal; Özgün, Gonca; Oznur, Meltem; Peiró Marqués, Francisca Maria; Pisapia, Pasquale; Poller, David; Pyzlak, Michal; Robinson, Betsy; Rossi, Esther Diana; Roy-Chowdhuri, Sinchita; Saieg, Mauro; Savic Prince, Spasenija; Schmitt, Fernando C; Javier Seguí Iváñez, Francisco; Štoos-Veić, Tajana; Sulaieva, Oksana; Sweeney, Brenda J; Tuccari, Giovanni; van Velthuysen, Marie-Louise; VanderLaan, Paul A; Vielh, Philippe; Viola, Patrizia; Voorham, Rinus; Weynand, Birgit; Zeppa, Pio; Faquin, William C; Pitman, Martha Bishop; Troncone, Giancarlo",Cancer cytopathology,41,1

While the majority of identified cases occurred in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), the disease was also found in members of 2 other subfamilies of Felidae: 1 generic tiger (Panthera tigris) and 2 Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi). The median age at time of death was 12 years, and all but 1 cheetah were housed in the United States. Characteristic clinical history included progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, disorientation, and/or difficulty eating. Neurologic deficits progressed at a variable rate over days to years. Mild to severe bilateral degenerative lesions were present in the cerebral white matter and variably and to a lesser degree in the white matter of the brain stem and spinal cord. Astrocytosis and swelling of myelin sheaths progressed to total white matter degeneration and cavitation. Large, bizarre reactive astrocytes are a consistent histopathologic feature of this condition. The cause of the severe white matter degeneration in these captive felids remains unknown; the lesions were not typical of any known neurotoxicoses, direct effects of or reactions to infectious diseases, or nutritional deficiencies. Leukoencephalomyelopathy was identified in 70 cheetahs, 1 tiger, and 2 panthers over an 11-year period, and to our knowledge, cases have ceased without planned intervention. Given what is known about the epidemiology of the disease and morphology of the lesions, an environmental or husbandry-associated source of neurotoxicity is suspected.","Brower, A I; Munson, L; Radcliffe, R W; Citino, S B; Lackey, L B; Van Winkle, T J; Stalis, I; Terio, K A; Summers, B A; de Lahunta, A",Veterinary pathology,41,1

We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample including 1100 participants. Data were collected online. Depression revealed a worsening pattern as quarantine sub-periods went by. Anxiety (both state and trait), just like suicidal risk, partially follow such a pattern, with mean scores increasing from the first to the second/third quarantine extensions, but then maintaining to the fourth extension. Predictors having protective effects on almost all the MHS indicators were: availability of current economic income (except for state-anxiety, without significant effect) and absence of suicide attempt history. Conversely, sex (woman), younger age, and mental disorder history had an increasing risk effect on all the MHS indicators. Overall, our findings indicate that quarantine have negative mental health impacts and that quarantine duration is a relevant aspect to be taken into account when measuring such an impact.

This study was aimed to determine the screening practices for hepatitis B among oncologists from India and their experience with hepatitis B reactivation. Methods A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among oncologists attending the Evidence-Based Medicine Conference at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. The questionnaire was developed in keeping with the recent guidelines for hepatitis B reactivation on chemotherapy, with questions regarding demographics, years in practice and hepatitis B screening practices and management. There was 78 per cent response rate to the questionnaire. Results Most respondents were <35 yr of age (69%), with < five years of experience (39%), practicing in an academic institution (81%). Seventy four per cent respondents always screened their patients with cancer for hepatitis prior to chemotherapy, whereas 19 per cent in special settings and seven per cent never screened; 96 per cent respondents used hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a screening test, while 17 per cent also used antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Sixty one per cent respondents used entecavir or tenofovir for prophylaxis; 70 per cent continued prophylaxis till 6-12 months after completion of chemotherapy, while 21 per cent continued only till the end of chemotherapy. Interpretation & conclusions More than 25 per cent of the oncologists were not screening their patients with cancer for viral hepatitis prior to cancer-directed therapy, and only 17 per cent of the oncologists used the recommended tests for screening. Better training of oncologists regarding viral hepatitis screening and management is needed.","Sundaram, Sridhar; Patil, Prachi; Sengar, Manju; Rathod, Raosaheb; Mehta, Shaesta",The Indian journal of medical research,41,7

New methods for preventing adhesions from a polypropylene mesh placed intra-abdominally or to solve difficult situations, such as when the peritoneum cannot be closed during a TAPP repair for an inguinal hernia, are still being seeked. This study mimics in an animal model a situation that can be found in clinical practice during laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty. A polypropylene mesh could be exposed to the intra-abdominal cavity even when the peritoneum is closed due to different circumstances, with no options to guarantee the prosthetic material of being exposed to the intrabdominal viscera. Different options have been suggested to solve these situations, being proposed in this study to cover the visceral surface of the mesh with an absorbable sponge containing thrombin, fibrinogen, and clotting factors (Tachosil®, Nycomed, Takeda, Osaka, Japan), to assess its use as a barrier to prevent postoperative adhesion formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty Wistar white rats (300-450 mg) were included in this study as experimental animals, being randomized into three groups (A, B, and C). We performed a bilateral prosthetic repair with conventional polypropylene mesh (2 × 2 cm, 82 kD). Prosthesis fixation was performed as follows. Group A: absorbable suture; group B: metal staples; group C: metal tackers. A piece of insulating absorbable sponge (Tachosil® 5 × 5 cm) was placed to cover the visceral surface of mesh placed at the right side of each animal. After 10 days, we performed a gross examination (by laparoscopy and laparotomy), measuring the quantity and the quality of the adhesions. Samples were taken for histopathological analysis. RESULTS Tachosil®-treated prostheses showed a statistically significant decrease in the quality of the adhesion found (p < 0.05). In addition, a smaller quantity of adhesions was identified in barrier-treated animals, although this lacked statistical significance. The histologic analysis showed no significant differences: more edema with the untreated mesh and increased angiogenesis and a lower degree of necrosis in mesh covered with Tachosil®. CONCLUSIONS The use of Tachosil® as a barrier material led to the absence of strong adhesions as it prevented direct contact between the mesh and the internal organs, preventing major problems associated with strong adhesions.","Suárez-Grau, J M; Rubio Chaves, C; Morales-Conde, S; Mendez García, C; Docobo Durantez, F; Padillo Ruiz, F J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,41,1

METHODS Two hundred thirty-nine patients with 273 nodules were enrolled in this retrospective study. Each nodule was categorized according to the CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 and CECT/MRI LI-RADS version 2017. The diagnostic performance of CEUS and CECT/MRI was compared. The reference standard was histopathology diagnosis. Inter-modality agreement was assessed with Cohen's kappa. RESULTS The inter-modality agreement for CEUS LI-RADS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS was fair with a kappa value of 0.319 (p < 0.001). The positive predictive values (PPVs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in LR-5, LR-4, and LR-3 were 98.3%, 60.0%, and 25.0% in CEUS, and 95.9%, 65.7%, and 48.1% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of LR-5 for diagnosing HCC were 75.6% and 93.8% in CEUS, and 83.6% and 83.3% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The positive predictive values of non-HCC malignancy in CEUS LR-M and CECT/MRI LR-M were 33.9% and 93.3%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing non-HCC malignancy were 90.9%, 84.5%, and 85.0% in CEUS LR-M and 63.6%, 99.6%, and 96.7% in CECT/MRI LR-M, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The inter-modality agreement of the LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. The positive predictive values of HCCs in LR-5 of the CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS are comparable. CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M. KEY POINTS • The inter-modality agreement for the final LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. • The LR-5 of CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS corresponds to comparable positive predictive values (PPVs) of HCC. For LR-3 and LR-4 nodules categorized by CECT/MRI, CEUS examination should be performed, at least if they can be detected on plain ultrasound. • CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M. For LR-M nodules categorized by CEUS, re-evaluation by CECT/MRI is necessary.","Ding, Jianmin; Long, Lei; Zhang, Xiang; Chen, Chen; Zhou, Hongyu; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Yandong; Jing, Xiang; Ye, Zhaoxiang; Wang, Fengmei",European radiology,41,1

METHODS Two muscle relaxation regimens were compared: rocuronium administered via intravenous (i.v.) bolus dosing combined with reversal through sugammadex at end of surgery (group R/S; 17 patients); mivacurium administered via continuous i.v. infusion without antagonization (group M; 22 patients). Train-of-four (TOF) monitoring determined the depth of NMB. RESULTS The TOF ratio at the time of tracheal extubation was greater in group R/S (median 1.03) than in group M (median 0.62). Time from end of surgery to tracheal extubation was not significantly different. The surgeons were 100% satisfied with the working conditions provided under both relaxation regimens. CONCLUSIONS Residual postoperative curarization at the time of extubation was frequently observed in group M, whereas there was complete recovery in group R/S. Reversal of NMB by sugammadex provides an additional safety dimension to patient care and should thus be considered especially for those at risk of airway complications or aspiration, in addition to frail patients.","von Quillfeldt, Susanne; Föhre, Bettina; Andrees, Nicolai; Spies, Claudia D; Galvagni, Daniele; Joussen, Antonia M; Wernecke, Klaus D; Boemke, Willehad",The Journal of international medical research,41,26

It has been reported that many compounds inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. Anthocyanins are flavonoid pigments present in fruits and vegetables, which are known to suppress symptoms related with Alzheimer's disease. However, the influence of anthocyanins on the amyloid fibril remains unclear. Here, we succeeded in the direct monitoring of the disaggregation reaction of single amyloid β (Aβ) fibrils by anthocyanins using total-internal-reflection-fluorescence microscopy with a quartz-crystal microbalance (TIRFM-QCM). It is found that the disassembly activity to the Aβ fibrils depends on the number of hydroxyl groups in six-membered ring B of anthocyanin, and only delphinidin-3-galactoside, possessing three hydroxyl groups there, shows high disassembly activity. Our results show the importance of the number of hydroxyl groups and demonstrate the usefulness of TIRFM-QCM as a powerful tool in studying interactions between amyloid fibrils and compounds.","Noi, Kentaro; Ikenaka, Kensuke; Mochizuki, Hideki; Goto, Yuji; Ogi, Hirotsugu",Analytical chemistry,41,23

A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of nebulized HCQ for pulmonary delivery to COVID-19 patients using the Nasal-Pulmonary Module in GastroPlus® V9.7 simulator, in order to calculate the necessary inhalation dose regimen of HCQ, was developed. The physiological, drug disposition, and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from the literature and used during model building after optimization using Optimization Module, while oral data was used for validation. The 25 mg BID inhalation dosing was predicted to lead to alveolar HCQ levels of 7 µM (above EC50 of ~1-5 µM), and small plasma levels of 0.18 µM (as compared to plasma levels of 3.22 µM after 200 mg BID oral dosing). However, average contact time (>1 µM) is around 0.5 h in lung parts, suggesting indirect exposure response effect of HCQ.The developed PBPK model herein predicted HCQ levels in plasma and different lung parts of adults after multiple inhalation dosing regimens for 5 days.

We characterized the 16Sv4 rDNA microbiome in oral mouthwash samples collected at baseline from a representative subset of 305 non-smoking women, aged 20-75 years. We evaluated within (alpha) and between sample (beta) diversity by incident cancer status and applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size analysis to assess differentially abundant taxa. Diversity and candidate taxa in relation to all-cancer incidence was evaluated in multivariable (MV)-adjusted Cox regression models. Over 8.8 median years of follow-up, 31 incident cancer cases were identified and verified. Advanced age, greater acculturation and cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with all-cancer incidence. Higher alpha diversity (age-adjusted Pdiff<0.01) and distinct biological communities (Pdiff=0.002) were observed by incident cancer status. Each unit increase in the Shannon diversity index yielded >8-fold increase in all-cancer and obesity-related cancer risk [MV-adjusted HR (95% CI): 8.11 (3.14, 20.94) and 10.72 (3.30, 34.84), respectively] with similar findings for the inverse Simpson index.

With regard to the psychosocial impacts, 38.4%, 31.9%, and 52.3% were worried about changing one's nature as a human being, changing one's personality, and discrimination by others, respectively. CONCLUSION Most medical students in China had a favorable attitude toward xenotransplantation. Students in the clinical years had a better knowledge of and more favorable attitude toward xenotransplantation. Their concern about the risks of xenotransplantation resolved slightly with seniority, but their concern about psychosocial impacts did not resolve with seniority.","Liu, Chang; Liu, Shiqing",Xenotransplantation,41,1

Unfortunately, treatments have not kept pace; unless their cancer is identified at a very early stage, most patients will not survive a year after diagnosis. The beginnings of this widespread problem were first recognized over 25 years ago, yet rates have continued to rise against a backdrop of much improved understanding and management of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We estimate that only ∼7% of the 10,000 cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma diagnosed annually in the USA are identified through current approaches to cancer control, and trace pathways by which the remaining 93% are 'lost'. On the basis of emerging data on aetiology and predictive factors, together with new diagnostic tools, we suggest a five-tier strategy for prevention and control that begins with a wide population base and triages individuals into progressively higher risk strata, each with risk-appropriate prevention, screening and treatment options.","Vaughan, Thomas L; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Nature reviews.

Progressed lymphedema is adversely complex and currently there is no widely acknowledged curative treatment. Therefore recent focus has shifted to risk reduction and prevention. It has been hypothesized that bypassing lymphatic vessels to veins prophylactically, could minimize the lymphatic dysfunction seen following lymphadenectomy. METHODS To investigate this possible future treatment modality, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of studies treating patients with prophylactic lymphovenous analysisstomosis (LVA) for the prevention of secondary lymphedema following lymphadenectomy. A systematic search yielded 12 articles included in the qualitative analysis and four of these were further eligible to be included in the quantitative analysis. RESULTS We found that patients treated with prophylactic LVA had a significant reduction in lymphedema incidence (Relative risk: 0.33, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.56) when compared to patients receiving no prophylactic treatment (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Prophylactic LVA in relation to lymphadenectomy shows promising results, however because of the low number of eligible studies and method heterogeneity between studies, there is an urgent need for uniformly high quality studies, before the treatment can be concluded effective.","Jørgensen, Mads G; Toyserkani, Navid M; Sørensen, Jens A",Microsurgery,41,8

Its application in the basilar artery (BA) has not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and early efficacy of the LVIS device for the treatment of BA aneurysms. METHODS A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed for all patients with BA aneurysms treated by LVIS stents at our institution. Angiographic results were evaluated using the modified Raymond-Roy classification (mRRC). RESULTS 23 patients (mean age 52.8 years) with a BA aneurysm that was treated by LVIS stent implantation, with (n=21) or without (n=2) adjunctive coiling, were included in our study. 7 aneurysms were treated in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). 10 aneurysms were located at the basilar tip, 10 at the basilar trunk, and 3 at the superior cerebellar artery. Procedure related complications developed in three patients (13%), including two perforator infarction and one worsening mass effect. Complications resulted in permanent morbidity (4%) in one case. One fatality was related to severe poor grade SAH. At a mean follow-up of 6.9 months, 13 of the 20 patients were mRRC I closure, 3 were mRRC II closure with an improvement from class IIIa, 3 were observed to be recanalized from class IIIa to IIIb, and 1 with stenting only was still patent similar to the immediate angiography. CONCLUSION The LVIS stent represents a feasible and safe option for endovascular embolization of BA aneurysms. Although recanalization may occur after LVIS treatment, the mid term complete occlusion rate was acceptable.","Wang, Chuanchuan; Wu, Yina; Feng, Zhengzhe; Wang, Jing; Li, Qiang; Zhao, Rui; Hong, Bo; Xu, Yi; Huang, Qinghai; Fang, Yibin; Liu, Jianmin",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,41,14

METHODS Laparoscopic colorectal procedures where a plastic freezer bag used as a wound protector at the extraction site were reviewed between 1991 and 2008 from a prospectively collected database. χ test was used to compare SSI and tumor recurrence rates between groups. Costing data were obtained from the operating room supplies department. RESULTS A total of 936 cases with 51 (5.45%) surgical-site infections were identified. SSI rates did not differ when comparing groups based on demographic factors, diagnosis, or location of procedure. Retrieval-site tumor recurrence rate was 0.21% (1/474). Cost of plastic freezer bags including sterilization ranged from $0.25 to $3.

Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) was first reported by Gagner and Pomp (Surg Endosc 8:408-410, 1994). Unfortunately, due to its complexity and technical demand, LPD never reached widespread popularity. Since it was first performed by P. C. Giulianotti in 2001, Robotic PD (RPD) has been gaining ground among surgeons. MIPD is included as a surgical option in the latest NCCN Guidelines. However, lack of surgical standardization, however, has limited the reproducibility of MIPD and made the acquisition of the technique by other surgeons difficult. We provide an accurate description of our standardized step-by-step RDP technique. METHODS We took advantage of our 15-year long experience and > 150 cases performed to provide a step-by-step guidance of our RPD standardized technique. The description includes practical ""tips and tricks"" to facilitate the learning curve and assist with the teaching/evaluation process. RESULTS 17 surgical steps were identified as key components of the RPD procedure. The steps reflect the subdivision of the RPD into several parts which help to understand a strategy that takes into accounts specific anatomical landmarks and the demands of the robotic platform. CONCLUSIONS Standardization is a key element of the learning curve of RPD. It can potentially provide consistent, reproducible results that can be more easily evaluated. Despite promising results, full acceptance of RPD as the 'gold standard' is still work in progress. Randomized-controlled trials with the application of a standardized technique are necessary to better define the role of RPD.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Mangano, Alberto; Bustos, Roberto E; Gheza, Federico; Fernandes, Eduardo; Masrur, Mario A; Gangemi, Antonio; Bianco, Francesco M",Surgical endoscopy,41,1

Few data are available on the effect of DM on cardiac neuropathy in heart failure (HF). The aim of the current study was to assess cardiac sympathetic activity in HF patients with and without DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with severe HF (n = 75), with (n = 37) and without DM (n = 38), and 14 diabetic patients with normal cardiac function underwent (123)I meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy from which early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios were calculated. Clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical data were measured. RESULTS DM compared with non-DM patients showed significantly lower early (1.65 ± 0.21 vs. 1.75 ± 0.21; P < 0.05) and late H/M ratios (1.46 ± 0.22 vs. 1.58 ± 0.24; P < 0.03). Early and late H/M were significantly higher in DM patients without HF (2.22 ± 0.35 and 1.99 ± 0.24, respectively) than HF patients with (P < 0.0001) and without (P < 0.0001) DM. In HF patients, an inverse correlation between early or late H/M ratio and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (Pearson = -0.473, P = 0.001; Pearson = -0.382, P = 0.001, respectively) was observed. In DM, in multivariate analysis, HbA1c and ejection fraction remained significant predictors of early H/M; HbA1c remained the only significant predictor of late H/M. No correlation between early or late H/M and HbA1c was found in non-DM patients. CONCLUSIONS Diabetic patients with HF show lower cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients not having DM or than DM patients with a similar degree of autonomic dysfunction not having HF. HbA1c correlated with the degree of reduction in cardiac sympathetic activity.","Paolillo, Stefania; Rengo, Giuseppe; Pagano, Gennaro; Pellegrino, Teresa; Savarese, Gianluigi; Femminella, Grazia D; Tuccillo, Marianna; Boemio, Antonio; Attena, Emilio; Formisano, Roberto; Petraglia, Laura; Scopacasa, Francesco; Galasso, Gennaro; Leosco, Dario; Trimarco, Bruno; Cuocolo, Alberto; Perrone-Filardi, Pasquale",Diabetes care,41,7

In 2017, 967,615 nonfatal drug overdoses were treated in emergency departments (EDs), a 4.3% increase from 2016 in all overdoses and a 3.1% increase in opioid-involved overdoses (1). During 2017 and 2018, syndromic surveillance revealed that 37.2% of overdoses treated in EDs in 18 states involved multiple drugs (2). To describe changes in rates and proportions of suspected nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in EDs, CDC analyzed syndromic surveillance data from 2018 to 2019 in 29 states. Rates of overdoses involving opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines increased 9.7%, 11.0%, and 18.3%, respectively, and the rate of benzodiazepine-involved overdoses decreased 3.0%. Overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines increased from 2018 to 2019, overall, in both sexes, and in most age groups. In 2019, 23.6%, 17.1%, and 18.7% of overdoses involving cocaine, amphetamine, and benzodiazepines, respectively, also involved opioids. Expanding overdose prevention, treatment, and response efforts is needed to reduce the number of drug and polydrug overdoses. This includes linkage into treatment, harm reduction services, and community-based programs for persons who use drugs; expanding overdose prevention efforts, including increased naloxone provision, to persons who use stimulants; addressing the illicit drug supply; and identifying specific risk factors for populations using these drugs. Continued surveillance with expanded coverage of additional jurisdictions of the evolving drug overdose epidemic is important to the success of these efforts.","Liu, Stephen; Scholl, Lawrence; Hoots, Brooke; Seth, Puja",MMWR.

METHODS As part of the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program, 15 students worked with bilingual social workers and community health workers in an affordable housing urban highrise, assessed building residents and implemented personalized plans of care using the 4Ms framework (what matters to the individual, medications, mentation, and mobility). RESULTS Students demonstrated competence conducting cognition and depression screening, medication review, and functional and fall risk assessments. Student self-rated achievement of learning objectives ranged from 4.3 to 4.8 (1-5 scale). A retrospective pretest-posttest survey suggested learning about the importance of interprofessional teamwork, and integration of person-centered values when providing care to older adults in the community. Students reflected on barriers to health for older adults in low socioeconomic states and the importance of improving care across the continuum.

Patient experience is recognised as a major contributing factor to healthcare quality and outcomes, therefore, enriched knowledge of the patient experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations is critical to redress health inequities. This review synthesises evidence of the healthcare experiences amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients through a metanarrative synthesis of qualitative literature. METHODS A systematic search strategy was developed and applied to six electronic databases between January 2000 and July 2019. Titles and abstracts were screened before applying the inclusion criteria to full text articles. A meta-narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS Fifty-four publications were identified from four research traditions; each with a unique conceptualisation of patient experience. Three themes emerged that demonstrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patient experiences are informed by 1) beliefs about wellbeing and healthcare provision, 2) their level of trust in the healthcare system, and 3) individual and community health system interactions. The findings highlight a range of aspects of patient experience that were important to participating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the included studies but not captured currently in health system surveys. CONCLUSION This review highlights the influence of beliefs about health and wellbeing on the patient experience amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in the Australian health system. Patient experiences were informed by past experience and their trust in the health system. The different factors influencing patient experience and the gravity of their influence must be considered in current approaches to capturing patient experience data collection methods.

Analysis of the model dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the expected or averaged output from the agent-based model. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex agent-based models may be infeasible, and coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to accurately describe model dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning field provide a promising, novel and unifying approach for agent-based model analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer differential equation models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from equation learning can be used to learn differential equation models from agent-based model simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few model simulations, and accurately predicts model dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two agent-based models that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread.","Nardini, John T; Baker, Ruth E; Simpson, Matthew J; Flores, Kevin B","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",41,31

INTERVENTION(S) Anonymous survey sent to applicants and PDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Descriptive study evaluating the experience and satisfaction of applicants and PDs with WBIs. RESULT(S) Forty-six percent of applicants and eligible PDs responded to our survey. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were adequate for conveying a sense of a program's strengths, faculty, diversity, clinical training, and research opportunities, but less than half responded that WBIs were adequate in providing a sense of the program's clinical site and facilities. After WBIs, both applicants (73%) and PDs (86%) were able to rank with confidence. The cost of WBIs was significantly lower for both applicants (median: $100) and programs (median: $100) than the costs previously reported for in-person interviews. The applicants interviewed at more programs than they would have if the interviews were on-site, and Zoom was the highest rated platform used. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were an adequate substitute, and that they should continue after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Furthermore, most of the PDs were planning to continue to use WBIs in some capacity.

Is it ethical to preempt the publication of another researcher's unpublished data or preliminary analysis, perhaps without citation? The long-established answer is 'certainly not'-but recent 'open data' use suggests otherwise. A research competition was held using data from The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). This SPRINT Data Analysis Challenge created a novel environment for using open data as data became open early. This allowed third-party researchers the opportunity to assess some of the trial's outcomes before trialists. Could this infringe on trialists' right to analyse their data? Simultaneously, trialists had access to analyses from submissions to the competition that were not formally 'published' with a typical author credit or citation. Therefore, trialists had the opportunity to view the competition submissions and published on those ideas first without a typical way to cite the source of that idea.

We conducted a time-series analysis to evaluate the association of six common air pollutants with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children aged 0-14 years in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan and Xining), China during 2013-2018. We used generalized additive models incorporating penalized smoothing splines and random-effect meta-analysis to calculate city-specific and pooled estimates, respectively. The exposure-response relationship curves were fitted using the cubic spline regression. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, season and disease subtype were also performed. A total of 183,036 respiratory diseases hospitalizations were recorded during the study period, and 94.1% of the cases were acute respiratory infections. Overall, we observed that increased levels of air pollutants except O3, were significantly associated with increased hospital admissions for respiratory disease. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 at lag 07, PM10 at lag 03 and per 1 mg/m3 increase in CO at lag 01 corresponded to increments of 1.19%, 3.58%, 2.23%, 0.51% and 6.10% in total hospitalizations, respectively. Generally, exposure-response relationships of PM2.5 and SO2 in Guangzhou, SO2, NO2 and CO in Wuhan, as well as SO2 and NO2 in Xining with respiratory disease hospitalizations were also found. Moreover, the adverse effects of these pollutants apart from PM2.5 in certain cities remained significant even at exposure levels below the current Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade II. Children aged 4-14 years appeared to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5, SO2 and NO2. Furthermore, with the exception of O3, the associations were stronger in cold season than in warm season. Short-term exposure to PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO were associated, in dose-responsive manners, with increased risks of hospitalizations for childhood respiratory diseases, and adverse effects of air pollutants except PM2.5 held even at exposure levels below the current CAAQS Grade II in certain cities.","Yang, Huihua; Yan, Chunxiang; Li, Meng; Zhao, Lei; Long, Zhen; Fan, Yali; Zhang, Zhonggang; Chen, Renjie; Huang, Yihui; Lu, Congbin; Zhang, Jianduan; Tang, Jie; Liu, Hua; Liu, Miao; Guo, Wenting; Yang, Liangle; Zhang, Xiaomin",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,41,8

Facial reanimation restores smiling, thus boosting self-confidence and social integration of the affected children. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of microsurgical workhorse free functional muscle transfer procedures with emphasis on the long-term functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a literature search of the PubMed database from 1995 to 2019 using the following search strategy: ""facial paralysis""[Title/Abstract] OR ""facial palsy""[Title]. We used as limits: full text, English language, age younger than 18 years, and humans. Two independent reviewers performed the online screening process using Covidence. Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. The protocol was aligned with the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019150112) of the National Institute for Health Research. RESULTS Free functional muscle transfer procedures include mainly segmental gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor muscle transfer. Facial reanimation procedures with the use of the cross-face nerve graft (CFNG) or masseteric nerve result in almost symmetric smiles. The transplanted muscle grows harmoniously along with the craniofacial skeleton. Muscle function and aesthetic outcomes improve over time. All children presented improved self-esteem, oral commissure opening, facial animation, and speech. CONCLUSIONS A two-stage CFNG plus an FFMT may restore a spontaneous emotive smile in pediatric facial palsy patients. Superior results of children FFMT compared to adults FFMT are probably attributed to greater brain plasticity.","Gasteratos, Konstantinos; Azzawi, Saif Al; Vlachopoulos, Nikolaos; Lese, Ioana; Spyropoulou, Georgia-Alexandra; Grobbelaar, Adriaan O","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",41,26

Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 1 Apr 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann",Wellcome open research,41,1

However, there is an associated risk of adverse events following a DS procedure including vitamin deficiencies, bleeding, obstruction, stricture, and leakage. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 37-year-old female with body mass index of 67kg/m(2) and multiple comorbidities underwent a Da Vinci-assisted, laparoscopic, one-stage, single-anastomosis DS procedure. On postoperative day 11, the patient developed persistent nausea, fatigue, and severe abdominal pain. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and was found to have hemoperitoneum, which was evacuated, but active bleeding source was not identifiable. Three days later, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, for bleeding with duodenal stump blowout. DISCUSSION Duodenal stump blowout is the result from increased pressure caused by distal obstruction with the back up of duodenal contents. Anastomotic leakage/blow-out following surgery when suspected, should be individualized and management strategy should be implemented according to the size of the leak, extent of the abscess, and status of the patient. CONCLUSION Duodenal stump leaks must be diagnosed as early as possible, and treated appropriately with operative intervention. Regardless of the operative technique the key to appropriate treatment is stabilize the patient, repair the duodenal stump, and adequate drainage.","Nelson, Lars; Moon, Rena C; Teixeira, Andre F; Jawad, Muhammad A",International journal of surgery case reports,41,1

Captopril has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Imbalance in the oxidant/antioxidant system is one of the major causes of inflammation. In the present study, the effects of captopril on total and differential white blood cells (WBC), oxidative stress andlung histopathological changes produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated in rat. MATERIALS AND METHOD The rats were divided into: control (saline-treated), LPS (1 mg/kg), 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg captopril-treated before LPS administration (LPS+Cap12.5, LPS+Cap25 and LPS+Cap50) and Cap-treated, 50 mg/kg before saline administration (as positive control group)groups. The levels of total and percentage of differential WBC in blood, and the oxidative stress index in the serum were evaluated. Lung histopathological changes were also examined. RESULTS In the LPS group, total WBC count, percentage of neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes in the blood, oxidative stress indices in serum, lung pathological changes were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Pathological changes of lung, serum oxidative stress indices of LPS+Cap50 group, total WBC counts of LPS+Cap25 and LPS+Cap50 groups, as well as percentage of neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils in LPS+Cap50 group and percentage of eosinophils in LPS+Cap50 and LPS+Cap25 groups, were significantly decreased compared to the LPS group (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The results of this study showed that captopril dose-dependently reduced total and differential WBC counts, while it improved serum oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers and histopathological changes in LPS-treated rats. These results indicate a therapeutic potential for captopril on systemic inflammation and oxidative stress against LPS-induced lung injuries.","Boskabadi, Javad; Mokhtari-Zaer, Amin; Abareshi, Azam; Khazdair, Mohammad Reza; Emami, Bahman; Mohammadian Roshan, Nama; Hosseini, Mahmoud; Boskabady, Mohammad Hossein",Experimental lung research,41,16

NAADP action is mediated by NAADP-binding protein(s) of unknown identity that confer NAADP sensitivity to TPCs. Here, we used a ""clickable"" NAADP-based photoprobe to isolate human NAADP-binding proteins and identified Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2) as a TPC accessory protein required for endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling. JPT2 was also required for the translocation of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus through the endolysosomal system. Thus, JPT2 is a component of the NAADP receptor complex that is essential for TPC-dependent Ca2+ signaling and control of coronaviral entry.","Gunaratne, Gihan S; Brailoiu, Eugen; He, Shijun; Unterwald, Ellen M; Patel, Sandip; Slama, James T; Walseth, Timothy F; Marchant, Jonathan S",Science signaling,41,16

This study examines the results of mitral valve repair with Simplici-T annuloplasty band without predetermining its length in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) as a result of degenerative disease. METHODS Three hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients (median age, 58 years; 69% men) underwent mitral valve repair for MR as a result of degenerative disease (52% bileaflet prolapse and 36% anterior leaflet prolapse). Prolapse of the leaflet was corrected by chordal replacement with Gore-Tex sutures and occasionally a triangular resection. A posterior mitral annuloplasty with a Simplici-T band (median length, 70 mm; range, 52 to 80 mm) was performed by securing it from the lateral to the medial fibrous trigones. Annular reduction was performed selectively on the commissures, false commissures, and areas of posterior leaflet resection. Mitral valve function, gradients, and areas were assessed perioperatively and annually during a median follow-up of 4.1 years (interquartile range, 2.7 to 5.4 years) and was 98% complete. RESULTS There were 2 operative and 7 late deaths; survival at 5 years was 97.2%. Three patients were discharged from the hospital with mild to moderate MR, and during follow-up a total of 14 patients had MR greater than mild and 1 patient had MR greater than moderate. Mitral valve re-repair was performed in 1 patient who exhibited mitral stenosis. Freedom from MR greater than mild at 5 years was 93.3%. CONCLUSIONS Selective reduction of the mitral annulus with a posterior band without predetermining its length during mitral valve repair for degenerative MR provides excellent functional results.","David, Tirone E; David, Carolyn M; Manlhiot, Cedric",The Annals of thoracic surgery,41,31

In our study we sought to evaluate alfaxalone, which has gained recent popularity in veterinary medicine, alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine to evaluate their anesthetic ability in Sprague-Dawley rats when administered intraperitoneally. Three doses of alfaxalone only and 4 dose combinations of alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine were tested in males and female rats. The time to induction, anesthetic duration, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and time to recovery were recorded by a blind observer. The level of anesthesia induced by the various anesthetic protocols was assessed by using pedal withdrawal reflex to a noxious stimulus and scored according to the response. Dependent on the treatment group,atipamezole or saline was administered intraperitoneally once animals reached 60 min of anesthesia. Regardless of the dose, alfaxalone alone achieved only a sedative level of anesthesia, whereas all alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine combinations led to a surgical level of anesthesia in all animals. Anesthesia regimens using alfaxalone alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine demonstrated sex-associated differences, with female rats maintaining longer durations of sedation or anesthesia than their male counterparts. Both male and female rats displayed decreases in physiologic parameters consistent with the effects of dexmedetomidine. Given the results described herein, we recommend 20 mg/kg alfaxalone for sedation and 30 mg/kg alfaxalone combined with 0.05 mg/kg dexmedetomidine for surgical anesthesia in female rats. Appropriate doses of alfaxalone only and alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine for male rats were not determined in this study and need further evaluation.","West, Sylvia E; Lee, Jonathan C; Johns, Tinika N; Nunamaker, Elizabeth A",Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,41,1

The infectivity, pathogenesis, and infection of this virus are dependent on the interaction of SARS-CoV2 spike protein with human ACE2 (hACE2). Spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes hACE-2. In the present study, we are reporting a denovo designed novel hybrid antiviral 'VT-AR-01' molecule that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. A series of antiviral molecules were tested for binding at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, ascorbate, lopinavir, and hydroxychloroquine have strong interaction at RBD-hACE2 interface. These four molecules were used for denovo fragment-based antiviral design. Denovo designing, docking, and MDS analysis identified a 'VTAR' hybrid molecule that has better interaction with this interface as compared to all antiviral used to design it. We have further used retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis to design 100 variants of VT-AR molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis, along with docking and MDS, identified VT-AR-01 that interact with the interface of the RBD-ACE2 complex. MDS analysis confirmed its interaction with the RBD-ACE2 interface by involving Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2, as well as Gln493 and Ser494 of RBD. Interaction of spike protein with ACE2 is essential for pathogenesis and infection of this virus; hence, this in-silico designed hybrid antiviral molecule (VT-AR-01) that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 may be further developed to control the infection of SARS-CoV2.","Tiwari, Vishvanath",Biology open,41,28

The authors' approach is to excise these nevi and perform reconstruction because of the risk of malignant transformation and the aesthetic and psychological effects these nevi can have on the child. This study presents the authors' experience in treating congenital nevi of the ear and suggests treatment principles and guidelines for the reconstructive surgeon. METHODS Fourteen patients with congenital nevus of the ear were treated from October of 1992 to September of 2008 by the senior surgeon (B.S.B.). Nevi involving the more stable areas such as the concha can be resected and grafted early; the antihelix, scapha, and triangular fossa area can be resected and grafted next; and the helical rim, having the most easily distorted cartilage, should be treated last. Lobule reconstruction requires combined flaps and a dermal fat graft or a postauricular fascial fat flap. RESULTS Successful reconstruction was achieved in 10 patients. Three patients require final revision procedures (lobule reconstruction). One patient, early in our series, developed a deformed helical rim resulting from skin grafting at age 16 months, before the cartilage was firm enough to withstand the contraction forces of the skin graft. All subsequent patients with helical rim involvement had treatment delayed until the ear was at or near completion of its growth. CONCLUSIONS Congenital nevi of the ear present a challenging reconstruction surgeon. The authors developed a treatment plan that breaks the ear down to aesthetic units and considers the location of the nevus, patient age, and the firmness of the cartilage.","Adler, Neta; Margulis, Alexander; Bauer, Bruce S",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,41,17

We examined differences over the 2 years after discharge in mortality, healthcare utilisation and frailty score between elderly survivors of ARI in the ICU and an elderly control population. METHODS We used 2009-2017 data from 39 hospital discharge databases. Patients ≥ 80 years old discharged alive from ICU hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection were propensity score-matched with controls (cataract surgery) discharged from the hospital at the same time and adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities present before hospitalisation. We reported 2-year mortality and compared healthcare utilisation and frailty scores in the 2-year periods before and after ICU hospitalisation. RESULTS One thousand two hundred and twenty elderly survivors of acute respiratory infection in the ICU were discharged, and 988 were successfully matched with controls. After discharge, patients had a 10.1-fold [95% CI, 6.1-17.3] higher risk of death at 6 months and 3.6-fold [95% CI, 2.9-4.6] higher risk of death at 2 years compared with controls. They also had a 2-fold increase in both healthcare utilisation and frailty score in the 2 years after hospital discharge, whereas healthcare utilisation and frailty scores among controls were stable before and after hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS We observed a substantially increased rate of death in the years following ICU hospitalisation for elderly patients along with elevated healthcare resource use and accelerated age-associated decline as assessed by frailty score. These findings provide data for better informed goals-of-care discussions and may help target post-ICU discharge services.","Guillon, Antoine; Hermetet, Coralie; Barker, Kimberly A; Jouan, Youenn; Gaborit, Christophe; Ehrmann, Stephan; Le Manach, Yannick; Dequin, Pierre-François; Grammatico-Guillon, Leslie",Critical care,41,1

For distal ureteral TCC, distal ureterectomy with ureteral reimplantation represents a treatment option. Multiple minimally invasive techniques have been introduced with the goal of replicating these open procedures. Currently, there is a paucity of literature for the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) management of upper-tract TCC. We evaluated our experience with RAL management of upper-tract TCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent complete RAL nephroureterectomy or distal ureterectomy with ureteral reimplantation at our institution. RESULTS Eleven patients with a mean age of 67.4 years underwent RAL nephroureterectomy. Mean operative time was 326 minutes (range 243-470 minutes), estimated blood loss 200 mL (range 100-400 mL), and mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 days. With a mean follow-up of 15.2 months (range 2-31 months), four patients experienced recurrence, and two ultimately died from metastatic disease. Four patients with a mean age of 73.5 years underwent RAL distal ureterectomy with ureteral reimplantation for distal ureteral TCC. Mean operative time was 311 minutes (range 225-446 minutes), estimated blood loss 200 mL (range 100-350 mL), and mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 days. With a mean follow-up of 30.5 months (range 12-48 months), only one patient, whose pathology exhibited carcinoma in situ within periureteral tissue, required adjuvant treatment for recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS RAL nephroureterectomy and distal ureterectomy with ureteral reimplantation are feasible options for patients with upper-tract TCC with promising short-term oncologic outcomes.","Eandi, Jonathan A; Nelson, Rebecca A; Wilson, Timothy G; Josephson, David Y",Journal of endourology,41,1

In the present study, atmospheric zinc (Zn) emissions from eight CFPPs with different kinds of boilers and air pollution control devices (APCDs) in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, were investigated as well as the partitioning of this metal among boilers and APCDs. During the investigation of a CFPP, samples were taken of input and output materials during the same period. Our results give a Zn content of 32-165 mg kg-1 for feed coal, 52-237 mg kg-1 for bottom ash, 108-725 mg kg-1 for fly ash, 1.2-6.0 mg kg-1 for limestone, 1.6-7.3 mg kg-1 for gypsum, and 1.39-7.06 μg Nm-3 for stack gas. Most of the zinc content in the feed coal goes with the flue gas after combustion and amounts to 94.2-96.1% and 60.5-78.1% for pulverized coal-fired boilers (PC) and circulating fluidized bed boilers (CFB), respectively. Based on input Zn, a larger share (80.8-96.4%) ends up the captured fly ash of PC boilers than the case of CFB boilers (66.1-73.6%). In turn, a minor portion is captured into the flue gas desulfurization gypsum, while we found a maximum of 0.05‰ is emitted into the atmosphere. The atmospheric emission factors (EMFs) of Zn for the eight CFPPs are 7.55-57.22 mg ton-1 coal, 4.17-22.75 μg (kWh)-1, or 0.39-2.36 g TJ-1 using different benchmarks. Overall, the calculated emission factors here are distinctively low with the upgrading of APCDs in recent years. An estimation of 1276 ± 1047 kg year-1 (range: 498-3777 kg year-1) of Zn is emitted into the atmosphere from the CFPPs of Guizhou Province in 2017 by coupling the EMFs obtained from this study and the coal consumption by this category of power plants.","Zhou, Xian; Feng, Xinbin; Bi, Xiangyang; Li, Xinyu; Wang, Qingfeng; Li, Shan; He, Tianrong; Li, Zhonggen",Environmental science and pollution research international,41,1

This study describes demographic, clinical, and functional characteristics of veterans in MFHs. Methods Findings from in-home assessments of veterans in MFHs tied to 4 VHA medical centers for ≥ 90 days between April 2014 and December 2015 were collected. Trained nurses completed Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessments for 92 veterans in MFHs. The assessment included demographic characteristics, cognition, behaviors, depression, pain, functional status, mobility, and morbidity. Results MFH veterans were primarily male (85%), aged > 65 years (83%), cognitively impaired (55%), and had a diagnosis of depression (52%). Overall, 22% had caregiverreported aggressive behaviors and 45% self-reported pain. More than half used a wheelchair (56%). Of the 11 activities of daily living (ADLs) assessed, MFH residents were most likely to require assistance with bathing and least likely to require assistance with bed mobility and eating, although more than half required eating assistance. Conclusions Veterans residing in MFHs have a wide range of care needs, including some veterans with high needs for help with ADLs and others who are completely independent in performing ADLs. These results provide insights about which veterans are staying in MFH care. Future studies should explore how VHA care providers refer veterans to LTC settings.","Magid, Kate H; Manheim, Chelsea; Haverhals, Leah M; Thomas, Kali S; Saliba, Debra; Levy, Cari","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",41,1
125628,125628,125628,The authors reply.,15.1355,10.636476,2020-11-01,"Background Models of propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics developed in patients without brain pathology are widely used for target-controlled infusion (TCI) during brain tumour excision operations. The goal of this study was to determine if the presence of a frontal brain tumour influences propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and existing PK-PD model performance. Methods Twenty patients with a frontal brain tumour and 20 control patients received a propofol infusion to achieve an induction-emergence-induction anaesthetic sequence. Propofol plasma concentration was measured every 4 min and at each transition of the conscious state. Bispectral index (BIS) values were continuously recorded. We used non-linear mixed-effects modelling to analyse the effects of the presence of a brain tumour on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol. Subsequently we calculated the predictive performance of Marsh, Schnider, and Eleveld models in terms of median prediction error (MdPE) and median absolute prediction error (MdAPE). Results Patients with brain tumours showed 40% higher propofol clearance than control patients. Performance of the Schnider model (MdPEpk -20.0%, MdAPEpk 23.4%) and Eleveld volunteer model (MdPEpk -8.58%, MdAPEpk 21.6%) were good. The Marsh model performed less well (MdPEpk -14.3%, MdAPEpk 41.4%), as did the Eleveld patient model (MdPEpk -30.8%, MdAPEpk 32.1%). Conclusions Brain tumours might alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Caution should be exerted when using propofol TCI in patients with frontal brain tumours due to higher clearance.

Aim This study was conducted in a descriptive and comparative way in order to identify the relation between the breastfeeding success and self-efficacy of obese and non-obese mothers during postnatal period and to make a comparison between the obese and non-obese group. Methods The study sample consisted of 113 obese and 111 non-obese mothers that met the study criteria who were hospitalized at the postnatal service of Health Education and Research Hospital in Ankara, September 2014-February 2015. Result The mean BMI of obese women prior to the pregnancy was 31.41±2.4 while it was 22.25±2.8 for the non-obese women. As the BSS scores increase among both the obese and non-obese mothers, the LATCH breastfeeding success score averages increase as well (p<0.05, r:0.613). Conclusion In the light of the data of, to increase the breastfeeding success among obese mothers, it is suggested that the perception of self-efficacy is enhanced, and additional consultation is provided on breastfeeding starting from the antenatal period. The trainings given to mothers by the midwife and nurse are supported with home visits especially in the obese women in the postnatal period in order for them to breastfeeding.","Ceylan, Sinem; Şahin, Sevil",African health sciences,41,31

Literature on the outcomes of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy is slowly building up. The aim of the present review was to gather evidence from relevant articles published in English from January to August 2020 in Medline and Google Scholar. The review revealed that pregnant women who become COVID-19-positive are usually either asymptomatic or mild-to-moderately symptomatic, similar to non-pregnant women. Pneumonia is one of the most common outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, it cannot be conclusively said that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. Pregnant women with COVID-19 with co-morbidities have increased risks of complications: there are regional variations in the rates of adverse outcomes reported. Though uncommon, the review shows that vertical transmission is possible. Additionally, the third trimester seems to be the most vulnerable period of infection. This aspect needs to be researched further to activate surveillance programs at the end of second trimester. Overall, it is necessary to monitor pregnant women before and after delivery, and their infants, during this pandemic.","Salem, Deemah; Katranji, Fawzi; Bakdash, Talah",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,41,1

However, it is challenging to conduct multiple user tests because of the significant burden on the elderly; thus, we need efficient ways to extract insight through different approaches. In this study, we aim to elucidate real-time transitions in users' emotions and achievement motivation while using such a device. We synthesize an utterance analysis method based on attribution theory, in which all users' utterances are attributed to four categories (ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck) that follow the developed coding rules. Knowing the transitions in causal attribution allows us to extract salient experiences for users, especially by extracting shifts from them and analyzing why the shift occurred and what exactly was happening before and after the shift. If only salient user experiences can be referenced from the aggregate data, useful information can be extracted in a short time to improve system characteristics and the environment. We discussed the validity and reliability of the proposed method by conducting a user test of an electric-assisted four-wheeled cycle for frail elderly people in Kakegawa city in Shizuoka, Japan. We also succeeded in marking the points that need attention, which is about 33% of the total amount of utterance data (1626 utterances), and thus confirmed the potential of the proposed method. Future research should examine how the developed methodology can help designers improve assistive device development, as well as how it can contribute to other fields such as education and social assistance.","Ohashi, Takumi; Watanabe, Makiko; Takenaka, Yuma; Saijo, Miki",Integrative psychological & behavioral science,41,17

Here, we report the effect of age on clinical and angiographic outcome within the North American Solitaire-FR Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) Registry. METHODS The NASA Registry recruited sites to submit data on consecutive patients treated with Solitaire-FR. Influence of age on clinical and angiographic outcomes was assessed by dichotomizing the cohort into ≤80 and >80 years of age. RESULTS Three hundred fifty-four patients underwent treatment in 24 centers; 276 patients were ≤80 years and 78 were >80 years of age. Mean age in the ≤80 and >80 cohorts was 62.2±13.2 and 85.2±3.8 years, respectively. Of patients >80 years, 27.3% had a 90-day modified Rankin Score ≤2 versus 45.4% ≤80 years (P=0.02). Mortality was 43.9% and 27.3% in the >80 and ≤80 years cohorts, respectively (P=0.01). There was no significant difference in time to revascularization, revascularization success, or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between the groups. Multivariate analysis showed age >80 years as an independent predictor of poor clinical outcome and mortality. Within the >80 cohort, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), revascularization rate, rescue therapy use, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Greater than 80 years of age is predictive of poor clinical outcome and increased mortality compared with younger patients in the NASA registry. However, intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator use, lower NIHSS, and shorter revascularization time are associated with better outcomes. Further studies are needed to understand the endovascular therapy role in this cohort compared with medical therapy.","Castonguay, Alicia C; Zaidat, Osama O; Novakovic, Roberta; Nguyen, Thanh N; Taqi, M Asif; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; E English, Joey; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Malisch, Tim W; Marden, Franklin A; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael T; Badruddin, Aamir; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng R; Britz, Gavin W; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; A Issa, Mohammad; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,41,16

The aims of the study were to analyze the practice of mouthpiece ventilation and to evaluate the performance of ventilators for mouthpiece ventilation. METHODS Practice of mouthpiece ventilation was assessed by a questionnaire, and the performance of 6 home ventilators with mouthpiece ventilation was assessed in a bench test using 24 different conditions per ventilator: 3 mouthpieces, a child and an adult patient profile, and 4 ventilatory modes. RESULTS Questionnaires were obtained from 30 subjects (mean age 33 ± 11 y) using NIV for 12 ± 7 y. Fifteen subjects used NIV for > 20 h/day, and 11 were totally ventilator-dependent. The subject-reported benefits of mouthpiece ventilation were a reduction in dyspnea (73%) and fatigue (93%) and an improvement in speech (43%) and eating (27%). The bench study showed that none of the ventilators, even those with mouthpiece ventilation software, were able to deliver mouthpiece ventilation without alarms and/or autotriggering in each condition. Alarms and/or ineffective triggering or autotriggering were observed in 135 of the 198 conditions. The occurrence of alarms was more common with a large mouthpiece without a filter compared to a small mouthpiece with a filter (P < .001), but it was not related to the patient profile, the ventilatory mode, or the type of ventilator. CONCLUSIONS Subjects are satisfied with mouthpiece ventilation. Alarms are common with home ventilators, although less common in those with mouthpiece ventilation software. Improvements in home ventilators are needed to facilitate the expansion of mouthpiece ventilation.","Khirani, Sonia; Ramirez, Adriana; Delord, Vincent; Leroux, Karl; Lofaso, Frédéric; Hautot, Solène; Toussaint, Michel; Orlikowski, David; Louis, Bruno; Fauroux, Brigitte",Respiratory care,41,1

The study included both a cross-sectional observational study and a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. 140 people diagnosed with a 35-49 mm diameter AAA, 56 (40%) of whom had concurrent PAD, and 25 healthy controls were prospectively recruited. QOL was assessed with the short form (SF) 36. Findings in participants that were diagnosed with both AAA and PAD were compared separately with those of participants that had a diagnosis of AAA alone or who had neither AAA nor PAD diagnosed (healthy controls). All participants diagnosed with an AAA were then randomly allocated to 145 mg of fenofibrate per day or identical placebo. Outcomes were assessed by changes in the domains of the SF-36 and ankle brachial pressure Index (ABPI) from randomization to 24 weeks. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Participants diagnosed with both AAA and PAD had significantly worse QOL than participants diagnosed with AAA alone or healthy controls. Fenofibrate did not significantly alter SF-36 scores or ABPI over 24 weeks.

Recently, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of dexmedetomidine has been published, but no external validation has been reported in clinical trials. We aimed to administer target-controlled infusion (TCI) of dexmedetomidine at the effect-site concentration (Ce) to patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia and investigate the relationship between dexmedetomidine Ce and the sedative effects. METHODS Forty-five patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery received spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. After confirmation of sensory block level, we initiated effect-site TCI of dexmedetomidine using Colin's model and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale and bispectral index (BIS) with each stepwise increase in the dexmedetomidine Ce. We used a non-linear mixed-effects model to determine the PD relationships between the dexmedetomidine Ce and sedation level. RESULTS The dexmedetomidine Ce associated with 50% probability (Ce50 ) of the MOAA/S scale ≤4, 3 and 2 was 0.57, 0.89 and 1.19 ng/mL, respectively. Mean dexmedetomidine Ce when BIS decreased ≤70 was 0.99 ± 0.15 ng/mL. As dexmedetomidine Ce increased, the MOAA/S scale decreased significantly (correlation coefficient [r] = -.832, P < .0001). BIS decreased significantly with increasing dexmedetomidine Ce (r = -.811, P < .0001) and decreasing MOAA/S scale (r = .838, P < .0001). The most common side effects were hypertension (26.67%) and bradycardia (20%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION We applied effect-site TCI of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for the first time. Dexmedetomidine Ce correlated significantly with MOAA/S scale and BIS, and was 0.89 and 1.19 ng/mL for moderate and deep sedation, respectively.","Kim, Kyung Mi; Seo, Kwon Hui; Lee, Jung Min; Park, Eun Young; Park, Jieun",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,41,1

We analyzed our results for the surgical management of this high-risk cohort. METHODS We queried our aortic database for consecutive patients undergoing ATAAD repair. Those presenting with malperfusion were compared with those without. Outcomes were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS From 1997 to 2019, a total of 336 patients underwent ATAAD repair. A total of 97 ATAAD patients presented with malperfusion. Malperfusion patients were more likely to be male (54.8% vs. 75.3%; p = .001), have had a prior myocardial infarction (11.9% vs. 26.8%; p = .001), to present with preoperative renal dysfunction (22.2% vs. 54.6%; p < .001), and to present with shock (12.6% vs. 28.9%; p = .001). The malperfusion group more often underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (5.4% vs. 24.7%; p < .001), and required additional noncardiac procedures 10.3% of the time. Operative mortality (0.8% vs. 15.5%; p < .001) and major adverse events (MAEs) (7.6% vs. 20.6%; p = .001) were both greater for the malperfusion patients. Ejection fraction, diabetes, and malperfusion were predictors of MAEs. Cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and multiple vascular bed malperfusion were predictors of MAEs, while extremity, renal, and spinal were not. CONCLUSION Improving outcomes for this high-risk cohort requires rapid diagnosis and reversal of ischemia while minimizing the risk of aortic rupture, irrespective of the strategic approach.","Iannacone, Erin; Robinson, Bryce; Rahouma, Mohamed; Girardi, Leonard",Journal of cardiac surgery,41,1

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 538 patients who underwent LM between January 2008 and December 2009 at our hospital. Patients undergoing LM were divided into two groups depending on whether the cell salvage and autologous blood recovery system was used; the use of the system was at the discretion of the surgeon. The system for intraoperative hemorrhage was employed based on the surgeon's decision. RESULTS Of the 583 patients, 23 patients (4.3%) underwent LM using the system. No patient required an allogeneic blood transfusion during or after the surgery. The median surgical time (183 vs. 100 m), total blood loss (520 vs. 100 mL), total weight of enucleated myomas (390 vs. 175 g), and postoperative calculated δ-Hemoglobin (δ-Hb) (2 vs. 1.6 g/dL) were significantly increased in the 23 patients in whom the system was used. The median autologous blood volume recovered by intraoperative use of the system and transferred to the 23 patients was 250 mL (range 125-800 mL). For patients in whom the system was not used, the total blood loss significantly correlated to δ-Hb (r = 0.29; P < 0.01). However, there was no such correlation in patients in whom the system was not used (r = 0.04; P = 0.86).

Objective To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardial tissue from autopsy cases and to document a possible cardiac response to that infection. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used data from consecutive autopsy cases from Germany between April 8 and April 18, 2020. All patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab tests. Exposures Patients who died of coronavirus disease 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cardiac tissue as well as CD3+, CD45+, and CD68+ cells in the myocardium and gene expression of tumor necrosis growth factor α, interferon γ, chemokine ligand 5, as well as interleukin-6, -8, and -18. Results Cardiac tissue from 39 consecutive autopsy cases were included. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 85 (78-89) years, and 23 (59.0%) were women. SARS-CoV-2 could be documented in 24 of 39 patients (61.5%). Viral load above 1000 copies per μg RNA could be documented in 16 of 39 patients (41.0%). A cytokine response panel consisting of 6 proinflammatory genes was increased in those 16 patients compared with 15 patients without any SARS-CoV-2 in the heart. Comparison of 15 patients without cardiac infection with 16 patients with more than 1000 copies revealed no inflammatory cell infiltrates or differences in leukocyte numbers per high power field. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis of autopsy cases, viral presence within the myocardium could be documented. While a response to this infection could be reported in cases with higher virus load vs no virus infection, this was not associated with an influx of inflammatory cells.

RAB25 blocks chemotherapy-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by either increasing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreasing proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. In particular, BAX expression negatively correlates with RAB25 expression in ovarian cancer cells. BH3 profiling assays corroborated that RAB25 decreases mitochondrial cell death priming. Suppressing RAB25 by means of RNAi or RFP14 inhibitory hydrocarbon-stapled peptide sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy as well as RAB25-mediated proliferation, invasion and migration.

METHODS Participants aged 18-‒80 years, scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anesthesia, were randomly divided into a masked group (wearing eye masks during surgery, n = 20) and a control group (no mask, n = 18). The sedation level was assessed using a modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) scale. Midazolam (1 mg) was incrementally administered every 5 min until moderate sedation (MOAA/S score of 3) was achieved. The bispectral index (BIS) was monitored, and the onset and maintenance times of a BIS < 80 were recorded. RESULTS The two groups had similar demographic characteristics. The midazolam requirements were significantly lower in the masked group than in the control group (2.8 mg vs. 3.7 mg, P = 0.024). However, the onset and maintenance times for a BIS < 80 were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the incidence of side effects or patient satisfaction between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Blocking the external environment with an eye mask during spinal anesthesia can reduce the requirement for sedatives, such as midazolam.

An underexplored and intriguing property of exercise is its actions on the body's 24 h or circadian rhythms. Molecular clock cells in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) use electrical and chemical signals to orchestrate their activity and convey time of day information to the rest of the brain and body. To date, the long-lasting effects of regular physical exercise on SCN clock cell coordination and communication remain unresolved. Utilizing mouse models in which SCN intercellular neuropeptide signaling is impaired as well as those with intact SCN neurochemical signaling, we examined how daily scheduled voluntary exercise (SVE) influenced behavioral rhythms and SCN molecular and neuronal activities. We show that in mice with disrupted neuropeptide signaling, SVE promotes SCN clock cell synchrony and robust 24 h rhythms in behavior. Interestingly, in both intact and neuropeptide signaling deficient animals, SVE reduces SCN neural activity and alters GABAergic signaling. These findings illustrate the potential utility of regular exercise as a long-lasting and effective non-invasive intervention in the elderly or mentally ill where circadian rhythms can be blunted and poorly aligned to the external world.","Hughes, Alun Thomas Lloyd; Samuels, Rayna Eve; Baño-Otálora, Beatriz; Belle, Mino David Charles; Wegner, Sven; Guilding, Clare; Northeast, Rebecca Catrin; Loudon, Andrew Stewart Irvine; Gigg, John; Piggins, Hugh David",Communications biology,41,17

Chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been investigated mostly in China, and there is very little information available on the radiological findings occurring in other populations. In this study, we aimed to describe the characteristics of chest CT findings in confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Iranian population, based on a time classification. METHODS Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan. RESULTS The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%), and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral multifocal GGO, and mixed GGO with consolidation were the most common patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in our study. However, these patterns might change according to the time interval from symptoms.","Jafari, Sirous; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Eshraghi, Sahereh; Araghi, Farnaz; Aryannejad, Armin; Mohammadnejad, Esmaeil; Rasoolinejad, Mehrnaz; Hajiabdolbaghi, Mahboubeh; Koochak, Hamid Emadi; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Abbasian, Ladan; Manshadi, Seyed Ali Dehghan; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Khalili, Hossein; Yazdi, Niloofar Ayoobi; Seifi, Arash",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,41,0

One determinant of alphavirus virulence is nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) that contains a highly conserved MacroD-type macrodomain at the N terminus, but the roles of nsP3 and the macrodomain in virulence have not been defined. Macrodomain is a conserved protein fold found in several plus-strand RNA viruses that binds to the small molecule ADP-ribose. Prototype MacroD-type macrodomains also hydrolyze derivative linkages on the distal ribose ring. Here, we demonstrated that the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain is able to hydrolyze ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins. Using mass spectrometry, we unambiguously defined its substrate specificity as mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated aspartate and glutamate but not lysine residues. Mutant viruses lacking hydrolase activity were unable to replicate in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito Aedes albopictus cells and rapidly reverted catalytically inactivating mutations. Mutants with reduced enzymatic activity had slower replication in mammalian neuronal cells and reduced virulence in 2-day-old mice. Therefore, nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase activity is critical for CHIKV replication in both vertebrate hosts and insect vectors, and for virulence in mice.","McPherson, Robert Lyle; Abraham, Rachy; Sreekumar, Easwaran; Ong, Shao-En; Cheng, Shang-Jung; Baxter, Victoria K; Kistemaker, Hans A V; Filippov, Dmitri V; Griffin, Diane E; Leung, Anthony K L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,41,24

However CVC is associated with numerous potential complications, including death. We describe the finding of a rare left-sided partial anomalous pulmonary vein connection during central venous catheterization for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). CASE PRESENTATION Ultrasound-guided cannulation of a large bore temporary dual-lumen Quinton-Mahurkar catheter into the left internal jugular vein was performed for CRRT initiation in a 66 year old African-American with sepsis-related oliguric acute kidney injury. The post-procedure chest X-ray suggested inadvertent left carotid artery cannulation. Blood gases obtained from the catheter showed high partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 140 mmHg and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 22 mmHg, suggestive of arterial cannulation. However, the pressure-transduced wave forms appeared venous and Computed Tomography Angiography located the catheter in the left internal jugular vein, but demonstrated that the tip of the catheter was lying over a left pulmonary vein which was abnormally draining into the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein rather than into the left atrium.

We assessed their pharmacodynamic profile and examined the role of the endothelium in mediating their vasomotor effects in vivo in man. METHODS AND RESULTS Eighteen healthy male volunteers (23±4 years) were recruited into a series of double-blind, randomized crossover studies using bilateral forearm venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial urocortin 2 (3.6 to 120 pmol/min), urocortin 3 (1.2 to 36 nmol/min), and substance P (2 to 8 pmol/min) in the presence or absence of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (aspirin), cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (fluconazole), and nitric oxide synthase (L-NMMA). Urocortins 2 and 3 evoked arterial vasodilatation (P<0.0001) without tachyphylaxis but with a slow onset and offset of action. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with L-NMMA reduced vasodilatation to substance P and urocortin 2 (P≤0.001 for both) but had little effect on urocortin 3 (P>0.05). Neither aspirin nor fluconazole affected vasodilatation induced by any of the infusions (P>0.05 for all). In the presence of all 3 inhibitors, urocortin 2- and urocortin 3-induced vasodilatation was attenuated (P<0.001 for all) to a greater extent than with L-NMMA alone (P≤0.005). CONCLUSIONS Urocortins 2 and 3 cause potent and prolonged arterial vasodilatation without tachyphylaxis. These vasomotor responses are at least partly mediated by endothelial nitric oxide and cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid. The role of urocortins 2 and 3 remains to be explored in the setting of human heart failure, but they have the potential to have major therapeutic benefits.

Social presence research studies the ways in which the presence of a conspecific affects processing, but has yet to be thoroughly applied to language processes. The principal aim of this study was to see how syntactic and semantic language processing might be subject to mere social presence effects by studying Event-Related brain Potentials (ERP). In a sentence correctness task, participants read sentences with a semantic or syntactic anomaly while being either alone or in the mere presence of a confederate. Compared to the alone condition, the presence condition was associated with an enhanced N400 component and a more centro-posterior LAN component (interpreted as an N400). The results seem to imply a boosting of heuristic language processing strategies, proper of lexico-semantic operations, which actually entails a shift in the strategy to process morphosyntactic violations, typically based on algorithmic or rule-based strategies. The effects cannot be related to increased arousal levels. The apparent enhancement of the activity in the precuneus while in presence of another person suggests that the effects conceivably relate to social cognitive and attentional factors. The present results suggest that understanding language comprehension would not be complete without considering the impact of social presence effects, inherent to the most natural and fundamental communicative scenarios.","Hinchcliffe, Clara; Jiménez-Ortega, Laura; Muñoz, Francisco; Hernández-Gutiérrez, David; Casado, Pilar; Sánchez-García, José; Martín-Loeches, Manuel",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,41,26

We hypothesized that the prognostic relevance of hypoproteinemia could be related to its association with impaired cardiovascular function and organ perfusion during transition. OBJECTIVES To describe the plasma protein status and the measures of cardiovascular function according to the outcome in infants <32 weeks' gestation. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight infants were prospectively included from birth to discharge. During the first 24 h of life, we assessed the cardiovascular function and systemic and organ blood flow by Doppler ultrasound, and monitored cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturation (cRSO2, rRSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy. These measures were analyzed in relationship to hypoproteinemia (total plasma protein level <40 g/L at 12 h of life) and severe adverse outcome (death or survival with severe neurological injury). RESULTS Hypoproteinemia was associated with a higher risk of a severe adverse outcome after adjustment of confounding variables (adjusted OR = 6.8; 95% CI 1.3-34). Compared to normoproteinemic infants and after adjustment for gestational age, hypoproteinemic ones had more significantly: hypotension (7 vs. 13%, p = 0.03), abnormal capillary refilling time (20 vs. 36%, p < 0.001), abnormal renal blood flow (resistive index 0.78 ± 0.11 vs. 0.85 ± 0.09, p = 0.04), lower rRSO2 (82.9 ± 9.2 vs. 73.6 ± 10.5%, p = 0.04), and lower systemic vascular resistance (0.155 ± 0.058 vs. 0.108 ± 0.037 mm Hg/L/kg; p = 0.04). The cRSO2 patterns were significantly decreased in infants with severe adverse outcome and independent from protein status. CONCLUSION Hypoproteinemia is associated with impaired cardiovascular function. Further studies are required to elucidate the interplay between changes in protein levels, postnatal hemodynamics and clinical outcome.","Bonsante, Francesco; Ramful, Duksha; Samperiz, Sylvain; Daniel, Sandrine; Godeluck, Anais; Robillard, Pierre-Yves; Jamal-Bey, Karim; Gouyon, Jean-Bernard; Binquet, Christine; Iacobelli, Silvia",Neonatology,41,1

The objective of this commentary was to develop a definition of client-led care in the Australian context and its key supporting principles for people living with HIV (PLHIV). METHODS The authors used two sources of evidence to support their HIV community experience with client-led care: (1) a scoping review of the literature, and (2) consultations with colleagues who were PLHIV advocates or HIV specialist physicians. The findings from the scoping review and consultations were summarised and the key principles of client-led care compared with those identified by the authors. RESULTS Seven articles met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis in the scoping review. Five PLHIV advocates and three HIV specialist physicians were consulted. Key principles supporting client-led care identified by the authors based on their experience centred around the themes of: (1) clients and healthcare providers working in partnership, (2) information and communication, (3) coordinating access to care, (4) building trust, and (5) respect for client's needs and preferences. The principles identified by the authors were supported by those of the scoping review and colleague consultations. CONCLUSIONS A client-led approach can complement conventional HIV care strategies and enable empowerment and greater engagement with care, potentially improving the care continuum and overall QoL for individuals living with HIV who can, and want to, lead their own care.","Crawford, David; Allan, Brent; Cogle, Aaron; Brown, Graham",HIV medicine,41,27

Vaccine hesitancy is a key driver of vaccine refusal and has been associated with vaccine preventable outbreaks. While parents seek information from many sources to inform their vaccine decision-making process, they continue to view their child's pediatric provider as a trusted source of vaccine information. The communication that occurs between a provider and parent with regards to vaccination is critical in reducing concerns and nudging parents toward vaccine acceptance. However, vaccine-hesitant parents raise issues in this encounter that many providers feel ill-equipped to answer, due to lack of training on evidence-based communication strategies. We focus on promising approaches related to patient-provider communication within the context of vaccination. We found empirical evidence that the use of a presumptive format to recommend vaccines, motivational interviewing, and tailoring information to increase message salience are approaches that can positively affect vaccine acceptance. As providers continue to serve as important influencers in the vaccine decision-making process, it is evident that there is a need to continue to identify evidence-based, and practically implementable approaches to mitigate parental vaccine hesitancy. Providers play a key role in improving coverage rates, and therefore it is paramount to seek ways to improve how providers communicate about vaccines.","Limaye, Rupali J; Opel, Douglas J; Dempsey, Amanda; Ellingson, Mallory; Spina, Christine; Omer, Saad B; Dudley, Matthew Z; Salmon, Daniel A; Leary, Sean O",Academic pediatrics,41,1

The objective of this project is to determine whether a recently developed slow-release formulation of bupivacaine was effective in reducing the experimental chronic postoperative pain. METHODS In male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g body weight), bupivacaine-releasing microspheres (MS-Bupi), containing 60 mg of bupivacaine base, were locally injected (MS-Bupi-L) 2 hours preoperatively into the subcutaneous compartment at the locus for experimental thoracotomy. Hypersensitivity to tactile stimulation was assessed by reductions in the threshold force required to induce a response to von Frey filaments (VFH) applied to the hairy back near the incision/retraction site. Pain behavior was assessed using a Qualitative Hyperalgesia Profile. Control groups included rats receiving the same dose of MS-Bupi but at a distant site on the back (MS-Bupi-D, testing for systemic drug actions) and rats receiving the same mass of microspheres with no drug (MS-Placebo) at the wound site. Rats were tested for 3 days before and 28 days (postoperative days [PODs]) after the procedure. Withdrawal threshold differences, which were the primary outcome measure, among all treatment groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, after which pairwise comparisons were made by determining Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds (WMWodds), with Bonferroni correction of the confidence intervals. RESULTS Microsphere bupivacaine released near the incision reduced the chronic tactile allodynia after thoracotomy. The threshold values during PODs 14 to 28 were different among the 3 treatment groups when examined on PODs 14, 16, 18, 23, 25, and 28 but not on POD21 (P = 0.0603). WMWodds showed that threshold of the MS-Bupi-L group differed from those of the MS-Bupi-D and the MS-Placebo groups for all the tested PODs, whereas the thresholds of the MS-Bupi-D group never differed from those of the MS-Placebo group. Area-under-curve analysis for threshold reductions below baseline, using WMWodds, also showed a reduction during the entire 28 PODs that was greater for the MS-Bupi-L group compared with the MS-Placebo or MS-Bupi-D group. The incidence of intense pain scores by the Qualitative Hyperalgesia Profile analysis was observed in 7 of 8 rats in the MS-Placebo group and in 5 of 8 rats in the MS-Bupi-L group. CONCLUSIONS Local slow release of bupivacaine subcutaneously from the MS-Bupi formulation suppresses postoperative mechanical hypersensitivity for ≥4 weeks after experimental thoracotomy. Systemic bupivacaine from this treatment has no effect on this hypersensitivity.","Strichartz, Gary R; Wang, Jeffrey Chi-Fei; Blaskovich, Phillip; Ohri, Rachit",Anesthesia and analgesia,41,19

METHODS This study involved 234 patients with 274 HCCs measuring ≤2 cm who had undergone RFA as the initial treatment. The mean tumor diameter was 1.478 cm. The median follow-up period was 829 days. We evaluated the post-RFA cumulative local recurrence rate and analyzed the risk factors contributing to clinical outcomes. RESULTS Cumulative local recurrence rates were 9, 19 and 19% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Among the 145 cases with a complete safety margin (SM) after RFA, only 4 developed local tumor recurrence and the cumulative rates of local tumor recurrence at 1, 2 and 3 years were 2, 3 and 3%, respectively. Among the 129 cases with incomplete SM, local tumor recurrence developed in 34 and the cumulative rates of local tumor progression at 1, 2 and 3 years were 14, 36 and 36%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, significant risk factors were tumor location (liver surface), irregular gross type and SM <5 mm. CONCLUSION Even with HCC measuring ≤2 cm, location and gross type of tumor should be carefully evaluated before RFA is performed.","Kono, Masashi; Inoue, Tatsuo; Kudo, Masatoshi; Chishina, Hirokazu; Arizumi, Tadaaki; Takita, Masahiro; Kitai, Satoshi; Yada, Norihisa; Hagiwara, Satoru; Minami, Yasunori; Ueshima, Kazuomi; Nishida, Naoshi; Murakami, Takamichi",Digestive diseases,41,23

Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L-1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable ('live'), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample.

Therefore, public health decision-makers necessitate appropriate support. METHODS Based on the analogy with business intelligence (BI) principles, the contextual analysis of the environment and available data resources, and conceptual modelling within systems and knowledge engineering, this paper proposes a general framework for computer-based decision support in the case of a biological incident. At the outset, the analysis of potential inputs to the framework is conducted and several resources such as demographic information, strategic documents, environmental characteristics, agent descriptors and surveillance systems are considered. RESULTS Consequently, three prototypes were developed, tested and evaluated by a group of experts. Their selection was based on the overall framework scheme.

Forearm glucose uptake (FGU) in response to glucose feeding was determined in healthy men before and during 72 hrs of forearm IMM, and the same measurements were made in the non-IMM contralateral limb at baseline and 72 hrs. In a similar study design, FGU and forearm lipid uptake were determined after a high fat mixed-meal (HFMM) in IMM and non-IMM limbs. FGU was reduced by 38%, 57% and 46% following 24, 48 and 72 hrs IMM, respectively, but unchanged in the non-IMM limb. A similar FGU response to IMM was observed after a HFMM, and forearm lipid uptake was unchanged. A sizeable reduction in FGU occurs in just 24 hrs of IMM that is sustained thereafter and specific to the IMM limb, making unloading per se the likely rapid driver of dysregulation. ABSTRACT The trajectory and magnitude of metabolic perturbations caused by muscle disuse are unknown yet central to understanding the mechanistic basis of immobilisation-associated metabolic dysregulation. To address this gap, forearm glucose uptake (FGU) was determined in 10 healthy men (age 24.9±0.6 yrs, weight 71.9±2.6 kg, BMI 22.6±0.6kg/m2 ) during a 180 min oral glucose challenge before (0) and after 24, 48 and 72 hrs of arm immobilisation, and before and after 72 hrs in the contralateral non-immobilised arm (Study A). FGU was decreased from baseline at 24 (38%; P = 0.04), 48 (57%; P = 0.01) and 72 (46%; P = 0.06) hrs immobilisation, and was also 63% less than the non-immobilised limb at 72 hrs (P = 0.002). In a second study, FGU and forearm lipid uptake was determined in 9 healthy men (age 22.4±1.3 years, weight 71.4±2.8 kg, BMI 22.6±0.8kg/m2 ) during a 420 min mixed-meal challenge before (0) and after 24 and 48 hrs of arm immobilisation and before and after 72 hrs in the contralateral non-immobilised arm (Study B). FGU responses were similar to Study A, and forearm lipid uptake was unchanged from pre-immobilisation in both arms over the study. A sizeable decrement in FGU in response to glucose feeding occurred within 24 hrs of immobilisation, which was sustained and specific to the immobilised limb. Increasing lipid availability had no additional impact on the rate or magnitude of these responses or lipid uptake. These findings highlight a lack of muscle contraction per se as a fast-acting physiological insult to FGU. This article is protected by copyright.

Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. METHODS We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. FINDINGS Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4-40·7) to 50·3% (50·0-50·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46·3% (95% UI 46·1-46·5) in 2017, compared with 28·7% (28·5-29·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88·6% (95% UI 87·2-89·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76·1% (95% UI 71·6-80·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53·9% (50·6-59·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. INTERPRETATION Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

Leuprolide acetate is a gonadotropin analogue commonly used for hormone-sensitive conditions such as prostate cancer and endometriosis. This repurposed drug demonstrated efficacy in a previous Phase II clinical trial in those women with AD who also received a stable dose of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Bowen et al., 2015). Basic biological, epidemiological and clinical trial data suggest leuprolide acetate mediates improvement and stabilization of neuropathology and cognitive performance via the modulation of gonadotropin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling. LUCINDA will enroll 150 women with mild-moderate AD who are receiving a stable dose of donepezil from three study sites in the United States. Cognition and function are the primary outcome measures as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Blood and MRI biomarkers are also measured to assess hormonal, inflammatory and AD biomarker changes. We present the protocol for LUCINDA and discuss trial innovations and challenges including changes necessitated by the covid-19 pandemic and study drug procurement issues.","Butler, Tracy; Goldberg, Judith D; Galvin, James E; Maloney, Thomas; Ravdin, Lisa; Glodzik, Lidia; de Leon, Mony J; Hochman, Tsivia; Bowen, Richard L; Atwood, Craig S",Contemporary clinical trials,41,33

However, it is unclear whether the number and type of vascular lesions or the number of ablation points could affect blood pressure (BP) reduction. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of vascular injury induced by RDN detected with OCT and the number of ablation points on BP response after 1, 3 and 6 months. METHODS RDN was either performed with a Simplicity catheter or an EnligHTNTM multielectrode basket followed by OCT. BP was recorded prospectively as office measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM) at each time point. Correlations between type and number of vascular lesions, as well as ablation points, on BP reduction were performed. RESULTS Out of 16 patients, two were lost to BP follow-up. We documented a BP reduction at 1, 3 and 6 months in both office and 24-h ABPM. The Δmean office systolic BP (SBP) reduction was -18.75 ± 24.55 mm Hg, -20.58 ± 16.92 mm Hg and -18.75 ± 29.39 mm Hg, respectively, and the Δmean 24h-ABPM SBP reduction was -6.50 ± 23.45 mm Hg, -16.88 ± 26.64 mm Hg and -13.89 ± 21.20 mm Hg, respectively. The number of vascular lesions did not correlate with office and 24h-SBP and diastolic BP reduction. However, there was a correlation between ablation points and office Δmean SBP reduction at 6 months (p <0.02). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates for the first time that the number and type of vascular lesions as assessed with OCT did not predict the success of BP reduction after RDN. However, we observed a substantial decrease in office SBP in relation to the number of ablation points at 6 months.","Ghadri, Jelena-Rima; Gaehwiler, Roman; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Sudano, Isabella; Osipova, Julia; Schoenenberger-Berzins, Renate; Erne, Paul; Lüscher, Thomas F; Templin, Christian",Swiss medical weekly,41,12

Experimental optimization is often time-consuming and inefficient due to the complexity of continuous processes. In this study, a model-based approach was investigated to improve process development of twin-column continuous capture with Protein A affinity resin MabSelect PrismA. Breakthrough curves under various conditions, productivity and capacity utilization (CU) of the continuous processes under varying operating conditions were predicted. Effects of three key operating parameters (feed concentration (c0), interconnected feed residence time (RT) and breakthrough percentage control of the first column during interconnected feeding (s)) on the productivity and CU were evaluated. A recommended working window can be determined directly from contour maps to balance the trade-off between productivity and CU. The model-optimized operating conditions at varying feed concentrations were verified by experiments, which indicated that the model-based approach was feasible and reliable. The results showed that the suitable RT was 1~2 min and suitable s was 0.6~0.75 for the continuous IgG capture with MabSelect PrismA. The maximum productivity varied from 14 to 47 g/L/h with the feed IgG concentrations at the range of 1 to 10 mg/mL. The results indicated that model-based approach could assist process development efficiently and promote target-orientated process design for continuous processes.","Sun, Yan-Na; Shi, Ce; Zhang, Qi-Lei; Yao, Shan-Jing; Slater, Nigel K H; Lin, Dong-Qiang",Journal of chromatography.

Children's activity in this setting is critical to meeting daily physical activity recommendations. Guidelines are evidence-based statements intended to optimise practice. This study aimed to identify guidelines used in Outside School Hours Care for physical activity and screen time and summarise their content and methods of development. METHODS Outside School Hours Care guidelines for children aged 5 to 12 years were identified by systematically searching Medline, Emcare, Embase, Scopus, ERIC, Sportsdiscus, TROVE, ProQuest, UpToDate, NICE, SIGN and Google in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search was conducted in March 2019 and results screened independently by two authors. Data were synthesized narratively. RESULTS Nine guideline documents were identified from grey literature only (n = 8 USA, n = 1 Canada). The included guidelines focused predominantly on the after school care period (n = 9 vs n = 2 for the before school period). All had recommendations for physical activity, whilst 7 included screen time recommendations. There was considerable variability across the physical activity and screen time recommendations, though taken together, they recommended 30-60 min of moderate- to- vigorous physical activity and less than 60 min of recreational screen time per session. All guidelines were developed by expert/stakeholder panels, but none followed rigorous guideline development methods. CONCLUSIONS Limited published guidelines for physical activity and screen time in Outside School Hours Care exist. There is a variation in duration and intensity of physical activity recommended, whilst screen time recommendations are more consistent. Guidelines designed with rigorous tools and for other world regions are warranted.","Virgara, Rosa; Lewis, Lucy; Phillips, Anna; Richardson, Mandy; Maher, Carol",BMC pediatrics,41,1

Biomechanical data indicate high variability in fixation stability across different devices. This study aims to provide a better insight into measuring the structural characteristics and mechanical behavior of ACL implant fixations. Fourteen human tibial specimens with reconstructed ACLs were subjected to progressively increasing dynamic loading until failure. The motions of the tibia, the proximal and distal graft ends, as well as the testing frame and actuator, were continuously recorded via a motion tracking system. Significantly higher displacements of the machine actuator (1.0 mm at graft slippage onset, and 12.2 mm at ultimate load) were measured compared to the displacements of the proximal (0.8 and 4.3 mm, respectively) and distal graft (0.1 and 3.4 mm, respectively) ends. The displacements measured at different sites showed significant correlations. The provided data suggest significant and systematic inaccuracies in the stiffness and slippage of the fixation when using machine displacement, as commonly reported in the literature. The assessment of the distal graft displacement excludes the artifactual graft elongation, and most accurately reflects the graft slippage onset indicating clinical failure. Considering the high displacement at the ultimate load, the ultimate load could be used as a standardized variable to compare different fixation methods. However, the ultimate load alone is not sufficient to qualitatively describe fixation stability.","Benca, Emir; Zderic, Ivan; Caspar, Jan; Knegsel, Kenneth van; Hirtler, Lena; Gueorguiev, Boyko; Widhalm, Harald; Windhager, Reinhard; Varga, Peter",Sensors,41,1

One critique of COVID-19 HCTs is their distinct paucity of information on crucial population groups. For safety reasons, these HCTs will exclude candidate participants of advanced age or with comorbidities that worsen COVID-19, yet a vaccine should (perhaps especially) protect such populations. We turn this cliché on its head. The truth is that either an HCT or a field trial has intrinsic generalisability limitations, that an HCT can expedite protection of high-risk participants even without challenging them with the virus, and that an important route to obtaining results generalisable to high-risk groups under either strategy is facilitated by HCTs.","Eyal, Nir; Gerhard, Tobias",Journal of medical ethics,41,7

Post-acute care use and hospital readmission appear to be common after critical illness. It is unknown whether specialty critical care units have different readmission rates and what these trends have been over time. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, a cohort of 53,539 medical/surgical patients who were treated in a critical care unit during their index admission were compared with 209,686 patients who were not treated in a critical care unit. The primary outcome was 30-day all cause hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes included post-acute care resource use and immediate readmission, defined as within 7 days of discharge. RESULTS Compared to patients discharged after an index hospitalization without critical illness, surviving patients following ICU admission were not more likely to be rehospitalized within 30 days (15.8 vs. 16.1%, p = 0.08). However, they were more likely to receive post-acute care services (45.3% vs. 70.9%, p < 0.001) as well as be rehospitalized within 7 days (5.2 vs. 6.0%, p < 0.001). Post-acute care use and 30-day readmission rates varied by ICU type, the latter ranging from 11.7% after admission in a cardiothoracic critical care unit to 23.1% after admission in a medical critical care unit. 30-day readmission after ICU admission did not decline between 2010 and 2015 (p = 0.38). Readmission rates declined over time for 2 of 4 targeted conditions (heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but only when the hospitalization did not include ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS Rehospitalization for survivors following ICU admission is common across all specialty critical care units. Post-acute care use is also common for this population of patients. Overall trends for readmission rates after critical illness did not change over time, and readmission reductions for targeted conditions were limited to hospitalizations that did not include an ICU admission.","Chesley, Christopher F; Harhay, Michael O; Small, Dylan S; Hanish, Asaf; Prescott, Hallie C; Mikkelsen, Mark E",Journal of intensive care medicine,41,1

We modeled facemasks for the campus population at varying proportions of mask use and effectiveness, and Hyflex model of partial online learning with reduction of people on campus. Results: Facemasks can substantially reduce cases and deaths, even with modest effectiveness. Even 20% uptake of masks will halve the epidemic size. Facemasks combined with Hyflex reduces epidemic size even more. Conclusions: Universal use of face masks and reducing the number of people on campus may allow safer universities reopening.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Bian, Linkan; Bethel, Cindy",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,41,1

This is a secondary cohort analysis of the DEFUSE 3 data assessing potential predictive variables for mortality in the EVT-treated patients. METHODS The primary outcome was death within 90 days. Patients who died and those who did not were compared statistically. We developed a predictive score using preprocedural variables that were statistically predictive of death in univariate regression analysis (P<0.1). RESULTS Of the 182 patients in the DEFUSE 3 study, 92 (mean age 69 years; 50% male) met our inclusion criteria, and 15.2% of these patients met the primary outcome. Patient age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, wake-up stroke, statin use, and history of diabetes were statistically associated with death. Statin use did not improve the prediction score so was excluded. Thus, our model included four predictors, with one point each given for age >75 years, NIHSS ≥20, wake-up stroke, and diabetes, yielding low (0-1), moderate (2), and high (3-4) risk of death. In the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories, 2/52 (3.9%), 3/23 (13.0%), and 9/17 (52.9%) of patients died, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Despite selective inclusion criteria and overwhelming benefit for EVT, a substantial number of EVT patients in DEFUSE 3 died. The preprocedural variables age, NIHSS, wake-up stroke, and diabetes may predict this risk. Our predictive score provides a basis for future research to determine which factors influence lethal outcome after EVT.","Taussky, Philipp; Agnoletto, Guilherme; Grandhi, Ramesh; Alexander, Matthew D; Wong, Ka-Ho; Albers, Gregory W; de Havenon, Adam",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,41,31

The waste biomass as alternates solved the problems of high price and nonrenewable of traditional raw materials. The waste Zanthoxylum bungeanum branches were firstly selected as raw materials to prepare activated carbons. Interestingly, the pore structure and surface chemistry can be successfully controlled by adjusting the heating rate. The hierarchical porous carbons exhibited great potential for toluene adsorption. The micro-mesopore structure possessed unique spatial effect; micropores played a dominant role in adsorption process, especially narrow micropores (pore size ≤ 1.0 nm) emerged stronger adsorptive force toward toluene molecules due to overlapping attractive forces from neighboring pore walls. And mesopores not only displayed excellent transport diffusion but also provided adsorption sites. Additionally, the high graphitization degree enhanced the interaction between graphene layer equipped electron-rich regions and π-electrons on the aromatic ring by the π-π conjugated effect. The hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups served as chemisorption sites and led to higher adsorption amounts. Fortunately, the regeneration can be achieved by thermal treatment at the low temperature (≤ 150 °C) or even gas purging at room temperature (20 °C), which avoided an explosion accident in the process of high-temperature regeneration.","Lei, Bingman; Xie, Hongmei; Chen, Shengming; Liu, Biyan; Zhou, Guilin",Environmental science and pollution research international,41,19

We similarly use a dimensionality reduction technique, the locally linear embedding to map the high dimension of the data set into a low dimensional embedding parameter space, while keeping the local geometry and the similarities of the neighbouring data points. After three consecutive steps, we assign one parameter to each binary star, which well scales with the""detachness"", i.e. the sum of the relative radii of the components. This value is in good agreement with the morphology types listed in the OGLE catalog and, along with the orbital periods, can be used to filter any morphological sub-types based on the similarity of light curves. Our open-source pipeline can be applied in a fully automatic way to any other large data set to classify binary stars.","B'odi, Attila; Hajdu, Tam'as",,41,1

However, many hospitals in low- and middle-income countries may not have access to central lines and the vasoactive medications are frequently given through a peripheral venous access. Aim: The aim of our study was to estimate the safety of peripheral vasoactive inotropes in children. Methods: Children requiring peripheral vasoactive medications were included in this study. We retrospectively collected data at two time points on use and complications of peripheral vasoactive medications. Results: Eighty-four children (51 pre-COVID era and 33 COVID pandemic) received peripheral vasoactive medications. Only 3% of children (3/84) developed extravasation injury, all of whom recovered completely. Conclusions: Results from our study suggest that extravasation injury due to peripheral inotrope infusion is very low (3%) and it can be safely administered in children at a diluted concentration.","Mooli, R.

Current estimates are mainly based on the fraction of positive samples or the total number of positive samples. However, both methods are biased and sensitive to the sampling depth. We here propose an alternative method to use the attributes of each sample to estimate the change in the total number of positive patients in the total population. We present a Bayesian estimator assuming a combination of condition and time-dependent probability of being positive, and mixed implicit-explicit solution for the probability of a person with conditions i at time t of being positive. We use this estimate to predict the total probability of being positive at a given day t. We show that these estimate results are smooth and not sensitive to the properties of the samples. Moreover, these results are a better predictor of future mortality.","shtossel, o.; louzoun, y.",,41,1

A cancer simulation model can help integrate new knowledge to inform clinical and policy decisions. OncoSim-Breast is a breast cancer simulation model. This paper aims to describe the key assumptions in the OncoSim-Breast model and how well it reproduces more recent breast cancer trends and the observed effects in a randomized screening trial. Methods: The OncoSim-Breast model simulates the onset, growth and spread of invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ tumours. The model combines Canadian cancer incidence, mortality, screening program and cost data to project population-level outcomes. Users can change the model input to answer specific policy questions. Here we report three validation exercises. First, we compared the model's projected breast cancer incidence and stage distributions with the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry. Second, we compared OncoSim's projected breast cancer mortality with Vital Statistics. Third, we replicated the UK Age trial to compare the model's projections with the trial's observed screening effects. Results: OncoSim-Breast's projected incidence, mortality and stage distribution of breast cancer were close to the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry and the Vital Statistics. OncoSim-Breast also reproduced the breast cancer screening effects observed in the UK Age trial. Interpretation: OncoSim-Breast's ability to reproduce the observed population-level breast cancer trends and the screening effects in a randomized trial increases the confidence of using its results to inform policy decisions related to early detection of breast cancer.","Yong, J.

Positive and negative effects are extremely important in individual's life experiences and in particular in the context of the quarantine, in which it is important to maintain the balance between favorable and unfavorable situations. The purpose of this paper is to study in depth the intensity of the affect during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal and to validate a scale of positive and negative affect in the context of quarantine and confinement. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used is of a quantitative nature, based on a questionnaire survey to measure the intensity of the affects and to analyze some sociodemographic variables. The sample consists of 726 individuals of age 18 years or older, who were in Portugal during the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The results show that respondents were concerned, anxious, well-disposed and impatient. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis applied to affects produced a latent structure with two factors: negative affect and positive affect. The affect scale has adequate convergent and discriminant validity and good internal consistency, with negative affect being experienced by individuals with greater intensity compared to positive affect. Originality/value: It is hoped that this study contributes to an increase in the scientific knowledge in the field of the affects in the context of delicate situations such as the pandemic COVID-19 so that health professionals can intervene to improve individual’s well-being. This is an important way to provide better health policy that considers in more depth individual wellbeing and emotions during times of crisis. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also stated that highlight the importance of understanding emotional states of individuals during crisis events. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Santos, E.; Ratten, V.; Diogo, A.; Tavares, F.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,41,5

This paper aims to explore perceived social support and loneliness and factor associations during the Covid-19 pandemic in a sample of individuals with severe mental ill health. Design/methodology/approach We sampled an already existing cohort of people with severe mental ill health. Researchers contacted participants by phone or by post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic restrictions had impacted health, Covid-19 experiences, perceived social support, employment and loneliness. Loneliness was measured by the three item UCLA loneliness scale. Findings In the pandemic sub-cohort, 367 adults with a severe mental ill health diagnosis completed a remote survey. 29-34% of participants reported being lonely. Loneliness was associated with being younger in age (adjusted OR = -.98, p = .02), living alone (adjusted OR = 2.04, p = .01), high levels of social and economic deprivation (adjusted OR = 2.49, p = .04), and lower perceived social support (B = -5.86, p < .001). Living alone was associated with lower perceived social support. Being lonely was associated with a self-reported deterioration in mental health during the pandemic (adjusted OR = 3.46, 95%CI 2.03-5.91). Practical implications Intervention strategies to tackle loneliness in the severe mental ill health population are needed. Further research is needed to follow-up the severe mental ill health population after pandemic restrictions are lifted to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends. Originality Loneliness was a substantial problem for the severe mental ill health population before the Covid-19 pandemic but there is limited evidence to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends during the pandemic.","Heron, P.

Endothelial dysfunction may be associated with lung involvement. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an indirect marker of endothelial dysfunction. The aim of our study was to evaluate ADMA concentrations and to identify its association with lung involvement in patients with COVID-19 disease. Methods: We included 42 patients with COVID-19 infection and lung involvement (Group 1). Forty-two age and sex matched patients without pneumonia acted as the control group (Group 2). All patients gave blood samples for ADMA at the 1st month control visit after discharge. We compared C-reactive protein (CRP) and ADMA concentrations in addition to routine biochemical parameters between groups. Results: Patients with lung involvement had higher admission glucose, CRP, and ADMA concentrations, and displayed lower hemoglobin concentration and lymphocyte count compared to patients without lung involvement. Although patients with lung involvement had higher ADMA concentrations with respect to those without;plasma ADMA levels were also higher than normal values in control group. Multivariate analysis identified log CRP concentration (OR= 3.047, 95% CI=1.881-5.023, p<0.001) as the independent predictor for lung involvement.

However, testing for COVID-19 is far from optimal, and behavioural barriers are unknown. Study 1 aimed to identify the range of barriers to testing. Study 2 aimed to estimate prevalence in a nationally relevant sample to target interventions. Methods: Study 1: National longitudinal COVID-19 survey from April-November 2020. Testing barriers were included in the June survey (n=1369). Open responses were coded using the COM-B framework (capability-opportunity-motivation). Study 2: Barriers from Study 1 were presented to a new nationally representative sample in November to estimate prevalence (n=2869). Barrier prevalence was analysed by health literacy level using Chi square tests. Results: Study 1: 49% strongly agreed to get tested for symptoms, and 69% would self-isolate. Concern about pain was the top barrier from a provided list (11%), but 32 additional barriers were identified from open responses and coded to the COM-B framework. Study 2: The most prevalent barriers were motivation issues (e.g. don't believe symptoms are COVID-19: 28%, few local cases: 18%). Capability issues were also common (e.g. not sure symptoms are bad enough: 19%, not sure whether symptoms need testing: 15%). Many barriers were more prevalent amongst people with low compared to high health literacy, including motivation (preference to self isolate: 21% vs 12%, pain: 15% vs 9%) and capability (not sure symptom needs testing: 12% vs 8%, not sure how to test:11% vs 4%). Conclusion: Even in a health system with free and widespread access to COVID-19 testing, motivation and capability barriers were prevalent issues, particularly for people with lower health literacy. This study highlights the important of diagnosing behaviour barriers to target public health interventions for COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Bonner, C.; Batcup, C.; Ayre, J.; Pickles, K.; Cvejic, E.; Copp, T.; Cornell, S.; Dodd, R.; Isautier, J.; Nickel, B.; McCaffery, K.

International studies have demonstrated that troponin is an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients but to our knowledge this has not been assessed in a UK hospitalised population. We performed a single-centre retrospective observational study investigating the association between troponin positivity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and increased mortality in the short term. Methods All adults admitted with swab-proven RT-PCR COVID-19 to Homerton University Hospital (HUH) from 04.02.20 to 30.04.20 were eligible for inclusion. We retrospectively analysed data collected from the physical and electronic patient records (EPR) including demographic and biochemical data (e.g. serum high sensitivity Troponin I). Data was analysed according to the primary outcome of death at 28 days during hospital admission. Troponin positivity was defined above the upper limit of normal according to our local laboratory assay (&gt;15.5ng/l for females, &gt;34 ng/l for males). Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the link between troponin positivity and death. Results The total number of adults with swab-proven RT-PCR COVID-19 to HUH from the date of the first positive swab to 30th April 2020 was 402. Mean length of stay for all patients was 9.1 days(SD 12.0). Table 1 shows selected demographics. This is a highly comorbid population with modest ethnic minority representation. Mean age was 65.3 years for men compared to 63.8 years for women. In those with a positive initial troponin, there was a high burden of mortality at 28 days post-admission. Mortality in troponin positive and negative patients is shown in table 2. A chi-squared test showed that survival of COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in those with a negative troponin (p = 3.23 x10-10) compared to those with a positive troponin. A Mann Whitney U test showed that initial troponin was significantly higher in those who died (p = 2.24 x10-12) compared to those who were alive. Mean initial troponin was 89.8 (95% CI 43.1 - 136.5). In the multivariate logistical regression, lung disease, age, troponin positivity and CPAP were all significantly associated with death, with an AUC of 0.8872, sensitivity of 0.9004 and specificity of 0.6292 for the model. Within this model, troponin positivity was independently associated with short term mortality (OR 3.23 , 95% CI 1.53-7.16, p=0.00278). Conclusions We demonstrated an independent association between troponin positivity and increased short-term mortality in COVID-19 in a London district general hospital. The mechanisms implicated in myocardial injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood but are likely multi-factorial.","Shyam-Sundar, V.; Stein, D.; Spazzapan, M.; Sullivan, A.; Qin, C.; Voon, V.",Heart,41,24

A qualitative study,15.300301,10.669107,2021-08-05,"Objectives - To investigate: (1) whether vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since Delta became the predominant variant; (2) whether efficacy wanes with time since second dose. Design - Matched case-control study. Setting - Population of Scotland from 1 December 2020 to 19 August 2021. Main outcome measure - Severe COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Results - Efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May 2021 coinciding with the replacement of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) by the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the next month. In the most recent time window, the efficacy of two doses against severe COVID-19 was 91% (95 percent CI 86% to 95%) for the AstraZeneca product and 92% (95 percent CI 85% to 95%) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) products. Against the broader category of hospitalised or fatal COVID-19, efficacy in this time window was slightly lower: 88% (95 percent CI 85% to 90%) for the AstraZeneca product, 91% (95 percent CI 88% to 93%) for mRNA vaccines. Efficacy against COVID-19 declined rapidly in the first two months since second dose but more slowly thereafter. For hospitalised or fatal COVID-19 the model best supported by the data was one in which efficacy was the sum of a rapidly waning effect with half-life of 17 (95% CI 9 to 39) days and a time-invariant efficacy of 83%. Conclusions - These results are reassuring with respect to concerns that efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the Delta variant became predominant. Although there is considerable uncertainty attached to any extrapolation into the future, these results suggest that the rapid early waning of efficacy against hospitalised COVID-19 after the second dose tapers off within a few months. This weakens the rationale for policies based on delivering booster doses to the entire population, rather than to vulnerable individuals for focused protection.","McKeigue, P.

Although the overall rate of PhACs extraction from hospital wastewater (HWW) through different secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been high equal to 79–99%, activity and proliferation of neurotransmitters are inhibited by antiseptics due to the low removal rate of some elements, such as naproxen, excellent-performance technologies are still needed. Venlafaxine and citalopram are the most used antidepressants associated with 10–12% removal value through WWTPs. While HWW contains various types of antibiotics, they improve biocides’ bacterial tolerance against treatment. Ozonation is one of the methods to enhance biodegradability, whereas biofilm reactors have effectively removed emerging contaminants (ECs). Combined activate sludge (CAS) and membrane filtration bioreactors will potently exclude compounds, but previous studies show that membrane filtration bioreactors are around 30%-55% more efficient. ECs elimination in tertiary treatment has shown its great ability rather than conventional treatment sectors. Moreover, ozone treatment can decrease in PPCPs value as 90–98% through activated carbon beds. Activated carbon (NAC) has shown its full capability for micropollutants removal from PAC and membrane bioreactors as well as PPCP reside removal from treated effluents. The ratio of infect COVID-19 in one area was directly proportional, as revealed by SARS-CoV-2 detection in both HWW and wastewater in almost all countries.

The use of lateral flow serology can provide a clinically convenient approach for the assessment of prior infection with Covid-19. However, its widespread adoption in organisations seeking to use it to test for workforce immunity is controversial and confusing. This paper aims to explore the paradoxical dilemmas and dialectics immunity workforce testing creates.Design/methodology/approachThis study involved capturing the ethnographical participation of a chief executive officer (CEO) dealing with the experience of managing the outcomes of Covid-19 workforce immunity testing. The aim was to take a snapshot in time of the CEO's empirical world, capturing their lived experiences to explore how management actions resulting from Covid-19 immunity testing can played out.FindingsProviding staff with immunity tests at first glance appears sensible, decent and a caring action to take. Nevertheless, once such knowledge is personalised by employees, they can, through dialectic dialogue, feel disadvantaged and harbour feelings of unfairness. Subsequently, this paper suggests that immunity testing may only serve to raise awareness and deepen the original management dilemma of whether testing is a worthwhile activity.Originality/valueThis paper aims to be amongst the first works to empirically explore the workforce management challenges that arise within small businesses within the service sector following the completion of Covid-19 immunity testing of their staff.

Polyflake is a composite of c-glass flakes and high-performance modified resin that can substantially protect ferrous and non-ferrous surfaces. In the repair and reclamation of defective or damaged metal structures by deposition of engineering materials, thermal spray techniques using metals or ceramics are commonly favored over their counterparts due to their versatility of the type of deposition material utilized. However, a simpler and more economical approach is polyflake material deposition. In this study, a full factorial design of experiment is used to characterize the main effects of three materials and techniques used for deposition: c-glass high temperature resin polyflake, 303 stainless steel metallization, and aluminum oxide ceramic deposition repair. The experiments were used to evaluate the mechanical properties and performance of the repaired 1045 steel shafts. In addition, environmental impact assessment was conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of the three repair techniques implemented. The experimental results show that repair material and technique have significant effect on the hardness of the repaired components and their abrasion resistance properties. Upon completion of 75 hours of simulated service operation of the repaired shafts, aluminum oxide ceramic coating repair showed dominance in overall quality characteristics; however, it had highest cost demands and higher energy footprint.","Enemuoh, Emmanuel U.; Ahmad, Nabeel",Procedia Manufacturing,41,1

Clearly, today's educators need to do more to be able to play their roles in meaningful ways without affecting knowledge delivery and satisfaction for students and to themselves. This means that as researchers we must develop our capabilities and join those with skills and experience that we lack to learn. This paper will report on the voices of educators at various level on the critical issues and challenges they face and how and what measures were taken to address them. A preliminary survey was carried out to find out from teachers and lecturers in several institutions globally and their narratives are reported thematically.

Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) are now routinely given to older patients. The impact of performance status (PS) and age on the immune response remains unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most older patients elected to continue their cancer therapy. Meta-analysis from trial data thus far has not demonstrated any association with cancer immunotherapy survival. This abstract reports on real -world experience of older patients with melanoma treated during the global pandemic. Methods: Real world data of all patients over 70 years of age receiving IO for melanoma, was collated at a tertiary cancer centre from Oct 2019 - Dec 2020. The objective was to see how these older patients tolerated CPI, in both the adjuvant and palliative settings, during a global pandemic. Information on demographics including age at diagnosis, intention, sites of metastases, PS, co-morbidities, toxicity, impact of COVID-19 and the patient outcomes were collected. During the pandemic the majority of patients on CPI treatment were assessed and followed up by telephone call rather than face to face. Results: Fifty-six patients over 70 years,were identified to have received CPI during the time period. There were 36 male and 22 female patients. Median age was 74 (range 70-88 years). Sixteen patients (29%) were treated with adjuvant intent;the remaining 40 patients (71%) were treated with palliative intent. Most patients with metastatic disease had 1-3 sites. All patients were PS0-1, except for one patient who was PS2. There were 19 patients (34%) who developed significant grade toxicities. No patients were treated on a clinical trial during the pandemic. Three patients (5%) elected to stop treatment during the pandemic. Calls to triage were taken as normal and the majority of patients had toxicity managed as an outpatient. No patients received the vaccine by the end of the study period. Conclusions: Real-world data explored the use of CPI in older patients and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their management. Older patients were able to continue on CPI during the pandemic and it was given safely in adjuvant and palliative settings. Comprehensive geriatric assessments are planned to be integrated however the current demands on medical colleagues has delayed the introduction. However clinicians working in partnership with patients ensured the safe delivery and no patients died from toxicity of therapy or COVID-19 during this time. These findings suggest that shared decision-making during a pandemic with older patients is essential to support patients and optimise outcomes. We suggest cancer therapies should not be restricted to patients based on age and IO can be given safely if precautions are taken during a global pandemic. Patients have now received first COVID-19 vaccinations and ongoing assessement of the impact of the vaccination is in progress.","Jorde, F.; Taylor, H.; Lipinski, L.; Herbert, C.; Ball, J.; Winter, H.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,41,5

Therefore, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the incidence of liver injury among published literature from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03 to provide an outline for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19. Four databases including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Scopus were searched for studies published from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03. Data analysis and drawing of charts were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2.2 (Biostat, USA). The search yielded 450 publications, of which 64 potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review and 21 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria remained. A total of 4191 COVID-19 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of liver injury was 19.5% (95% CI: 14.3-26.1). According to our results, there was significant heterogeneity among the 19 studies (X2 = 738.5; p < 0.001; I2 = 94.34%). Among 288 death cases, the pooled prevalence of liver injury was 22.8% (95% CI: 11.7-39.8). In summary, the COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases and even may lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. The results of this systematic review highlight the importance of liver injury that may assist clinicians anywhere in the globe in controlling COVID-19-related infection and complications. Moreover, the prevalence of liver injury can be higher in severe cases than in mild cases.","Samidoust, Pirouz; Samidoust, Aryan; Samadani, Ali Akbar; Khoshdoz, Sara",Le infezioni in medicina,41,28

Here, the genome of the pathogenic North American PRRSV isolate 16244B has been sequenced and compared with LV. The genomic organization of 16244B was the same as LV but with only 63.4% nucleotide identity. The 189 nucleotide 5' non-coding region (NCR) of 16244B was distinct from the LV NCR, with good conservation (83%) only over a 43 base region immediately upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Major differences were found in the region encoding the non-structural part of the ORF1a polyprotein, which shared only 47% amino acid identity over 2503 residues of the six non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded. Nsp2, thought to have a species-specific function, showed the greatest divergence, sharing only 32% amino acid identity with LV and containing 120 additional amino acids in the central region. Nsps encoded by the 5'-proximal and central regions of ORF1b had from 66 to 75% amino acid identity; however, the carboxy-terminal protein CP4 was distinct (42% identity). The ORF 1a-1b frameshift region of 16244B had 98% nucleotide identity with LV. Consistent with previous reports for North American isolates, the six structural proteins encoded were 58 to 79% identical to LV proteins. The 3' NCR (150 nucleotides) was 76% identical between isolates. These genomic differences confirm the presence of distinct North American and European PRRSV genotypes.","Allende, R; Lewis, T L; Lu, Z; Rock, D L; Kutish, G F; Ali, A; Doster, A R; Osorio, F A",The Journal of general virology,41,33

Cancer patients are considered a highly susceptible group. The effect of this pandemic on cancer mortality is still unknown. AIM Our aim is to know whether or not we need to postpone cancer treatment during viral pandemics in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective observational study from March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020, included cancer patients on active treatment, who have been admitted to our oncology center through the emergency unit, and patients who received oncology treatment in the outpatient treatment unit. COVID-19 positive cases were identified based on polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS A total of 1300 patients was included in the study, 1096 patients attended the outpatient clinics, 204 patients were admitted to our oncology floor for emergency care. The cancer diagnosis was mainly breast cancer, followed by colon cancer. The main cause of emergency room visit was mainly fever followed by pain. Admission diagnosis was mainly disease progression followed by symptom control, COVID-19 infection, and febrile neutropenia. 1288 cycles of anticancer therapy were provided to 513 patients in the outpatient treatment unit. Three out of the nineteen patients who had a confirmed COVID-19 infection (16%) died not only due to infection, but also disease progression. CONCLUSION Cancer treatment is not a risk factor for COVID-19 infection or its complications. Cancer treatment should not be interrupted during viral pandemics and every effort should be made to give cancer patients the standard of care.","Elemam, O; Tashkandi, E; Abdelkhalek, S; Shalaby, I; Baraka, R",Experimental oncology,41,20

Both DNA and RNA viruses encode multifunctional proteins that interact with and modify host cell proteins. While viral genomes were the first complete sequences known, the corresponding proteomes are only now elucidated, with some surprising results. Even more daunting is the task to globally monitor the impact of viral infection on the proteome of the host cell and many technical hurdles must still be overcome in order to facilitate robust and reproducible measurements. Further complicating the picture is the dynamic nature of proteins, including post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage and activation or destruction by proteolytic events. Nevertheless, several promising studies have been published using high-throughput methods directly measuring protein abundance. Particularly, quantitative or semiquantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis of viral and cellular proteomes are now being used to characterize viruses and their host interaction. In addition, the full set of interactions between viral and host proteins, the interactome, is beginning to emerge, with often unexpected interactions that need to be carefully validated. In this review, we will discuss two major areas of viral proteomics: first, virion proteomics (such as the protein characterization of viral particles) and second, proteoviromics, including the viral protein interactomics and the quantitative analysis of host cell proteome during viral infection.","Viswanathan, Kasinath; Früh, Klaus",Expert review of proteomics,41,28

In the present study, the interaction of tone and intonation in Cantonese was examined using acoustic and perceptual analyses. The acoustic patterns of tones at the initial, medial, and final positions of questions and statements were measured. Results showed that intonation affects both the FO level and contour, while the duration of the six tones varied as a function of positions within intonation contexts. All six tones at the final position of questions showed rising FO contour, regardless of their canonical form. Listeners were overall more accurate in the identification of tones presented within the original carrier than of the same tones in isolation. However, a large proportion of tones 33, 21, 23, and 22 at the final position of questions were misperceived as tone 25 both within the original carrier and as isolated words. These results suggest that although the intonation context provided cues for correct tone identification, the intonation-induced changes in FO contour cannot always be perceptually compensated for, resulting in some erroneous perception of the identity of Cantonese tone.","Ma, Joan K-Y; Ciocca, Valter; Whitehill, Tara L",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,41,8

However, a number of issues, including safety, gene expression levels, cell selectivity and antivector immunity, are driving the search for new vector systems. A number of replicon-based vectors derived from positive-strand RNA viruses have recently been developed, and this paper reviews the current knowledge on the first flavivirus replicon system, which is based on the Australian flavivirus Kunjin (KUN). Like most replicon systems, KUN replicons can be delivered as DNA, RNA or virus-like particles, they replicate their RNA in the cytoplasm and direct prolonged high-level gene expression. However, unlike most alphavirus replicon systems, KUN replicons are non-cytopathic, with transfected cells able to divide, allowing the establishment of cell lines stably expressing replicon RNA and heterologous genes. As vaccine vectors KUN replicons can induce potent, long-lived, protective, immunogen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity, a feature potentially related to extended production of antigen and double-stranded RNA-induced 'danger signals'. The identification of KUN replicon mutants that induce increased levels of IFN-alpha/beta has also spawned investigation of KUN replicons for use in cancer gene therapy. The unique characteristics of KUN replicons may thus make them suitable for specific protein production, vaccine and gene therapy applications.","Pijlman, Gorben P; Suhrbier, Andreas; Khromykh, Alexander A",Expert opinion on biological therapy,41,1

We used the BBDR rat model to investigate the relationship between viral infection and autoimmune diabetes. BBDR rats are diabetes-free in viral Ab-free housing, but the disease develops in approximately 30% of BBDR rats infected with Kilham rat virus (KRV) through a process that does not involve infection of pancreatic beta cells. Pretreatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic (poly(I:C)), a ligand of TLR3, acts synergistically to induce diabetes in 100% of KRV-infected rats. The mechanisms by which KRV induces diabetes and TLR3 ligation facilitates this process are not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of the innate immune system plays a crucial role in diabetes induction. We report that multiple TLR agonists synergize with KRV infection to induce diabetes in BBDR rats, as do heat-killed Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus (natural TLR agonists). KRV infection increases serum IL-12 p40 in a strain-specific manner, and increases IL-12 p40, IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10, and IFN-gamma mRNA transcript levels, particularly in the pancreatic lymph nodes of BBDR rats. Infection with vaccinia virus or H-1 parvovirus induced less stimulation of the innate immune system and failed to induce diabetes in BBDR rats. Our results suggest that the degree to which the innate immune system is activated by TLRs is important for expression of virus-induced diabetes in genetically susceptible hosts.","Zipris, Danny; Lien, Egil; Xie, Jenny X; Greiner, Dale L; Mordes, John P; Rossini, Aldo A",Journal of immunology,41,24

Following the discovery of five new human respiratory viruses since 2000, there is an increasing need for diagnostic tests to detect these emerging viruses. We have developed a new test that can detect 20 different respiratory virus types/subtypes in a single 5-h test. The assay employs multiplex PCR using 14 virus-specific primer pairs, followed by a multiplexed target-specific primer extension (TSPE) reaction using 21 primers for specific respiratory virus types and subtypes. TSPE products were sorted and identified by using a fluid microsphere-based array (Universal Array; TmBioscience Corporation, Toronto, Canada) and the Luminex x-MAP system. The assay detected influenza A and B viruses; influenza A virus subtypes H1, H3, and H5 (including subtype H5N1 of the Asian lineage); parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus types A and B; adenovirus; metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; enterovirus; and coronaviruses OC43, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, NL63, and HKU1.

The RVP test detected an additional 61 positive specimens that either were not detected by DFA/culture or were positive for viruses not tested for by DFA/culture. After resolution of discordant results by using a second unique PCR assay and by using a combined reference standard of positivity, the RVP test detected 180 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 98.5%, whereas DFA and culture detected only 126 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 68.8%. The RVP test should improve the capabilities of hospital and public health laboratories for diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections and should assist public health agencies in identifying etiologic agents in respiratory tract infection outbreaks.","Mahony, J; Chong, S; Merante, F; Yaghoubian, S; Sinha, T; Lisle, C; Janeczko, R",Journal of clinical microbiology,41,1

However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge.","Chen, Zhiwei; Zhang, Linqi; Qin, Chuan; Ba, Lei; Yi, Christopher E; Zhang, Fengwen; Wei, Qiang; He, Tian; Yu, Wenjie; Yu, Jian; Gao, Hong; Tu, Xinming; Gettie, Agegnehu; Farzan, Michael; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Ho, David D",Journal of virology,41,24

The present evaluation attempts to assess the long-term (1989–2016) physiochemical characteristics of WQ of river Ganga at five upstream locations (Uttarkashi, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Devprayag, and Rishikesh) of Uttarakhand, India using comprehensive pollution index (CPI) and environmetrics (PCA and CA). These methods were used to categorize, summarize expensive datasets, and grouping the similar polluted areas along the river stretches. The WQ of river at all the locations were within the good category and most of the physiochemical parameters were well within their acceptable limit for drinking WQ. Considerably, CPI demonstrated the river WQ was in slight pollution range (CPI: 0.40–1.00) in the year 2007 and 2015 at all the five locations. The positive correlation coefficient (R 2&gt; 0.50) among NO 2+NO 3, Ca, Na, B, and K indicates the significant contribution of organic and inorganic salts through runoffs from catchments due to weathering of rocks. PCA confirmed the input source of nutrients in the river from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Moreover, the upstream WQ assessed was found to be good as compared to the severely polluted downstream region. Due to COVID-19 and shutdown in the country, reduction of pollution load in the river was observed due to the rejuvenation capability of river Ganga. This information can assist the environmentalist, policymaker, and water resources planners & managers to prepare strategic planning in advance to maintain the aesthetic and cultural value of Ganga river in future.","Kumar, Amit; Mishra, Saurabh; Taxak, A.

Safe and effective vaccines are needed to overcome this crisis. Here, we develop and assess the protective efficacy and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in rhesus macaques. Twenty macaques were divided into four groups of five animals each. One group was administered a placebo, while three groups were immunized with three different vaccine candidates of BBV152 at 0 and 14 days. All the macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 fourteen days after the second dose. The protective response was observed with increasing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers from 3rd-week post-immunization. Viral clearance was observed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal swab, throat swab and lung tissues at 7 days post-infection in the vaccinated groups. No evidence of pneumonia was observed by histopathological examination in vaccinated groups, unlike the placebo group which exhibited interstitial pneumonia and localization of viral antigen in the alveolar epithelium and macrophages by immunohistochemistry.

We aimed to determine whether development of significant liver injury during hospitalization is related to concomitant medications or processes common in COVID-19 (eg, ischemia, hyperinflammatory, or hypercoagulable states), and whether it can result in liver failure and death. METHODS: There were 834 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were included. Clinical, medication, and laboratory data were obtained at admission and throughout hospitalization using an identified database. Significant liver injury was defined as an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level 5 or more times the upper limit of normal; ischemia was defined as vasopressor use for a minimum of 2 consecutive days; hyperinflammatory state was defined as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein value of 100 mg/L or more, and hypercoagulability was defined as D-dimer 5 mg/L or more at any time during hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 105 (12.6%) patients developed significant liver injury. Compared with patients without significant liver injury, ischemia (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; range, 2.5-7.4; P < .0001) and tocilizumab use (OR, 3.6; range, 1.9-7.0; P = .0001) were independent predictors of significant liver injury. Although AST correlated closely with alanine aminotransferase (R = 0.89) throughout hospitalization, AST did not correlate with the international normalized ratio (R = 0.10) or with bilirubin level (R = 0.09). Death during hospitalization occurred in 136 (16.3%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that significant liver injury was not associated with death (OR, 1.4; range, 0.8-2.6; P = .2), while ischemic (OR, 2.4; range, 1.4-4.0; P = .001), hypercoagulable (OR, 1.7; range, 1.1-2.6; P = .02), and hyperinflammatory (OR, 1.9; range, 1.2-3.1; P = .02) disease states were significant predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Liver test abnormalities known to be associated with COVID-19 are secondary to other insults, mostly ischemia or drug-induced liver injury, and do not lead to liver insufficiency or death.","Chew, Michael; Tang, Zeyu; Radcliffe, Christopher; Caruana, Dennis; Doilicho, Natty; Ciarleglio, Maria M; Deng, Yanhong; Garcia-Tsao, Guadalupe",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,41,1

Their preferment was rapid due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of conducting exams online is being opted as the appropriate way of assessment, ensuring the students' safety and well-being. According to Warts et al., this form of examination has been pretty effective in the past when blended with the conventional assessment. However, at present, implemented as the singular way of assessment, e-exams have shown a more significant promise in being beneficial to the learners. As a matter of fact, a comprehensive analysis on understanding the learners' perception towards the e-exams was not done earlier, particularly in the developing nations. Thus, it was pertinent to examine the pre-requisites of e-exams to promote it as a useful tool for the smooth conduct of exams in the aforesaid nations. Against such a backdrop, this study was conducted during January to March 2021 on 207 students enrolled in four universities, three situated in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India: Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and one situated in Saudi Arabia, namely Saudi Electronic University (SEU). A quantitative approach was employed for the study, with the responses recorded via web questionnaires. Confirmatory -factor analysis (CFA) was applied in the study to examine whether the process of conducting online examinations is being chosen as the appropriate form of assessment, ensuring the safety and well-being of students through AMOS (version 24) software. For determining the reliability of the two latent constructs, namely ""Perceptions of students towards E-exams (PSE)"" and ""Pre-requisites of E-exams (POE),"" Cronbach's alpha was used through SPSS (version 25) software in the study, and the results reveal that the strong internal consistency exists between all the measured variables. In addition, the mean and standard deviation were used by the researchers to find out the pre-requisites of the online examination system. The participants expressed their insights on the relative benefits of online examination. Their perception was based on pedagogy, validity and reliability, affective factors, practicality, and security. From their insights, it was concluded that online examination is more advantageous than conventional paper-based exams. The outcome also applies to the authenticity of grading and the overall efficiency concerning the time, effort, and expenditure on conducting the examination. Contrarily, the participating students also recognized numerous hurdles in implementing e-exams concerning security, validity, and impartiality. The conclusion further revealed that online examination is especially relevant for formative assessment of learning instead of summative assessment, provided authenticity, security, and flexibility are used as fundamental tenants in the proper implementation of e-exams. The outcome of the present study will facilitate higher education institutions and policymakers in taking the electronic examination system to the next level.","Khan, Mohammed Arshad; Vivek, Vivek; Khojah, Maysoon; Nabi, Mohammed Kamalun; Paul, Mohinder; Minhaj, Syed Mohd",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),41,26

Methods: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. Results: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020. Emergency services decreased by 35.25%, percentage of children decreased by 4.28% (from 34.28% to 30%) and males increased by 13.53% (from 59.97% to 73.5%). Mechanical trauma, microbial keratitis, and conjunctivitis were the most common reasons for presentation. The former lessened by 41.75% while the latter two amplified by 1.25 times and 2 times, respectively. While sanitizer-associated chemical injury increased in proportion, endophthalmitis, and postoperative complications declined. The number of donor corneas collected and emergency therapeutic keratoplasties performed decreased by 99.61% and 92.39%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic demanded a global attention towards monitoring viruses and other infectious pathogens in hospital wastewater and their removal. Apart from that, the presence of various recalcitrant organics, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), etc. imparts a complex pollution load to water resources and ecosystem. In this review, an insight into the occurrence, persistence and removal of drug-resistant microorganisms and infectious viruses as well as other micro-pollutants have been documented. The performance of various pilot/full-scale studies have been evaluated in terms of removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), PhACs, pathogens, etc. It was found that many biological processes, such as membrane bioreactor, activated sludge process, constructed wetlands, etc. provided more than 80% removal of BOD, COD, TSS, etc. However, the removal of several recalcitrant organic pollutants are less responsive to those processes and demands the application of tertiary treatments, such as adsorption, ozone treatment, UV treatment, etc. Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, viruses were found to be persistent even after the treatment of hospital wastewater, and high dose of chlorination or UV treatment was required to inactivate them. This article circumscribes the various emerging technologies, which have been used to treat PhACs and pathogens.

However, the quantitative intracellular sensing of Zn2+ using DNAzyme remains challenging because of issues related to penetration of the signal through tissue, targeted cellular uptake and activation, and susceptibility toward enzymatic degradation. In this study, we developed a novel phosphate ion-activated DNAzyme-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanoprobe for two-photon imaging of Zn2+ in living cells and tissues. The design of this nanoprobe involved the loading of a Zn2+-specific, RNA-cleaving DNAzyme onto the MOFs through strong coordination between the phosphonate O atoms of the DNAzyme backbone and Zr atoms in the MOFs. This coordination restrained the extracellular activity of DNAzyme, however, after cell entry, the DNAzyme was released from the MOFs through competitive bind by the phosphate ions present at a high intracellular concentration. Following their release, the two-photon (TP) fluorophore-labeled substrate strands of DNAzyme was cleaved with the aid of Zn2+, which resulted in a strong fluorescent signal. The incorporation of a TP fluor-ophore into the nanoprobe facilitated near-infrared (NIR) excitation, which allowed the highly sensitive and specific im-aging of Zn2+ in living cells and tissues at greater depths than possible previously. The TP-DNAzyme-MOFs nanoprobe achieved a low detection limit of 3.53 nM, extraordinary selectivity toward Zn2+, and tissue signal penetration of 120 ï­m. More importantly, this nanoprobe was successfully used to monitor cell apoptosis, and this application of the DNAzyme-MOFs probe holds great potential for future use in biological studies and medical diagnostics.","Shi, Xinxin; Meng, Hong-Min; Geng, Xin; Qu, Ling-Bo; Li, Zhaohui",ACS Sens,41,1

To understand the dynamics of tests conducted could help to assess a country response to the pandemic. In that sense, our aim was to verify if there is a relationship between pandemic dynamics and molecular tests conducted in Colombia. Methods: We retrieved publicly available data from The Colombian National Institute of Health from March 2 to December 31, 2020, on testing and outcomes related to COVID-19. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between molecular tests conducted per 100000 persons and death or incidence rate per 100000 people of every department of Colombia. To assess if there a cyclic relationship between the daily number of molecular tests and daily COVID-19 cases in Colombia, we executed a cointegration analysis and evaluated the hypothesis with an augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. A critical value of -3.42 for rejecting the null hypothesis at 5% was used. Results: There was a positive correlation between molecular tests conducted and COVID-19 incidence and death rate (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01 and r = 0.64, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The cointegration (ADF) test revealed a statistically significant and closely time-dependent stochastic structure between daily COVID-19 cases and number of molecular tests (ADF, -3.50;p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: In Colombia, the molecular tests conducted are reactive to COVID-19 incidence and, in contrast to other scenarios, the molecular testing increase does not reduce COVID-19 incidence or mortality.","Lozano, A.; Zakzuk, J.; Salcedo Mejía, F.; Moyano, L.; Alvis-Zakzuk, N.; Alvis-Zakzuk, N.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence on the association between hyperglycemia at admission and the development of COVID-19. METHOD: Four databases namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library, were screened for eligible studies. STATA software was utilized to pool data for this meta-analysis. The primary outcomes included mortality and severity. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Healthcare centres around the world have seen changes in the nature of injuries acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic; we therefore hypothesize that social isolation measures have changed the pattern of plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed comparing patient presentations during the enforced COVID-19 lockdown to two previous periods. All emergency referrals requiring operative intervention by the plastic and reconstructive surgery unit of our institution were included. Patient demographics, place and mechanism of injury, drug and alcohol involvement, delays to presentation, length of admission and complication rates were collected. RESULTS: Demographics and complication rates were similar across all groups. A 31.8% reduction in total number of emergency cases was seen during the lockdown period. Increase in do-it-yourself injuries (P = 0.001), bicycle injuries (P = 0.001) and injuries acquired via substance abuse (P = 0.041) was observed. Head and neck injuries, mostly due to animal bites and falls, were also more prevalent compared to the same period the previous year (P = 0.007). As expected, over 80% of plastic surgery operations during the COVID-19 period were due to injuries acquired at home, a significant increase compared to previous periods. CONCLUSION: Despite changes in the pattern of presentations requiring plastic and reconstructive emergency surgery, traumatic injuries continued to occur during the pandemic. Thus, planning will be essential to ensure resource allocation for emergency procedures is sustained as second and third waves of COVID-19 cases emerge worldwide.","Cordova, Leonardo Z; Savage, Nicholas; Ram, Rachna; Ellis, Lisa; Tobin, Vicky; Rozen, Warren M; Seifman, Marc A",ANZ J Surg,41,1

The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted stroke systems of care merits study from a global lens. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational, international study, across 6 continents, 40 countries, and 187 comprehensive stroke centers. The study objectives were to measure the global impact of the pandemic on the volumes for mechanical thrombectomy (MT), stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) hospitalizations over a 3-month period at the height of the pandemic (March 1 to May 31, 2020) compared with two control 3-month periods prior (immediately preceding and one year prior). A secondary objective was to examine whether these changes in volume were impacted by COVID-19 and baseline hospital center stroke volumes. Third, we evaluated the relationships between stroke and COVID-19 diagnoses. Results: There were 26,699 stroke admissions in the 3 months immediately before compared to 21,576 admissions during the pandemic months, representing a 19.2% (95%CI,-19.7 to -18.7) decline. There were 5,191 MT procedures in the 3 months preceding compared to 4,533 procedures during the pandemic, representing a 12.7% (95%CI,-13.6 to -11.8) drop. Significant reductions were also seen in relation to the prior year control period. The decreases were noted across centers with high, intermediate, and low COVID-19 hospitalization burden, and also across high, intermediate, and low volume stroke centers. High-volume COVID-19 centers (-20.5%) had greater declines in MT volumes than mid- (-10.1%) and low-volume (-8.7%) centers. There was a 1.5% stroke rate across54,366 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted in 3.9% (784/20,250) of allstroke admissions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a global decline in the volume ofoverall stroke hospitalizations, MT procedures, ischemic stroke/TIA and ICH admission volumes.Despite geographic variations, these volume reductions were observed regardless of COVID-19hospitalization burden and pre-pandemic stroke and MT volumes. Centers with higher COVID-19inpatient volumes experienced steeper declines.","Nogueira, R.; AbdalKader, M.; Qureshi, M. M.; Frankel, M. R.; Haussen, D.; Al-bayati, A.

Methods: We analyzed the effects of changes in the total AOD, black carbon, sulfate, and organic matter in the atmosphere (&#955;â¯=â¯550 nm) in the same period of 2019 and 2020, following the COVID-19 epidemic in Blida City, which was the most-affected city in Algeria. Results: The quarantine that was enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19 resulted in side effects that were identifiable in the total AOD and in some of its atmospheric components. Comparing these variables in 2019 and 2020 (in the months during the quarantine) revealed that in April, the BCAOD values were much lower in 2020 than in 2019. Conclusion: Based on the effects of the emerging COVID-19, the research listed the changes received from the AOD, and is considered as a comparative study and represents a significant side effect of the quarantine that was mainly designed to limit COVID-19.","Chabane, Foued; Arif, Ali",,41,3

However, up to May 2020, there has been a lack of information about the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff in care homes and limited testing in this setting. RESULTS: Overall, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 6.5% with a higher rate in residents (9.0%) than in staff (4.7%). A key finding was the high proportion of asymptomatic infection detected in staff (69%) and residents (51%) with evidence of under-detection of symptoms by care home staff. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of asymptomatic infection combined with under detection of symptoms by care home staff indicates that offering a test to all residents and staff in care homes with rapid reporting of results would assist accurate identification of infected individuals, facilitating prompt infection prevention and control action. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out in 2455 residents and staff across 37 care homes in the London Borough of Bromley across a three-week period.

Characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to progress in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal&#945;1-3Galß1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (&#945;-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti-&#945;-Gal immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti-&#945;-Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to &#945;-Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to &#945;-Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti-&#945;-Gal IgE, IgM, and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti-&#945;-Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the &#945;-Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with &#945;-Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase &#945;-Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce severity of COVID-19.","Urra, José Miguel; Ferreras-Colino, Elisa; Contreras, Marinela; Cabrera, Carmen M; Fernández de Mera, Isabel G; Villar, Margarita; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José",J. med. virol,41,16

The patients have a dismal prognosis which has not improved in more than a decade suggesting that better understanding of this disease is required. In this study we analyze two previously published RNA sequencing datasets and gain further insights into the global transcriptome of two known sub-groups of this disease, which are characterized by the presence or absence of a homeobox gene expression signature. Specifically, we identify a remarkable mutually exclusive expression of the HOXA9/HOXA10 and IRX1 genes and have thus termed the two sub-groups iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1. This expression pattern is of critical importance as it suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the two sub-groups. Investigation of the transcriptome of the two sub-groups reveals a more aggressive nature of the iALL-IRX1 group, which is further supported by the fact that patients within this group have a worse prognosis and are also diagnosed at a younger age. This could be reflective of a developmentally earlier cell of origin for iALL-IRX1. Our analysis further uncovers critical differences between the two groups that may impact on treatment strategies for the two groups. In summary, through a detailed investigation into the transcriptional profile of iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1 patients, we highlight the importance of acknowledging that these two sub-groups are different, and that this is of clinical importance.","Symeonidou, V; Ottersbach, K",Exp. hematol,41,24

Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a ""risk factor"" for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts; and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19.

In this context, molecular docking simulations were carried out to understand which drugs are most effective in modulating a total of ten receptors, whether directly in viral, pro-inflammatory or central nervous system signaling, related to COVID-19. Subsequently, some results were validated through molecular dynamics simulations based on publicly available trajectory files. Among a total of 71 molecular docking simulations, the drug ledipasvir administered to patients with Hepatitis-C (HCV) was the most promising with a mean value ΔGº ≈ -10.3 kcal · mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and a nonspecific probability according to neural networks of 0.21.

Objective: To examine trends in trauma admissions throughout Los Angeles County (LAC) during the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, all trauma admissions to the 15 verified level 1 and level 2 trauma centers in LAC from January 1 to June 7, 2020 were reviewed. All trauma admissions from the same period in 2019 were used as historical control. For overall admissions, the study period was divided into 3 intervals based on daily admission trend analysis (January 1 through February 28, March 1 through April 9, April 10 through June 7). For the blunt trauma subgroup analysis, the study period was divided into 3 similar intervals (January 1 through February 27, February 28 through April 5, April 6 through June 7). Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Trends in trauma admission volume and injury patterns. Results: A total of 6777 patients in 2020 and 6937 in 2019 met inclusion criteria. Of those admitted in 2020, the median (interquartile range) age was 42 (28-61) years and 5100 (75.3%) were men. Mechanisms of injury were significantly different between the 2 years, with a higher incidence of penetrating trauma and fewer blunt injuries in 2020 compared with 2019 (penetrating: 1065 [15.7%] vs 1065 [15.4%]; blunt: 5309 [78.3%] vs 5528 [79.7%]). Overall admissions by interval in 2020 were 2681, 1684, and 2412, whereas in 2019 they were 2462, 1862, and 2613, respectively. There was a significant increase in overall admissions per week during the first interval (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.002-1.04; P = .03) followed by a decrease in the second interval (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94; P < .001) and, finally, an increase in the third interval (IRR, 1.05; CI, 1.03-1.07; P < .001). On subgroup analysis, blunt admissions followed a similar pattern to overall admissions, while penetrating admissions increased throughout the study period. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, trauma centers throughout LAC experienced a significant change in injury patterns and admission trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. A transient decrease in volume was followed by a quick return to baseline levels. Trauma centers should prioritize maintaining access, capacity, and functionality during pandemics and other national emergencies.","Ghafil, Cameron; Matsushima, Kazuhide; Ding, Li; Henry, Reynold; Inaba, Kenji",JAMA Netw Open,41,24

Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has shown promise in central nervous system (CNS) regeneration, yet its therapeutic utility is severely limited by instability. We computationally reengineered ChABC by introducing 37, 55, and 92 amino acid changes using consensus design and forcefield-based optimization. All mutants were more stable than wild-type ChABC with increased aggregation temperatures between 4° and 8°C. Only ChABC with 37 mutations (ChABC-37) was more active and had a 6.5 times greater half-life than wild-type ChABC, increasing to 106 hours (4.4 days) from only 16.8 hours. ChABC-37, expressed as a fusion protein with Src homology 3 (ChABC-37-SH3), was active for 7 days when released from a hydrogel modified with SH3-binding peptides. This study demonstrates the broad opportunity to improve biocatalysts through computational engineering and sets the stage for future testing of this substantially improved protein in the treatment of debilitating CNS injuries.","Hettiaratchi, Marian H; O039,; Meara, Matthew J; Meara, Teresa R; Pickering, Andrew J; Letko-Khait, Nitzan; Shoichet, Molly S",Sci.

In this work GO nanosheets, synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite (patent N 102015000023739, Tor Vergata University), were investigated as possible carriers of an anticancer drug, the S29, an inhibitor of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (c-SRC) on a neuroblastoma cell line (SK N BE 2 cells). Neuroblastoma is a heterogenous tumor whose characteristics range from spontaneous regression to aggressive phenotypes that are due to different mutations that often occur in SRC family kinases. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases are currently investigated for their anti-tumoral effects on aggressive neuroblastomas, but their uptake in cells and pharmacokinetics needs to be improved. In this work S29 was stably conjugated with highly water-dispersible GO nanoparticles. S29/GO complex formation was induced by 1h sonication and its stability was analyzed by chromatography coupled with spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry. The synthesized composite (GO-S29) was delivered into SK N BE 2 cells and its effects on cell viability, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and migration were studied. The results show that the compound GO-S29 exerts anti-tumoral effects on the neuroblastoma cell line, higher than both GO and S29 do alone and that GO has an additive effect on S29.","Mardente, Stefania; Aventaggiato, Michele; Mari, Emanuela; Francioso, Antonio; Tafani, Marco; Mosca, Luciana; Zicari, Alessandra; Malyshev, Igor; Kuznetsova, Larisa; Valentini, Federica",,41,16

This study aimed at determining whether some food items on sale around an industrialized area of Ogun State are contaminated with trace metals. Methods: Seven different food items - Clarias gariepinus (roasted, fresh and smoked) Bos taurus (dried and fresh beef), zobo leaf (Hibiscus sabdariffa) and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) were sampled from three major markets, namely: Lusada, Atan and Ota in Ado-Odo/Ota LGA of Ogun State. They were analyzed for Lead, Cadmium, Nickel, Manganese and Zinc using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Results: Cd was not detected in most of the food items across the markets. Pb, Ni and Mn were detected in very high concentrations above the maximum allowable limits by international regulatory agencies. Zn was the only metal that was generally below regulatory limits in food items across the three markets. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) values were generally higher than values acceptable in food. Conclusion: Some of the food items consumed in this area are not entirely safe from metal toxicity and this may have serious health consequences.","Ayanda, Opeyemi Isaac; Bello, Oluwakemi Adetutu; Nwabuisi, Oluwatosin Ifeanyichukwu",Afr Health Sci,41,25

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of adults with type 1 diabetes in our center, in whom a prescription for a flash monitoring sensor was collected. Primary outcome was change in HbA1c between 2016 and after flash monitoring. Rates of hospital admission were compared between the first year after flash monitoring and the corresponding 12-month period 2 years earlier. RESULTS: Approximately half of all adults with type 1 diabetes, attending our center, collected prescriptions for flash monitoring sensors (n=2216). Median fall in HbA1c was -1 (-0.1) mmol/mol (%) (p<0.001) and was greatest in those with baseline HbA1c >75 (9.0) mmol/mol (%): -10 (-0.9) mmol/mol (%), p<0.001. 43% of those with a baseline HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (7%) experienced a &#8805;5 mmol/mol (0.5%) fall in HbA1c. In addition to higher HbA1c, early commencement within 1 month of NHS-funded flash monitoring (p<0.001), and male gender (p=0.013) were associated with a fall in HbA1c of &#8805;5 (0.5) mmol/mol (%). Socioeconomic deprivation (p=0.009) and collecting fewer than 2 sensors per month (p=0.002) were associated with lack of response. Overall, hospital admissions did not change but an increase in admissions for hypoglycemia was observed (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Flash monitoring is associated with reduction in HbA1c in individuals with HbA1c >58 mmol/mol. Numerous clinical features are independently associated with HbA1c response. An increase in hypoglycemia admissions occurred following flash monitoring.","Stimson, Roland H; Dover, Anna R; Ritchie, Stuart A; Wright, Rohana J; McKnight, John A; Zammitt, Nicola N; Gibb, Fraser W",,41,7

In the U.S., physical distancing orders and other restrictions have had severe economic and societal consequences. Populations already vulnerable in the United States have experienced worse COVID-19 health outcomes. The World Health Organization has made recommendations to engage at risk populations and communicate accurate information about risk and prevention; to conduct contract tracing; and to support those affected by COVID-19. This Commentary highlights the ways in which an existing and cost-effective, but underutilized workforce, community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators, should be deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators have skills in community engagement and health communication and are able to gain the trust of vulnerable communities. Furthermore, many community health workers and non-clinical patient navigators have skills in assisting community members with meeting basic needs and with navigating public health and healthcare systems. Members of this workforce are more than prepared to conduct contact tracing. State, local, tribal, and territorial public health agencies and healthcare systems should be collaborating with national, state, and local organizations that represent and employ CHWs/non-clinical patient navigators to determine how to better mobilize this workforce to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

After over six-month spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 causes critical threats to global public health and economy. The investigations on evolution and genotyping on genetic variations are of great importance, therefore, the present study characterized the molecular variation of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 4230 complete genome sequences from the worldwide samples collected during the first 6-month pandemic. Phylogenetic tree analysis with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum-Parsimony methods indicated that the haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were classified into four clades with the unique nucleotide and amino acid changes: T27879C (ORF8 L84S) in clade 1 (25.34%), A23138G (spike D614G) in clade 2 (63.54%), G10818T (nsp6 L37F), C14540T (nsp12 T442I), and G25879T (ORF3a V251F) in clade 3 (2.58%), and miscellaneous changes in clade 4 (8.54%). Interestingly, subclade 2B with the amino acid changes at nsp2 T85I, Spike D614G, and ORF3a Q57H was firstly reported on March 4, 2020 in United States of America, becoming the most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (36.21%) and America (45.81%).

To assess the immunological effects of this drug on B cells, follicular T helper (Tfh) cells, and peripheral T helper (Tph) cells in patients with NMOSD, peripheral B cell and Tfh cell phenotypes were evaluated in 26 patients with NMOSD before and after tocilizumab treatment by nine-color flow cytometry, as well as the expression of costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules on B cells. Results showed that the frequency of CD27+IgD- switched memory B cells, CD27-IgD- double-negative B cells, and CD27highCD38high antibody-secreting cells was increased in patients with NMOSD. Tocilizumab treatment led to a significant shift of B cells to naïve B cells from memory B cells after 3 months. Three markers on B cells associated with T-cell activation (i.e., CD86 CD69, and HLA-DR) were downregulated after tocilizumab treatment. The frequencies of total Tfh and Tph cells were decreased, whereas that of follicular regulatory T cells tended to increase. Intrinsic increased PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was characteristic of B cells in patients with NMOSD. Tocilizumab selectively restored PD-L1 on B-cell subsets. These results provided evidence that tocilizumab enhanced B- and T-cell homoeostasis by regulating B-cell differentiation and inhibiting lymphocyte activation in patients with NMOSD.","Liu, Ye; Zhang, Huiming; Zhang, Tian-Xiang; Yuan, Meng; Du, Chen; Zeng, Pei; Huang, Zhenning; Jia, Dongmei; Yang, Guili; Shi, Fu-Dong; Zhang, Chao",Front Immunol,41,22

The induction of a coordinated immune response is crucial to the elimination of any pathogenic infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate the host immune system to favor viral adaptation and persistence within the host. The virus can counteract type I interferon (IFN-I) production, attenuating IFN-I signaling pathway activation and disrupting antigen presentation. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2 infection can enhance apoptosis and the production of inflammatory mediators, which ultimately results in increased disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 produces an array of effector molecules, including nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open-reading frames (ORFs) accessory proteins. We describe the complex molecular interplay of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs and accessory proteins with the host's signaling mediating immune evasion in the current review. In addition, the crucial role played by immunomodulation therapy to address immune evasion is discussed.

To date, there has been a lack of data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination coverage in China since the vaccine has become available. METHODS: We designed and implemented a cross-sectional, population-based online survey to evaluate the willingness, hesitancy, and coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine among the Chinese population. 8742 valid samples were recruited and classified as the vaccine-priority group (n = 3902; 44.6%) and the non-priority group (n = 4840; 55.4%). RESULTS: The proportion of people's trust in the vaccine, delivery system, and government were 69.0%, 78.0% and 81.3%, respectively. 67.1% of the participants were reportedly willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, while 9.0% refused it. 834 (35.5%) reported vaccine hesitancy, including acceptors with doubts (48.8%), refusers (39.4%), and delayers (11.8%). The current coverage was 34.4%, far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity. The predicted rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 64.9%, 68.9% and 81.1% based on the rates of vaccine hesitancy, willingness, and refusal, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccine rate is far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity, which will require more flexible and comprehensive efforts to improve the population's confidence and willingness to vaccinate. It should be highlighted that vaccination alone is insufficient to stop the pandemic; further efforts are needed not only to increase vaccination coverage but also to maintain non-specific prevention strategies.","Wang, Chao; Han, Bingfeng; Zhao, Tianshuo; Liu, Hanyu; Liu, Bei; Chen, Linyi; Xie, Mingzhu; Liu, Jiang; Zheng, Hui; Zhang, Sihui; Wang, Yu; Huang, Ninghua; Du, Juan; Liu, Ya-Qiong; Lu, Qing-Bin; Cui, Fuqiang",Vaccine,41,6

Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and CT < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.","Bourassa, Lori; Perchetti, Garrett A; Phung, Quynh; Lin, Michelle J; Mills, Margaret G; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Harmon, Kimberly G; Reed, Jonathan C; Greninger, Alexander L",J Clin Virol,41,1

Despite this, the vaccination coverage level in most European countries is relatively low. This is largely due to patients having limited access to vaccinations. In some countries, implementing vaccinations in pharmacies and by authorized pharmacists has significantly improved vaccination coverage rates and herd immunity, while lowering the cost of treating infections and the resulting complications, as well as minimizing the phenomenon of inappropriate antibiotic therapies. This article presents the role of pharmacists in the prevention of infectious diseases, pointing out the measurable effects of engaging pharmacists in conducting preventive vaccinations, as well as analyzing the models of implementing and conducting vaccinations in pharmacies in selected countries, and depicting recommendations regarding vaccinations developed by international organizations.

Our aim was to describe the characteristics of the disease in this population and to determine predictive factors for poor outcome in terms of severe respiratory distress (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) or death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients consecutively admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively collected, and retrospective statistical analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess potential factors for poor outcomes defined as ARDS or death. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were analysed, and 34 of them developed respiratory failure (70% as ARDS). Lymphocytes/mm3 (412 versus 686; p = 0.001), serum albumin (2.84 versus 3.1); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (670 versus 359; p < 0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (25.8 versus 9.9; p < 0.001) discriminate those that developed respiratory failure. Mortality rate was 25%, significantly higher among ARDS, neutropenic patients (p = 0.01) and in those with bilateral infiltrates (44% versus 0%; p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic analyses model confirmed the predictive value of severe neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] 16.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-190.9, p 0.025), bilateral infiltrates (OR 32.83, CI 95% 3.51-307, p 0.002) and tumour lung involvement (OR 4.34, CI 95% 1.2-14.95, p 0.02). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients under active treatment admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection have worse outcomes in terms of mortality and respiratory failure rates compared with COVID-19 global population. Lymphopenia, LDH, CRP and albumin discriminate illness severity, whereas neutropenia, bilateral infiltrates and tumour pulmonary involvement are predictive of higher mortality.","Yarza, Ramón; Bover, Mateo; Paredes, Diana; López-López, Flora; Jara-Casas, Diego; Castelo-Loureiro, Alicia; Baena, Javier; Mazarico, José María; Folgueira, María Dolores; Meléndez-Carmona, María Ángeles; Reyes, Alhena; Lumbreras, Carlos; Paz-Ares, Luis; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen; Gómez-Martín, Carlos",Eur J Cancer,41,28

This study sought to evaluate whether there is any difference on the long-term results of TAR and non-TAR CABG patients. METHODS: The Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL/CCTR), Clinical Trials.gov, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published by October 2020. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies with propensity score matching comparing TAR versus non-TAR CABG were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The current barriers to implementation of TAR in clinical practice and measures that can be used to optimize outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen publications (from 2012 to 2020) involving a total of 22,746 patients (TAR: 8,941 patients; non-TAR: 13,805 patients) were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (over 10 years) was lower in the TAR group than in the non-TAR group (random effect model: HR 0.676, 95% confidence interval 0.586-0.779, P<0.001). There was evidence of low heterogeneity of treatment effect among the studies for mortality, and none of the studies had a particular impact on the summary result. The result was not influenced by age, sex, or comorbidities. We identified low risk of publication bias related to this outcome. CONCLUSION: This review found that TAR presents the best long-term results in patients who undergo CABG. Given that many patients are likely to benefit from TAR, its use should be encouraged.","Rayol, Sérgio C; Eynde, Jef Van den; Cavalcanti, Luiz Rafael P; Escorel, Antonio Carlos; Rad, Arian Arjomandi; Amabile, Andrea; Botelho, Wilson; Ruhparwar, Arjang; Zhigalov, Konstantin; Weymann, Alexander; Sobral, Dario Celestino; Sá, Michel Pompeu B O",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,41,10

Comparing the Outcome of COVID-19 in Cancer and Non-Cancer Patients: an International Multicenter Study,15.404247,10.373823,2020,"The importance of Zn for human health becomes obvious during Zn deficiency. Even mild insufficiencies of Zn cause alterations in haematopoiesis and immune functions, resulting in a proinflammatory phenotype and a disturbed redox metabolism. Although immune system malfunction has the most obvious effect, the functions of several tissue cell types are disturbed if Zn supply is limiting. Adhesion molecules and tight junction proteins decrease, while cell death increases, generating barrier dysfunction and possibly organ failure. Taken together, Zn deficiency both weakens the resistance of the human body towards pathogens and at the same time increases the danger of an overactive immune response that may cause tissue damage. The case numbers of Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) are still increasing, which is causing enormous problems for health systems and economies. There is an urgent need to reduce both the number of severe cases and the resulting deaths. While therapeutic options are still under investigation, and first vaccines have been approved, cost-effective ways to reduce the likelihood of or even prevent infection, and the transition from mild symptoms to more serious detrimental disease, are highly desirable. Nutritional supplementation might be an effective option to achieve these aims. In this review, we discuss known Zn deficiency effects in the context of an infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 and its currently known pathogenic mechanisms and elaborate on how severe pre-existing Zn deficiency may pre-dispose patients to a severe progression of COVID-19. First published clinical data on the association of Zn homoeostasis with COVID-19 and registered studies in progress are listed.","Wessels, Inga; Rolles, Benjamin; Slusarenko, Alan J; Rink, Lothar",Br J Nutr,41,24

COVID-19-induced coagulopathy (CIC) is commonly encountered at presentation manifested by considerable elevation of D-dimer and fibrin split products but with modest or no change in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. CIC is a complex process that is distinctly different from conventional sepsis-induced coagulopathy. The cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection appears to be more severe in COVID-19, resulting in development of extensive micro- and macrovascular thrombosis and organ failure. Unlike conventional sepsis, anticoagulation plays a key role in the treatment of COVID-19, however without practice guidelines tailored to these patients. We propose a scoring system for COVID-19-coagulopathy (CIC Scoring) and stratification of patients for the purpose of anticoagulation therapy based on risk categories. The proposed scoring system and therapeutic guidelines are likely to undergo revisions in the future as new data become available in this evolving field.","Hadid, Tarik; Kafri, Zyad; Al-Katib, Ayad",Blood Rev,41,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, BioRxiv and MedRxiv, and Cochrane (up to April 20, 2021) were the search databases. Two reviewers (SK and CK) independently selected the electronic published literature that studied the effect of nitric oxide with SOC or control. The clinical and physiological outcomes such as prevention of progressive systemic de-oxygenation/clinical improvement, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, improvement in pulmonary arterial pressure, and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: The 14 retrospective/protective studies randomly assigning 423 patients met the inclusion criteria. Cumulative study of the selected articles showed that iNO has a mild impact on ventilation time or ventilator-free days. iNO has increased the partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of fraction of inspired oxygen in a few patients as compared to baseline. However, in most of the studies, it does not have better outcome when compared to the baseline improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome, nitric oxide is linked to a slight increase in oxygenation but has no effect on mortality.","Prakash, Ajay; Kaur, Sukhmeet; Kaur, Charanjeet; Prabha, Praisy K; Bhatacharya, Anusuya; Sarma, Phulen; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,41,21

Methods: This study is a retrospective, multicenter analysis of general surgery emergency operations performed during the period from 1 March to 15th 2020 lockdown and in the same time period of 2019 in three medical centers providing emergency surgical care to the area Salzburg-North, Austria. Results: In total 165 emergency surgeries were performed in the study period of 2020 compared to 287 in 2019. This is a significant decrease of 122 (42.5%) emergency surgeries during the COVID-19 lockdown (pâ¯= 0.005). The length of hospital stay was reduced to 3 days in 2020 compared to 4 in 2019. Appendectomy remained the most performed emergency surgery for both periods; however the number of surgeries was reduced to less than a half, with 72 cases in 2019 and 33 cases in 2020 (pâ¯= 0.118).

METHODS: We tested 594 nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals with COVID-19 (RT-PCR cycle threshold [Ct] values &#8804; 40) or non-COVID-19 (Ct values > 40) diagnoses. RT-PCR positive samples were assigned to diagnostic, screening, or monitoring groups of testing. RESULTS: With a limit of detection of 1.2 × 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4, 80.0, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. Additional testing of RT-PCR positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA showed that, by three groups, PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively. PPAs dropped to 55.6, 20.0, or 41.7% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively.

Methods The PSA (Kit: Immunoassay Program- Cycle 18, Siemens Atellica IM Analyzer) levels in patients who had had a PSA check at least 3 months, but no more than 6 months, prior to diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection, were examined retrospectively. PSA levels were measured and recorded from these patients on the first day of diagnosis of COVID-19. These patients were called back for urology outpatient follow-up at the 3rd month after the end of the COVID-19 treatment. PSA levels measured in the pre-COVID-19 period, during the period of active infection with COVID-19 and in the post-COVID-19 period were compared. Results In total, 91 patients had a serum PSA level of 1.58±1.09 ng/ml in the pre-COVID-19 period, a serum PSA level of 4.34±3.78 ng/ml measured in the COVID-19 period and 2.09±2.70 ng/ml in the post-COVID-19 period. It was determined that the serum PSA level measured during active COVID-19 infection was statistically significantly higher than the PSA levels measured according to the pre-COVID-19 period and the post-COVID-19 period (p<0.001, p<0.001;respectively). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection in men diagnosed with BPH causes significant increases in PSA levels during the active period of the disease.

Methods &nbsp; &nbsp;We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 71 GGO-like COVID-19 patients who received therapy in Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology between January 17th and February 13th, 2020. These 71 GGO-like COVID-19 patients were as a COVID-19 group. And 80 GGO-like early-stage lung carcinoma patients who underwent resection were as a lung carcinoma group. Clinical features such as sex, age, symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia and dyspnea, detailed exposure history, confirmatory test (SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR) and pathologic diagnosis were analyzed. Results &nbsp; &nbsp;Significantly different symptoms and exposure history between the two groups were detected (P&lt;0.001). More lesions (61 patients at percentage of 85.92%, P&lt;0.001), relative peripheral locations (69 patients at percentage of 97.18%, P&lt;0.001) and larger opacities (65 patients at percentage of 91.55%, P&lt;0.001) were found in chest radiographs of GGO-like COVID-19 compared with GGO-like early-stage lung carcinoma. Similar features appeared in early-stage of COVID-19 and lung carcinoma, while pneumonia developed into more extensive and basal predominant lung consolidation. Coexistence of GGO-like COVID-19 and early-stage lung carcinoma might occur. Conclusion &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering these similar and unique features of GGO-like COVID-19 and early-stage lung carcinoma, it is necessary to understand short time re-examination of chest radiographs and other diagnostic methods of these two diseases.

Every anatomist is unlocking technology to deliver best education however understanding of the subject without dissections or other practical teaching aids like bones, specimens, embryology models, microscopic slides etc. is challenging. This approach misses the feel and human visual impacts. Potential educational disruption is felt currently and will be experienced even after the pandemic is over due to scarcity of cadavers. As the body donor may be carrier or died of Covid-19 and there is no proven screening to rule out this infection in donor, so the acceptance of body donations is not advisable for the safety of medical students and health care workers. To conclude, anatomy education is cadaverless currently due to Covid-19 lockdown and it is prophesied that after the pandemic, real cadavers will be replaced by virtual cadavers because of paucity of cadavers.

We recently found that inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a physiological, metabolic energy (ATP)-providing polymer released from blood platelets, blocks the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) to the cellular ACE2 receptor in vitro. PolyP is a marine natural product and is abundantly present in marine bacteria. Now, we have approached the in vivo situation by studying the effect of polyP on the human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells in a mucus-like mucin environment. These cells express mucins as well as the ectoenzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and adenylate kinase (ADK), which are involved in the extracellular production of ATP from polyP. Mucin, integrated into a collagen-based hydrogel, stimulated cell growth and attachment. The addition of polyP to the hydrogel significantly increased cell attachment and also the expression of the membrane-tethered mucin MUC1 and the secreted mucin MUC5AC. The increased synthesis of MUC1 was also confirmed by immunostaining. This morphogenetic effect of polyP was associated with a rise in extracellular ATP level. We conclude that the nontoxic and non-immunogenic polymer polyP could possibly also exert a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2-cell attachment; first, by stimulating the innate antiviral response by strengthening the mucin barrier with its antimicrobial proteins, and second, by inhibiting virus attachment to the cells, as deduced from the reduction in the strength of binding between the viral RBD and the cellular ACE2 receptor.","Müller, Werner E G; Neufurth, Meik; Wang, Shunfeng; Tan, Rongwei; Schröder, Heinz C; Wang, Xiaohong",Mar. drugs,41,4

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we find that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe. In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe means that half as many lockdown periods would be required to end continent-wide community transmission.","Ruktanonchai, N W; Floyd, J R; Lai, S; Ruktanonchai, C W; Sadilek, A; Rente-Lourenco, P; Ben, X; Carioli, A; Gwinn, J; Steele, J E; Prosper, O; Schneider, A; Oplinger, A; Eastham, P; Tatem, A J",Science,41,16

CONCLUSIONS: Conspiracy beliefs may be situated on a spectrum of mistrust-related phenomena, which extends from healthy scepticism to persecutory delusions. They can be conceptualised as unfounded and fixed beliefs held with strong conviction about harm inflicted by powerful groups on the community or another group of people, usually with preserved insight that these beliefs differ from those that most people have and with reasons for having such beliefs not necessarily being implausible.

The US government has sponsored the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, for public health emergencies; however, federally supported programs, including the Public Health and Emergency Preparedness program and Cities Readiness Initiative, have historically emphasized antibiotic pill dispensing over mass vaccination. While mass vaccination and pill dispensing programs share similarities, they also have fundamental differences that require dedicated preparedness efforts to address. To date, only a limited number of public assessments of local mass vaccination operational capabilities have been conducted. To fill this gap, we interviewed 37 public health and preparedness officials representing 33 jurisdictions across the United States. We aimed to characterize their existing mass vaccination operational capacities and identify challenges and lessons learned in order to support the efforts of other jurisdictions to improve mass vaccination preparedness. We found that most jurisdictions were not capable of or had not planned for rapidly vaccinating their populations within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 weeks). Many also noted that their focus on pill dispensing was driven largely by federal funding requirements and that preparedness efforts for mass vaccination were often self-motivated. Barriers to implementing rapid mass vaccination operations included insufficient personnel qualified to administer vaccinations, increased patient load compared to pill-dispensing modalities, logistical challenges to maintaining cold chain, and operational challenges addressing high-risk populations, including children, pregnant women, and non-English-speaking populations. Considering the expected availability of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine for distribution and dispensing to the public, our findings highlight critical considerations for planning possible future mass vaccination events, including during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Hosangadi, Divya; Shearer, Matthew P; Warmbrod, Kelsey Lane; Kan, Lilly; Cantu, Michelle; Nuzzo, Jennifer",Health Secur,41,16

COVID-19 runs its course in two phases, the initial incubation phase and later clinical symptomatic phase. Patients in the initial incubation phase often have insidious clinical symptoms, but they are still highly contagious. At the later clinical symptomatic phase, the immune system is fully activated and the disease may enter the severe infection stage in this phase. Although many patients are known for their respiratory symptoms, they had neurological symptoms in their first 1-2 days of clinical symptomatic phase, and ischaemic stroke occurred 2 weeks after the onset of the clinical symptomatic phase. The key is to prevent a patient from progressing to this severe infection from mild infection.

As the virus continues to spread on a global scale, the majority of efforts have been on the development of vaccines and the mass immunization of the public. While the daily case numbers were following a decreasing trend, the emergent of new virus mutations and variants still pose a significant threat. As economies start recovering and societies start opening up with people going back into office buildings, schools, and malls, we still need to have the ability to detect and minimize the spread of COVID-19. Individuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on symptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some symptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal method to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers using convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting function that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were performed on an existing dataset with respect to the three considered modes of coughs, fever, and shortness of breath. The results show considerable improvements in the detection of COVID-19 using our weighting function when compared to an equal weighting function.","Effati, Meysam; Sun, Yu-Chen; Naguib, Hani E.; Nejat, Goldie",,41,24

RDNI has been recommended for treating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ""New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan"". AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate and verify the underlying mechanisms of RDNI for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: This study firstly performed anti-SARS-CoV-2 experiments in Vero E6 cells. Then, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was adopted to explore the potential mechanisms of RDNI in the treatment for COVID-19. After that, western blot and a cytokine chip were used to validate the predictive results. RESULTS: We concluded that half toxic concentration of drug CC50 (dilution ratio) =1:1280, CC50=2.031 mg crude drugs/mL (0.047 mg solid content/mL) and half effective concentration of drug (EC50) (diluted multiples) =1:25140.3, EC50=103.420µg crude drugs/mL (2.405µg solid content/mL). We found that RDNI can mainly regulate targets like carbonic anhydrases (CAs), matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and pathways like PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Forkhead box O s and T cell receptor signaling pathways to reduce lung damage. We verified that RDNI could effectively inhibit the overexpression of MAPKs, PKC and p65 nuclear factor-&#954;B. The injection could also affect cytokine levels, reduce inflammation and display antipyretic activity. CONCLUSION: RDNI can regulate ACE2, Mpro and PLP in COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of RDNI in the treatment for COVID-19 may be related to the modulation of the cytokine levels and inflammation and its antipyretic activity by regulating the expression of MAPKs, PKC and p65 nuclear factor NF-&#954;B.","Jia, Shanshan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Xinkui; Fan, Xiaotian; Huang, Zhihong; Lu, Shan; Shen, Liangliang; Guo, Siyu; Liu, Yingying; Wang, Zhenzhong; Cao, Liang; Cao, Zeyu; Zhang, Xinzhuang; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Jingyuan; Li, Jialin; Wu, Jiarui; Xiao, Wei",J Ethnopharmacol,41,20

The utility and sustainability of inpatient telemedicine initiatives need to be evaluated as the number of COVID-19 inpatients is expected to continue declining. In this viewpoint, we describe the use of a rapidly deployed inpatient telemedicine workflow at a large academic medical center and discuss the potential impact on PPE savings. In early 2020, videoconferencing software was installed on patient bedside iPads at two academic medical center teaching hospitals. An internal website allowed providers to initiate video calls with patients in any patient room with an activated iPad, including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Patients were encouraged to use telemedicine technology to connect with loved ones via native apps or videoconferencing software. We evaluated the use of telemedicine technology on patients' bedside iPads by monitoring traffic to the internal website. Between May 2020 and March 2021, there were a total of 1240 active users of the Video Visits website (mean 112.7, SD 49.0 connection events per month). Of these, 133 (10.7%) connections were made. Patients initiated 63 (47.4%) video calls with family or friends and sent 37 (27.8%) emails with videoconference connection instructions. Providers initiated a total of 33 (24.8%) video calls with the majority of calls initiated in August (n=22, 67%). There was a low level of adoption of inpatient telemedicine capability by providers and patients. With sufficient availability of PPE, inpatient providers did not find a frequent need to use the bedside telemedicine technology, despite a high census of patients with COVID-19. Compared to providers, patients used videoconferencing capabilities more frequently in September and October 2020. We did not find savings of PPE associated with the use of inpatient telemedicine.","Halabi, Reem; Smith, Geoffrey; Sylwestrzak, Marc; Clay, Brian; Longhurst, Christopher A; Lander, Lina",J Med Internet Res,41,16

We hypothesized that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of postoperative outcomes after arthroscopic meniscus repair. METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized blinded study, with a parallel design and an allocation ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in our hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. It was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. A total of 70 patients who meet inclusion criteria are randomized to either all-inside or inside-out group. The primary outcome measure was retear rate. Retear was determined by repeat arthroscopic evaluation of patients with follow-up for symptoms of persistent or new pain, catching, or locking that was possibly related to the meniscal repair. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific quality of life measurement with the Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool, range of motion, operative time, and adverse events at surgery or throughout the follow-up period.

The CSF of Neuro-COVID patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4+ T cells. Neuro-COVID CSF leukocytes featured an enriched interferon signature; however, this was less pronounced than in viral encephalitis.

Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown. However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups. To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection further beyond these high risk groups.","Anderez, Dario Ortega; Kanjo, Eiman; Pogrebna, Ganna; Johnson, Shane; Hunt, John Alan",,41,5

Eight studies in adult samples showed an increase in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms;two studies underlined a minimal impact of COVID-19 on OCD patients and one study showed a slight improvement in symptoms. Two out of three studies on children and adolescents showed an exacerbation of OCD and a worsening even in the presence of an ongoing treatment. Conclusions: The studies reviewed are few. There are more studies on adult OCD than on children and adolescents. The results are controversial: few studies examined OCD subtypes;in most studies the typology of treatment was not clear and the samples covered a wide age range;a large number of studies did not use the same monitoring period or quantitative measures, both of which make it difficult to compare or rely on the results.","Zaccari, V.; D039,; Arienzo, M.

Shunt complications are frequent with an estimated 20-40% failure rate within the first year, and 4.5% per year subsequently. We have an open-door 'possible shunt malfunction' pathway for children treated with a shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy, providing direct ward access to ensure rapid assessment and timely management of children. OBJECTIVE: To audit the 'possible shunt malfunction' pathway in terms of clinical outcomes (percentage-confirmed shunt dysfunction and number of re-attendances) and costs. METHODS: Clinical data for patients attending the triage service were prospectively recorded over 7 months-including the number of attendances, previous shunt revisions, shunt type, investigations performed (CT, x-rays), and outcome. Costings (e.g. costs of physician, inpatient stay, investigations) were obtained from the hospital's procurement department. RESULTS: In the study period, there were 81 attendances by 62 patients and only 16% of attendances resulted in surgical management (either shunt revision or ETV). Approximately 17% of patients re-attended at least once. The average cost per attendance in our pathway was £765.57 ($969.63; 858.73). The total expenditure for the pathway over 7 months was £62,011.03 ($78,540.07; 69,556.81), with inpatient stay making up the biggest percentage of cost (49.2%). CONCLUSION: Only 16% (13 attendances) of those attending through our pathway required neurosurgical intervention. Investigations for possible blocked shunt come at significant health, social, and financial cost. High rates of shunt failure, re-attendance, investigations, and inpatient stays incur a sizable financial burden to the healthcare system.","Tong, Liting; Higgins, Louise; Sivakumar, Gnanamurthy; Tyagi, Atul; Goodden, John; Chumas, Paul",Childs nerv. syst,41,16

An online cross-sectional survey was applied. Data were collected from N = 263 healthcare workers in Tabasco State, Mexico. We developed and administered a questionnaire, which consisted of sociodemographic characteristics, plus four sections. The sections evaluated were (1) knowledge of COVID-19; (2) feelings/emotions during the COVID-19 outbreak; (3) factors that caused stress and (4) factors that helped to reduce stress. Surveyed individuals were divided into three groups: physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers. When we evaluated their knowledge of COVID-19 we observed that the majority of healthcare workers in the three groups reported that they knew about COVID-19. Physicians indicated that they felt insecure about practicing their profession (62.5%) due to the high risk of being in contact with SARS-CoV-2. With regards to stressor factors, the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to their families was the main factor causing moderate to high stress (95.4%). Finally, we found that ""your profession puts your life at risk"" was the only factor associated with feeling nervous and scared (PR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.54-6.43). We recommended health education campaigns, introductory courses on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, management protocols and the provision of protection equipment to health workers in order to reduce personal and professional fears of contagion and to improve the health system in Mexico when facing epidemics.","Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín; Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; Fresán, Ana; González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz; Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso; Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther; López-Narváez, María Lilia; Martínez-Magaña, José Jaime; Nicolini, Humberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),41,24

Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. MAIN TEXT: The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior.

In this prospective study of 176 patients with COVID-19 infection, we found that plasma levels of &#945;-defensins were elevated, tracked with disease progression/mortality or resolution and with plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimers. Immunohistochemistry revealed intense deposition of &#945;-defensins in lung vasculature and thrombi. IL-6 stimulated the release of &#945;-defensins from neutrophils, thereby accelerating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis in human blood, imitating the coagulation pattern in COVID-19 patients. The procoagulant effect of IL-6 was inhibited by colchicine, which blocks neutrophil degranulation.

TNR can undergo somatic instability that is mediated by DNA damage and repair, and gene transcription. Recent studies have pointed towards a role for R-loops in causing TNR expansion and deletion, and it's been shown that base excision repair (BER) can result in CAG repeat deletions from R-loops in yeast. However, it remains unknown how BER in R-loops can mediate TNR instability. In this study, using biochemical approaches, we examined BER enzymatic activities and their influence on TNR-R-loops. We found that AP endonuclease 1 incised an abasic site on the non-template strand of a TNR R-loop, creating a double-flap intermediate containing an RNA-DNA hybrid that subsequently inhibited pol ß DNA synthesis of TNRs. This stimulated flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) cleavage of TNRs engaged in an R-loop. Moreover, we showed that FEN1 also efficiently cleaved the RNA strand, facilitating pol ß loop/hairpin bypass synthesis and the resolution of TNR R-loops through BER. Consequently, this resulted in fewer TNRs synthesized by pol ß than those removed by FEN1, thereby leading to repeat deletion. Our results indicate that TNR R-loops preferentially lead to repeat deletion during BER by disrupting the balance between the addition and removal of TNRs. Our discoveries open a new avenue for the treatments and prevention of repeat expansion diseases and cancer.","Laverde, Eduardo E; Lai, Yanhao; Leng, Fenfei; Balakrishnan, Lata; Freudenreich, Catherine H; Liu, Yuan",J. biol. chem,41,26

Mandates for training organisations to reduce social contact during the global pandemic, and make learning available online, provide an opportunity for regional, rural and remote clinicians and students to more easily access learning and professional development opportunities. Online lectures, while posing an opportunity for regional, rural and remote HPE, entail potential risks. Educators who are familiar with face-to-face pedagogies may find a transition to remote, digital interaction unfamiliar, disarming, and therefore they may not design maximally engaging lectures. The strategies used in a face-to-face lecture cannot be directly transferred into the online environment. This article proposes strategies to ensure the ongoing effectiveness, efficiency and engagement of lectures transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Cognitive learning theory, strategies to promote learner engagement and minimise distraction, and examples of software affordances to support active learning during the lecture are proposed. This enables lecturers to navigate the challenges of lecturing in an online environment and plan fruitful online lectures during this disruptive time. These suggestions will therefore enable HPE to better meet the existing and future needs of regional, rural and remote learners who may not be able to easily access face-to-face learning upon the relaxation of social distancing measures.

METHODS: A total of 535 COVID-19 patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, chronic eye diseases, systemic concomitant symptoms, radiologic findings and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by real-time PCR was collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of 535 patients, 27 patients (5.0%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 4 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 5.9 ± 4.5 days (mean [SD]). The other ocular symptoms, including increased conjunctival secretion, ocular pain, photophobia, dry eye and tearing, were also found in patients with conjunctival congestion. Notably, hand-eye contact was independently correlated with conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had chronic eye diseases, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.2%), xerophthalmia (24, 4.5%) and keratitis (14, 2.6%). Similar to the published studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough and fatigue. A total of 343 patients (64.1%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival congestion is one of the COVID-19-related ocular symptoms, which could occur as the initial symptoms. Frequent hand-eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID-19. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection.","Chen, Liwen; Deng, Chaohua; Chen, Xuhui; Zhang, Xian; Chen, Bo; Yu, Huimin; Qin, Yuanjun; Xiao, Ke; Zhang, Hong; Sun, Xufang",Acta Ophthalmol,41,9

Vaccination coverage is suboptimal in inflammatory bowel disease population. It is of paramount importance to ensure an effective and rapid vaccination program with the adherence of the largest number of well-informed patients. AIMS: We assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among inflammatory bowel disease patients. METHODS: We performed a survey as part of routine practice, between January 8th and February 22nd, 2021. All consecutive adult patients followed at Nancy University Hospital for inflammatory bowel disease were included. Patients completed a self-administered, structured, paper-based questionnaire. Demographic data, medical history, knowledge, and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination were collected. RESULTS: Among the 104 patients who responded to the survey, 57 patients (54.8%) had intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine efficacy, social responsibility, herd immunity, and desire to return to normal life were associated with self-reported willingness to receive a vaccine (20.2%, 20.2%, 11.5%, and 15.4%, respectively). Unknown long-term safety, risk of adverse reaction to vaccine and concern that the vaccine is being developed too quickly were the most commonly reported reasons for non-uptake (27.9%, 15.4%, and 12.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Half of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease would like to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This rate is similar to that reported in the French general population. Despite some concerns, patients with inflammatory bowel disease understood the necessity to be vaccinated against COVID-19.","Caron, Bénédicte; Neuville, Elise; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Dig. dis. sci,41,24

Though preventive vaccines and treatment methods are out on the market, a specific cure for the disease has not been discovered. Recent investigations and research studies primarily focus on the immunopathology of the disease. A healthy immune system responds immediately after viral entry, causing immediate viral annihilation and recovery. However, an impaired immune system causes extensive systemic damage due to an unregulated immune response characterized by the hypersecretion of chemokines and cytokines. The elevated levels of cytokine or hypercytokinemia leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with multiple organ damage. Moreover, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with race, gender, and age;hence, this viral infection’s outcome differs among the patients. Many therapeutic strategies focusing on immunomodulation have been tested out to assuage the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is essential before contemplating relief measures. This present review explains the interrelationships of hyperinflammatory response or cytokine storm with organ damage and the disease severity. Furthermore, we have thrown light on the diverse mechanisms and risk factors that influence pathogenesis and the molecular pathways that lead to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple organ damage.

Patients with a history of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) at a tertiary care transplant center in Detroit, Michigan were retrospectively reviewed from March until May 2020. Clinical parameters and outcomes of 5 OHT recipients and one combined heart-lung recipient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. The cohort was predominately African American males with median age of 59 years (interquartile range, 48.25-73.25). All patients were classified as having mild-moderate disease; none required intubation or ICU admission with no deaths. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and shortness of breath 83% (n = 5), followed by cough and chills 67% (n = 4). All admitted patients (n = 5) received hydroxychloroquine and 3 received high-dose steroids. Antimetabolites were held for 2 patients (33.3%). The calcineurin inhibitor trough goal was decreased in only 1 patient; 3 other patients, without change in goal, required calcineurin inhibitor dosage reduction. Two patients requiring readmission presented 7 and 23 days after initial symptoms onset. In conclusion, our experience with OHT patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not have an elevated risk of severe infection.

The aim of this study is to analyse the commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to practising sport, sports habits and the profile of the Spanish population during lockdown according to the level of addiction to exercise. The sample consisted of 1019 subjects with a mean age of 35 years old. The variables analysed were exercise addiction, commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to sport, and sport habits. Three groups were identified according to their addiction level to exercise: asymptomatic (n = 202), symptomatic (n = 756), and at risk of addiction (n = 61). The main results indicated that a higher addiction level was associated with a higher number of days and time spent on exercise per week. Six percent of the subjects were at addiction risk, and they had a lower feeling of insecurity towards sport. These findings provide information to governments on the need to promote physical activity programmes at home to promote adequate fitness and mental wellbeing in the population.","Berengüí, Rosendo; López-Gullón, José María; Angosto, Salvador",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),41,3

However, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized, and two more will be approved soon, according to a World Health Organization report on December 12, 2020. Many COVID-19 patients show symptoms of acute lung injury that eventually leads to pulmonary fibrosis. Our aim in this article is to present the relationship between pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, with a focus on angiotensin converting enzyme-2. We also evaluate the radiological imaging methods computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) for visualization of patient lung condition. Moreover, we review possible therapeutics for COVID-19 using four categories: treatments related and unrelated to lung disease and treatments that have and have not entered clinical trials. Although many treatments have started clinical trials, they have some drawbacks, such as short-term and small-group testing, that need to be addressed as soon as possible.","Yim, Joowon; Lim, Hee Hyun; Kwon, Youngjoo",Arch Pharm Res,41,26

OBJECTIVE: To compare the administration or not of oral calcifediol on mortality risk of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, open, non-randomized cohort study. SETTINGS: Hospitalized care. PATIENTS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 5 February and 5 May 2020 in five hospitals in the South of Spain. INTERVENTION: Patients received calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) treatment (0.266 mg/capsule, 2 capsules on entry and then one capsule on day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) or not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In-hospital mortality during the first 30 days after admission. RESULTS: A total of 537 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 (317 males (59%), median age, 70 years), and 79 (14.7%) received calcifediol treatment. Overall, in-hospital mortality during the first 30 days was 17.5%. The OR of death for patients receiving calcifediol (mortality rate of 5%) was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.61) compared to patients not receiving such treatment (mortality rate of 20%; p < 0.01).

A recent study showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could reduce the negative impact of PICs; hence, we conducted the present study to investigate if NAC can also reduce the negative prognostic impact of IBL. METHODS: We reviewed 115 gastric cancer patients treated with NAC and radical gastrectomy. The cut-off for IBL predicting the long-term survival was assessed by a receiver operating characteristic curve. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the association between patient characteristics including IBL, overall survival, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: The cut-off for IBL was set at 990 ml. Twenty-six patients had excessive IBL exceeding 990 ml (22.6%) and PICs developed in 33 patients (28.7%). The body mass index, IBL, ypT, and ypN were significant independent prognostic predictors, but PICs were not. CONCLUSION: NAC did not decrease the risk induced by excessive IBL.

It is well-known that these agents can prolong the QTc interval and potentially induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP). We aim to assess the prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmic events in COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs. METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies reporting peak QTc &#8805;500 ms, peak QTc change &#8805;60 ms, peak QTc interval, peak change of QTc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, or atrioventricular block (AVB). All meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies (three case series, 35 cohorts, and nine randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) involving 13 087 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of peak QTc &#8805;500 ms was 9% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3%-18%) and 8% (95%CI, 3%-14%) in patients who received hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, respectively. Likewise, the use of hydroxychloroquine (risk ratio [RR], 2.68; 95%CI, 1.56-4.60) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (RR, 3.28; 95%CI, 1.16-9.30) was associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation compared to no treatment. Ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, and AVB were reported in <1% of patients across treatment groups. The only two studies that reported individual data of lopinavir/ritonavir found no cases of QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine with or without azithromycin had a relatively high prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation. However, the prevalence of arrhythmic events was very low, probably due to underreporting. The limited information about lopinavir/ritonavir showed that it does not prolong the QTc interval.","Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Brañez-Condorena, Ana; Hernandez, Adrian V",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,41,2

Actions aimed at women's economic empowerment through income transfer programs are one of those. Still, the literature on their impact is scarce and controversial. This study attempts to shed some light on this matter assessing whether the Brazilian Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Programa Bolsa Família [PBF]) is a protective factor for psychological and physical IPV against women in families of different levels of income. This is a cross-sectional, household-based study conducted in the city of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sample comprised 807 women reporting some intimate relationship in the 12 months before the interview. Information on IPV and participation on PBF were collected through face-to-face interviews using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) and a direct question, respectively. A multigroup path analysis was applied to study the relations between PBF and psychological and physical IPV, considering confounding factors, some mediators, and moderation by income. The prevalence of both psychological and physical IPV are high, be it in the poverty and the extreme poverty income strata (psychological IPV: 66.2% and 72.7%, respectively; physical IPV: 26.2% and 40.6%, respectively). Results also showed a positive and direct association between PBF and psychological violence, yet only among families above the poverty line (ß = .287, p = .001). The same could be found regarding physical violence, but the effect of PBF was indirect, mediated by psychological violence (ß = .220, p = .003). Findings suggest that actions aimed at preventing IPV should go hand in hand with the PBF and, perhaps, other income transfer programs. This is even more relevant in relation to the less extreme poverty group where cash transfer may further raise conflicts and violence.","Leite, Tatiana Henriques; de Moraes, Claudia Leite; Reichenheim, Michael Eduardo; Deslandes, Suely; Salles-Costa, Rosana",J Interpers Violence,41,24

In this work, we focus on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions, power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic. In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.","Chen, Yize; Yang, Weiwei; Zhang, Baosen",,41,15

Immunizations are not required, leaving refugees at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of State developed and co-funded a global immunization program for US-bound refugees, implemented in 2012 in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration. METHODS: We describe the Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees, including vaccination schedule development, program implementation and procedures, and responses to challenges. We estimate 2019 immunization coverage rates using the number of age-eligible refugees who received &#8805;1 dose of measles-containing vaccine during overseas health assessment, and calculated hepatitis B infection prevalence using hepatitis B surface antigen testing results. We report descriptive data on adverse events following immunization. RESULTS: By September 2019, the program was active in >80 countries on five continents. Nearly 320,000 examined refugees had &#8805;1 documented vaccine doses since program inception. During federal fiscal year 2019, 95% of arriving refugees had &#8805;1 documented measles-containing vaccine. The program's immunization schedule included eleven vaccines preventing fourteen diseases. In 2015-2019, only two vaccine preventable disease-associated refugee group travel cancellations occurred, compared to 2-8 cancellations annually prior to program initiation. To maintain uniform standards, dedicated staff and program-specific protocols for vaccination and monitoring were introduced. CONCLUSIONS: An overseas immunization program was successfully implemented for US-bound refugees. Due to reductions in refugee movement cancellation, lower cost of immunization overseas, and likely reductions in vaccine preventable disease-associated morbidity, we anticipate significant cost savings. Although maintaining uniform standards across diverse settings is challenging, solutions such as introduction of dedicated staff, protocol development, and ongoing technical support have ensured program cohesion, continuity, and advancement. Lessons learned can benefit similar programs implemented in the migration setting.","Mitchell, Tarissa; Dalal, Warren; Klosovsky, Alexander; Yen, Catherine; Phares, Christina; Burkhardt, Margaret; Amin, Farah; Froes, Ivan; Hamadeh, Amira; Lynn, Sai Aung; Quintanilla, Judith; Doney, Annelise Casano; Cetron, Martin; Weinberg, Michelle",Vaccine,41,7

This has been driven by the lack of existing effective direct acting antivirals for coronaviruses, the marginal clinical impact of remdesivir and the relative lack of efficacy of antivirals against other respiratory pathogens, combined with the failure of repurposed drugs. This review explores the potential utility of mAb targeting SARS-CoV-2, to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection. The use of mAb against host factors (e.g. tocilizumab targeting IL-6 receptor and canakinumab targeting IL1-β) to mitigate the inflammatory response seen in progressive disease will not be considered. This review will primarily consider mAb that have direct neutralising activity via their targeting of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein focussing on: the targets of mAb;how they mediate viral neutralisation;their propensity to generate escape mutants;their clinical use so far, and their likely place in the therapeutic play book.","Kelleher, A.

How SARS-CoV-2 is able to achieve high titer in the absence of symptoms remains unclear. Here, we examine the upper airway host transcriptional response in patients with COVID-19 (n = 93), other viral (n = 41) or non-viral (n = 100) acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Compared with other viral ARIs, COVID-19 is characterized by a pronounced interferon response but attenuated activation of other innate immune pathways, including toll-like receptor, interleukin and chemokine signaling. The IL-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are markedly less responsive to SARS-CoV-2, commensurate with a signature of diminished neutrophil and macrophage recruitment. This pattern resembles previously described distinctions between symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infections and may partly explain the propensity for pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19. We further use machine learning to build 27-, 10- and 3-gene classifiers that differentiate COVID-19 from other ARIs with AUROCs of 0.981, 0.954 and 0.885, respectively. Classifier performance is stable across a wide range of viral load, suggesting utility in mitigating false positive or false negative results of direct SARS-CoV-2 tests.","Mick, Eran; Kamm, Jack; Pisco, Angela Oliveira; Ratnasiri, Kalani; Babik, Jennifer M; Castañeda, Gloria; DeRisi, Joseph L; Detweiler, Angela M; Hao, Samantha L; Kangelaris, Kirsten N; Kumar, G Renuka; Li, Lucy M; Mann, Sabrina A; Neff, Norma; Prasad, Priya A; Serpa, Paula Hayakawa; Shah, Sachin J; Spottiswoode, Natasha; Tan, Michelle; Calfee, Carolyn S; Christenson, Stephanie A; Kistler, Amy; Langelier, Charles",Nat Commun,41,24

This study evaluated differences in several mental health and well-being measures according to relationship quality during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures. A cross-sectional online survey was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in Austria. Relationship quality was measured with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI), and mental health measures included quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). ANOVAs with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests and Chisquared tests were applied. In all mental health scales, individuals with good relationship quality (n = 543) scored better than individuals with poor relationship quality (n = 190) or without relationship (n = 272). The odds ratios (OR) between the poor and good relationship quality groups were 3.5 for the PHQ-9, 3.4 for the GAD-7, and 2.0 for the ISI. Additionally, individuals without no relationship scored better on all scales than individuals with poor relationship quality (all p-values < .05). Relationship quality was related to mental health during COVID-19. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased according to relationship quality from 13% up to 35%. Relationship per se was not associated with better mental health, but the quality of the relationship was essential. Compared to no relationship, a good relationship quality was a protective factor whereas a poor relationship quality was a risk factor.","Pieh, Christoph; O Rourke, Teresa; Budimir, Sanja; Probst, Thomas",PLoS One,41,10

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation.

All patients underwent hematochemical tests, LUS examinations, chest CT, and confirmatory rRT-PCR. The diagnostic performance of LUS and chest CT was calculated with rRT-PCR as a reference. The interobserver agreement of radiologists and ultrasound examiners was calculated. Ultrasound and CT features were compared to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Positive and negative likelihood ratios measured the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Nineteen (30%) patients were COVID-19 negative, and 44 (70%) were positive. No differences in demographics and clinical data at presentation were observed among positive and negative patients. Interobserver agreement for CT had a &#954; value of 0.877, whereas for LUS, it was 0.714. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia were 93%, 90%, 85%, and 95%, respectively; whereas for LUS, they were 68%, 79%, 88%, and 52%. On receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve values were 0.834 (95% confidence interval, 0.711-0.958) and 0.745 (95% confidence interval, 0.606-0.884) for chest CT and LUS. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound had good reliability compared to chest CT. Therefore, our results indicate that LUS may be used to assess patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia.","Fonsi, Giovanni Battista; Sapienza, Paolo; Brachini, Gioia; Andreoli, Chiara; De Cicco, Maria Luisa; Cirillo, Bruno; Meneghini, Simona; Pugliese, Francesco; Crocetti, Daniele; Fiori, Enrico; Mingoli, Andrea",J. ultrasound med,41,1

METHODS: The search was conducted on April 30 and May 7, 2020, using Ovid database and Google search. Patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as selected characteristics regarding antibiotic use (indication, class used, rates and types of bacterial secondary and co-infection, and duration of treatment) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies reporting data from 2834 patients were included. Mean rate of antibiotic use was 74.0 % of cases. Half the studies reported occurrence of a bacterial co-infection or complication (10 studies). Amongst the latter, at least 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections. Pooled data of 4 studies show that half of patients receiving antibiotics were not severe nor critical. Detailed data on antibiotic use lack in most articles. CONCLUSIONS: The present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.","Chedid, Marie; Waked, Rami; Haddad, Elie; Chetata, Nabil; Saliba, Gebrael; Choucair, Jacques",J Infect Public Health,41,26

Many measures to contain the pandemic are being employed like hospitalization of patients tested positive, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing. The consequent social isolation and the uncertainty of the disease has led to psychological distress. Aims and Objectives: The aim was to study the psychological distress and its associated factors in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done in a designated COVID center where patients tested positive were admitted from all over the state. A total of 222 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were screened using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and those who screened positive had their diagnosis confirmed by using the International Classification of Disease 10 criteria. Results: A total of 222 patients were screened of which 22.1% showed distress, 12.6% showed mild distress, and 9.5% moderate distress. Depression criteria were met by 5.5% and 3.2% had generalized anxiety disorder. Factors significantly associated with distress were deaths in the family and duration of hospitalization, whereas family members affected with COVID-19 were inversely related to psychological distress. Conclusion: Having a number of family members affected and simultaneously admitted in the same hospital seems to have acted as a buffer against psychological distress. However, deaths in the family due to COVID-19 and long duration of hospitalization were found to be factors associated with psychological distress. Efforts should be made to treat not only the physical health but also address the psychological distress in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. © 2021 Archives of Mental Health ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Pingali, S.; Joopaka, A.

Our aim was to continue the regular physical health monitoring of North East Hampshire CMHRS patients who are prescribed lithium during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to achieve above 90% compliance for the monitoring standards. Lithium monitoring clinics have been established in our CMHRS since 2017, Lithium is a high-risk medication as recognised by a National Patient Safety Alert in 2009. Previous annual POMH-UK audits have identified suboptimal monitoring of Lithium patients at local and national levels.MethodThe ‘Plan-Do-Study-Act’ (PDSA) approach was utilised and a ‘QI Bundle’ formed. A database of patients who are prescribed lithium has been created and maintained. Synchronised standardised reminder letters are sent to the patients twice yearly. NICE recommends that patients on lithium have their lithium levels checked every 3 months for the first year and then at least every 6 months, plus TFTs, U&Es, calcium and weight every 6 months (or more frequently if impaired). The Specialist Pharmacist Service advise that during the COVID-19 pandemic, if patients are not in the at-risk category then monitoring intervals can be extended by up to 3 months, but that patients in the at-risk category should have their normal monitoring intervals continued.Lithium clinics have been held every April and October since 2017 by the Junior Doctors allocated to NE Hampshire CMHRS. This year they were conducted via telephone appointment or face to face where safe to do so with clinician in full PPE. An audit was subsequently carried out in December 2020 to assess our patient's compliance with the aforementioned NICE recommendations for lithium monitoring, the results of which were compared to previous annual audits.ResultSeventeen patients were currently prescribed lithium within the NE Hampshire CMHRS. Over 90% compliance with monitoring was achieved in December 2020 apart from the checking of calcium levels which was slightly below target at 82%, and weight which was at 88%. There was no significant reduction in monitoring standards obtained compared to data from the previous three years.ConclusionRoutine monitoring for our patients who are prescribed Lithium was effectively and safely continued during the pandemic. Above 90% compliance with lithium monitoring standards was nearly obtained across all areas. We will continue to offer lithium monitoring twice yearly.","Gardner, Katherine Shuttleworth Charles",BJPsych Open,41,15

Due to the emergency situation in the public health system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as a measure of social accountability, remote medical care services and online education were adopted in order to continue following the curricular program and to provide assistance to local city governments. Experience report: Two months before graduation, medical students followed-up on the monitoring of residents and COVID-19 healthcare professionals of forty-three ILPIs (Long-Term Elderly Care Facilities) in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The medical students made daily telephone calls to all these ILPI units, requesting information, generally from the head nurses and owners, about the main COVID-19 symptoms that were detected in the residents and employees of these facilities. All the collected information was discussed daily with the teacher in charge of mentoring the program, fed into an online database and into a work schedule chart, then relayed to the local Municipal Health Secretariat. A COVID-19 contingency plan was devised by the team, authorized by the Local Health Secretariat and then presented to the ILPIs, aiming to offer them the best guidance throughout the pandemic. Discussion: the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the Health Education System's fragilities, limitations and capacity to adapt to this crisis, thus largely contributing to improving the training of new medical doctors. During the program, medical students faced many challenges, especially regarding the difficulty to contact some ILPIs by telephone, omitted or erroneous information provided by employees in these facilities and delays in reporting suspected cases. In spite of this scenario, daily contact with these facilities allowed the team to identify the ILPIs that were more adequately prepared and the ones that needed auditing and further supervision. Also, this daily contact established a bond between the team and the ILPIs. Conclusion: During the pandemic, it was possible to perform actions according to the logic of social accountability, demonstrating that remote online medical practice is a tool capable of both maintaining interns in contact with the practical aspects of medical care and providing medical assistance to the community and to the local government.","Bertasso, Carolina Pimentel; Guerra, Amanda Cristina Netto; Pereira, Fernanda; Nakazato, Lissa; Delatore, Lara Godela; Anbar Neto, Toufic; Spadacio, Cristiane",Rev. bras. educ. méd,41,21

In the early days of the pandemic, US president Donald J Trump has endorsed the use of unproven therapies. Subsequently, a death attributed to the wrongful ingestion of a chloroquine-containing compound occurred. OBJECTIVE: We investigated Donald J Trump's speeches and Twitter posts, as well as Google searches and Amazon purchases, and television airtime for mentions of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir. METHODS: Twitter sourcing was catalogued with Factba.se, and analytics data, both past and present, were analyzed with Tweet Binder to assess average analytics data on key metrics. Donald J Trump's time spent discussing unverified treatments on the United States' 5 largest TV stations was catalogued with the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, and his speech transcripts were obtained from White House briefings. Google searches and shopping trends were analyzed with Google Trends. Amazon purchases were assessed using Helium 10 software. RESULTS: From March 1 to April 30, 2020, Donald J Trump made 11 tweets about unproven therapies and mentioned these therapies 65 times in White House briefings, especially touting hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These tweets had an impression reach of 300% above Donald J Trump's average. Following these tweets, at least 2% of airtime on conservative networks for treatment modalities like azithromycin and continuous mentions of such treatments were observed on stations like Fox News. Google searches and purchases increased following his first press conference on March 19, 2020, and increased again following his tweets on March 21, 2020. The same is true for medications on Amazon, with purchases for medicine substitutes, such as hydroxychloroquine, increasing by 200%. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in positions of power can sway public purchasing, resulting in undesired effects when the individuals' claims are unverified. Public health officials must work to dissuade the use of unproven treatments for COVID-19.","Niburski, Kacper; Niburski, Oskar",J Med Internet Res,41,16

It is now becoming obvious that the problem of the current pandemic cannot be reduced to individual states and regions and has the potential to influence the entire political organization of the modern world. Analyzing the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in world politics, the authors rely on the concept of transformations in the system of the world political organization, as well as the concept of global governance and megatrends of world politics, the key of which is globalization. The authors of the article consider the experience of individual global and regional associations, which are considered to be the elements of global governance, whose functions, among the other, include responding to challenges of a biogenic nature, identifying several important trends, among which are the intensification of previously emerging trends, the strengthening of isolationism, the growing political fragmentation of the world, destructive influence of ""coronacrisis"" on globalization, but with parallel sectoral polarization in global economy, a new balancing between cooperation and competition in international relations. At the same time, it is argued that there is no alternative to international cooperation in solving problems of a global nature, which can hardly indicate the end of globalization and the triumph of disintegration and de-democratization. The authors argue about the heightened need to reform global governance, since the efforts of individual international associations cannot lead to solving global challenges, and the national-centrist approach to solving global problems proves its inefficiency and irresponsibility. As a result, we are talking about the lack of alternative to the idea of forming a system of global governance, which should be based on cooperation and interaction of states, international organizations and institutions, as well as business structures and academic communities, in other words, rely on multilateral and multilevel approach. The authors are convinced of the need to develop a project of an ""ideal future"" taking into account the identified trends in the transformation of the political organization of the world and the effects of megatrends, which implies the further development of scientific research and discussions, as well as a series of international negotiating forums on the future structure of the world and the corresponding pattern of global governance.","Lebedeva, M.

Moving beyond typical settings in the exponential distribution family, it is usually challenging to prove the existence and further construct such UMVUE in finite samples. For example in the ongoing Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), it is hard to characterize the complete sufficient statistics of the underlying treatment effect due to pre-planned modifications to design aspects based on accumulated unblinded data. As an alternative solution, we propose a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) guided ensemble learning framework to construct an improved estimator from existing ones. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically reaches the minimal variance within the class of linearly combined estimators. Simulation studies are further performed to demonstrate that our proposed estimator has considerable finite-sample efficiency gain. In the ACTT on COVID-19 as an important application, our method essentially contributes to a more ethical and efficient adaptive clinical trial with fewer patients enrolled.","Zhan, T.; Fu, H.; Kang, J.",,41,6

Neurological manifestations are observed more frequently in patients with coronavirus disease. Main text: The aim of the review is to seek evidence for infection of the nervous system by the human coronavirus and study the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus and its treatment. A search was done in PubMed, Google Scholar, CrossRef, and Scopus. There is evidence for the coronavirus infection of the nervous system from experimental studies, autopsy reports, and clinical studies. The virus can damage the nervous system either by direct viral damage to the neural cells or by immunopathology. Cerebral edema, neuronal degeneration, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, polyneuritis, toxic encephalopathy, and stroke can occur. The coronavirus has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction technique in infected patients. The abnormalities of the coagulation system increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Chloroquine analogs, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and immunoglobulin have been shown to be useful for the treatment. Conclusion: There is substantial evidence for infection of the nervous system by the different strains of the human coronavirus. The coronavirus enters the nervous system either by the blood or from the olfactory nerves. The neurological diseases correlate with the severity of the coronavirus disease. The treatment is mainly supportive. The reports of patients with encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis show slow recovery. But a stroke has a high mortality.","Unnithan, Ajaya Kumar Ayyappan",Egypt J Neurol Psychiatr Neurosurg,41,24

Methods: This study examined a cohort of 54 residents of a long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation program from March to April 2020. Baseline demographics, clinical diagnoses, and vital signs were examined to look for statistical differences between positive versus negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) groups. During the early phase of the pandemic, the facility closely followed the local shelter-in-place order (starting March 19, 2020) and symptom-based testing. Results: Of the residents, the primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizoaffective disorder: 28 (51.9%), schizophrenia: 21 (38.9%), bipolar I disorder: 3 (5.5%), and unspecified psychotic disorder: 2 (3.7%). Forty (74%) of 54 residents tested positive for SARS-COV-2, with a doubling time of 3.9 days. There were no statistical differences between the positive SARS-COV-2 versus negative groups for age or race/ethnicity. Psychiatric and medical conditions were not significantly associated with contracting SARS-COV-2, with the exception of obesity (n = 17 [43%] positive vs n = 12 [86%] negative, P = .01). Medical monitoring of vital signs and symptoms did not lead to earlier detection. All of the residents completely recovered, with the last resident no longer showing any symptoms 24 days from the index case. Conclusion: Research is needed to determine optimal strategies for long-term care mental health settings that incorporate frequent testing and personal protective equipment use to prevent rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2.","Xiong, Glen L; Atkin, Alec; Moquin, Kelly; Candido, MarieChristi; Beilenson, Peter; Kasirye, Olivia; Wasserman, Michael; Blum, Patricia; Hilty, Donald",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins, and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.","Azgari, Cem; Kilinc, Zeynep; Turhan, Berk; Circi, Defne; Adebali, Ogun",Viruses,41,20

Our objective is to report our practice implementation and experience of COVID-19 recovery during the resumption of routine imaging at a tertiary academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines for this practice implementation. Recover Wisely focused on a data driven, strategic rescheduling and redesigning patient flow process. We used scheduling simulations and meticulous monitoring and control of outpatient medical imaging volumes to achieve a linear restoration to our pre-COVID imaging studies. We had a tiered plan to address the backlog of rescheduled patients with gradual opening of our imaging facilities, while maintaining broad communication with our patients and referring clinicians. RESULTS: Recover Wisely followed our anticipated linear modeling. Considering the last 10 weeks in the recovery, outpatient growth was linear with an increase of approximately 172 cases per week, (R2 =0.97). We achieved an overall recovery of 102% in week 10, as compared to average weekly pre-COVID outpatient volumes. The modalities recovered as follows in outpatient volumes: CT (113%), MRI (101%), nuclear medicine including PET (138%), mammograms (97%), ultrasound (99%) and interventional radiology (106%). When compared to identical 2019 calendar weeks (May 4, 2020-July 10, 2020), the total 2020 radiology volume was 11% reduced from the 2019 volume. The reduction in total weighted relative value units was 8% in this time period, as compared to 2019.

However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these ""future"" viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of ""future"" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Eguia, Rachel T; Crawford, Katharine H D; Stevens-Ayers, Terry; Kelnhofer-Millevolte, Laurel; Greninger, Alexander L; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael J; Bloom, Jesse D",PLoS Pathog,41,1

Students report a desire to resume in-person learning but safety and flexibility are paramount to achieve this instructional modality. Flipping the classroom is a teaching approach that promotes independent learning outside of class with activity-based exercises within the classroom. Benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student engagement, course flexibility, and enhanced learning. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the utility of flipping the classroom on learning physiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized undergraduate Human Physiology students (n = 124) during the fall 2020 semester. Course content was provided as asynchronous online lectures with 3 ? 5 new videos released weekly. Students independently viewed the lectures outside of class and completed a synchronous weekly online quiz before a weekly in-person lecture recitation with masks and social distancing. Lecture recitations (50 min) were designed to review, reinforce and practice lecture material?they were generally structured as follows: 1) review most difficult concepts from recent lectures;2) answer questions collected via collaborative online document;3) complete/discuss practice questions via iClicker;and 4) complete/discuss mini-case studies or real-world scenarios. Sessions were recorded for asynchronous viewing. To supplement lecture, students also completed 3 traditional wet labs and 3 virtual labs (ADInstruments). At the conclusion of the semester, students were offered extra credit (&lt;1% course total) to complete a survey regarding their experience with the flipped classroom environment and perceived barriers to academic success. Student demographics: 71% were female, 52% were nursing majors and 50% were sophomores. Students felt that the flipped classroom design fit well into their schedules (87%) and they learned a lot of material (85%) that was applicable to their lives (90%) and future careers (94%). Students agreed that their questions were answered during lecture recitation (66%), the sessions helped them understand difficult material (70%), and they benefited from the in-person practice (71%). The majority (68%) stated that lecture recitations improved their physiology education. Despite these positive responses, 60% of students still reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted their physiology education. Top barriers to educational success included increased stress (77%), working more (52%), lack of motivation (45%), increased family obligations (44%), and feeling overwhelmed (39%). In addition, 20% of students reported contracting COVID-19 and 42% had to self-isolate due to exposure. These data demonstrate the benefits of a flipped classroom model to teach undergraduate physiology. This research also highlights the increased challenges that students face as they attempt to continue their education during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Desaulniers, Amy",The FASEB Journal,41,21

The disease, later named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), was caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency. COVID-19 is now a global pandemic impacting more than 43,438,043 patients with 1,158,596 deaths globally as of August 26th, 2020. COVID-19 is highly contagious and has caused more deaths than SARS in 2002-2003 or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-2013 combined and represents an unprecedented human affliction not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918. COVID-19 has been associated with several cardiac complications, including hypercoagulability, acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at the highest risk for myocardial injury and mortality among infected patients. The mechanism by which COVID-infected patients develop cardiac complications remains unclear, though it may be mediated by increased ACE-2 gene expression. Despite initial concerns, there is no evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy increases risk for myocardial injury among those infected with COVID-19. In the current report, we summarize the peer-reviewed and preprint literature on cardiovascular risks and complications associated with COVID-19, as well as provide insights into its pathogenesis and management.","Krittanawong, Chayakrit; Kumar, Anirudh; Hahn, Joshua; Wang, Zhen; Zhang, Hong Ju; Sun, Tao; Bozkurt, Biykem; Ballantyne, Christie M; Virani, Salim S; Halperin, Jonathan L; Jneid, Hani",Am J Cardiovasc Dis,41,24

Old age and underlying illnesses are associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. However, whether frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of reduced reserve to stressors, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged &#8805; 60 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients (&#8805; 60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted between 7 February 2020 and 6 April 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for frailty on admission using the FRAIL scale, in which five components are included: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. The outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to identify the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frailty and severe illness. The significant variables in univariable analysis were included in the adjusted model. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, (median age, 67 years; interquartile range = 64-75 years; 57 [50%] men), 39 (34.2%), 39 (34.2%), and 36 (31.6%) were non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. During the 60 days of follow-up, 43 severe diseases occurred including eight deaths. Four of 39 (10.3%) non-frail patients, 15 of 39 (38.5%) pre-frail patients, and 24 of 36 (66.7%) frail patients progressed to severe disease. After adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, haemoglobin, white blood count, lymphocyte count, albumin, CD8+ count, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, frailty (HR = 7.47, 95% CI 1.73-32.34, P = 0.007) and pre-frailty (HR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.16-21.61, P = 0.03) were associated with a higher hazard of severe disease than the non-frail. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, assessed by the FRAIL scale, was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease among older COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that the use of a clinician friendly assessment of frailty could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ma, Yao; Hou, Lisha; Yang, Xiufang; Huang, Zhixin; Yang, Xue; Zhao, Na; He, Min; Shi, Yixin; Kang, Yan; Yue, Jirong; Wu, Chenkai",BMC Med,41,10

However, the effects of asthma, asthma medication, and asthma severity on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 have not yet been established. METHODS: The study included 7590 de-identified patients, who were confirmed to have COVID-19 using the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 RNA-polymerase chain reaction tests conducted up to 15th May 2020; and we used the linked-medical claims data provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Asthma and asthma severity (step suggested by GINA) was defined using the diagnostic code and history of asthma medication usage. RESULTS: Among 7590 COVID-19 patients, 218 (2.9%) had underlying asthma. The total medical cost associated with COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma was significantly higher than that of other patients. Mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma (7.8%) was significantly higher than that of other patients (2.8%; p<0.001). However, asthma was not an independent risk factor for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 after adjustment. Asthma medication use and asthma severity also did not affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. However, use of oral short-acting ß2-agonists (SABA) was an independent factor to increase the total medical cost burden.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about the mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population are now arising. Yet, information on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population have not been comprehensively reported in Thailand. As such, we conduct a cross-sectional study, a national online survey to describe the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand. METHODS: This study is a repeated cross-sectional study, an open online voluntary national-based survey during the wave I (April 21-May 4, 2020) follow-up in the wave II (August 3-16, 2020), wave III (November 15-28, 2020), and a 1-year follow-up survey (wave IV: April 21-May 4, 2021) in Thailand. Health care workers at the hospitals and the adult general population will be invited to participate in the online survey via the SurveyMonkey that limits one-time participation per unique internet protocol address. The target sample size of at least 1182 health care workers and 1310 general populations will be required to complete the online survey for each wave of the survey. Sociodemographic characteristics and a set of measurement tools for mental and psychosocial problems for each subcohort including depression, anxiety, stress, resilient copings, neuroticism, perceived social support, wellbeing, somatic symptoms, insomnia, burnout (for healthcare workers), and public stigma toward COVID-19 infection (for the general population) will be collected. For all estimates of prevalence, we will weigh data for all wave analyses under the complex design of the survey. Subgroup analyses stratified by key characteristics will also be done to analyze the proportion differences. For the repeated cross-sectional survey, we will combine the data from the wave I to wave IV survey to analyze changes in the mental health status. We will perform multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts to explore associations with individual-level and region-level/hospital-level predictors. We also plan to perform an ancillary systematic review and meta-analysis by incorporating data from our findings to all available evidence. RESULTS: Our findings will provide information on the short- and long-term mental health status as well as the psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 outbreak in a national sample of health care workers and the general population in Thailand.

These bias effects threatens the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.","Borland, David; Zhang, Jonathan; Kaul, Smiti; Gotz, David",,41,22

The absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are no vaccines available, social distancing is the only feasible approach to fight against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to monitor the social distancing in real-time.","Punn, Narinder Singh; Sonbhadra, Sanjay Kumar; Agarwal, Sonali",,41,13

CASE PRESENTATION: An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4º C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION: This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome. The patient was also one of the earliest admitted with COVID-19 in a Norwegian hospital and marked a new phase of the epidemic, as he had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Borén, Håkon Kinck; Kjøstolfsen, Gjertrud Hole; Aaløkken, Trond Mogens; Latif, Nadim; Brekke, Hanne; Lind, Andreas; Hesstvedt, Liv",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,41,29

Variants have the potential to affect transmission, disease severity, diagnostics, therapeutics, and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. In November 2020, CDC established national surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants using genomic sequencing. As of May 6, 2021, sequences from 177,044 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens collected during December 20, 2020-May 6, 2021, from 55 U.S. jurisdictions had been generated by or reported to CDC. These included 3,275 sequences for the 2-week period ending January 2, 2021, compared with 25,000 sequences for the 2-week period ending April 24, 2021 (0.1% and 3.1% of reported positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, respectively). Because sequences might be generated by multiple laboratories and sequence availability varies both geographically and over time, CDC developed statistical weighting and variance estimation methods to generate population-based estimates of the proportions of identified variants among SARS-CoV-2 infections circulating nationwide and in each of the 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) geographic regions.* During the 2-week period ending April 24, 2021, the B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants represented an estimated 66.0% and 5.0% of U.S. SARS-CoV-2 infections, respectively, demonstrating the rise to predominance of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC) and emergence of the P.1 VOC in the United States. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance methods to analyze surveillance data produces timely population-based estimates of the proportions of variants circulating nationally and regionally. Surveillance findings demonstrate the potential for new variants to emerge and become predominant, and the importance of robust genomic surveillance. Along with efforts to characterize the clinical and public health impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants, surveillance can help guide interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.","Paul, Prabasaj; France, Anne Marie; Aoki, Yutaka; Batra, Dhwani; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Dugan, Vivien; Galloway, Summer; Hall, Aron J; Johansson, Michael A; Kondor, Rebecca J; Halpin, Alison Laufer; Lee, Brian; Lee, Justin S; Limbago, Brandi; MacNeil, Adam; MacCannell, Duncan; Paden, Clinton R; Queen, Krista; Reese, Heather E; Retchless, Adam C; Slayton, Rachel B; Steele, Molly; Tong, Suxiang; Walters, Maroya S; Wentworth, David E; Silk, Benjamin J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,41,29

Methods: An electronic literature search using PubMed was conducted to identify relevant research studies published between December 2019 and August 2020. Twenty-five studies were selected out of 1,041 studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, which highlight patients' satisfaction and experience with the use of telemedicine during the pandemic. Results: The findings based upon 48,144 surveyed patients and 146 providers in 12 different countries revealed high satisfaction with virtual encounters across a spectrum of diseases. Telemedicine was found satisfactory on various outcome measures, such as addressing patients' concerns, communication with health care providers, usefulness, and reliability. Most common advantages were time saved due to lesser traveling and waiting time, better accessibility, convenience, and cost efficiency. Age and sex did not significantly impact the satisfaction levels. Physicians and patients both showed a strong preference for continued usage and agreed upon telemedicine's potential to complement the regular health care services even after the pandemic. Technical challenges (reported in 10 studies) and lack of physical examination (reported in 13 studies) were the main limitations encountered in virtual visits. Conclusion: Long-term sustainability of telemedicine for all socioeconomic classes requires closer scrutiny of issues such as technology, training, reimbursement, data privacy, legal guidelines, and framework. Telemedicine must be adopted as a proactive strategy and scaled-up even beyond emergency usage due to its immense potential in complementing conventional health care services, such as diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, surveillance, and infection control.","Nanda, Mehak; Sharma, Rajesh",Telemed. j. e. health,41,24

Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are at risk of burnout and the COVID-19 pandemic may increase this risk. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of burnout risk and identify risk factors among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Web-based survey performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in French speaking Belgium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS: A total of 1135 ICU nurses responded to the questionnaire. The overall prevalence of burnout risk was 68%. A total of 29% of ICU nurses were at risk of depersonalisation (DP), 31% of reduced personal accomplishment (PA), and 38% of emotional exhaustion (EE). A 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratio increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07-2.95) and DP (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-2.40). Those who reported having a higher perceived workload during the COVID-19 pandemic were at higher risk for all dimensions of burnout. Shortage of personal protective equipment increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.35-3.34) and nurses who reported having symptoms of COVID-19 without being tested were at higher risk of EE (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.68-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of ICU nurses were at risk of burnout and this risk was associated with their working conditions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend monitoring the risk of burnout and implementing interventions to prevent and manage it, taking into account the factors identified in this study.","Bruyneel, Arnaud; Smith, Pierre; Tack, Jérôme; Pirson, Magali",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,41,24

Accordingly, we developed a rapid health impact assessment (HIA) to evaluate positive and negative health effects of telework on these groups and recommended easily implementable countermeasures. METHODS: Immediately after an emergency was declared in Japan, we implemented a rapid, five-step HIA. We screened and categorized health effects of telework for the three above-mentioned groups, extracting their content, directionality, and likelihood. Following a scoping exercise to determine the HIA's overall implementation, five experienced occupational health physicians appraised and prioritized the screened items and added new items. We outlined specific countermeasures and disseminated the results on our website. A short-term evaluation was conducted by three external occupational health physicians and three nurses. RESULTS: Following screening and appraisal, 59, 29, and 27 items were listed for teleworkers, non-teleworkers, and family members of teleworkers, respectively, covering work, lifestyle, disease and medical care, and home and community. Targeted countermeasures focused on the work environment, business management, communications, and lifestyles for teleworkers; safety and medical guidelines, work prioritization, and regular communication for non-teleworkers; and shared responsibilities within families and communication outside families for family members of teleworkers. CONCLUSION: The HIA's validity and the countermeasures' practical applicability were confirmed by the external evaluators. They can be easily applied and adapted across diverse industries to mitigate the wider negative effects of telework and enhance its positive effects.","Nagata, Tomohisa; Ito, Daisuke; Nagata, Masako; Fujimoto, Ayumi; Ito, Ryotaro; Odagami, Kiminori; Kajiki, Shigeyuki; Uehara, Masamichi; Oyama, Ichiro; Dohi, Seitaro; Fujino, Yoshihisa; Mori, Koji",J Occup Health,41,10

Deep learning methods are promising in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images. Most of these works first train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune the model on the newly collected COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset, often at a much smaller scale. However, simple fine-tuning may lead to poor performance due to two issues, firstly the large domain shift present in chest x-ray datasets and secondly the relatively small scale of the COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA). SODA is designed to align the data distributions across different domains in the general domain space and also in the common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). As PGs play diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses, inhibiting PG production with NSAIDs could affect COVID-19 pathogenesis in multiple ways, including: (1) altering susceptibility to infection by modifying expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; (2) regulating replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells; and (3) modulating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate these potential roles. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates COX-2 in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. In contrast, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NSAID treatment reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by reduced neutralizing antibody titers. Our findings indicate that NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication.ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are critical for the generation of prostaglandins - lipid molecules with diverse roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs could therefore have multiple effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that NSAID treatment reduced both the antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of NSAIDs to modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has important implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis in patients. Whether this occurs in humans and whether it is beneficial or detrimental to the host remains an important area of future investigation. This also raises the possibility that NSAIDs may alter the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Chen, Jennifer S; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Chow, Ryan D; Wei, Jin; Filler, Renata B; Eisenbarth, Stephanie C; Wilen, Craig B",J. virol,41,1

Traditional biostatistical methods for risk estimations require: (i) the number of infected people who were not hospitalized, which may be severely undercounted since many infected people were not tested; (ii) comorbidity information for people not hospitalized, which may not always be readily available. We aim to overcome these limitations by developing a Bayesian approach to estimate the risk ratio of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We derived a Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the risk ratio using the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. We applied our approach to two large-scale datasets in the United States: 2491 patients in the COVID-NET, and 5700 patients in New York hospitals. RESULTS: Our results consistently indicated that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our approach only needs (i) the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their comorbidity information, which can be reliably obtained using hospital records, and (ii) the prevalence of the comorbidity of interest in the general population, which is regularly documented by public health agencies for common medical conditions. CONCLUSION: We developed a novel Bayesian approach to estimate the hospitalization risk for people with comorbidities infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Gao, Xiang; Dong, Qunfeng",J. am. med. inform. assoc,41,23

Early symptoms overlap with other common conditions such as common cold and Influenza, making early screening and diagnosis are crucial goals for health practitioners. The aim of the study was to use machine learning (ML), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a simple statistical test to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from full blood counts without knowledge of symptoms or history of the individuals. The dataset included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2 patients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 94-95%) and those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC = 80-86%). Here, AUC is the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure for model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts can be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The normalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes, and an increase in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a characteristic immune response profile pattern and changes in different parameters measured in the full blood count that are detected from simple and rapid blood tests. While symptoms at an early stage of infection are known to overlap with other common conditions, parameters of the full blood counts can be analysed to distinguish the viral type at an earlier stage than current rt-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 allow at present. This new methodology has potential to greatly improve initial screening for patients where PCR based diagnostic tools are limited.","Banerjee, Abhirup; Ray, Surajit; Vorselaars, Bart; Kitson, Joanne; Mamalakis, Michail; Weeks, Simonne; Baker, Mark; Mackenzie, Louise S",Int Immunopharmacol,41,14

Cancer mortality rates in Africa are substantially higher than those of the rest of the world, which may be partly attributed to lack of RT access and insufficient human resources. The Access to Care (A2C) Cape Town RT training programme was created in 2014 with the aim of supplementing practical RT training in the region, focusing on clinics moving from 2 to 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The programme makes use of hybrid teaching methods, including pre-course e-learning followed by 17 on-site days of free-thinking design exercises, didactic learning, hands-on treatment planning computer sessions (39% of total teaching time), virtual simulation training and departmental demonstration sessions. Email support is offered to all teams for 3 months after each course to develop clinical protocols. Thirteen teams (radiation oncologist, medical physicist and radiation therapy technologist) from Africa attended the course between 2015 and 2019, with additional participants from seven South African and four international centres. E-learning done on the LaraNara training platform was only successful once formal progress tracking was introduced in 2019 (34% vs. 76% test completion rate). Delays between course attendance and initial clinical use of equipment proved to be detrimental to knowledge retention, with some centres having to send a second team for training. The course will be modified for remote teaching in 2021, to make provision for the global changes in travel due to Covid-19.","Burger, H.; Wyrley-Birch, B.; Joubert, N.; Trauernicht, C.

The development of an effective vaccine will take several months to become available, and its affordability is unpredictable. Transfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) may provide passive immunity. Based on initial data from China, a group of hematologists, infectious disease specialists, and intensivists drafted this protocol in March 2020. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of CP in treating patients with COVID-19 across Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Eligible patients with COVID-19 will be recruited for CP infusion according to the inclusion criteria. As COVID-19 has proven to be a moving target as far as its management is concerned, we will use current definitions according to the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. All CP recipients will receive supportive management including all available recommended therapies according to the available MOH guidelines. Eligible CP donors will be patients with COVID-19 who have fully recovered from their disease according to MOH recovery criteria as detailed in the inclusion criteria. CP donors have to qualify as blood donors according to MOH regulations except for the history of COVID-19 in the recent past. We will also test the CP donors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a rapid test, and aliquots will be archived for future antibody titration. Due to the perceived benefit of CP, randomization was not considered. However, we will compare the outcome of the cohort treated with CP with those who did not receive CP due to a lack of consent or lack of availability. In this national collaborative study, there is a likelihood of not finding exactly matched control group patients. Hence, we plan to perform a propensity score matching of the CP recipients with the comparator group patients for the major characteristics. We plan to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of both groups and compare the outcomes. A total sample size of 575 patients, 115 CP recipients and 460 matched controls (1:4 ratio), will be sufficient to detect a clinically important hospital stay and 30-day mortality difference between the two groups with 80% power and a 5% level of significance. RESULTS: At present, patient recruitment is still ongoing, and the interim analysis of the first 40 patients will be shared soon. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a protocol for a national collaborative multicenter phase II study in Saudi Arabia for assessing the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of CP in treating patients with severe COVID-19. We plan to publish an interim report of the first 40 CP recipients and their matched comparators soon.

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described.

Automated detection of lung infections and their boundaries from medical images offers a great potential to augment the patient treatment healthcare strategies for tackling COVID-19 and its impacts. Detecting this disease from lung CT scan images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose patients. However, finding the presence of infected tissues and segment them from CT slices faces numerous challenges, including similar adjacent tissues, vague boundary, and erratic infections. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a two-route convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting global and local features for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. Each pixel from the image is classified into the normal and infected tissues. For improving the classification accuracy, we used two different strategies including fuzzy c-means clustering and local directional pattern (LDN) encoding methods to represent the input image differently. This allows us to find more complex pattern from the image. To overcome the overfitting problems due to small samples, an augmentation approach is utilized. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved precision 96%, recall 97%, F score, average surface distance (ASD) of 2.8 ± 0.3 mm, and volume overlap error (VOE) of 5.6 ± 1.2%.","Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid; Bendechache, Malika; Amirabadi, Amir; Ab Rahman, Mohd Nizam; Baseri Saadi, Soroush; Aghamohammadi, Amirhossein; Kooshki Forooshani, Mersedeh",Biomed Res Int,41,26

Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 µg/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection. The study identified a versatile antimicrobial peptide in humans as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment using dual mechanisms, thus providing a potential candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and treatment.","Wang, Cheng; Wang, Shaobo; Li, Daixi; Chen, Peiqin; Han, Songling; Zhao, Gaomei; Chen, Yin; Zhao, Jianqi; Xiong, Jiachuan; Qiu, Jingfei; Wei, Dong-Qing; Zhao, Jinghong; Wang, Junping",ACS Infect Dis,41,16

Some viruses have neuroinvasive properties and activate the immune response in the brain. These immune events may be neuroprotective or they may cause long-term damage similar to what is seen in some neurodegenerative diseases. The new ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the Respiratory viruses causing highly acute lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical similarities to those reported in ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus""(SARS-CoV) and the ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus""(MERS-CoV) including neurological manifestation. To examine the possible neurological damage induced by SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to understand the immune reactions to viral infection in the brain, and their short- and long-term consequences. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which will be discussed, cooperative homological and phylogenetical studies lead us to question if SARS-CoV-2 can have similar neuroinvasive capacities and neuroinflammatiory events that may lead to the same short- and long-term neuropathologies that SARS-CoV had shown in human and animal models.

Henceforth, the discovery of the potential drugs is an urgent and utmost requirement for the medical fraternity. Since, the side effects of plant-derived compounds will be lower compared to synthetic/chemical drugs. The Main protease (3CLpro or NSP5) and endoribonuclease (NSP15) proteins are necessity for viral replication and its survival in the host cell. In the present study, in-silico approach of drug development was used to search for potential antiviral plant-derived compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins. Eight plant-derived compounds of which the antiviral activity was known and available, and two reported drugs against SARS-CoV-2 selected for the molecular docking analysis. The docking results suggested that bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, scutellarin, quercetin and myricetin showed least binding energy, i.e., greater than -6.5 Kcal/mol against 3CLpro and endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease.

This study aims to assess whether the use of doppler ultrasound, in cases with intermediate clinical suspicion of testicular torsion, can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to clinical assessment alone. METHODS: We implemented a new clinical algorithm where patients with intermediate suspicion of testicular torsion undergo doppler ultrasound within 60 min. This study compared the patients that presented within one year prior to the implementation (group 1) to the patients who presented within one year after the implementation (group 2). The primary outcome measure was failure to confirm testicular torsion upon surgical exploration (negative surgical exploration). Missed testicular torsion was one of the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: 590 consecutive patients were included. 322 (55%) in group 1 and 268 (45%) in group 2. There were 9 (2.8%) testicular torsions in group 1 vs 9 (3.4%) in group 2 (p = 0.69) and 2 (0.6%) missed testicular torsions in group 1 vs 0 in group 2 (p = 0.50). Doppler ultrasound was performed in 65 patients (24.2%) in group 2 vs 0 in group 1 (p < 0.01). Negative surgical exploration was performed in 27 (8.4%) patients in group 1 vs 8 (3.0%) in group 2 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasound assessment of patients at intermediate clinical risk of testicular torsion significantly reduced the frequency of negative surgical explorations without increased rate of missed testicular torsions.","Teurneau-Hermansson, Karl; Zindovic, Igor; Jakobsson, Jon; Navntoft, Anders; Nozohor Ekmark, Ann; Salö, Martin; Wagenius, Magnus",Scand J Urol,41,20

Our objective was to model the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak progression in Italian regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemic's progression. Our setting was Italy, and especially Lombardy, which is experiencing a heavy burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The peak of new daily cases of the epidemic has been reached on the 29th, while was delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. In our models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection, both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day-by-day assessments based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. The two methods provide an agreement of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, each infected person in Lombardy has involved 4 other people (3.6 based on data of April 23rd) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68, as reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to our model, Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche will reach an R0 value of up to 3.5. The R0 was 3.11 for Lazio and 3.14 for the Campania region, where the latter showed the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.11), Sicily (2.99), Abruzzo (3.0), Calabria (2.84), Basilicata (2.66), and Molise (2.6). The R0 value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions. The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April. Regarding the strengths and limitations of this study, our model is based on assumptions that might not exactly correspond to the evolution of the epidemic. What we know about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is based on Chinese data that seems to be different than those from Italy; Lombardy is experiencing an evolution of the epidemic that seems unique inside Italy and Europe, probably due to demographic and environmental factors.","Distante, Cosimo; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),41,29

Methods: A total of 32 children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 24 and February 12, 2020 from four provinces in western China were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and quarantine 14 days later. Results: Eleven children (34%) were asymptomatic, among whom six children had normal computed tomographic (CT) scan images. Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD =7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test. Conclusions: Children with asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for the same duration as symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with FDPCs in posterior areas were clinically and radiographically re-evaluated. Mesial and distal radiographic marginal bone levels (mBLs) from baseline (i.e. delivery of FDPC) to the follow-up examination were calculated and compared between implant surfaces adjacent to and distant from the cantilever extension. Implant survival rate, pocket probing depth (PPD), presence/absence of bleeding on probing (BoP) and presence/absence of mechanical/technical and biological complications were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with 30 FDPCs supported by 60 implants were re-evaluated after a mean loading time of 13.3 ± 2.7 years (range: 10-18.6 years). One diameter-reduced implant carrying a cantilever extension fractured, yielding a patient-based survival rate of 96.2% (95% CI: 0.95/1.0). The mean marginal bone level change was not statistically significantly different from baseline to follow-up (1.2 mm ± 0.9 to 1.6 mm ± 1.7; 95% CI: -0.1/0.9; p>0.05). The mean PPD changed statistically significantly from 3.4 mm ± 0.7 to 3.7 mm ± 0.7 (95% CI: 0.04/0.6; p=0.02). Loss of retention occurred &#8805; 1x in 9 patients (34.6%, 95% CI: 0.44/0.83).

Results from a single-center observational study,15.452825,10.691069,2020,"BACKGROUND: Elevated proinflammatory cytokines are associated with greater COVID-19 severity. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in patients with severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19. METHODS: We did a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 trial at 45 hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, and Spain. We included adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:1 with permuted blocks of five) to receive intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. Patients, care providers, outcome assessors, and investigators remained masked to assigned intervention throughout the course of the study. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement of two or more points (seven point scale ranging from 1 [death] to 7 [discharged from hospital]) in the modified intention-to-treat population. The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04327388; EudraCT, 2020-001162-12; and WHO, U1111-1249-6021. FINDINGS: Between March 28 and July 3, 2020, of 431 patients who were screened, 420 patients were randomly assigned and 416 received placebo (n=84 [20%]), sarilumab 200 mg (n=159 [38%]), or sarilumab 400 mg (n=173 [42%]). At day 29, no significant differences were seen in median time to an improvement of two or more points between placebo (12·0 days [95% CI 9·0 to 15·0]) and sarilumab 200 mg (10·0 days [9·0 to 12·0]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·03 [95% CI 0·75 to 1·40]; log-rank p=0·96) or sarilumab 400 mg (10·0 days [9·0 to 13·0]; HR 1·14 [95% CI 0·84 to 1·54]; log-rank p=0·34), or in proportions of patients alive (77 [92%] of 84 patients in the placebo group; 143 [90%] of 159 patients in the sarilumab 200 mg group; difference -1·7 [-9·3 to 5·8]; p=0·63 vs placebo; and 159 [92%] of 173 patients in the sarilumab 400 mg group; difference 0·2 [-6·9 to 7·4]; p=0·85 vs placebo). At day 29, there were numerical, non-significant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +8·9% [95% CI -7·7 to 25·5]; p=0·25) for patients who had critical disease. No unexpected safety signals were seen. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 65% (55 of 84) in the placebo group, 65% (103 of 159) in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 70% (121 of 173) in the sarilumab 400 mg group, and of those leading to death 11% (nine of 84) were in the placebo group, 11% (17 of 159) were in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 10% (18 of 173) were in the sarilumab 400 mg group. INTERPRETATION: This trial did not show efficacy of sarilumab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in patients with critical COVID-19.

Therefore, this review aimed to examine the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms among pregnant women and postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched for articles from November 2019 to December 2020. Twenty-six observational studies and brief reports were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of anxiety was greater than depression in both antenatal and postnatal periods, and the prevalence of depression was higher in the antenatal period than the postnatal period. The pooled prevalence for antenatal anxiety symptoms, antenatal depressive symptoms and postnatal depressive symptoms were 40% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.27-0.52), 27% (95% CI: 0.20-0.33) and 17% (95% CI: 0.10-0.24), respectively.

The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. RESULTS: Between 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (nâ=â40) and control (nâ=â40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (Pâ=â1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RT-PCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (Pâ>â0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, larger randomized clinical trials including more parameters are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of SOF/VEL.","Sayad, Babak; Khodarahmi, Reza; Najafi, Farid; Miladi, Ronak; Mohseni Afshar, Zeinab; Mansouri, Feizollah; Rahimi, Zohreh; Shirvani, Maria; Salimi, Mehdi; Vaziri, Siavash; Janbakhsh, Alireza; Khosravi Shadmani, Fatemeh; Bozorgomid, Arezoo; Zamanian, Mohammad Hossein; Afsharian, Mandana",J. antimicrob. chemother,41,18

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is known to be expressed on type II pneumocytes. As a counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that regulating the ACE2/RAS system is effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV. Vitamin D was found to affect ACE2, the target of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, we propose that vitamin D might alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2.","Xiao, Dongqiong; Li, Xihong; Su, Xiaojuan; Mu, Dezhi; Qu, Yi",Int J Infect Dis,41,5

In both bacteria and archaea, transcriptional factors play important roles in regulation of CRISPR adaptation and interference. In the model Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus, a CRISPR-associated factor Csa3a triggers CRISPR adaptation and activates CRISPR RNA transcription for the immunity. However, regulation of DNA repair systems for repairing the genomic DNA damages caused by the CRISPR self-immunity is less understood. Here, according to the transcriptome and reporter gene data, we found that deletion of the csa3a gene down-regulated the DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including the ups and ced genes. Furthermore, in vitro analyses demonstrated that Csa3a specifically bound the DDR gene promoters. Microscopic analysis showed that deletion of csa3a significantly inhibited DNA damage-induced cell aggregation. Moreover, the flow cytometry study and survival rate analysis revealed that the csa3a deletion strain was more sensitive to the DNA-damaging reagent. Importantly, CRISPR self-targeting and DNA transfer experiments revealed that Csa3a was involved in regulating Ups- and Ced-mediated repair of CRISPR-damaged host genomic DNA. These results explain the interplay between Csa3a functions in activating CRISPR adaptation and DNA repair systems, and expands our understanding of the lost link between CRISPR self-immunity and genome stability.","Liu, Zhenzhen; Sun, Mengmeng; Liu, Jilin; Liu, Tao; Ye, Qing; Li, Yingjun; Peng, Nan",Nucleic acids res,41,24

In the mid-20th Century the relationship between drug metabolism and toxicity became appreciated, and the roles of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes began to be defined in the 1960s. Today we understand much about the metabolism of drugs and many aspects of safety assessment in the context of a relatively small number of human P450s. P450s affect drug toxicity mainly by either reducing exposure to the parent molecule or, in some cases, by converting the drug into a toxic entity. Some of the factors involved are enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition (both reversible and irreversible), and pharmacogenetics. Issues related to drug toxicity include drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, and the roles of chemical moieties of drug candidates in drug discovery and development. The maturation of the field of P450 and drug toxicity has been facilitated by advances in analytical chemistry, computational capability, biochemistry and enzymology, and molecular and cell biology. Problems still arise with P450s and drug toxicity in drug discovery and development, and in the pharmaceutical industry the interaction of scientists in medicinal chemistry, drug metabolism, and safety assessment is critical for success.","Guengerich, F Peter",Toxicol Res,41,24

For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the knowledge and the different actions in the management of thromboprophylaxis in work environments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study with data collection through a Google® form with 19 questions for professionals involved in the care of COVID-19. 414 surveys were received. The quantitative variables were represented with means and standard deviation and the qualitative variables with percentages and confidence intervals. RESULTS: 414 surveys analyzed. 58.2% were women. The most participatory age group was 56-65 years. 95.2% stated that COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis. 93.6% considered that outpatient COVID-19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis. 60.5% of the physicians did not know any protocol for the evaluation of thrombotic risk in these patients. Low molecular weight heparin was considered the main treatment for thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of doctors consider that COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of suffering VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis than the general population, however more than a third do not assess the thrombotic risk and a significant percentage claim not to know protocols to evaluate said risk. The survey highlights the training needs of our professionals in thromboprophylaxis so that our patients receive healthcare with the highest possible quality.","García Vallejo, O; Frías Vargas, M; Gil Gil, I; Vázquez Gómez, N; Piera Carbonell, A; Peiró Morant, J","SEMERGEN, Soc.

Bangladesh and India are two densely populated South Asian developing countries with limited resources. Both countries face mass community transmission of the disease, with India facing severe infections and deaths. Predictably, a large population might sum up to a large amount of COVID-19-related BMW. There is also the question of capacity, whether the existing BMW policies and regulations of the regions can manage the BMW strategically driven by the pressure of the pandemic. Here, we have shown a framework leading to further environmental and community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic if the BMW generated at healthcare facilities and homes is not appropriately managed. The BMW, such as safety suits or personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, gloves, and shields, would likely damage the environment in the long run by creating microplastic pollution. Modification and modernization of the existing policies, plans, and guidelines on the proper management of the hospital and household infectious waste is suggested. Moreover, occupational health and safety assessments for waste management workers at the hospitals are recommended. Installing suitable capacity incinerators and related infrastructures are recommended for appropriate waste management. In the absence of incinerators, the existing industrial furnaces, cement kilns, and mobile incinerators can be used with a rapid impact assessment adhering to the appropriate implementations of the policies and guidelines.","Shammi, Mashura; Behal, Arvind; Tareq, Shafi M",Environ. sci. technol,41,6

The aim of the study was to assess if alterations in gene expression of microRNAs associated with diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in whole peripheral blood of children aged 3-11 years descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. A substantially altered microRNA expression profile was found in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. Almost all microRNAs with the exception of miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated. The microRNA expression profile also differed between children after normal and GDM complicated pregnancies in relation to the presence of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and/or valve problems and heart defects. Always, screening based on the combination of microRNAs was superior over using individual microRNAs, since at 10.0% false positive rate it was able to identify a large proportion of children with an aberrant microRNA expression profile (88.14% regardless of clinical findings, 75.41% with normal clinical findings, and 96.49% with abnormal clinical findings). In addition, the higher incidence of valve problems and heart defects was found in children with a prior exposure to GDM. The extensive file of predicted targets of all microRNAs aberrantly expressed in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies indicates that a large group of these genes is involved in ontologies of diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. In general, children with a prior exposure to GDM are at higher risk of later development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, and would benefit from dispensarisation as well as implementation of primary prevention strategies.","Hromadnikova, Ilona; Kotlabova, Katerina; Dvorakova, Lenka; Krofta, Ladislav; Sirc, Jan",,41,20

Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.","Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Alenazi, Thamer H; Alhejazi, Ayman; Al Safi, Faisal; Al Olayan, Ashwaq",JCO Glob Oncol,41,16

This paper focuses on the link between illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and infectious disease pathogens. A literature review through Web of Science and relevant conference proceedings from 1990 to 2020 resulted in documenting 82 papers and 240 identified pathogen cases. Over 60% of the findings referred to pathogens with known zoonotic potential and five cases directly referenced zoonotic spillover events. The diversity of pathogens by taxa included 44 different pathogens in birds, 47 in mammals, 16 in reptiles, two in amphibians, two in fish, and one in invertebrates. This is the highest diversity of pathogen types in reported literature related to IWT. However, it is likely not a fully representative sample due to needed augmentation of surveillance and monitoring of IWT and more frequent pathogen testing on recovered shipments. The emergence of infectious disease through human globalization has resulted in several pandemics in the last decade including SARS, MERS, avian influenza H1N1,and Ebola.

However, not all individuals may have been affected in the same way. In addition to situational factors such as occupation, family status, and health, personality traits may affect how individuals experienced the initial crisis. METHODS: Using data from the pairfam COVID-19 survey, an online survey of the participants of the German Family Panel pairfam conducted from May to July 2020, as well as personality data from the pairfam panel data, this study analyzes whether the Big Five personality traits influence the degree to which young and middle-aged individuals (16-49 years old) felt negatively affected by and were able to see any benefits of the initial COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. RESULTS: While neuroticism is linked to a more negative perception of the restrictions to daily life, openness to experiences is associated with more positive perceptions of the situation. Like neuroticism, extraversion is also associated with a more negative perception, but only among respondents without a partner. For respondents with a romantic partner, no association was found. CONCLUSION: Results confirm that personality plays a role in individual perceptions of the pandemic situation. Moreover, they show that most individuals perceived not only negative but also positive aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in 2020.","Schmiedeberg, Claudia; Thönnissen, Carolin",Soc Sci Med,41,13

METHODS: Prospective repeated-measures cohort study on a sample of participants aged 60 and over. A total of 2, 785 respondents at the baseline (May 2019) were followed during the COVID-19 (August 2020). The changes in psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 were assessed using generalized estimation equations with adjusting for sex, age, education, economic status, marital status, tea drinking status, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, sedentary time, sleep quality and ADL. RESULTS: The psychological distress of older people has significantly increased in August 2020 compared with May 2019. Both older adults who remained frail and transitioned into frail state reported more psychological distress during the COVID-19. Similarly, both pre-existing multimorbidity and emerging multimorbidity groups were associated with more psychological distress. The group of frailty progression who reported new emerging multimorbidity showed more increase in psychological distress, in comparison with those remained non-frail state who reported no multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has increased among the community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained and progressive frail state, as well as multimorbidity were all associated with a greater increase of psychological distress. These findings suggest that future public health measures should take into account the increased psychological distress among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assessment of frailty and multimorbidity might help in warning of psychological distress.","Wang, Yi; Fu, Peipei; Li, Jie; Jing, Zhengyue; Wang, Qiong; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Chengchao",Age ageing,41,29

We apply our technique to coupled ordinary and partial differential equation models of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics operating on different scales, that is, within a single organism and between several hosts. The structure of a model is assessed by the theory of chemical organizations, not requiring quantitative kinetic information. We present the Hasse diagrams of organizations for the twelve virus models analyzed within this study. For comparing models, each organization is characterized by the types of species it contains. For this, each species is mapped to one out of four types, representing uninfected, infected, immune system, and bacterial species, respectively. Subsequently, we can integrate these results with those of our former work on Influenza-A virus resulting in a single joint hierarchy of 24 models. It appears that the SARS-CoV-2 models are simpler with respect to their long term behavior and thus display a simpler hierarchy with little dependencies compared to the Influenza-A models. Our results can support further development towards more complex SARS-CoV-2 models targeting the higher levels of the hierarchy.","Peter, Stephan; Dittrich, Peter; Ibrahim, Bashar",Viruses,41,2

The masks are accepted by the public. People with a pollen allergy have an interest in knowing whether masks can also provide protection against pollen and thus prevent symptoms even without medication. Method: In order to evaluate the potential 'antipollen effect' of face masks, 14 adults with confirmed grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were exposed to grass pollen for a period of two hours following a standardised protocol. The test was conducted outside of the grass pollen season. The subjects wore either no mask, a medical mask or a FFP2 mask. Results: Subjects wearing either mask were clearly able to avoid both nasal and conjunctival symptoms. There were no significant differences between the two masks in terms of effect. Mask wearing to prevent pollen exposure clearly supports overall well-being.

We conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies that reported the association of CVD with worse prognosis and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Literature search through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase was completed by 2 reviewers from November 1, 2019 to April 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were observational case-control or cohort studies on COVID-19 patients with a history of CVD included, which reported outcomes of COVID-19 infection severity, clearly outlined the definition of ""severe disease"" and with sample size >10. Data were abstracted independently by 2 authors. Studies were divided into 2 separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs nonsevere) and mortality (nonsurvivors vs survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. A total of 18 studies (nâ¯=â¯4858 patients) were included. Sixteen studies were from China, while 2 were from the United States.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64-327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5-9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100-379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing's disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 °C) and chest pain. Oxygen therapy, antibiotics and symptomatic treatments lead to full recovery 24 days later. A 66-year-old woman with a 4-year medical history of mild CD (late-night serum cortisol 603.4 nmol/L, LNSC 10.03 nmol/L) tested positive for COVID-19 in routine screening and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with CS depends on the severity of hypercortisolism. Thus, severe hypercortisolism is a warning sign that CS affected by COVID-19 could require emergency care despite a lack of clinical presentations and low inflammation biomarkers.","Belaya, Zhanna; Golounina, Olga; Melnichenko, Galina; Tarbaeva, Natalia; Pashkova, Evgenia; Gorokhov, Maxim; Kalashnikov, Viktor; Dzeranova, Larisa; Fadeev, Valentin; Volchkov, Pavel; Dedov, Ivan",Endocrine,41,6

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs.","Beeraka, Narasimha M; Sadhu, Surya P; Madhunapantula, SubbaRao V; Rao Pragada, Rajeswara; Svistunov, Andrey A; Nikolenko, Vladimir N; Mikhaleva, Liudmila M; Aliev, Gjumrakch",Front Immunol,41,5

Method: A total of 20 online and six land-based faculty completed e-mail interviews both one month and 3 months post self-isolation. Results: Online faculty were more satisfied with their home workplace, but both groups felt more negative about their online work, as they felt a loss of freedom and independence due to the isolation. Conclusions: Findings indicated that both land-based and online faculty showed indications of stress due to self-isolation, which in turn affected their feelings about work. Gaining a sense of control seems to be essential to reducing stress over time. Implication for theory and/or practice: Future researchers may wish to examine the relationship of feelings of employee burnout to the stress of the pandemic. How working from home interacts with burnout is not yet known, particularly for online faculty.

Lianhuaqingwen capsule (LHQW-C), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula widely used for respiratory diseases, shows therapeutic efficacy in the application of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the active ingredients, drug targets, and the therapeutic mechanisms of LHQW-C in treating COVID-19 are poorly understood. In this study, an integrating network pharmacology approach including pharmacokinetic screening, target prediction (targets of the host and targets from the SARS-CoV-2), network analysis, GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and virtual docking were conducted. Finally, 158 active ingredients in LHQW-C were screen out, and 49 targets were predicted. GO function analysis revealed that these targets were associated with inflammatory response, oxidative stress reaction, and other biological processes. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of LHQW-C were highly enriched to several immune response-related and inflammation-related pathways, including the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and Th17 cell differentiation. Moreover, four key components (quercetin, luteolin, wogonin, and kaempferol) showed a high binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro). The study indicates that some anti-inflammatory ingredients in LHQW-C probably modulate the inflammatory response in severely ill patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Xiaobo; Gao, Rui; Zhou, Zubing; Tang, Xuehua; Lin, Jingjing; Wang, Long; Zhou, Xin; Shen, Tao",Int J Med Sci,41,6

Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. OBJECTIVE: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. PARTICIPANTS & SETTING: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. METHODS: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-the-moment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. RESULTS: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","Wolf, Jennifer Price; Freisthler, Bridget; Chadwick, Caileigh",Child Abuse Negl,41,16

This makes them more vulnerable to danger and hazards, and they thus have a higher risk of injury. Safety education such as teaching safety rules and tips is vital to prevent children from injuries. Although game-based approaches have the potential to capture children's attention and sustain their interest in learning, whether these new instructional approaches are more effective than traditional approaches in delivering safety messages to children remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a game-based intervention in promoting safety knowledge and behaviors among Hong Kong school children in Grades 4-6. It will also examine the potential effect of the game-based intervention on these children's functioning and psychosocial difficulties. METHODS: This study comprises the development of a city-based role-playing game Safe City, where players are immersed as safety inspectors to prevent dangerous situations and promote safety behavior in a virtual city environment. The usability and acceptability tests will be conducted with children in Grades 4-6 who will trial the gameplay on a mobile phone. Adjustments will be made based on their feedback. A 4-week randomized controlled trial with children studying in Grades 4-6 in Hong Kong elementary schools will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the Safe City game-based intervention. In this trial, 504 children will play Safe City, and 504 children will receive traditional instructional materials (electronic and printed safety information). The evaluation will be conducted using both child self-report and parent proxy-report data. Specifically, child safety knowledge and behaviors will be assessed by a questionnaire involving items on knowledge and behaviors, respectively, for home safety, road safety, and sport-related safety; child functioning will be assessed by PedsQL Generic Core Scales; and psychosocial difficulties will be assessed by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. These questionnaires will be administered at 3 time points: before, 1 month, and 3 months after the intervention. Game usage statistics will also be reviewed. RESULTS: This project was funded in September 2019. The design and development of the Safe City game are currently under way. Recruitment and data collection will begin from September 2020 and will continue up to March 1, 2021. Full analysis will be conducted after the end of the data collection period. CONCLUSIONS: If the Safe City game is found to be an effective tool to deliver safety education, it could be used to promote safety in children in the community and upgraded to incorporate more health-related topics to support education and empowerment for the larger public.

Here, we investigate the relationship of spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 with the S protein of a closely related bat virus, RaTG13. We determined cryo-EM structures for RaTG13 S and for both furin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. We also biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although the overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are similar, there are key differences in their properties, including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about 1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor. These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor.","Wrobel, Antoni G; Benton, Donald J; Xu, Pengqi; Roustan, Chloë; Martin, Stephen R; Rosenthal, Peter B; Skehel, John J; Gamblin, Steven J",Nat Struct Mol Biol,41,16

Objetivo. Comparar las propiedades diagnósticas de cinco definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas o propuestas en Chile durante los primeros ocho meses de la pandemia. Métodos. Se analizaron las propiedades diagnósticas (sensibilidad, especificidad, y valores predictivos positivo y negativo) de tres definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas en Chile entre marzo y octubre del 2020, y dos propuestas de definición alternativas. La muestra fue de 2 019 personas con resultados conocidos a la prueba de la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) para SARS-CoV-2. Para elaborar el criterio 5 se aplicó una regresión logística escalonada (stepwise) optimizando los valores de sensibilidad y especificidad. Se exploró la asociación de variables demográficas, síntomas y signos con la positividad a la PCR mediante regresión logística multifactorial. Se analizaron diferentes escenarios de positividad y se compararon las curvas ROC. Resultados. La presencia de anosmia (OR = 8,00; IC95%: 5,34–11,99) y fiebre (OR = 2,15; IC95%: 1,28–3,59) y el haber tenido contacto estrecho previo con una persona enferma de COVID-19 (OR = 2,89; IC95%: 2,16–3,87) se asociaron con un resultado positivo de la PCR.

Therefore, the study of human-virus PPIs can help us understand the principles of human-virus relationships and can thus guide the development of highly effective drugs to break the transmission of viral infectious diseases. Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of experimentally identified human-virus PPI data, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for bioinformatics studies revolving around human-virus PPIs. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of computational studies on human-virus PPIs, especially focusing on the method development for human-virus PPI predictions. We briefly introduce the experimental detection methods and existing database resources of human-virus PPIs, and then discuss the research progress in the development of computational prediction methods. In particular, we elaborate the machine learning-based prediction methods and highlight the need to embrace state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms and new feature engineering techniques (e.g. the protein embedding technique derived from natural language processing). To further advance the understanding in this research topic, we also outline the practical applications of the human-virus interactome in fundamental biological discovery and new antiviral therapy development.","Lian, Xianyi; Yang, Xiaodi; Yang, Shiping; Zhang, Ziding",Brief. bioinform,41,2

While the impact of COVID-19 is affecting the general public, it is clear that these distressful experiences will be magnified in older adults, particularly people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), making them the most vulnerable group during this time. People with differing degrees of ADRD are especially susceptible to the virus, not only because of their difficulties in assessing the threat or remembering the safety measures, but also because of the likelihood to be subject to other risk factors, such as lack of proper care and psychological issues. Therefore, in this article, we will discuss the challenges related to home-based care for people with ADRD during a pandemic and propose a formulation of systematic solutions to address these challenges and to alleviate the social and economic impact resulting from the crisis.","Sm-Rahman, Atiqur; Lo, Chih Hung; Ramic, Azra; Jahan, Yasmin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),41,16

However, clinical trials have revealed that the co-administration of CQ and AZM resulted in severe side effects, including cardiac arrhythmia, in patients with COVID-19. To elucidate the cardiotoxicity induced by CQ and AZM, we examined the effects of these drugs based on the electrophysiological properties of human embryonic stem cellderived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) using multi-electrode arrays. CQ treatment significantly increased the field potential duration, which corresponds to prolongation of the QT interval, and decreased the spike amplitude, spike slope, and conduction velocity of hESC-CMs. AZM had no significant effect on the field potentials of hESC-CMs. However, CQ in combination with AZM greatly increased the field potential duration and decreased the beat period and spike slope of hESC-CMs when compared with CQ monotherapy. In support of the clinical data suggesting the cardiovascular side effects of the combination therapy of CQ and AZM, our results suggest that AZM reinforces the cardiotoxicity induced by CQ in hESC-CMs. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(10): 545-550].","Kim, Ye Seul; Lee, Soo Yong; Yoon, Jung Won; Kim, Dasol; Yu, Sangbin; Kim, Jeong Su; Kim, Jae Ho",BMB Rep,41,16

However, the quality of available evidence is generally low, and regulatory frameworks have focused on apps with medical purposes only, overlooking apps with significant interactions with patients that may require stronger oversight.Areas covered: To support this expanded evidence generation process, we identified the reasons that distinguish mHealth apps compared to medical devices at large and that should differentially feature their assessment. mHealth apps are characterized by the iterative nature of the corresponding interventions, frequent user interactions with a non-linear relationship between technology usage, engagement and outcomes, significant organizational implications, as well as challenges associated with genericization, their broad diagnostic potential, and price setting.Expert Opinion: The renewed reliance experienced during the pandemic and the unprecedented injection of resources through recovery instruments can further boost the development of apps. Only robust evidence of the benefits of mHealth apps will persuade health-care professionals and beneficiaries to systematically deploy them. Regulatory bodies will need to question their current approaches by adopting comprehensive evaluation processes that adequately consider the specific features of mHealth apps.","Tarricone, Rosanna; Petracca, Francesco; Ciani, Oriana; Cucciniello, Maria",Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,41,16

However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. In this study, we established air-liquid interface culture systems for pig bronchial epithelial cells (Ali-PBECs) that were comparable to the conditions in the native bronchus in vivo We used this Ali-PBECs model to study the infection and migration characteristics of M. hyopneumoniae in vitro Based on the results, we confirmed that M. hyopneumoniae was able to adhere to Ali-PBECs and disrupt mucociliary function. Importantly, M. hyopneumoniae could migrate to the basolateral chamber through the paracellular route but not the transcellular pathway, and this was achieved by reversibly disrupting tight junctions (TJs) and increasing the permeability and damaging the integrity of the epithelial barrier. We examined the migration ability of M. hyopneumoniae using an Ali-PBECs model for the first time. The disruption of the epithelial barrier allowed M. hyopneumoniae to migrate to the basolateral chamber through the paracellular route, which may be related to the immune evasion, extrapulmonary dissemination and persistent infection of M. hyopneumoniae.","Wang, Haiyan; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Xie, Xing; Liu, Beibei; Wei, Yanna; Gan, Yuan; Yuan, Ting; Ni, Bo; Wang, Jia; Zhang, Lei; Xiong, Qiyan; Shao, Guoqing; Feng, Zhixin",Infect. immun,41,32

Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID-19 mortality was higher among non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential-worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID-19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic.

Although there has been an increasing use of service dogs among children and youth their impact has not yet been synthesized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to conduct a systematic review assessing the impact of service dogs on children, youth and their families. METHODS: Systematic searches of seven international databases from 1985 to 2020 led to 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Using a narrative synthesis review approach we analyzed these studies regarding their sample characteristics, methods, results and quality of evidence. RESULTS: There were 29 studies in our review that included 1121 children and youth (or parents representing them) that spanned across six countries over a 32-year period. Although the outcomes of the impact of service dogs varied across the studies, 23/29 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: physical health (i.e., diabetes management, seizure management, mobility), psychological health (i.e., quality of life, safety, behavior, stress, anxiety, self-confidence and independence), social well-being (i.e., social interactions, school and work) and dog-owner-bond. Children, youth and their parents also described several challenges in owning a service dog. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that service dogs have potential to provide many benefits for children, youth and their families.

Despite growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in virology as well as many molecular studies, except remdesivir, no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug has been officially approved. METHODS: In the present study molecular docking technique was applied to test binding affinity of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin-two commercially available fluoroquinolones, to SARS-CoV-2 S-, E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO). Chloroquine and dexamethasone were used as reference positive controls. RESULTS: When analyzing the molecular docking data it was noticed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin possess lower binding energy with S protein as compared to the references. In the case of TMPRSS2 protein and PLPRO protease the best docked ligand was levofloxacin and in the case of E proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase the best docked ligands were levofloxacin and dexamethasone. Moreover, a molecular dynamics study also reveals that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin form a stable complex with E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO).

This study analysed the association between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in Brazil. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was conducted on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 with a defined outcome (i.e. hospital discharge or death) in Brazil. Data were retrieved from the national surveillance system database (SIVEP-Gripe) between February 16 and August 8, 2020. METHODS: Clinical characteristics, sociodemographic variables, use of hospital resources and outcomes of hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19, stratified by self-reported race, were investigated. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The association between self-reported race and in-hospital mortality, after adjusting for clinical characteristics and comorbidities, was evaluated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, Brazil had 3,018,397 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 100,648 deaths. The study population included 228,196 COVID-19-positive adult in-hospital patients with a defined outcome; the median age was 61 years, 57% were men, 35% (79,914) self-reported as Black/Brown and 35.4% (80,853) self-reported as White. The total in-hospital mortality was 37% (85,171/228,196). Black/Brown patients showed higher in-hospital mortality than White patients (42% vs 37%, respectively), were admitted less frequently to the intensive care unit (ICU) (32% vs 36%, respectively) and used more invasive mechanical ventilation (21% vs 19%, respectively), especially outside the ICU (17% vs 11%, respectively). Black/Brown race was independently associated with high in-hospital mortality after adjusting for sex, age, level of education, region of residence and comorbidities (odds ratio = 1.15; 95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised Brazilian adults with COVID-19, Black/Brown patients showed higher in-hospital mortality, less frequently used hospital resources and had potentially more severe conditions than White patients. Racial disparities in health outcomes and access to health care highlight the need to actively implement strategies to reduce inequities caused by the wider health determinants, ultimately leading to a sustainable change in the health system.","Peres, I T; Bastos, L S L; Gelli, J G M; Marchesi, J F; Dantas, L F; Antunes, B B P; Maçaira, P M; Baião, F A; Hamacher, S; Bozza, F A",Public Health,41,21

Their encoded GRX proteins could be classified into four classes: CC, CGFS, CPYC and GRL types. The distribution and synteny of these GRXs on chromosomes, the gene structures, the promoter sequences, and the possible protein subcellular localizations were characterized. Molecular interaction network analysis suggested that MaGRX might interact with glutathione reductase (GR), sulfiredoxin, peroxiredoxin (Prx), and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), contributing to the antioxidative defense of banana fruit. MicroRNA prediction showed that MaGRX genes might be targeted by different miRNAs. Transcriptome analysis characterized the expression profiles of different MaGRX genes during banana fruit ripening, and in response to different storage stresses. The results suggested that CC-type, CPYC-type and GRL-type MaGRXs might be more active than CGFS-type MaGRXs during banana fruit ripening and the response to stress.

During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.","Cheng, Cecilia; Lau, Yan-Ching; Luk, Jeremy W",J Med Internet Res,41,24

Since its emergence, the COVID-19 infection has led to significant public health, economic and social problems. The current pandemic has inspired researchers to make every effort to design and develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine to provide sufficient protection against the virus and control the infection. In December 2020, the Pfizer vaccine was the first COVID-19 vaccine given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and the second FDA so-approved vaccine was the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, which was introduced a week later. Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines, and are estimated to have an efficacy rate of more than 94%. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the attempts made to develop safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, highlighting potential challenges and concerns, such as disease enhancement, virus mutations, and public acceptance of the vaccine.","Mahmoodpoor, Ata; Sanaie, Sarvin; Samadi, Parisa; Yousefi, Mehdi; Nader, Nader D",Immunol Invest,41,14

As influential information sources, mainstream news media have a unique opportunity to use their platform to debunk and educate the public about misinformation. Despite evidence lending support to the potential for mainstream news media to play a larger role in combating misinformation in society, empirical explorations of how they have contributed to the management of misinformation remain scant. This study aims to address these major gaps in research by investigating how mainstream news dailies gatekeep and correct COVID-19 related misinformation in Singapore. The content of 164 news articles published by the mainstream news dailies in Singapore from January 1 to April 30, 2020 on COVID-19 misinformation was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results show that the two main types of misinformation, fabricated and reconfigured misinformation, were covered almost equally by mainstream news media. Misinformation related to science and health were most frequently reported, followed by scams, and government policy. Statistically significant differences were found between how mainstream news media corrected the various types and topics of misinformation. Significant differences were also found within the various types, topics, and corrections of misinformation across the early stages of the pandemic. Taken together, these findings shed light on the critical role of mainstream news media as public education tools to correct misinformation during public health crises. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the understanding of media misinformation gatekeeping, and misinformation correction. From a practical perspective, it highlights the capacity and potential roles of the press in supporting government efforts to combat misinformation.","Lwin, May O; Lee, Si Yu; Panchapakesan, Chitra; Tandoc, Edson",Health Commun,41,2

We present the steps taken by the government and evaluate their effect on epidemic trends. MATERIALS: Cyprus Press and Information Office data were analysed. Using an R-based forecasting program, two models were created to predict cases up to 01/09/2020: Model 1, which utilised data up to 09/06/2020, when airports reopened to foreign travelers with COVID-19 screening; and Model 2, which utilised data until 24/06/2020, when screening for passengers from low-transmission countries was discontinued. RESULTS: PIO data revealed no significant policy changes between 24/06/2020 and 31/07/2020. Prediction models were robust and accurate (Model 1, R2 = 0.999, P < .001; Model 2, R2 = 0.998, P < .001). By August 30th, recorded cases exceeded those predicted by Model 1 by 24.47% and by Model 2 by 20.95%, with P values <.001 for both cases. CONCLUSIONS: The significant difference between recorded cases and those projected by Models 1 and 2 suggests that changes in epidemic trends may have been associated with policy changes after their respective dates. Discontinuation of major restrictions such as airport reopening, can destabilise the control of the epidemic, and may concomitantly necessitate a reevaluation of the current epidemic status. In the face of an evolving situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, states are forced to balance the imposing of restrictions against their impact on the economy.","Kakoullis, Loukas; Eliades, Elias; Papachristodoulou, Eleni; Parperis, Konstantinos; Chra, Paraskevi; Constantinidou, Anastasia; Chatzittofis, Andreas; Sampsonas, Fotios; Panos, George",Int J Clin Pract,41,23

The elderly population is considered to be high risk for potential complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and this fact can also potentially lead to anxiety symptoms amongst the elderly. Therefore, a study was conducted to assess the anxiety symptoms in elderly living in few major cities of Rajasthan state in India. Methods: The study was conducted from April 2020 to May 2020 using an online questionnaire which measured the levels of anxiety amongst the elderly population (age ≥ 65 years) living in the community via the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) scale. Responses were received from 162 participants. Data were analyzed using the Chi‐square test and logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was kept at p value &lt; 0.05. Results: Around 69.14% of the participants belonged to the age group of 65-74 years;61.72% of whom were male. Moreover, up to 82.72% of the participants were suffering from one or more chronic medical illnesses. Based on the GAD-7 scores, 30.25%, 12.35%, and 6.17% of the respondents were suffering from mild, moderate, and severe forms of anxiety, respectively. After applying a ≥ 5 score as a cut off score for the GAD-7 scale, 48.77% of the elderly participants were experiencing anxiety symptoms indicating further assessment. In those respondents with anxiety symptoms, significant association was observed with age (p = 0.00), sex (p = 0.04), and the zone of residence (p = 0.00). On the other hand, no significant association was observed with the presence of chronic medical illness such as Diabetes, Hypertension, COPD, etc. with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.77). Conclusion: This study has revealed a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms among the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock down. We recommend that a pre-planned strategy should be prepared for early identification of vulnerable elderly in the community who are at a greater risk of suffering from anxiety disorder under this stressful period.

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures to quantify the mobility level needed to control SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., mobility threshold), and the difference relative to the observed mobility level (i.e., mobility gap). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study of the weekly incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada from Mar. 15, 2020, to Mar. 6, 2021. The outcome was weekly growth rate, defined as the ratio of cases in a given week versus the previous week. We evaluated the effects of average time spent outside the home in the previous 3 weeks using a log-normal regression model, accounting for province, week and mean temperature. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 mobility threshold and gap. RESULTS: Across the 51-week study period, a total of 888 751 people were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Each 10% increase in the mobility gap was associated with a 25% increase in the SARS-CoV-2 weekly case growth rate (ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.29). Compared to the prepandemic baseline mobility of 100%, the mobility threshold was highest in the summer (69%; interquartile range [IQR] 67%-70%), and dropped to 54% in winter 2021 (IQR 52%-55%); a mobility gap was present in Canada from July 2020 until the last week of December 2020. INTERPRETATION: Mobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control SARS-CoV-2 through spring 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide provincial and regional loosening and tightening of physical distancing measures.","Brown, Kevin A; Soucy, Jean-Paul R; Buchan, Sarah A; Sturrock, Shelby L; Berry, Isha; Stall, Nathan M; Jüni, Peter; Ghasemi, Amir; Gibb, Nicholas; MacFadden, Derek R; Daneman, Nick",CMAJ,41,20

Although many diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, have been established, the data from these devices are rarely assessed. Furthermore, telemedicine has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE: We sought to remotely support children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers, enhance the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with diabetes, increase multiple stakeholders' engagement with digital care via a participatory approach, evaluate the feasibility of using an interoperable open-source platform in a university hospital setting, and analyze the success factors and barriers of transitioning from conventional care to digital care. METHODS: Service design methods were used to adapt clinical workflows. Remote consultations were performed on a monthly and on-demand basis. Diabetes device data were uploaded from patients' homes to an open-source platform. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Germany. RESULTS: A total of 28 children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers enrolled in this study and completed 6 months of remote visits. Of these 28 participants, 16 (57%) also opted to attend at least one of their regular visits remotely. After 3 months of remote visits, participants' time in range (P=.001) and time in hyperglycemia (P=.004) significantly improved, and their time in hypoglycemia did not increase. These improvements were maintained during the COVID-19 lockdown period (ie, between months 3 and 6 of this study). Participants' psychosocial health improved after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultations and commonly shared data access can improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes, even during challenging circumstances. A service design approach helped with the delivery of comprehensive and holistic solutions that accounted for the needs of multiple stakeholders. Our findings can inform the future integration of digital tools into clinical care during and beyond the pandemic.

METHODS: Forty hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test were evaluated. They were randomly divided into an experimental group (n= 20; gargling with 1.0% H2O2 and nasal wash with 0.5% H2O2) or a control group (n= 20). The solutions were used for 7 days and the patients were monitored every 2 days, for a total of 8 days. At check-ups, patients were asked about their symptoms and possible adverse effects of the solutions. The presence and severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of symptoms were recorded. Data were compared using the Student test and the Fisher exact test (&#945;= 0.05). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the length of hospital stay (p= 0.65). The most frequent symptom on day 0 was coughing (72.0% in the experimental group and 76.5% in the control group), which abated over time. There was no significant difference between the groups in the evaluated symptoms. Most (75.0%) of the patients in the experimental group presented a reduction in dyspnea between days 0 and 2. Few patients reported adverse effects from the use of the solutions. CONCLUSIONS: H2O2 as a mouthwash and nasal spray is safe to use. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that H2O2 is effective as an auxiliary treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Di Domênico, Marielle Bazzo; Cesca, Henrique; Ponciano, Thales Henrique Jincziwski; Dos Santos, Renan Brandenburg; Lenz, Ulysses; Antunes, Vinícius Picoli; Godinho, Vinicius Webber; Collares, Kauê; Corazza, Pedro Henrique",Epidemiol Health,41,10

The influx of patients in the emergency departments (EDs) is testing the capacity of the system to its limit. In order to increase EDs' capacity and performance, healthcare managers and practitioners are adopting process improvement (PI) approaches in their operations. Thus, this study aims to identify the main PI approaches implemented in EDs, as well as the benefits and barriers to implement these approaches. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a rigorous systematic literature review of 115 papers. Furthermore, under the lens of thematic analysis, the authors present the descriptive and prescriptive findings. Findings The descriptive analysis found copious information related to PI approaches implemented in EDs, such as main PIs used in EDs, type of methodological procedures applied, as well as a set of barriers and benefits. Aiming to provide an in-depth analysis and prescriptive results, the authors carried out a thematic analysis that found underlying barriers (e.g. organisational, technical and behavioural) and benefits (e.g. for patients, the organisation and processes) of PI implementation in EDs. Originality/value The authors contribute to knowledge by providing a comprehensive review of the main PI methodologies applied in EDs, underscoring the most prominent ones. This study goes beyond descriptive studies that identify lists of barriers and benefits, and instead the authors categorize prescriptive elements that influence these barriers and benefits. Finally, this study raises discussions about the behavioural influence of patients and medical staff on the implementation of PI approaches.","Volochtchuk, A. V.

It has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation may aggravate arrhythmias or trigger new-onset conduction abnormalities. However, the specific type and distribution of electrocardiographic disturbances in COVID-19 as well as their influence on mortality remain to be fully characterized. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained from 186 COVID-19-positive patients at a large tertiary care hospital in Northern Nevada. The following arrhythmias were identified by cardiologists: sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), premature atrial contraction (PAC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrioventricular block (AVB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). The mean PR interval, QRS duration, and corrected QT interval were documented. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the ECG features of patients who died during the hospitalization with those who survived. The influence of ECG features on mortality was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A-Fib, atrial flutter, and ST-segment depression were predictive of mortality. In addition, the mean ventricular rate was higher among patients who died as compared to those who survived. The use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with reduced odds of death; however, this association did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated arrhythmias remains to be established, but we postulate that systemic inflammation and/or hypoxia may induce potentially lethal conduction abnormalities in affected individuals. Longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the risk factors, pathogenesis, and management of COVID-19-associated cardiac arrhythmias.","Antwi-Amoabeng, Daniel; Beutler, Bryce D; Singh, Sahajpreet; Taha, Moutaz; Ghuman, Jasmine; Hanfy, Ahmed; Manasewitsch, Nicholas T; Ulanja, Mark B; Ghuman, Joban; Awad, Munadel; Gullapalli, Nageshwara; Gbadebo, T David",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,41,1

They provide a favorable environment for plasma anticoagulant proteins, including antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and protein C. Under septic conditions, however, the anticoagulant properties of endothelial cells are compromised. Rather, activated/injured endothelial cells can provide a scaffold for intravascular coagulation. For example, the expression of tissue factor, an important initiator of the coagulation pathway, is induced on the surface of activated endothelial cells. Phosphatidylserine, a high-affinity scaffold for gamma-carboxyglutamate domain containing coagulation factors, including FII, FVII, FIX, and FX, is externalized to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of injured endothelial cells. Hemodilution decreases not only coagulation factors but also plasma anticoagulant proteins, resulting in unleashed activation of coagulation on the surface of activated/injured endothelial cells. The aberrant activation of coagulation can be suppressed in part by the supplementation of recombinant antithrombin and recombinant thrombomodulin. This review aims to overview the physiological and pathological functions of endothelial cells along with proof-of-concept in vitro studies.

METHODS: We explored correlates of vaccine hesitancy, considering political believes and psychosocial concepts, conducting a non-probability quota-sampled online survey with 1007 Austrians. RESULTS: We identified several important correlates of vaccine hesitancy, ranging from demographics to complex factors such as voting behavior or trust in the government. Among those with hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine, having voted for opposition parties (opp) or not voted (novote) were (95% Confidence Intervall (CI)opp, 1.44-2.95) to 2.25-times (95%CInovote, 1.53-3.30) that of having voted for governing parties. Only 46.2% trusted the Austrian government to provide safe vaccines, and 80.7% requested independent scientific evaluations regarding vaccine safety to increase willingness to vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expected, psychosocial dimensions were only weakly correlated with vaccine hesitancy. However, the strong correlation between distrust in the vaccine and distrust in authorities suggests a common cause of disengagement from public discourse.","Schernhammer, Eva; Weitzer, Jakob; Laubichler, Manfred D; Birmann, Brenda M; Bertau, Martin; Zenk, Lukas; Caniglia, Guido; Jäger, Carlo C; Steiner, Gerald",J. public health (Oxf),41,12

The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents the urgent need to understand the complex pathogen–host interplay for effective control of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 reorganizes the host cytoskeleton for efficient cell entry and controls host transcriptional processes to support viral protein translation. The virus also dysregulates innate cellular defenses using various structural and nonstructural proteins. This results in substantial but delayed hyperinflammation alongside a weakened interferon (IFN) response. We provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and its uniquely aggressive life cycle and discuss the interactions of various viral proteins with host signaling pathways.

Besides common immune defense mechanisms, releasing their DNA covered with antimicrobial proteases and histones represent another strong defense mechanism: neutrophil extracellular traps. In vitro the two most common inducers of these, so called, NETs are calcium ionophores (CI) and PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). Following stimulation monitoring of NET release is necessary. For now, the methods of choice are quantification of free DNA by fluorescent dyes or analysis of immunofluorescence images. As a new method we tested bio-impedance monitoring of neutrophils after stimulation with the two inducers PMA and CI in gold-electrode coated plates. Bio-impedance (cell index) was measured over time. Results were compared to the monitoring of NETs by the fluorescent DNA-binding dye Sytox Green and immunofluorescence analysis. Cell index peaked about 25 min faster following CI stimulation than following PMA stimulation. The activation in Sytox Green Assay was significantly later detectable for PMA (+ approx. 90 min) but not for CI stimulation. The earlier and faster activation by CI was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Our data suggest that bio-impedance measurement allows an easy online tracking of early neutrophil activation.

We built a stochastic model to simulate outbreaks in LTCF populations with differing vaccination coverage and NPI adherence to evaluate their interacting effects. Vaccination combined with strong NPI adherence produced the least morbidity and mortality. Healthcare worker vaccination improved outcomes in unvaccinated LTCF residents but was less impactful with declining NPI adherence.

Here, we integrate complex networks and machine learning approaches to develop a new approach to identifying reservoirs. An exhaustive dataset of mammal–pathogen interactions was transformed into networks where hosts are linked via their shared pathogens. We present a methodology for identifying important and influential hosts in these networks. Ensemble models linking network characteristics with phylogeny and life-history traits are then employed to predict those key hosts and quantify the roles they undertake in pathogen transmission. Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa. Host importance is further integrated into ensemble models to predict reservoirs of zoonoses of various pathogen taxa and quantify the extent of pathogen sharing between humans and mammals. We establish predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses, showcasing host influence to be a key factor in determining these reservoirs. Finally, we provide new insight into the determinants of zoonosis-sharing, and contrast these determinants across major pathogen taxa.","Wardeh, Maya; Sharkey, Kieran J.; Baylis, Matthew",Proc Biol Sci,41,1

Patients developing a first transfusion‐induced red cell alloantibody (N = 505) were each compared with two similarly exposed, but non‐alloimmunised controls (N = 1010) during a 5‐week ‘alloimmunisation risk period’ using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Transfusions during ‘severe’ bacterial (tissue‐invasive) infections were associated with increased risks of alloantibody development [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1·34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0·97–1·85], especially when these infections were accompanied with long‐standing fever (RR 3·06, 95% CI 1·57–5·96).

NEP's role in degradation of diverse classes of peptides such as amyloid beta, natriuretic peptide, substance P, angiotensin, endothelins, etc., is associated with pathologies of alzheimer's, kidney and heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and certain malignancies. Hence the functional inhibition of NEP in the above systems can be a good therapeutic target. In the present study, in-silico drug repurposing approach was used to identify NEP inhibitors. Molecular docking was carried out using GLIDE tool and 2934 drugs from the ZINC12 database were screened using high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) docking. Based on the XP docking score and ligand interaction, the top 8 hits were subjected to free ligand binding energy calculation, to filter out 4 hits (ZINC000000001427, ZINC000001533877, ZINC000000601283, and ZINC000003831594). Further, induced fit docking-standard precision (IFD-SP) and molecular dynamics (MD) studies were performed. The results obtained from MD +studies suggest that ZINC000000601283-NEP and ZINC000003831594-NEP complexes were most stable for 20ns simulation period as compared to ZINC000001533877-NEP and ZINC000000001427-NEP complexes.

Moreover, sleep difficulties seem to be more prominent in the older group during the pandemic, suggesting that there could be additional risk factors involved. The current study aimed to investigate the role of resilience in the association between changes in sleep and the subjective sleep quality (SSQ) in teens and young adults during COVID-19. METHODS: 289 teens (12-17 years old) and 294 young adults (18-25 years old) completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 and an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index online. Teens and young adults were each divided into a resilient and less resilient group. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to examine the unique contribution of weekdays sleep duration, sleep difficulties, and resilience to SSQ. Sleep duration, sleep difficulties and SSQ before COVID-19, and gender were entered as controls. RESULTS: Results show that in less resilient teens, changes in sleep onset difficulties (β=-.285, p=.003), nocturnal and early awakenings (β=-.218, p=.019), and weekdays sleep duration (β=.282, p=.001) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 36.5% of the variance. In less resilient young adults, changes in nightmares (β=-.309, p=.027) and sleep onset difficulties (β=-.263, p=.012) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 24.1% of the variance. In resilient teens, changes in weekdays sleep duration (β=.296, p=.007) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 20.1% of the variance. In resilient adults, changes in sleep onset difficulties (β=-.325, p=.001), nocturnal and early awakenings (β=-.374, p=.000), and weekdays sleep duration (β=.192, p=.009) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 46.0% of the variance. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that resilience appears to be a protecting factor in the impacts of sleep difficulties on sleep quality, but only in adolescents. Indeed, in young adults, sleep difficulties seem to be a more important factor modulating sleep quality than changes in sleep duration. These results underline the importance of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of each population to better target interventions.

The purpose of this study was to quantify and describe changes in recreational screen time from 2018 to 2020 among a diverse sample of emerging adults. Participants (n = 716) reported their average weekly recreational screen time in 2018 and again during the pandemic in 2020. Additionally, participants qualitatively reported how events related to COVID-19 had influenced their screen time. Weekly recreational screen time increased from 25.9 ± 11.9 h in 2018 to 28.5 ± 11.6 h during COVID-19 (p < 0.001). The form of screen time most commonly reported to increase was TV shows and streaming services (n = 233). Commonly reported reasons for changes in screen time were boredom (n = 112) and a desire to connect with others (n = 52). Some participants reported trying to reduce screen time because of its negative impact on their mental health (n = 32). Findings suggest that screen time and mental health may be intertwined during the pandemic as it may lead to poorer mental health for some, while promoting connectedness for others. Health professionals and public health messaging could promote specific forms for screen time to encourage social connection during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Wagner, Brooke E.; Folk, Amanda L.; Hahn, Samantha L.; Barr-Anderson, Daheia J.; Larson, Nicole; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,41,33

This paper presents an extension of an existing Bayesian network model for an application in which people can add their own personal risk factors to calculate their probability of exposure to the virus and likely severity if they do catch the illness. The data need not be shared with any central authority. In this way, people can become more aware of their individual risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly, as many countries prepare for a second wave of infections or a prolonged pandemic. This has the advantage not only of preserving privacy but also of containing the virus more effectively by allowing users to act without the time lag of waiting to be informed that a contact has been tested and confirmed COVID-19 positive. Through a nuanced assessment of individual risk, it could also release many people from isolation who are judged highly vulnerable using cruder measures, helping to boost economic activity and decrease social isolation without unduly increasing transmission risk. Although much has been written and reported about single risk factors, little has been done to bring these factors together in a user-friendly way to give an overall risk rating. The causal probabilistic model presented here shows the power of Bayesian networks to represent the interplay of multiple, dependent variables and to predict outcomes. The network, designed for use in the UK, is built using detailed data from government and health authorities and the latest research, and is capable of dynamic updates as new information becomes available. The focus of the paper is on the extended set of risk factors.","Prodhan, G.",,41,9

In Colombia, forecasts are not yet counted. OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with the development of severe disease in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the prognostic factors for the outcome of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an ambispective cohort study in hospitalized patients at the Fundación Cadioinfantil from March to June, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients analyzed, 31.7% (n=33) had a severe presentation and 9.6% (n=10) had a mortality outcome. For mortality, the most important prognostic factor was the development of severe disease followed by age over 60 years and malnutrition. For the development of the severe disease, prognostic factors were a history of hemodialysis (HR=135), diabetes (HR=4.4), and an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1,004), while the lymphocyte count over 1,064 was a protective factor (HR=0.9). In the classification of patients, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score in the high and low-risk categories corresponded to the best performance. There was no difference between the treatments administered. CONCLUSIONS: The most important prognostic factors for mortality were being over 60 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, and cirrhosis, while for the development of severe disease they were chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, NEWS2 with high risk at admission, increased levels of LDH and C reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis.","Motta, Juan Camilo; Novoa, Danny; Gómez, Carmen Cecilia; Moreno, Julián; Vargas, Lina; Pérez, Jairo; Millán, Henry; Arango, Álvaro Ignacio",Biomedica,41,23

STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: In all, 23 patients with COVID‐19 and with an average interval of 2.81 days between hospital admission and image examination. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T; Respiratory‐gated three‐dimensional radial UTE pulse sequence. ASSESSMENT: Image quality score. Patient‐ and lesion‐based interobserver and intermethod agreement for identifying the representative image findings of COVID‐19. STATISTICAL TESTS: Wilcoxon‐rank sum test, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W), intraclass coefficients (ICCs), and weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the image quality of CT and UTE‐MRI (CT vs. UTE‐MRI: 4.3 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.09). Moreover, both patient‐ and lesion‐based interobserver agreement of CT and UTE‐MRI for evaluating the image signs of COVID‐19 were determined as excellent (ICC: 0.939–1.000, P < 0.05; Kendall's W: 0.894–1.000, P < 0.05.). In addition, the intermethod agreement of two image modalities for assessing the representative findings of COVID‐19 including affected lobes, total severity score, ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, GGO with consolidation, the number of crazy paving pattern, and linear opacities, as well as pseudocavity were all determined as substantial or excellent (kappa: 0.649–1.000, P < 0.05; ICC: 0.913–1.000, P < 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION: Pulmonary MRI with UTE is valuable for assessing the representative image findings of COVID‐19 with a high concordance to CT.

Problems of variable CD vaccine safety and efficacy persist, but CD vaccines have greatly reduced the prevalence of disease and cases in vaccinated dogs are now rare. Canine hepatitis (ICH, CAV-1 infection) also has been controlled well by vaccines for more than 35 years and it is now rare; the sporadic cases seen in the 1990s have usually occurred in unvaccinated dogs. CAV-2 vaccines should, therefore, continue to be given since they have proved to be safe and effective, and prevent hepatitis as well as adenoviral tracheobronchitis. Failure to vaccinate would likely result in increase in cases of ICH, a serious disease, but never as significant as distemper and CPV infection. ""Are we vaccinating too often?"" The question is complex, but the dominant opinion is ""yes"" (Smith, 1995). The question cannot be responded to unequivocally, however, since manufacturers employ different strains that vary in their immunizing capacity and, probably, duration of immunity. This question was frequent with distemper in the 1960s. At that time, many veterinarians tested batches of the vaccine they used by providing pre- and postvaccinal sera to competent diagnostic laboratories. That practice appeared to benefit veterinarians and dogs, as well as the quality of vaccines. Unfortunately, many owners and some veterinarians seem to hold the view that infectious diseases such as parvovirus infection can be controlled by frequent vaccination alone. The common practice of dog breeders of vaccinating their animals several times each year is senseless. Revaccination for distemper and parvovirus infection is suggested at 1 year of age, but recommendations regarding the frequency of most vaccinations given after that time are unclear. Since most distemper and CPV-2 vaccines probably provide immunity that endures several years, vaccination at 3- to 5-year intervals, after the first year, seems a reasonable practice until more data on duration of immunity become available. ""Are too many kinds of vaccines being promoted for dogs?"" Distemper and parvovirus vaccines are essential; canine adenovirus vaccines are recommended since the few cases brought to our attention in recent years have been in unvaccinated dogs. Vaccination against respiratory infections is recommended for most dogs, especially those in kennels, or if they are to be boarded. Need has not been clearly established for coronavirus vaccines; Lyme disease vaccines (see below) are useful in preventing illness in areas where the disease exists, but are unnecessary elsewhere since dogs respond rapidly to appropriate antibiotics; current Leptospira bacterins are without benefit since they contain serovars that fail to protect in most areas (noted below). Lyme disease (LD) was not considered here, but newer recombinant (OspA) vaccines are now available that appear to be safe and effective for at least 1 year and they have not caused vaccine-induced postvaccinal lameness, which has been documented with certain whole-cell Lyme disease bacterins. Lyme disease vaccines should be restricted to dogs in, or entering, endemic areas where infested ticks reside. More than 85% of LD cases occur in the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern States, about 10% in six Midwestern states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), and a smaller percentage in restricted areas of northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Leptospirosis also was not discussed here, but vaccines are commonly reported as a cause of anaphylaxis and current vaccines do not contain the serovars prevalent in most regions. The vast majority of cases diagnosed at the New York State Diagnostic Lab at Cornell are grippotyphosa and pomona serovars and there have been no recent cases caused by canicola or icterohemorrhagiae serovars. Because leptospirosis is an important disease of dogs, there is an urgent need for more research and the development of safer vaccines that contain the prevalent","Carmichael, L.E.",Adv Vet Med,41,6

Recent focus has been on emerging zoonoses and on identifying common patterns and drivers of emerging diseases. However, no overarching framework exists to integrate knowledge on all emerging infectious disease events. Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases. Moreover, it may contribute to a better understanding of how human action changes disease landscapes globally.","Engering, Anneke; Hogerwerf, Lenny; Slingenbergh, Jan",Emerg Microbes Infect,41,20

Under national lockdown, businesses were closed, learning institutions moved to emergency remote teaching (ERT), and hospitals reduced their patient loads. De-escalation of clinical services at Groote Schuur and Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospitals affected Genetic Counseling Services and resulted in a decrease in in-person and an increase in telecounseling sessions. ERT, offered by the University of Cape Town, affected the teaching of Genetic Counseling students, and other methods of training had to be found to compensate for the lack of patient contact. In this paper, we present our Genetic Counseling team's experiences of learning and clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. The team met online as a group in November 2020 to discuss their experiences. The discussion was recorded and transcribed, and topics that arose during the discussion were identified. The pandemic and the accompanying lock down, which forced trainees to move back home, resulted in great uncertainty. The trainees found ERT on an online platform, including simulated cases, very helpful, but they lost the confidence to work with real patients. Telecounseling became the predominant form of service delivery and was experienced as positive when video sessions were possible. The telephone service for advanced maternal age counseling was problematic due to unreliable networks. The biggest loss for the GCs was the feeling of disconnection from peers, supervisors, and patients. The experiences highlighted positive and negative aspects as well as specific challenges faced in South Africa. Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic will be used in future to improve training of GCs and to enhance service delivery.","Wessels, Tina-Marié; Düsterwald, Gillian; Barlow, Robyn; Cameron-Mackintosh, Sinead; Diedericks, Angelique; Francois, Sydney; Laing, Nakita; Pretorius, Willem; Scholtz, Kathrine; Vorster, Nina",Journal of genetic counseling,41,16

As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.","Prem, Kiesha; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Klepac, Petra; Eggo, Rosalind M.; Davies, Nicholas G.; Cook, Alex R.; Jit, Mark",PLoS Comput Biol,41,4

We examined whether polymorphisms of RANTES, IP-10 and Mig affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: We tested the polymorphisms of RANTES, IP-10 and Mig for their associations with SARS in 495 Hong Kong Chinese SARS patients and 578 controls. Then we tried to confirm the results in 356 Beijing Chinese SARS patients and 367 controls. RESULTS: RANTES -28 G allele was associated with SARS susceptibility in Hong Kong Chinese (P < 0.0001, OR = 2.80, 95%CI:2.11–3.71). Individuals with RANTES -28 CG and GG genotypes had a 3.28-fold (95%CI:2.32–4.64) and 3.06-fold (95%CI:1.47–6.39) increased risk of developing SARS respectively (P < 0.0001).

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti-SARS therapy. There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase. To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS-CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain. The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes. We predict important structural attributes of potential anti-SARS-CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen-bonding capability for the 2′ and 3′ groups of the sugar ring and C3′ endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization. Our results suggest that designing anti-SARS therapies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other antiviral drugs. This work should also provide guidance for future biochemical experiments.","Xu, Xiang; Liu, Yunqing; Weiss, Susan; Arnold, Eddy; Sarafianos, Stefan G.; Ding, Jianping",Nucleic Acids Research,41,2

In this study, we aimed to review the instructions published either before or after COVID-19's transmission to Iran to depict the clinical approach and therapeutics used in Iran to battle the current pandemic. We retrospectively gathered and critically reviewed all official situation reports, guidelines, guidance, flowcharts, protocols, recommendations and advice released by Iranian scientific, or administrative arms of action against COVID-19. The ongoing clinical trials approved by MOHME and registered to the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) have been reviewed as well. Our study resulted in the following mainstays of Iran's approach to COVID-19: (i) active clinical screening; preferably on-line or on-phone, (ii) management of limited paraclinical resources; by using them as diagnostic tools rather than epidemiological, (iii) a trend toward outpatient care of mild-to-moderate cases; either confirmed or suspicious, with active scheduled follow-up, and (iv) avoidance of pharmacotherapy, as far as possible. The therapeutic and administrative instructions are still being actively updated with some recommendations different from the previous ones. Nevertheless, a common approach in the background could be detected, It seems that the instructions are conceptually in line with the first “National Guideline for 2019-nCoV” published on 20 January 2020.

However, prospective data on the relationship between loneliness and problematic substance use are lacking, and few studies have examined specific commonplace substances, such as alcohol and cannabis. This study used prospective data from a community sample of US adults with problematic alcohol or cannabis use to examine whether loneliness was a predictor of subsequent increased substance use. METHODS: Participants (N = 210) were recruited between 05/2016-06/2019 from a New York City medical center. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups, participants completed identical computerized questionnaires. We used generalized estimating equations to assess the average effect of past 2-week loneliness on subsequent number of days of alcohol or cannabis use, controlling for baseline days of use, demographic characteristics, and past 2-week DSM-5 depression. RESULTS: Compared with individuals who were never lonely, participants with moderate or severe loneliness had a significantly higher frequency of alcohol or cannabis use at the subsequent assessment (ß = 0.25 95% CI: 0.08-0.42). CONCLUSION: Individuals experiencing loneliness at least a few times in the past 2 weeks reported more days of subsequent alcohol or cannabis use compared with individuals who were not lonely. This is cause for concern, as national surveys of US adults indicate increasing rates of loneliness, depression and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest the need for health care providers to screen for feelings of loneliness and potentially harmful coping behaviors such as substance use, and to offer healthier alternative coping strategies.","Gutkind, Sarah; Gorfinkel, Lauren R; Hasin, Deborah S",Addict Behav,41,1

RESULTS: Approximately 27 000 persons were invited via email to assess eligibility. 1001 households were mailed dried blood spot sample kits, 762 returned blood samples for analysis. In the primary sample group, 36 individuals (4.6%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated weighted prevalence in this population of 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.0). In the secondary sampling group, 10 participants (3.4%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated adjusted prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.4). No samples were IgM positive.

This narrative review attempts to describe some problems with the management of Covid-19 induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) by pulmonologists. Methods We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reviewed the references of retrieved articles for additional studies. The search was limited to the terms: Covid-19 AND: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), SARS, MERS, non invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), pronation (PP), health care workers (HCW). Results Protection of Health care workers should be paramount, so full Personal Protective Equipment and Negative pressure rooms are warranted. HFNC alone or with PP could be offered for mild cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 200-300); NIV alone or with PP may work in moderate cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 100-200). Rotation and coupled (HFNC/NIV) strategy can be beneficial. A window of opportunity of 1-2hours is advised. If PaO2/FIO2 significantly increases, Respiratory Rate decreases with a relatively low Exhaled Tidal Volume, the non-invasive strategy could be working and intubation delayed. Conclusion Although there is a role for non-invasive respiratory therapies in the context of COVID-19 ARF, more research is still needed to define the balance of benefits and risks to patients and HCW. Indirectly, non invasive respiratory therapies may be of particular benefit in reducing the risks to healthcare workers by obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure.","Winck, João Carlos; Ambrosino, Nicolino",Pulmonology,41,20

Results: The Panbio™ COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device demonstrated a high concordance with laboratory tests. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 506 participants (25.3%) at enrolment, with a higher prevalence in COVID-19 frontline (28.3%) than non-frontline (19.9%) staff. At follow-up, 274/399 antibody positive participants (68.7%) retained antibodies; 4/146 participants negative at enrolment (2.7%) had seroconverted. Non-white ethnicity, older age, hypertension and COVID-19 symptoms were independent predictors of higher antibody levels (OR 1.881, 2.422–3.034, 2.128, and 1.869 respectively), based on Architect™ index quartiles; participants in the first three categories also showed a greater antibody persistence at 3 months. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positivity rate among healthcare staff was high, declining by 31.3% during the 3-month follow-up interval. Interestingly, the IgG-positive participants with certain risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness (older age, Black or Asian Ethnicity hypertension) demonstrated greater persistence over time when compared to the IgG-positive participants without these risk factors.","Choudhry, Naheed; Drysdale, Kate; Usai, Carla; Leighton, Dean; Sonagara, Vinay; Buchanan, Ruaridh; Nijjar, Manreet; Thomas, Sherine; Hopkins, Mark; Cutino-Moguel, Teresa; Gill, Upkar S.; Foster, Graham R.; Kennedy, Patrick T.",Front Med (Lausanne),41,3

METHODS: Data were obtained from the ABP Certification Management System. We determined, within each subspecialty, the annual number of first-year fellows. We assessed for changes in the population using variables available throughout the study period (gender, medical school location, program region, and program size). We fit linear trendlines and calculated χ(2) statistics. RESULTS: The number of first-year pediatric medical subspecialty fellows increased from 751 in 2001 to 1445 in 2018. Fields with the growth of 3 or more fellows per year were Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Neonatology, and Hematology Oncology (P value <0.05 for all). The number of fellows entering Adolescent Medicine, Child Abuse, Infectious Disease, and Nephrology increased at a rate of 0.5 fellows or fewer per year. Female American Medical Graduates represented the largest and growing proportions of several subspecialties. Distribution of programs by region and size were relatively consistent over time, but varied across subspecialties. CONCLUSIONS: The number of pediatricians entering medical subspecialty fellowship training is uneven and patterns of growth differ between subspecialties. IMPACT: The number of individuals entering fellowship training has increased between 2001 and 2018. Growth in the number of first-year fellows is uneven. Fields with the greatest growth: Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, and Neonatology. Fields with limited growth: Adolescent Medicine, Child Abuse, Infectious Disease, and Nephrology. Concerns about the pediatric medical subspecialty workforce are not explained by the number of individuals entering the fellowship.","Macy, Michelle L.; Leslie, Laurel K.; Turner, Adam; Freed, Gary L.",Pediatr Res,41,16

In particular, in recent years, through modification with immunopotentiators and targeting molecules, and in combination with innovative immunization devices, liposomes are rapidly developed as a multifunctional vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) that has a high capability in inducing desired immunoresponses, as they can target immune cells and even cellular organelles, engender lysosome escape, and promote Ag cross-presentation, thus enormously enhancing vaccination efficacy. Moreover, after decades of development, several products developed on liposome VADS have already been authorized for clinical immunization and are showing great advantages over conventional vaccines. This article describes in depth some critical issues relevant to the development of liposomes as a VADS, including principles underlying immunization, physicochemical properties of liposomes as the immunity-influencing factors, functional material modification to enhance immunostimulatory functions, the state-of-the-art liposome VADSs, as well as the marketed vaccines based on a liposome VADS.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are heterogeneous and common in individuals with ADRD and are associated with more severe illness. However, unlike the cognitive symptoms of ADRD that are usually progressive, BPSD may be treatable. Individuals with BPSD are facing unique challenges during the pandemic due to the inherent nature of the illness and the biological and psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. These challenges include a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection in individuals with BPSD due to their frailty and medical vulnerability, difficulty participating in screening or testing, and adhering to infection control measures such as physical distancing. Further, biological effects of COVID-19 on the brain and its psychosocial impact such as isolation and disruption in mental health care are likely to worsen BPSD. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and strategies to manage the impact of COVID-19 and to effectively care for individuals with BPSD in community, long-term care, or hospital settings during the pandemic. Despite the ongoing uncertainty associated with this pandemic, we can reduce its impact on individuals with BPSD with a proactive approach.","Keng, Alvin; Brown, Eric E.; Rostas, Aviva; Rajji, Tarek K.; Pollock, Bruce G.; Mulsant, Benoit H.; Kumar, Sanjeev",Front Psychiatry,41,21

There has been little published research examining patients' experiences of accessing remote consultations since Covid-19. Such research is important as remote methods for delivering some care may be maintained in the future. OBJECTIVE To use content from Twitter to understand discourse around health and care delivery in the UK as a result of Covid-19, in particular Twitter users' views on and attitudes to care being delivered remotely. METHODS Tweets posted from the UK between January 2018 and October 2020 were extracted using the Twitter API. 1,408 tweets across three search terms were extracted into Excel. 161 tweets were removed following de-duplication, and 610 were identified as irrelevant to the research question. Relevant tweets (n=637) were coded into categories using NVivo software, and assigned a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. To examine views of remote care over time, the coded data was imported back into Excel so that each tweet was associated with both a theme(s) and sentiment. RESULTS The volume of tweets on remote care delivery increased markedly following the Covid-19 outbreak. Five main themes were identified in the tweets: access to remote care (n=267), quality of remote care (n=130), anticipation of remote care (n=39), online booking and asynchronous communication (n=85) and publicising changes to services or care delivery (n=160). Mixed public attitudes and experiences to the changes in service delivery were found. The proportion of positive tweets regarding access to, and quality of, remote care was higher in the immediate period following the Covid-19 outbreak (March-May 2020) when compared to the time before the Covid-19 onset, and the time when restrictions from the first lockdown eased (June-October 2020). CONCLUSIONS Using Twitter data to address our research questions proved beneficial for providing rapid access to Twitter users' attitudes to remote care delivery at a time when it would have been difficult to conduct primary research due to Covid-19. It allowed us to examine the discourse on remote care over a relatively long period and explore shifting attitudes of Twitter users at a time of rapid changes in care delivery. The mixed attitudes towards remote care highlights the importance that patients have a choice over the type of consultation that best suits their needs, and that the increased use of technology for delivering care does not become a barrier for some. The finding that overall sentiment about remote care was more positive in the early stages of the pandemic but since declined emphasises the need for a continued examination of people's preference, particularly if remote appointments are likely to remain central to healthcare delivery.

The genomic analysis of complete transcriptomes, so-called meta-transcriptomics, is providing a particularly rich source of data on the global diversity of RNA viruses and their evolutionary history. Herein we review some of the insights that meta-transcriptomics has provided on the fundamental patterns and processes of virus evolution, with a focus on the recent discovery of a multitude of novel invertebrate viruses. In particular, meta-transcriptomics shows that the RNA virus world is more fluid than previously realized, with relatively frequent changes in genome length and structure. As well as having a transformative impact on studies of virus evolution, meta-transcriptomics presents major new challenges for virus classification, with the greater sampling of host taxa now filling many of the gaps on virus phylogenies that were previously used to define taxonomic groups. Given that most viruses in the future will likely be characterized using metagenomics approaches, and that we have evidently only sampled a tiny fraction of the total virosphere, we suggest that proposals for virus classification pay careful attention to the wonders unearthed in this new age of virus discovery.","Shi, Mang; Zhang, Yong-Zhen; Holmes, Edward C.",Virus Res,41,26

Mortality rate may increase up to 25% in solid malignancies. In parallel to increased mortality rates among cancer patients, safety concerns regarding cancer treatment has increased over time. However, there were contradictory results for the cancer treatment during pandemic. In this study, we assessed the effect of cancer treatment on the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched on September 01, 2020. Primary endpoints were severe disease and death in the cancer patients treated within the last 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. Quality of included studies were assessed by New Castle-Ottawa Scale. Generic inverse variance method was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included for this meta-analysis. Chemotherapy within the last thirty days before COVID-19 diagnosis increased the risk of death in cancer patients after adjusting for confounding variables (OR: 1.85; 95% CI:1.26-2.71). However, severe COVID-19 risk did not increase. Furthermore, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy did not increase the severe disease and death risk in cancer patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy increased the risk of death from COVID-19 in cancer patients. However, there was no safety concern for immunotherapy, targeted therapies, surgery, and radiotherapy.","Yekedüz, Emre; Utkan, Güngör; Ürün, Yüksel",Eur J Cancer,41,8

Distinct C. auris clades evolved seemingly simultaneously at independent geographical locations and display both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Although comparative genomics and phenotypic profiling studies are increasing, we still lack mechanistic knowledge about the C. auris species diversification and clinical heterogeneity. Since gene expression variability impacts phenotypic plasticity, we aimed to characterize transcriptomic signatures of C. auris patient isolates with distinct antifungal susceptibility profiles in this study. First, we employed an antifungal susceptibility screening of clinical C. auris isolates to identify divergent intra-clade responses to antifungal treatments. Interestingly, comparative transcriptional profiling reveals large gene expression differences between clade I isolates and one clade II strain, irrespective of their antifungal susceptibilities. However, comparisons at the clade levels demonstrate that minor changes in gene expression suffice to drive divergent drug responses. Finally, we functionally validate transcriptional signatures reflecting phenotypic divergence of clinical isolates. Thus, our results suggest that large-scale transcriptional profiling allows for predicting phenotypic diversities of patient isolates, which may help choosing suitable antifungal therapies of multidrug-resistant C. auris.","Jenull, Sabrina; Tscherner, Michael; Kashko, Nataliya; Shivarathri, Raju; Stoiber, Anton; Chauhan, Manju; Petryshyn, Andriy; Chauhan, Neeraj; Kuchler, Karl",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,41,22

Action research work was planned and implemented to identify alternative solutions to overcome barriers to IPE in the local Egyptian context. METHODS: -An 8-week e-learning elective course was developed, implemented, and evaluated. A mixed group of 30 nursing and medical students was enrolled voluntarily in the course. Female to male ratio was 3:2. Four faculty members were assigned to manage the course. Based on the EMRO-WHO guidelines, ethics content was selected and organized. A closed Facebook group was created and utilized as the e-learning platform. Facilitated large-group and case-based discussions were the main instructional methods. Scoring of mixed small group assignments was the main assessment tool. Course evaluation was conducted using the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) and an Online-Course Evaluation Questionnaire (OCEQ). RESULTS: ISVS results revealed that students’ perception of ability, comfort and value in working with others, were all positive. The OCEQ provided additional evidence regarding the satisfaction of students with the Facebook group as a learning platform. Assignment submission rate was 90%. Success rate of small group assignments (scores ≥ 60%) was 100%. Response rate to the open online discussions was 63%. Through peer evaluation as well as direct observation of online discussions, there was evidence of distinct contributions by females and by medical students compared to nursing students. CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the students’ perception and performance, our IPE distance learning experience was valuable. Motivation of medical students as well as females was evident. IPE is a challenging process. The elective approach and using DL can offer solutions. Conducting relevant practical sessions as well as sustainability of this IPE e-learning experience remain key challenges.","Abdelaziz, Adel; Mansour, Tayseer; Alkhadragy, Rania; Abdel Nasser, Asmaa; Hasnain, Memoona",Adv Med Educ Pract,41,16

The article proposes and analyzes a pandemic residual risk assessment tool, which is a simple and universal source for residual risk estimation based on a five-step consequence/probability matrix, a five-step hierarchy of risk controls, and a general formula for calculating residual risk. The methodology of the survey is based on a questionnaire with 16 questions used for the initial validation of the residual risk scale, of which six related to the potential of organizational resilience. The pilot survey was conducted in 66 enterprises in Poland. On the basis of the survey, four measures related to the use of control measures against threats after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic have been proposed. These are personal protective equipment (PPE) controls, administrative controls, engineering controls, and substitution controls. Using the survey results, we estimated averages of the response results, and, on their basis, we estimated the residual risks for individual types of enterprises according to the type of business and its size. Based on the calculations, a strong correlation was found between the potential of organizational resilience and the individual use of control measures. Therefore, the main finding of the survey proves that effective risk management builds organizational resilience in enterprises. The practical implications of the study allow the management staff to find out what aspects related to the use of control measures need to be paid attention to in order to minimize residual risk.","Ewertowski, Tomasz; Butlewski, Marcin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,41,16

Although most clinical laboratories still rely on conventional methods, a cascade of technological changes, driven by digital imaging and high-throughput sequencing, will revolutionize the management of clinical diagnostics for direct detection of bacteria and swift antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Importantly, such technological advancements occur in the golden age of machine learning where computers are no longer acting passively in data mining, but once trained, can also help physicians in making decisions for diagnostics and optimal treatment administration. The further potential of physically integrating new technologies in an automation chain, combined to machine-learning-based software for data analyses, is seducing and would indeed lead to a faster management in infectious diseases. However, if, from one side, technological advancement would achieve a better performance than conventional methods, on the other side, this evolution challenges clinicians in terms of data interpretation and impacts the entire hospital personnel organization and management.

However, predictions of strains that will circulate are imperfect, and manufacturing of new vaccines based on them takes months. As an alternative, universal influenza vaccines target highly conserved antigens. In proof of concept studies of universal vaccine candidates in animal models challenge is generally conducted only a short time after vaccination, but protective immunity lasting far longer is important for the intended public health impact. We address the challenge of providing long-term protection. We demonstrate here broad, powerful, and long-lasting immune protection for a promising universal vaccine candidate. A single intranasal dose of recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing influenza A nucleoprotein (A/NP) and matrix 2 (M2) was used. Extending our previous studies of this type of vaccine, we show that antibody and T-cell responses persist for over a year without boosting, and that protection against challenge persists a year after vaccination and remains broad, covering both group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses. In addition, we extend the work to influenza B. Immunization with influenza B nucleoprotein (B/NP)-rAd also gives immune responses that last a year without boosting and protect against challenge with influenza B viruses of mismatched HA lineages. Despite host immunity to adenoviral antigens, effective readministration is possible a year after primary vaccination, as shown by successful immunization to a transgene product the animals had not seen before. Protection against challenge with divergent and highly pathogenic A/H7N9 virus was weaker but was enhanced by a second dose of vaccine. Thus, this mucosal vaccination to conserved influenza antigens confers very long-lasting immune protection in animals against a broad range of influenza A and B viruses.","Lo, Chia-Yun; Misplon, Julia A; Li, Xing; Price, Graeme E; Ye, Zhiping; Epstein, Suzanne L",Vaccine,41,6

To investigate potential pathways to misdiagnosis, we interviewed 28 HIV testers in Zimbabwe and conducted weeklong observations at four testing facilities. Approaching adherence to national HIV testing algorithms as a social and scripted practice, dependent on the integration of certain competences, materials and meanings, our thematic analysis revealed three underlying causes of misdiagnosis: One, a lack of confidence in using certain test-kits, coupled with changes in testing algorithms and inadequate training, fed uncertainties with some testing practices. Two, difficult work conditions, including high workloads and resource-depleted facilities, compounded these uncertainties, and meant testers got distracted or resorted to testing short-cuts. Three, power struggles between HIV testers, and specific client-tester encounters created social interactions that challenged the testing process. We conclude that these contexts contribute to deviances from official and recommended testing procedures, as well as testing and interpretation biases, which may explain cases of misdiagnoses. We caution against user-error explanations to misdiagnosis in the absence of a broader recognition of how broader structural determinants affect HIV testing practices.","Skovdal, Morten; Beckmann, Nadine; Maswera, Rufurwokuda; Nyamukapa, Constance; Gregson, Simon",PLoS One,41,26

However, anti-CRC/COVID-19 treatment options are currently unavailable. Since niacin is a vitamin with cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory functions, this study aimed to evaluate the possible functional roles and underlying mechanisms of action of niacin as an anti-COVID-19 and -CRC therapy. INTERVENTIONS: We used a series of network pharmacology-based and computational analyses to understand and characterize the binding capacity, biological functions, pharmacological targets and therapeutic mechanisms of niacin in CRC/COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We revealed the clinical characteristics of CRC patients and COVID-19 patients, including predisposing genes, survival rate and prognosis. Moreover, the results of molecular docking analysis indicated that niacin exerted effective binding capacity in COVID-19. Further, we disclosed the targets, biological functions and signaling pathways of niacin in CRC/COVID-19. The analysis indicated that niacin could help in treating CRC/COVID-19 through cytoprotection, enhancement of immunologic functions, inhibition of inflammatory reactions and regulation of cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, five core pharmacological targets of niacin in CRC/COVID-19 were also identified, including BCL2L1, PTGS2, IL1B, IFNG and SERPINE1. CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, revealed the niacin-associated molecular functions and pharmacological targets for treating CRC/COVID-19, as COVID-19 remains a serious pandemic. But the findings were not validated in actual CRC patients infected with COVID-19, so further investigation is needed to confirm the potential use of niacin for treating CRC/COVID-19.","Li, Rong; Li, Yu; Liang, Xiao; Yang, Lu; Su, Min; Lai, Keng Po",Brief Bioinform,41,16

The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics approaches. And the predictions further indicate that some viral prototypes might utilize the rat ACE2 while rats might serve as a vector or reservoir of SARS-CoV.","Zhang, Yuan; Zheng, Nan; Nan, Peng; Cao, Ying; Hasegawa, Masami; Zhong, Yang",Comput Biol Chem,41,5

This methodology is characterised by following a bottom-up approach, where usability and user needs are at the heart of the development. Recent research on user requirements for captioning in immersive environments has shown that there is both a need for improvement and a wealth of research opportunities. The final aim is to identify how to display captions for an optimal viewing experience. This work began four years ago with some partial findings. We build from the lessons learnt, focussing on the user-centric design requirements cornerstone: prototyping. Our prototype framework integrates methods used in existing solutions aiming at instant contrast-and-compare functionalities. The first part of the article presents the state of the art for user requirements identifying the reasons behind the development of the prototyping framework. The second part of the article describes the two-stage framework development. The initial framework concept answered to the challenges resulting from the previous research. As soon as the first framework was developed, it became obvious that a second improved solution was required, almost as a showcase on how ideas can quickly be implemented for user testing, and for users to elicit requirements and creative solutions. The article finishes with a list of functionalities, resulting in new caption modes, and the opportunity of becoming a comprehensive immersive captions testbed, where tools such as eye-tracking, or physiological testing devices could be testing captions across any device with a web browser.","Hughes, Chris.

Particularly, it focuses on reflection of teacher’s type in reaching digital literacy of the primary school pupils. The contribution is considered from the view how (fast) teachers’ adopt innovations in this field. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory is applied on an intentionally selected sample of Czech primary school teachers (N = 167). Applying the tool designed by Kankaanrinta and based on the Rogers’ theory, teachers were structured into five groups (Innovators, Early adopters, Early majority, Late majority, Laggards) and the null hypothesis was tested stating that the level of digital literacy with the primary school learners does not depend on the teacher’s type (according to the Rogers’ typology of diffusion of innovation). Consequently, the increase in knowledge of learners (N = 173) was considered for each type of teachers through didactic pretest and posttest, each consisting of 18 tasks. For the purpose of testing, a special environment was designed to avoid any impact of learners’ previous knowledge on the results, and a Dell Latitude notebook was set as a hardware platform. The software part was based on the open-source software exploiting Xubuntu 15.10 operational system developed on Ubuntu/Linux basis.

The clearance of senescent cells is expected to decrease chronic, low-grade inflammation and improve tissue repair capacity, thus attenuating the decline of physical function in aged organisms. However, selective and effective clearance of senescent cells of different cell types has proven challenging. Herein, we developed a prodrug strategy to design a new compound based on the increased activity of lysosomal β-galactosidase (β-gal), a primary characteristic of senescent cells. Our prodrug SSK1 is specifically activated by β-gal and eliminates mouse and human senescent cells independently of senescence inducers and cell types. In aged mice, our compound effectively cleared senescent cells in different tissues, decreased the senescence- and age-associated gene signatures, attenuated low-grade local and systemic inflammation, and restored physical function. Our results demonstrate that lysosomal β-gal can be effectively leveraged to selectively eliminate senescent cells, providing a novel strategy to develop anti-aging interventions.","Cai, Yusheng; Zhou, Huanhuan; Zhu, Yinhua; Sun, Qi; Ji, Yin; Xue, Anqi; Wang, Yuting; Chen, Wenhan; Yu, Xiaojie; Wang, Longteng; Chen, Han; Li, Cheng; Luo, Tuoping; Deng, Hongkui",Cell Res,41,32

Le nombre total de décès déclarés reste faible. En septembre 2020, on dénombrait 1532 cas et 81 décès sur la ville de Bamako, dont 466 cas et 27 décès dans la commune VI. Cette étude évalue la proportion de la population ayant été infectée par le SARS-CoV-2 à Bamako et la compare aux données rapportées afin d’éclairer l’épidémie de COVID-19 au Mali. Matériels et méthodes L’étude a eu lieu dans 3 quartiers de la commune VI de Bamako. Un échantillonnage stratifié par quartiers et secteurs a permis de tirer au sort des concessions, dans lesquelles tous les ménages acceptant de participer ont été inclus. Les participants ont été inclus à leur domicile, répondu à un questionnaire et fourni un échantillon sanguin. Les anticorps IgM et IgG contre la protéine Spike du SARS-CoV-2 ont été détectés par ELISA. La séroprévalence et l’intervalle de confiance à 95 % (IC95 %) ont été calculés pour la commune VI, par quartier, par classe d’âge. Le nombre total d’infections survenues à Bamako a été estimé en appliquant les taux de séroprévalence mesurés par âge et par sexe à la population de Bamako (données de recensement de 2009 actualisées en 2017). Le nombre de décès attendus a été calculé en appliquant aux infections estimées les taux de mortalité par classe d’âge observés en Chine durant la phase précoce de l’épidémie (alors que la prise en charge n’avait pas été optimisée). Résultats Du 16 au 29 septembre 2020, 1526 participants ont été inclus et 1367 résultats valides de sérologie obtenus. La séroprévalence brute s’élevait à 16,5 % (225/1367, IC95 %=14,5–18,5 %). La prévalence était similaire entre les 3 quartiers (Chi2, p =0,91). Une tendance non significative à l’augmentation avec l’âge a été observée. En tenant compte de la distribution par âge et par sexe de l’échantillon par rapport à celle de la population, la prévalence en population générale était estimée à 15,8 %, soit plus de 380 000 infections pour 2,4 millions d’habitants. Le nombre attendu de décès liés à la COVID-19 serait inférieur à 1500 entre mars et septembre 2020 à Bamako. Conclusion Cette étude transversale suggère une propagation lente mais généralisée du SARS-CoV-2 durant les 6 premiers mois de la pandémie à Bamako. La faible mortalité rapportée ne reflète pas les décès attendus, mais la létalité estimée reste faible (<4 décès/1000 cas), en accord avec la structure jeune de la population.

Four vaccines against Covid-19 have been approved to date. Their acceptance and safety have not been addressed on healthcare workers. The aim of the present study is to evaluate vaccination rates and side effects among Spanish nephrologists. Methods: All the Spanish nephrologists were invited to participate in this survey. Data on demographics, Covid-19 infection status, received vaccine doses and side effects were collected. Acceptance and side effects were analyzed for Covid-19 vaccination. Factors associated to vaccination were assessed and a multivariate adjusted model was constructed to determine independent predictors for Covid-19 vaccine side effects. Results: A total of 708 nephrologists answered the survey (460 [65%] women, mean age 44±11 years). Six-hundred and eight (86%) had received the first dose and 513 (72%) were fully vaccinated. Most of the subjects (565, 93%) received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech®) vaccine. Among vaccinated nephrologists, 453 (75%) presented any side effect; the most frequent was local reaction (68%), followed by myalgia (44%), tiredness (39%) and headache (34%). Age (OR 0.97, 95%CI [0.95-0.99], p<0.0001) and prior Covid-19 infection (OR 2.37, 95%CI [1.27-4.42], p=0.007) were independent predictors for developing side effects with Covid-19 vaccine. Overall side effects were similar with both vaccines, being myalgia (p=0.006) and tiredness (p=0.032) more frequent with the Pfizer-BioNTech® one.

METHODS: In 2019, we enrolled callers to three abortion accompaniment groups in three countries into a prospective study on the safety and effectiveness of self-managed medication abortion with accompaniment support. Participants completed up to five interview-administered questionnaires from baseline through 6-weeks after taking the pills. Primary outcomes included: (1) the number of participants enrolled in a 30-day period, (2) the proportion that had a complete abortion; and (3) the proportion who experienced any warning signs of potential or actual complications. RESULTS: Over the 30-day recruitment period, we enrolled 227 participants (95% of those invited), and retained 204 participants (90%) for at least one study follow-up visit. At the 1-week follow-up, two participants (1%) reported a miscarriage prior to taking the pills, and 202 participants (89% of those enrolled and 99% of those who participated in the 1-week survey) had obtained and taken the medications. Three weeks after taking the medications, 192 (95%) participants reported feeling that their abortion was complete. Three (1.5%) received a surgical intervention, two (1%) received antibiotics, and five (3%) received other medications. Participants did not report any major adverse events. CONCLUSION: These results establish the feasibility of conducting prospective studies of self-managed medication abortion in legally restrictive settings.

DESIGN: Simulation study of patient care interactions using N95 respirators contaminated with a higher and lower inocula of the benign virus bacteriophage MS2. METHODS: In total, 12 healthcare personnel performed 3 standardized examinations of mannequins including (1) control with suboptimal respirator handling technique, (2) improved technique with glove change after each N95 contact, and (3) control with 1-minute ultraviolet-C light (UV-C) treatment prior to donning. The order of the examinations was randomized within each subject. The frequencies of contamination were compared among groups. Observations and simulations with fluorescent lotion were used to assess routes of transfer leading to contamination. RESULTS: With suboptimal respirator handling technique, bacteriophage MS2 was frequently transferred to the participants, mannequin, and environmental surfaces and fomites. Improved technique resulted in significantly reduced transfer of MS2 in the higher inoculum simulations (P < .01), whereas UV-C treatment reduced transfer in both the higher- and lower-inoculum simulations (P < .01). Observations and simulations with fluorescent lotion demonstrated multiple potential routes of transfer to participants, mannequin, and surfaces, including both direct contact with the contaminated respirator and indirect contact via contaminated gloves. CONCLUSION: Reuse of contaminated N95 respirators can result in contamination of personnel and the environment even when correct technique is used. Decontamination technologies, such as UV-C, could reduce the risk for transmission.","Li, Daniel F.; Alhmidi, Heba; Scott, Jacob G.; Charnas, Ian C.; Pearlmutter, Basya; Silva, Sandra Y.; Wilson, Brigid M.; Donskey, Curtis J.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,41,24

Methods: We evaluated the sensitivity using a panel of finger prick blood samples from participants >18 years of age that had been tested for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. For assessing specificity, we used serum samples from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort participants collected in 2012 with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

China proceeds from the concept of ensuring full sovereignty by the member states of the organisation, but against the backdrop of low development rates of national economies (up to 2–2.5%) and lack of awareness by countries of their national interests in the region, Chinese business will strengthen its expansion, relying on both the World Trade Organisation rules and using protectionist measures by absorbing ineffective business entities. China is guided by the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, while maintaining its socio-political model based on the fusion of the communist ideology and the traditional philosophical doctrines of China and the mentality of the country’s population, excluding the democracy export policy, denying the desire for undivided hegemony and to rule the world community.

METHODS: We analyzed national surveillance data to compare incidence of respiratory viruses during 2016-2019 vs. 2020. Results of multiplex reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays for eight respiratory viruses were included: adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV; non-SARS-CoV-2), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). RESULTS: During 2016-2019, rates of detection of respiratory viruses were relatively stable: ADV, 3.7%-9.2%; PIV, 1.4%-17.0%; RSV, 0.3%-15.3%; IFV, 0.4%-35.6%; HCoV, 1.5%-8.4%; HRV, 7.0%-25.1%; HBoV, 0.6%-6.3%; and HMPV, 0.7%-14.5%. Following implementation of social distancing in February 2020, rates of detection of enveloped viruses (HCoV, HMPV, IFV, PIV and RSV) were significantly reduced by up to 100%. However, non-enveloped viruses (ADV, HRV and HBoV) persisted throughout 2020, and HRV rates in hospitalized patients significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of social distancing for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea, rates of detection of enveloped respiratory viruses decreased significantly, whereas non-enveloped viruses persisted, suggesting that enhanced infection prevention strategies are required to mitigate spread of these viruses.","Park, Sangshin; Michelow, Ian C; Choe, Young June",J Infect Dis,41,1

We sought to estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States during April 2020 and compare that to the number of expected deaths in the same time period. Methods: The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts that 67,212 COVID-19 deaths will occur during April 2020. To obtain the number of excess COVID-19 deaths, we multiplied published infection fatality rates by age by population numbers to obtain assumed infection rates. We then subtracted the expected number of deaths calculated using life table mortality rates. Results: During April 2020 there may be 61,690 to 62,526 excess deaths. Population infection rates of 3.6% to 4.3% by mid-April 2020 would generate the number of COVID-19 deaths predicted by IHME. Conclusions: During April 2020 over 90% of the COVID-19 deaths can be classified as excess deaths.

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","González-Sanguino, C.; Ausín, B.; Castellanos, M.A.; Saiz, J.; Muñoz, M.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,41,23

The fast speed of publication has challenged researchers and other stakeholders to keep up with the volume of published articles. To search the literature effectively, researchers use databases such as PubMed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of different searches for COVID-19 records in PubMed and to assess the complexity of searches required. METHODS: We tested PubMed searches for COVID-19 to identify which search string performed best according to standard metrics (sensitivity, precision, and F-score). We evaluated the performance of 8 different searches in PubMed during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how complex a search string is needed. We also tested omitting hyphens and space characters as well as applying quotation marks. RESULTS: The two most comprehensive search strings combining several free-text and indexed search terms performed best in terms of sensitivity (98.4%/98.7%) and F-score (96.5%/95.7%), but the single-term search COVID-19 performed best in terms of precision (95.3%) and well in terms of sensitivity (94.4%) and F-score (94.8%). The term Wuhan virus performed the worst: 7.7% for sensitivity, 78.1% for precision, and 14.0% for F-score. We found that deleting a hyphen or space character could omit a substantial number of records, especially when searching with SARS-CoV-2 as a single term. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive search strings combining free-text and indexed search terms performed better than single-term searches in PubMed, but not by a large margin compared to the single term COVID-19. For everyday searches, certain single-term searches that are entered correctly are probably sufficient, whereas more comprehensive searches should be used for systematic reviews. Still, we suggest additional measures that the US National Library of Medicine could take to support all PubMed users in searching the COVID-19 literature.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Palayew, Adam; Rasmussen, Lauge Neimann; Andersen, Tue Helms; Nicholson, Joey; Norgaard, Ole",J Med Internet Res,41,9

Emergency departments (EDs), recognized as essential venues for HIV screening, may play a unique role in identifying undiagnosed HIV among PWID, who frequently present for complications of injection drug use (IDU). Our objective was to describe changes in HIV diagnoses among PWID detected by an ED HIV screening program and estimate the program’s contribution to HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide during the emergence of a regional HIV outbreak. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of electronically queried clinical records from an urban, safety-net ED’s HIV screening program and publicly available HIV surveillance data for its surrounding county, Hamilton County, Ohio. Outcomes included the change in number of HIV diagnoses and the ED’s contribution to case identification county-wide, overall and for PWID during 2014–2018. RESULTS: During 2014–2018, the annual number of HIV diagnoses made by the ED program increased from 20 to 42 overall, and from 1 to 18 for PWID. We estimated that the ED contributed 18% of HIV diagnoses in the county and 22% of diagnoses among PWID. CONCLUSIONS: The ED program contributed 1 in 5 new HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide, further illustrating the importance of ED HIV screening programs in identifying undiagnosed HIV infections. In areas experiencing increasing IDU, HIV screening in EDs can provide an early indication of increasing HIV diagnoses among PWID and can substantially contribute to case-finding during an HIV outbreak.","Faryar, Kiran A.; Ancona, Rachel M.; Reau, Zachary; Lyss, Sheryl B.; Braun, Robert S.; Rademaker, Todd; Sickles, Ryane K.; Lyons, Michael S.",PLoS One,41,21

There are no specific treatments for chronic HPV infection, resulting in an urgent unmet need for a modality that is safe and effective for both immunocompromised and otherwise normal patients with recalcitrant disease. DNA vaccination is attractive because it avoids the risks of administration of live vectors to immunocompromised patients, and can induce potent HPV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses. We have developed a DNA vaccine (pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2) encoding calreticulin (CRT) fused to E6, E7 and L2 proteins of HPV-16, the genotype associated with approximately 90% vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile and oropharyngeal HPV-associated cancers and the majority of cervical cancers. Administration of the DNA vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation induced significantly greater HPV-specific immune responses compared to IM injection alone or mixed with alum. Furthermore, pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination via electroporation of mice carrying an intravaginal HPV-16 E6/E7-expressing syngeneic tumor demonstrated more potent therapeutic effects than IM vaccination alone. Of note, administration of the DNA vaccine by IM injection followed by electroporation elicited potent E6 and E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antitumor effects despite CD4+ T cell-depletion, although no antibody response was detected. While CD4+ T cell-depletion did reduce the E6 and E7-specific CD8+ T cell response, it remained sufficient to prevent subcutaneous tumor growth and to eliminate circulating tumor cells in a model of metastatic HPV-16+ cancer. Thus, the antibody response was CD4-dependent, whereas CD4+ T cell help enhanced the E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell immunity, but was not required. Taken together, our data suggest that pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination via electroporation warrants testing in otherwise healthy patients and those with compromised CD4+ T cell immunity to treat HPV-16-associated anogenital disease and cancer.","Peng, Shiwen; Song, Liwen; Knoff, Jayne; Wang, Joshua W; Chang, Yung-Nien; Hannaman, Drew; Wu, T-C; Alvarez, Ronald D; Roden, Richard BS; Hung, Chien-Fu",Cell Biosci,41,1

We aim to describe the acute functional outcomes of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients after transferring out of the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: 51 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients at a national designated center for COVID-19 were included in this exploratory, retrospective observational cohort study from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. Functional outcomes were measured primarily with the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and divided into 2 categories: dependent ambulators (FAC 0–3) and independent ambulators (FAC 4–5). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine associations. Results: Many patients were dependent ambulators (47.1%) upon transferring out of ICU, although 92.2% regained independent ambulation at discharge. On multivariate analysis, we found that a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 1 or more (odds ratio 14.02, 95% CI 1.15–171.28, P = 0.039) and a longer length of ICU stay (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.04–2.16, P = 0.029) were associated with dependent ambulation upon discharge from ICU. Conclusions: Critically ill COVID-19 survivors have a high level of impairment following discharge from ICU. Such patients should be screened for impairment and managed appropriately by rehabilitation professionals, so as to achieve good functional outcomes on discharge.","Tay, Matthew Rong Jie; Ong, Poo Lee; Puah, Ser Hon; Tham, Shuen Loong",Front Med (Lausanne),41,30

Participants 1338 participants were enrolled in a home oximetry programme at one of the four pilot sites. Participants were excluded if primary care data and oxygen saturations are rest at enrolment were not available. 908 participants were included in the analysis. Interventions Home oximetry monitoring was provided to participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of Covid-19. Participants were enrolled following attendance to accident and emergency departments, hospital admission or referral through primary care services. Results Of 908 patients enrolled into four different Covid-19 home oximetry programmes in England, 771 (84.9%) had oxygen saturations at rest of 95% or more, and 320 (35.2%) were under 65 years of age and without comorbidities. 52 (5.7%) presented to hospital and 28 (3.1%) died following enrolment, of which 14 (50%) had Covid-19 as a named cause of death. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients enrolled after admission to hospital (OR 8.70, 95% CI: 2.5-29.9), compared to those enrolled in primary care, Patients enrolled after hospital discharge (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15-0.68) or emergency department presentation (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.89) were significantly less likely to present to hospital after enrolment than those enrolled in primary care. Conclusions This study find that home oximetry monitoring can be a safe pathway for Covid-19 patients; and indicates increases in risk to vulnerable groups and patients with oxygen saturations < 95% at enrolment, and in those enrolled on discharge from hospital. Findings from this evaluation have contributed to the national implementation of home oximetry across England, and further work will be undertaken to evaluate clinical effectiveness of the new pathway.","Clarke, J.; Flott, K.; Fernandez Crespo, R.; Ashrafian, H.; Fontana, G.; Benger, J.; Darzi, A.; Elkin, S.",,41,8

The significant advantages of Luminex xMAP technology are high-throughput, high parallel and automation. This study aimed to establish a liquid bead array based on Luminex xMAP technology that was able to simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens. METHODS: Specific probes and primers to detect the nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens were designed. Probes were coupled with fluorescent carboxylated microspheres. The parameters of the system were optimized, including ratio of forward/reverse primers (1:2), hybridization temperature (50 °C) and duration (30 min) and quantity of PCR product (2 μl). The sensitivity and specificity of the system were also evaluated. Moreover mixed nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens, including Bluetongue virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer, Coxiella burnetii, African swine fever virus, West Nile fever virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, vesicular stomatitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus and Schmalenberg’s disease virus, and 3000 clinical samples were tested for practicability. RESULTS: The optimized detection system showed high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. Each probe showed specific fluorescence signal intensity without any cross-hybridization for the other insect-borne pathogens tested, which included dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, spotted fever group rickettsiae, ehrlichiae and chikungunya virus. The limit of detection was 10 copies of target gene. Insect-borne pathogens were successfully detected among the 3000 clinical samples, and the results were consistent with those obtained using gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits. CONCLUSIONS: This optimized liquid array detection system was high-throughput and highly specific and sensitive in screening of the insect-borne pathogens. It was promising in detection of these pathogens for molecular epidemiological studies.

This short-version-PDS had good psychometric properties among Japanese adults with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to translate and culturally validate the short-version-PDS for the Brazilian sociolinguistic context. Methods: A translation of the short-version-PDS was performed based on established guidelines. We enrolled 53 patients with PTSD as a potential comorbidity. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the short-version-PDS included forward and back-translation by a Japanese Brazilian researcher and a certified translator; synthesis was achieved by consensus, backward translation, pilot test, and finalization. Content validity coefficient (CVC) was used to assess quality of adaptation. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Spearman correlations were between the new short-version-PDS and the Brazilian version of the posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the best cut-off values for the short-version-PDS. Results: The short-version-PDS was well accepted by all subjects, none of the questions were experienced as inappropriate, and all questions of the 3 items were judged important. Item 1 presented CVCt = 0.92; item 2 had a CVCt = 0.87 and item 3 had a CVCt = 0.95. The internal consistency of the final version as measured by Cronbach's alpha was 0.78. The short-version-PDS scale correlated positively with the DSM-5 scale with a Spearman rho of 0.64 (95%CI [0.4-0.8], p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was 0.97 (95%CI [0.9-1.0], p < 0.001).

The study involved 17 explosives detection dogs, two cadaver detection dogs and two dogs with no previous detection training. Training lasted two weeks before starting the validation protocol. Sequential five and seven-cone line-ups were used with axillary sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative). A total of 1368 trials were performed during validation, including 151 positive and 110 negative samples. Each line-up had one positive sample and at least one negative sample. The dog had to mark the positive sample, randomly positioned behind one of the cones. The dog, handler and data recorder were blinded to the positive sample location. The calculated overall sensitivities were between 71% and 79% for three dogs, between83% and 87% for three other dogs, and equal to or higher than 90% for the remaining 15 dogs (more than two thirds of the 21 dogs).

Despite having no or minimal symptoms, some patients may have markedly reduced pulse oximetry readings. This has been referred to as “silent” or “apathetic” hypoxia (Ottestad et al., 2020 [1]). We present a case of a 72-year-old male with COVID-19 syndrome who presented to the emergency department with minimal symptoms but low peripheral oxygen saturation readings. The patient deteriorated over the following days and eventually died as a result of overwhelming multi-organ system failure. This case highlights the utility of peripheral oxygen measurements in the evaluation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Self-monitoring of pulse oximetry by patients discharged from the emergency department is a potential way to identify patients needing to return for further evaluation.","Wilkerson, R.

Long‐COVID syndrome symptoms, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients undertaking or following chemotherapy for cancer (chemofog or chemobrain), as well in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The pathogenesis of brain fog in these illnesses is presently unknown but may involve neuroinflammation via mast cells stimulated by pathogenic and stress stimuli to release mediators that activate microglia and lead to inflammation in the hypothalamus. These processes could be mitigated by phytosomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the natural flavonoid luteolin.","Theoharides, Theoharis C.; Cholevas, Christos; Polyzoidis, Konstantinos; Politis, Antonios",Biofactors,41,32

However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density. COVID-19 testing through pharmacies can improve access across the US. Even if only few pharmacies offer testing, judicious selection of specific sites can simplify logistics and improve access.","Risanger, Simon; Singh, Bismark; Morton, David; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",medRxiv,41,28

Extended interval dosing (EID) is a promising strategy to mitigate the risk of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, but it is unknown whether EID affects wearing-off symptoms. In this observational study, we evaluated if prevalence or intensity of wearing-off symptoms changed when natalizumab dosing intervals were extended from 4 to 6 weeks in 30 treated patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Norway. New or increased wearing-off symptoms during EID were reported by 50%. Symptom increase was more frequent among patients with pre-existing wearing-off symptoms during standard dosing compared to patients without such pre-existing symptoms [p = 0.0005]. Our observations support the need to study the effect of EID on wearing-off symptoms in randomized controlled trials.","Bringeland, Gerd Haga; Blaser, Nello; Myhr, Kjell-Morten; Vedeler, Christian Alexander; Gavasso, Sonia",J Neurol Sci,41,11

METHODS: Data were collected from 4005 individuals through an online survey conducted 3–4 weeks after the nationwide lockdown implementation in France. Participants were asked whether they practiced five behaviors (i.e., screen watching, snacking, eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, and walking) less often, as often as, or more often than prior to the lockdown. Beliefs and expectations toward the COVID-19 epidemic were also assessed using an adapted version of Witte’s EPPM, together with sociodemographic and environmental variables. Among the respondents consuming regularly alcohol and tobacco, logistic regressions were performed to estimate the Odds ratios (ORs) of increase (yes/no) and decrease (yes/no) in drinking and smoking since the lockdown. RESULTS: More than 8 in 10 respondents reported unhealthy changes in lifestyle since the lockdown, mostly in relation to physical activity. The unhealthy changes were positively associated with male sex (RR = 1.17; confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.10–1.24), living urban density, having a garden (RR = 1.16 [1.07–1.26]), financial difficulties because of COVID-19 (RR = 1.09 [1.02–1.18]), and lack of fear control (RR = 1.04 [1.01–1.09]) and negatively with cognitive avoidance (RR = 0.92 [0.89–0.95]). Less than 4 in 10 respondents reported healthy changes over the same period, mostly in relation to better eating habits. They were positively associated with living with more than two persons (RR = 1.22 [1.02–1.45]), having a terrace (RR = 1.14 [1.02–1.29], and perceived efficacy (RR = 1.11 [1.04–1.08]) and negatively with being aged 40 or higher. Alcohol consumption overall declined in regular drinkers, while a slight increase in tobacco use was observed in regular smokers. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown resulted in frequent and mostly unhealthy changes in lifestyle among the general population. These changes were related to individual and environmental characteristics but also to EPPM appraisals in the wake of fear appeal from COVID-19 campaigns. Communication and preventive measures should include messages and initiatives toward the maintenance of healthy lifestyles during pandemics such as the adaptation of physical activity and eating guidelines to the particular contexts of mobility restriction and infection control.","Constant, Aymery; Conserve, Donaldson Fadael; Gallopel-Morvan, Karine; Raude, Jocelyn",Front Psychol,41,26

To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player’s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","Huang, Jiechen; Wang, Juan; Xia, Chengyi",Chaos Solitons Fractals,41,21

Although the pathophysiology of this lethal virus is still not fully understood, it has been suspected to attach to the ACE2 receptors leading to its deadly pathogenesis. Found to be the cause of venous thrombotic and embolic events, arterial thrombotic events such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been an unusual phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old female with a past medical history of COVID-19 infection 12 days prior to admission presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of shortness of breath for 2 to 3 days prior to admission. In the ED she was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air for which she was placed on 90% FiO2 via OptiFlow and nonrebreather mask. Her D-Dimer on admission was noted to be 506 ng/mL (normal value <500 ng/mL). Unfortunately, due to worsening respiratory distress the decision was made to intubate the patient and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. An electrocardiogram was also obtained showing ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-V6 (Figure 1). An emergent bedside echocardiogram was obtained showing wall motion abnormalities consistent septal and anterior apical hypokinesis. A cardiac troponin level was obtained and was >80.00 ng/mL (normal value <0.04 ng/mL). The decision was made to proceed with cardiac catheterization for which complete stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was noted. She received one drug eluding stent to the proximal LAD and due to severe cardiogenic shock an Impella was placed for hemodynamic support. Despite aggressive intervention and multiple vasopressors and Impella support she continued to decompensate and ultimately succumbed to her condition. DISCUSSION: STEMI is a rare complication of COVID-19 infection with an incidence of about 1%. The pathophysiology of STEMI in this setting is still not yet understood;however, COVID-19 infection is known to cause a hypercoagulable state through cytokine and complement activation as well as endothelial damage. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, COVID-19 should be considered as a cause for arterial thrombotic events such as STEMI. It is imperative that clinicians are aware of the complications of this deadly virus and aggressively manage the hypercoagulable state observed in these patients to prevent morbidity and mortality.

Here, we investigated the temporal transcriptional changes that occur in the cat intestine during T. gondii infection. METHODS: Cats were infected with 100 T. gondii cysts and their intestines were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) Illumina technology was used to gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are differentially expressed due to infection. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was also used to validate the level of expression of a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by sequencing. RESULTS: Our transcriptome analysis revealed 2363 DEGs that were clustered into six unique patterns of gene expression across all the time points after infection. Our analysis revealed 56, 184, 404, 508, 400 and 811 DEGs in infected intestines compared to uninfected controls at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hpi, respectively. RNA-Seq results were confirmed by qRT-PCR. DEGs were mainly enriched in catalytic activity and metabolic process based on gene ontology enrichment analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that transcriptional changes in the intestine of infected cats evolve over the course of infection, and the largest difference in the enriched pathways was observed at 96 hpi. The anti-T. gondii defense response of the feline host was mediated by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I, proteasomes, heat-shock proteins and fatty acid binding proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed novel host factors, which may be critical for the successful establishment of an intracellular niche during T. gondii infection in the definitive feline host.

To address this gap, this paper analyzes administrative data on utilization of contraceptive health services by women referred via community health promoters in two large urban and peri-urban areas of Mozambique. We focus on the period immediately surrounding the national state of emergency declaration linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 31, 2020. Data reported for 109,129 women served by 132 unique promoters and 192 unique public health facilities is analyzed using logistic regression, interrupted time series analysis and hazard analysis. The results demonstrate that the imposition of the state of emergency is associated with a modest short-term drop in both service provision and utilization, followed by a relatively rapid rebound. We conclude that in this context, the accessibility of reproductive health services was not dramatically reduced during the first phase of the pandemic-related emergency.","Leight, Jessica; Hensly, Catherine; Chissano, Marcos; Ali, Liza",PLoS One,41,23

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhu, Z.; Tang, J.; Chai, X.; Fang, Z.; Liu, Q.; Hu, X.; Xu, D.; He, J.; Tang, L.; Tai, S.; Wu, Y.; Zhou, S.",,41,1

Further, it requires sufficient discussions among related parties because the purpose of telemedicine is diagnosis and treatment, and the participation of medical specialists is essential. Based on the characteristics of the healthcare structure of Korea, which has a low proportion of public healthcare and most patients are taken care of by a few large tertiary care hospitals, the fundamental issues need to be discussed. METHODS: A comparison was conducted with overseas cases to discuss the prerequisites for the effective implementation of telemedicine in South Korea under the current situation. We also examined the structural characteristics of the Korean medical community. RESULTS: The current paper recommends that an in-depth analysis and studies are conducted on the following aspects: a search for telemedicine services focused on public healthcare, a search of services for illnesses that impose high levels of burden on households, and the development and implementation of a telemedicine system for follow-up management at primary and secondary care hospitals after the patient undergoes surgery or treatment at tertiary care hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: As the technology develops, the focus should also be on factors such as safety, usefulness, availability, and how the functions will be realized in order to enable user communication. A clear system should be established to regulate and manage the lack of sufficient discussions. In addition, seeking projects and systems that reflect the characteristics of each country will facilitate the efficient implementation of telemedicine.","Lee, Hyeoi-Yun; Lee, Ji-San; Kim, Jeongeun",Healthc Inform Res,41,24

The first goal of the study was to analyze the antibody titre seven days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of 248 healthcare workers (HCWs). The second goal was to analyze how antibody titre changes in correlation with age, gender, BMI and hypertension. METHODS: : An immunogenicity evaluation was carried out among HCWs vaccinated at the Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri (IFO), Rome, Italy. All HCWs were asked to be vaccinated by the Italian national vaccine campaign at the beginning of 2021. 260 vaccinated HCWs were enrolled in the study. All eligible participants were assigned to receive the priming dose in two weeks’ time and the booster dose exactly 21 days thereafter. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 7 days after second dose of vaccine. Quantitative measurements of IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens of SARS-CoV-2 were performed with a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay. Presence of SARS-Cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swab was determined by commercial RT-PCR testing. FINDINGS: : 248 HWCs were analyzed, 158 women (63.7%) and 90 men (36.3%). After the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, 99.5% of participants developed a humoral immune response. The geometric mean concentration of antibodies among the vaccinated subjects after booster dose (285.9 AU/mL 95% CI: 249.5–327.7) was higher than that of human convalescent sera (39.4 AU/mL, 95% CI: 33.1–46.9), with p<0.0001. Multivariate linear regression analysis of AU/mL by age, gender and BMI multivariate was performed by the inclusion of covariates. This analysis demonstrated that age (p<0.0001) and gender (p = 0.038) are statistically associated with differences in antibody response after vaccination, whereas BMI and hypertension have no statistically significant association (p = 0.078 and p = 0.52 respectively).","Pellini, Raul; Venuti, Aldo; Pimpinelli, Fulvia; Abril, Elva; Blandino, Giovanni; Campo, Flaminia; Conti, Laura; De Virgilio, Armando; De Marco, Federico; Di Domenico, Enea Gino; Di Bella, Ornella; Di Martino, Simona; Ensoli, Fabrizio; Giannarelli, Diana; Mandoj, Chiara; Manciocco, Valentina; Marchesi, Paolo; Mazzola, Francesco; Moretto, Silvia; Petruzzi, Gerardo; Petrone, Fabrizio; Pichi, Barbara; Pontone, Martina; Zocchi, Jacopo; Vidiri, Antonello; Vujovic, Branka; Piaggio, Giulia; Morrone, Aldo; Ciliberto, Gennaro",EClinicalMedicine,41,1

Critical vessel characteristics including the degree of angulation and tortuosity influence the ability to advance stent retriever devices toward the site of occlusion. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of carotid artery catheter pathway accessibility on the thrombectomy outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Traditional imaging modalities generate incomplete pictures of the vascular tortuosity and are prone to clinical judgment errors. Recent three-dimensional computed tomography angiography image analysis techniques circumvent these limitations to calculate accurate tortuosity and angulation measurements. These novel images facilitate classifying common anatomical variant patients into groups that may be treated with specially designed catheter devices. Importantly, this image analysis method reveals significant angulation in the common carotid artery and extracranial internal carotid artery that correlates with delays in reaching the occlusion site. Increased age, which is associated with increased risk of stroke, also increases the incidence of severe tortuosity. The semi-automated measurements technique also demonstrate that full 360° arterial loops are present in nearly 3% of catheter pathways and that the overall degree of angulation differs bilaterally. In this review, we examine the utility of this novel image analysis procedure and evaluate the recent literature relevant to neuroendovascular thrombectomy in AIS patients. Three literature databases – PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were queried for original articles investigating both preclinical and clinical thrombectomy applications.","Farooq, Jeffrey; Lee, Jea Young",Brain Circ,41,16

To better understand the role of vitamin D deficiency in the disease course of COVID-19, we undertook a retrospective case-control study in North West England. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether hospitalization with COVID-19 is more prevalent in individuals with lower vitamin D levels. METHODS: The study included individuals with test results for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) between April 1, 2020, and January 29, 2021, from 2 districts in North West England. The last 25(OH)D level in the previous 12 months was categorized as “deficient” if less than 25 nmol/L and “insufficient” if 25 to 50 nmol/L. RESULTS: The study included 80 670 participants. Of these, 1808 were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, of whom 670 died. In a primary cohort, median serum 25(OH)D in nonhospitalized participants with COVID-19 was 50.0 nmol/L (interquartile range [IQR], 34.0-66.7) vs 35.0 nmol/L (IQR, 21.0-57.0) in those admitted with COVID-19 (P < 0.005). In a validation cohort, median serum 25(OH)D was 47.1 nmol/L (IQR, 31.8-64.7) in nonhospitalized vs 33.0 nmol/L (IQR, 19.4-54.1) in hospitalized patients. Age-, sex-, and season-adjusted odds ratios for hospital admission were 2.3 to 2.4 times higher among participants with serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L compared with those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels, without excess mortality risk. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Widespread measurement of serum 25(OH)D and treatment of insufficiency or deficiency may reduce this risk.","Jude, Edward B; Ling, Stephanie F; Allcock, Rebecca; Yeap, Beverly X Y; Pappachan, Joseph M",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,41,20

This database documents cases of MERS-CoV globally, with specific attention paid to zoonotic transmission. An initial literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; after screening articles according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 208 sources were selected for extraction and geo-positioning. Each MERS-CoV occurrence was assigned one of the following classifications based upon published contextual information: index, unspecified, secondary, mammal, environmental, or imported. In total, this database is comprised of 861 unique geo-positioned MERS-CoV occurrences. The purpose of this article is to share a collated MERS-CoV database and extraction protocol that can be utilized in future mapping efforts for both MERS-CoV and other infectious diseases. More broadly, it may also provide useful data for the development of targeted MERS-CoV surveillance, which would prove invaluable in preventing future zoonotic spillover.","Ramshaw, Rebecca E.; Letourneau, Ian D.; Hong, Amy Y.; Hon, Julia; Morgan, Julia D.; Osborne, Joshua C.

An animal model that supports MERS-CoV infection and causes severe lung disease is useful to study pathogenesis and evaluate therapies and vaccines. The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10–12 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10–12 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease. To generate a mouse model with associated morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, we serially passaged HCoV-EMC/2012 strain in the lungs of young hDPP4 KI mice. After 30 in vivo passages, an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated MERS(MA)6.1.2. This virus clone produced significantly higher titers than the parental clone in the lungs of hDPP4 KI mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the procedures used to mouse adapt MERS-CoV by serial passage of the virus in lungs. We also describe the methods used to isolate virus clones and characterize virus infection.","Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B.",MERS Coronavirus,41,2

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier function through repairing intestinal epithelial damage. However, little was known about the effects of IL-22 against apoptosis caused by toxins and infection of intestinal pathogens in the intestinal epithelium, especially in pigs. In this study, we had successfully used prokaryotic expression system to produce recombinant porcine interleukin-22. Meanwhile, purified rIL-22 could activate STAT3 signal pathway and have been demonstrated to be safe to IPEC-J2 cells by increasing E-cadherin expression, without proinflammatory cytokines changes. Furthermore, rIL-22 reversed apoptosis induced by deoxynivalenol (DON) and played a vital part in repairing the intestinal injury. We also found that rIL-22 stimulated epithelial cells to secrete pBD-1 against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) K88 infection, as well as alleviating apoptosis ratio. This study provided a theoretical basis for curing intestinal inflammation caused by ETEC infection and epithelial apoptosis induced by DON with rIL-22 in pigs.","Li, Yunyun; Wang, Jinquan; Li, Yuchen; Wu, Haiqin; Zhao, Shiyi; Yu, Qinghua",Veterinary Microbiology,41,10

The authors suggest that 2D:4D is linked with ACE variant prevalence, and that higher male 2D:4D is associated with higher case fatality ratios, and point to 2D:4D as a useful prognostic measure for COVID-19 susceptibility. A critical review and robust Bayesian analysis of the hypothesis is described here, finding no conclusive evidence of COVID-19 mortality and 2D:4D, nor associations between 2D:4D and ACE1 allele or ACE2 genotype frequency.

METHODS: National data were used to calculate the weekly and monthly CFRs, stratified by three age groups: 0-64, 65-79, and 80+ years. We also calculated the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) to offset the differences in age composition. RESULTS: The epidemic consisted of the initial wave, a trough in June, and two conjoined summer waves, yielding 17 206 coronavirus disease 2019 cases and 290 deaths. While the number of confirmed cases nearly quadrupled during summer, case fatality estimates decreased; CFR in spring was 4.81 (95% confidence interval 3.91-5.71), compared with 1.24 (1.06-1.42) in summer. The SMR for summer was 0.45 (0.37-0.55), suggesting that the case fatality risk halved compared with spring. Cardiovascular comorbidity was an important risk factor for case fatality (SMR 2.63 [2.20-3.13] during spring and 1.28 [1.02-1.59] during summer). The risk of death in ventilated patients remained unchanged (SMR 0.98 [0.77-1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic dynamics suggests summer decline in case fatality, except in ventilated patients. While the effect of comorbidity also decreased, cardiovascular comorbidity remained an important risk factor for death even during summer. A plethora of possible confounders and an ever-changing landscape of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Croatia require constant monitoring and evaluation, with an aim to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus and a disruption of health care functioning.","Kristić, Ivica; Pehlić, Marina; Pavlović, Mirjana; Kolarić, Branko; Kolčić, Ivana; Polašek, Ozren",Croat Med J,41,0

Many epidemic models have been developed to provide references for decision-making by governments and the World Health Organization. To capture and understand the characteristics of the epidemic trend, parameter optimization algorithms are needed to obtain model parameters. In this study, the authors propose using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) to identify epidemic models. This algorithm combines the advantage of the Gauss–Newton method and gradient descent method and has improved the stability of parameters. The authors selected four countries with relatively high numbers of confirmed cases to verify the advantages of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm over the traditional epidemiological model method. The results show that the Statistical-SIR (Statistical-Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model using LMA can fit the actual curve of the epidemic well, while the epidemic simulation of the traditional model evolves too fast and the peak value is too high to reflect the real situation. 摘要 现如今, 新冠肺炎(COVID-19)严重威胁着世界各国人民的生命健康.许多流行病学模型已经被用于为政策制定者和世界卫生组织提供决策参考.为了更加深刻的理解疫情趋势的变化特征, 许多参数优化算法被用于反演模型参数.本文提议使用结合了高斯-牛顿法和梯度下降法的Levenberg–Marquardt(LMA)算法来优化模型参数.使用四个病例数相对较多的国家来验证这一算法的优势:相较于传统流行病学模型模拟曲线过早过快的到达峰值, 应用LMA的Statistical-SIR(Statistical-Susceptible–Infected–Recovered)模型可以更好地拟合实际疫情曲线.","Zhang, Li; Huang, Jianping; Yu, Haipeng; Liu, Xiaoyue; Wei, Yun; Lian, Xinbo; Liu, Chuwei; Jing, Zhikun",,41,16

The objective of our study was to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different pediatric age groups during the first 2 months of the fall back-to-school period, in the context of increasing viral transmission in France. METHODS: Weekly epidemiological data provided by Santé Publique France and the Ministry of National Education were analyzed according to the age groups defined by the different school levels. Weeks (W) 34–42 were considered for analysis. RESULTS: The PCR positivity rate and incidence rate increased in all age groups during the study period, in an age-dependent manner. At W42, with adults being considered as reference, the risk ratio for a positive PCR test was 0.46 [95% CI: 0.44–0.49] and 0.69 [0.68–0.70] for children aged 0–5 years and 6–17 years, respectively. Similarly, the incidence rate ratio was 0.09 [0.08–0.09], 0.31 [0.30–0.32], 0.64 [0.63–0.66], and 1.07 [1.05–1.10] for children aged 0–5 years, 6–10 years, 11–14 years, and 15–17 years, respectively. Children and adolescents accounted for 1.9% of the newly hospitalized patients between W34 and W42, and for 1.3% of new intensive care admissions. No death was observed. Among infected children and adolescents, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals was 57% at W34 and 48% at W42. The number of schools closed remained low, less than 1% throughout the study period. The number of confirmed cases among school staff was consistent with the data measured in the general population. CONCLUSION: In the context of increasing viral transmission in the population, the spread among children and adolescents remained lower than that observed among adults, despite keeping schools open. However, the impact was age-dependent, with data in high schools close to those observed in adults.","Gras-Le Guen, C.; Cohen, R.; Rozenberg, J.; Launay, E.; Levy-Bruhl, D.; Delacourt, C.",Arch Pediatr,41,5

Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept.

By contrast, facial-expression recognition was not significantly correlated with measures of depression, positive or negative affect, empathy, or autistic-like traits. Because the range of affective factors considered in this study and its use of multiple expression-recognition tasks mean that it is a relatively comprehensive investigation of the role of affective factors in facial expression recognition, we carried out a direct replication. In common with Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 44, 503–517), scores on the DASS anxiety subscale negatively predicted performance on the emotion recognition tasks across multiple analyses, although these correlations were only consistently significant for performance on the emotion-labelling task.

Perform. 44, 503–517), other affective factors (e.g. those related to empathy) often also significantly predicted emotion-recognition performance. Collectively, these results support the proposal that affective factors predict individual differences in emotion recognition, but that these correlations are not necessarily specific to measures of general anxiety, such as the DASS anxiety subscale.","Alharbi, Sarah A.

Through subcutaneous priming and intranasal boosting, the combinatorial nanoshell vaccine elicits prominent lung-resident CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that surprisingly show better durability than live viral infections. In particular, nanoshells containing CpG-ODN and a pair of conserved class I and II major histocompatibility complex-restricted influenza nucleoprotein-derived antigenic peptides are demonstrated to induce near-sterilizing immunity against lethal infections with influenza A viruses of different strains and subtypes in mice, resulting in rapid elimination of replicating viruses.

After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36 to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2 to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98 to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74 to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85 to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90). In contrast, as expected, there was no association between population mobility changes and fiscal or monetary measures or emergency healthcare investment. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the effect of public policy on mobility in the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19 transmission. By using Citymapper’s mobility index, this work provides the first evidence about trends in mobility and the impacts of different policy interventions, suggesting that closure of public transport, workplaces and schools are particularly impactful.","Vannoni, Matia; McKee, Martin; Semenza, Jan C.; Bonell, Chris; Stuckler, David",Global Health,41,1

During the period of 1990 and 2000, three more tissue banks were set up, i.e., Biomaterial Centre in Surabaya, Jamil Tissue Bank in Padang, and Sitanala Tissue Bank in Tangerang. In 1994, BRTB produced bone allografts. The banks established under the IAEA program concentrated its work on the production of amnion, bone and soft tissues allografts, as well as bone xenografts. These tissues (allografts and xenografts) were sterilised using gamma irradiation (about 90%) and the rest were sterilized by ETO and those products have been used in the treatment of patients at more than 50 hospitals in Indonesia. In 2004, those tissue banks produced 8,500 grafts and 5,000 of them were amnion grafts for eye treatment and wound dressing. All of those grafts were used for patients as well as for research. In 2006, the production increased to 9,000 grafts. Although the capacity of those banks can produce more grafts, we are facing problems on getting raw materials from suitable donors. To fulfill the demand of bone grafts we also produced bone xenografts. The impact of the IAEA program in tissue banking activities in Indonesia can be summarised as follows: to support the national program on importing substitutes for medical devices. The price of imported tissues are between US$ 50 and US$ 6,000 per graft. Local tissue bank can produce tissues with the same quality with the price for about 10–30% of the imported tissues.","Hilmy, Nazly; Manjas, Menkher; Ferdiansyah; Abbas, Basril; Morales Pedraza, Jorge",Cell Tissue Bank,41,33

Until now, SARS‐CoV‐2 has been identified as the seventh member of the coronavirus family capable of infecting humans. In the past two decades, humankind has experienced outbreaks triggered by two other extremely infective members of the coronavirus family; the MERS‐CoV and the SARS‐CoV. According to several investigations, SARS‐CoV causes proteinuria and renal impairment or failure. The SARS‐CoV was identified in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney of infected patients. Also, renal dysfunction was observed in numerous cases of MERS‐CoV infection. And recently, during the 2019‐nCoV pandemic, it was found that the novel coronavirus not only induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also can induce damages in various organs including the liver, heart, and kidney. The kidney tissue and its cells are targeted massively by the coronaviruses due to the abundant presence of ACE2 and Dpp4 receptors on kidney cells. These receptors are characterized as the main route of coronavirus entry to the victim cells. Renal failure due to massive viral invasion can lead to undesirable complications and enhanced mortality rate, thus more attention should be paid to the pathology of coronaviruses in the kidney. Here, we have provided the most recent knowledge on the coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and COVID19) pathology and the mechanisms of their impact on the kidney tissue and functions.","Motavalli, Roza; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman; Achmad, Muhammad Harun; Sergeevna, Nataliya Klunko; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Adili, Ali; Khiavi, Farhad Motavalli; Marofi, Faroogh; Yousefi, Mehdi; Ghoreishizadeh, Shadi; Shomali, Navid; Etemadi, Jalal; Jarahian, Mostafa",IUBMB Life,41,2

Classroom teaching had to be converted almost entirely to digital formats within a short period of time. The present study provides an overview of the respective changes and associated complications as well as opportunities in teaching Neurology. Methodology: Lecturers in Neurology at all University hospitals in Germany were asked about their approach and the individual changes in their curriculum. Of a total of 39 locations, 23 answered the online questionnaire (see attachment 1). Results: While frontal teaching and lectures could be carried out digitally without any problems, difficulties arose especially in learning physical examination and bedside teaching. Most of the participants stated that they had not found satisfactory e-learning formats to replace teaching at the patients bed. Conclusion: The ad hoc changes in teaching Neurology resulted in significant additional effort for the part of lecturers, but were generally well accepted by students. The Corona pandemic thus ultimately offers an opportunity to enrich teaching in Neurology.","Biesalski, Anne-Sophie; von Kirchbauer, Isabelle; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike",GMS J Med Educ,41,29

We aim to study (1) changes in global arthroscopic practices, (2) recommendations on reducing risk to patients and health care workers (HCW), (3) changes in follow-up protocols of these patients. Systematic search was carried out by two different reviewers using three different online databases for all studies published in the English language before April 2020. The total number of abstracts screened initially was 314. After screening of these abstracts, a total of 13 studies were included for the systematic review. Numbers of orthopaedic injuries have seen a sharp fall during this time. Most elective surgical facilities were also closed at this time. Most studies have recommended telemedicine as an essential medium of providing continued care to patients during COVID-19. Studies have recommended that a conservative approach should be preferred for most patients with ligament injuries, and alternative procedures that have less requirement for an operating room should be explored. Common recommendation in all studies is that procedures of more elective nature should be postponed to a safer time frame when the transmission of COVID-19 virus in the population has declined. When surgeries are resumed, there is a need for triage of arthroscopy procedures from more important or urgent to less important ones. Elective surgical procedures should preferably be started with patients with no co-morbidities and lesser risk of peri-operative complications. All patients undergoing surgery and health care personnels should have some screening for disease. Attempts should be made to have shortest hospital stay. Choice of anaesthetic procedure should emphasize on minimal aerosolization of the virus. Regional anaesthesia is the preferred choice as far as possible. Most guidelines have recommended that patient follow up should be made telephonically or on video-conferencing.","Goyal, Tarun; Harna, Bushu; Taneja, Ashish; Maini, Lalit",Journal of arthroscopy and joint surgery,41,22

This study aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 age-stratified and overall morbidity and mortality rates based on analysis of extensive epidemiological data for the pervasive epidemic in Qatar, a country where < 9% of the population are ≥ 50 years. We show that SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality demonstrate a striking age dependence with low values for those aged < 50 years, but rapidly growing rates for those ≥ 50 years. Age dependence was particularly pronounced for infection criticality rate and infection fatality rate. With Qatar’s young population, overall SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality were not high with < 4 infections in every 1000 being severe or critical and < 2 in every 10,000 being fatal. Only 13 infections in every 1000 received any hospitalization in acute-care-unit beds and < 2 in every 1000 were hospitalized in intensive-care-unit beds. However, we show that these rates would have been much higher if Qatar’s population had the demographic structure of Europe or the United States.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) has among the highest prevalence of curable STIs including syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis, and high neonatal mortality rates. Diagnosis and treatment of these STIs in PNG rely on syndromic management. Advances in STI diagnostics through point-of-care (PoC) testing using GeneXpert technology hold promise for resource-constrained countries such as PNG. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of a cluster-randomised cross-over trial comparing antenatal PoC testing and immediate treatment of curable STIs with standard antenatal care in two provinces in PNG. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness of the PoC intervention compared with standard antenatal care will be assessed prospectively over the trial period (2017–2021) from societal and provider perspectives. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated for the primary health outcome, a composite measure of the proportion of either preterm birth and/or low birth weight; for life years saved; for disability-adjusted life years averted; and for non-health benefits (financial risk protection and improved health equity). Scenario analyses will be conducted to identify scale-up options, and budget impact analysis will be undertaken to understand short-term financial impacts of intervention adoption on the national budget. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for uncertainty in key model inputs.

In our research, we aimed to develop and validate a cost-effective, commercially available EMG-BFB device for home- and community-based use. We began by repurposing mTrigger(®) (mTrigger LLC, Newark, DE, USA), a cost-effective, portable EMG-BFB device, for gait application. This included developing features in the cellphone app such as step feedback, success rate, muscle activity calibration, and cloud integration. Next, we tested the validity and reliability of the mTrigger device in healthy adults by comparing it to a laboratory-grade EMG system. While wearing both devices, 32 adults walked overground and on a treadmill at four speeds (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 m/s). Statistical analysis revealed good to excellent test–retest reliability (r > 0.89) and good to excellent agreement in the detection of steps (ICC > 0.85) at all speeds between two systems for treadmill walking. Our results indicated that mTrigger compared favorably to a laboratory-grade EMG system in the ability to assess muscular activity and to provide biofeedback during walking in healthy adults.","Koiler, Reza; Bakhshipour, Elham; Glutting, Joseph; Lalime, Amy; Kofa, Dexter; Getchell, Nancy",Int J Environ Res Public Health,41,16

METHODS: We devised and filmed a range of simulation techniques that mimic steps of phacoemulsification cataract surgery using various “everyday” basic materials. This video was combined in a “parallel” fashion with live cataract surgery so that all steps of surgery were simulated. Subsequently, we distributed an online subjective validation questionnaire on Google Forms with the embedded simulation video in a generic invitation that was forwarded via email and/or text messages/WhatsApp messenger amongst Ophthalmologists of all grades within our regions (Kent, Surrey and Sussex, London and Wales Postgraduate Deaneries). RESULTS: Face validity: 66 (99%) participants agreed that the explanations in the video were clear and 53 (79%) concurred with the realistic feel of simulated technique. Instrumentation and adaptations demonstrated were deemed user friendly and conducive to replicate by 99% participants. Content validity: 60 (90%) of participants agreed the techniques described in the video reflected the technical skills required to train cataract surgeons. Forty-nine (74%) agreed that the simulation techniques were relevant for acquiring other generic and transferable microsurgical and manual dexterity skills.

The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO(2) emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO(2) emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)). The present-day radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m(−2) (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5% (range 1.3–10%, 90% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m(−2) including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9% of current forcing (range 2–14%, 90% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3–4 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO(2) on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO(2) effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NO(x) result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NO(x) emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a ‘hydrogen economy’ develops. The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO(2) impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectors, where the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.","Lee, D.S.; Pitari, G.; Grewe, V.; Gierens, K.; Penner, J.E.; Petzold, A.; Prather, M.J.; Schumann, U.; Bais, A.; Berntsen, T.; Iachetti, D.; Lim, L.L.; Sausen, R.",Atmos Environ (1994),41,21

A literature search across PubMed and internet was conducted. A number of studies dealing with COVID-19 were identified. The data elucidated that increased pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines in combination with hypoxia, thromboembolism and pneumonia are involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although many drugs has been tested in monotherapy regimen with varying outcome or without desirable effect, there is still hope for better results by simultaneously targeting the virus itself and its symptoms. Theoretically, a mixture of at least two available antiviral drugs in combination with other anti-pathogenic and immune system-enhancing drugs or combination of antiviral drugs with convalescent plasma seems likely to have much better effect than the monotherapy regimen of either of these drugs.","Duner, Pontus; Salehi, Albert",J Clin Med Res,41,32

Knowledge about the infectious state of intraocular structures could influence the daily work of ophthalmic surgeons. OBSERVATIONS: We analyzed ocular samples from a patient who had succumbed to COVID-19 pneumonia for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We detected viral RNA in the ocular-surface samples on one swab and in one excidate from the conjunctiva. Samples from the anterior chamber and vitreous revealed no SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSIONS: and Importance SARS-CoV-2 can effectively be inactivated with standard disinfection agents. The now proven absence of SARS-CoV-2 in intraocular fluids could influence how ophthalmic surgeons work. Without having to account for the risk of a contagion via the anterior chamber and/or vitreous body, the surgical staff would require no additional, more elaborate protection.","Lauermann, Peer; Storch, Marcus; Weig, Michael; Tampe, Björn; Winkler, Martin; Hoerauf, Hans; Feltgen, Nicolas; Hakroush, Samy",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,41,11

We reported six serial cases of bradycardia attributable to Covid-19. Four among them developed a complete atrioventricular block. These patients experienced clinical symptoms related to bradycardia initially required a permanent pacemaker implantation. One patient later however did not require permanent pacing due to spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. In comparison, the other two patients who developed transient sinus bradycardia experienced a self-limiting condition during their hospitalization period without requiring any cardiac pacing device nor medication to increase heart rate. Complete atrioventricular block and transient sinus bradycardia in these patients despite not having any history of bradycardia might be due to complex processes in the systemic inflammatory response in covid-19. Cardiac monitoring, hemodynamic evaluation, and strategy for permanent pacemaker in these patients should be treated as a case-by-case basis.","Amir, Muzakkir; Yoseph, Hendry; Farisi, Aulia Thufael Al; Phie, James Klemens Phieter; Adam, Andi Tiara Salengke",Int J Infect Dis,41,1

Here, we described quickness and cheaper strategies of direct RT-qPCR (in the absence of RNA isolation) and compared the results to those obtained using standard RNA isolation procedure. The tests varied using pure, diluted samples, combined with Proteinase K (PK) or Lysis Buffer. Our findings showed consistently that PK pre-treated samples in the absence of RNA extraction procedures presents similar results to those obtained by standard RNA isolation procedures. On average, 16 samples extracted with the MagMAX™ CORE Kit, take around 2 h, costing an average of USD 5, the pre-treatment of samples using PK, on the other hand, would cut the value to less than USD 0.30 and reduce the time of procedure in more than 1 ½ hours.

It is currently unknown whether programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade therapy affects severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity on the basis of no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter. Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status. After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. PD-1 blockade does not appear to affect the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: A key question in oncology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is whether PD-1 blockade therapy affects COVID-19 severity.

Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre- and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins.

Remdesivir (REM) was granted its first conditional marketing authorisation in the EU in June 2020. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and local health authorities all across the EU have since strongly recommended the implementation of pharmacovigilance activities aimed at further evaluating the safety of this new drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) attributed to either REM or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, a Portuguese hospital centre based in Lisbon. We present the preliminary results reporting plausible adverse effects of either HCQ or REM. METHODS: An observational cohort study was carried out between 16 March and 15 August 2020. Participants were divided into two cohorts: those prescribed an HCQ regimen, and those prescribed REM. Suspected ADRs were identified using an active monitoring model and reported to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System through its online notification tool. The ADR cumulative incidence was compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The study included 149 patients, of whom 101 were treated with HCQ and the remaining 48 with REM. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. A total of 102 ADRs were identified during the study period, with a greater incidence in the HCQ cohort compared with the REM cohort (47.5% vs 12.5%; p<0.001). Causality was assessed in 81 ADRs, all of which were considered possible. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data are crucial to further establish the safety profile for REM.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), NHS Health Economics Database, and bibliographies. Outcome measures Percentage of patients with complete resolution at 24 and 48 hours, mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of symptoms, days missed from work or school, recurrence, and adverse events. Results We included eight trials, consisting of 743 patients in total (369 children, 374 adults). 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. In addition to antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids significantly increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (four trials) by more than three times (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1), and at 48 hours (three trials) to a lesser extent (1.7, 1.3 to 2.1).

However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011–2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: < 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. RESULTS: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.","Simusika, Paul; Tempia, Stefano; Chentulo, Edward; Polansky, Lauren; Mazaba, Mazyanga Lucy; Ndumba, Idah; Mbewe, Quinn K.; Monze, Mwaka",BMC Health Serv Res,41,1

METHODS: PubMed was used to search for studies published from January 1995 to June 2019 using the key words Alkhumra virus, Alkhurma virus, novel flavivirus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Additionally, records of the Saudi Ministry of Health were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles on AHFV were identified. Acute febrile flu-like illness, hepatitis, hemorrhagic manifestations, and, less commonly, encephalitis are the main clinical features. The virus seems to be transmitted from livestock animals to humans by direct contact with these animals or their raw meat, or perhaps by tick or mosquito bites. The ability of ticks and mosquitoes to serve as vectors for AHFV needs to be confirmed by biological studies. The exact role of animals such as sheep, goats, camels, and other mammals in the transmission and maintenance of the virus remains to be elucidated.

Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is now widely used as the gold standard for detecting viruses. Although a multiplex assay is essential for identifying virus types and subtypes, the poor multiplicity of RT-qPCR makes it laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe the development of a multiplex RT-qPCR platform with hydrogel microparticles acting as independent reactors in a single reaction. To build target-specific particles, target-specific primers and probes are integrated into the particles in the form of noncovalent composites with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The thermal release characteristics of DNA, primer, and probe from the composites of primer-BNNT and probe-CNT allow primer and probe to be stored in particles during particle production and to be delivered into the reaction. In addition, BNNT did not absorb but preserved the fluorescent signal, while CNT protected the fluorophore of the probe from the free radicals present during particle production. Bicompartmental primer-incorporated network (bcPIN) particles were designed to harness the distinctive properties of two nanomaterials. The bcPIN particles showed a high RT-qPCR efficiency of over 90% and effective suppression of non-specific reactions. 16-plex RT-qPCR has been achieved simply by recruiting differently coded bcPIN particles for each target. As a proof of concept, multiplex one-step RT-qPCR was successfully demonstrated with a simple reaction protocol.","Kim, Jung Min; Jung, Seungwon; Jeon, Eui Ju; Kim, Bong Kyun; No, Jin Yong; Kim, Myung Jong; Kim, Heesuk; Song, Chang Seon; Kim, Sang Kyung",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,41,16

The aim of the study was to explore the lifestyle changes of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania, the changes in prenatal care and delivery during the pandemic and the psychological impact on women and to determine how healthcare providers can help them to overcome this period. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted anonymously and distributed among pregnancy-related groups from Romania, recruiting 559 study participants, between May and October 2020. A total of 559 pregnant women completed an online 26-item questionnaire but we only validated 557 responses for study. The survey included basic demographic questions, pregnancy-related questions, questions regarding the pregnant women’s lifestyle changes during the pandemic and their perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and questions which evaluated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and delivery in Romania. Results: The pandemic restrictions affected women’s routine activities regarding professional, familial and social life. Therefore, for pregnant women who were emotionally vulnerable, these restrictions had a great impact on their mental health. The majority of the study participants (78.8%, N = 439) were emotionally affected by the pandemic. The fear related to the possibility of having their pregnancy affected by the virus was dominant in the group (45.8%). A high number of women (69.5%) felt safe when they accessed health services, but private hospitals were considered safer (53.1%) compared to public hospitals (14.4%). The majority of participants (53.7%) used to have prenatal care in a private healthcare system. During the pandemic, preventive measures were associated with low confidence in the healthcare system. Of the total group of participants, 123 women (22.1%) gave birth during the pandemic. Of these, a majority of the study participants considered that it was very difficult for them to cope without their partner during the hospitalization and labor period. Conclusions: The main anxiety of pregnant women were related to threats to their lives and their baby’s health because of the uncertainty caused by pandemic. It is important to know that the restrictions and the changes in maternity care had a negative impact on them. This conclusion must be taken into account when preventive measures will be decided for helping them to get through such a period. Additionally, psychological support will be essential for improving the mental health of pregnant women and for preventing a negative outcome of the pregnancy. These feelings must be taken into account when preventive measures will be established during pandemic and a psychological support will be essential for improving their mental health for preventing negative outcome of pregnancy.","Cigăran, Ruxandra-Gabriela; Botezatu, Radu; Mînecan, Elma-Maria; Gică, Corina; Panaitescu, Anca Maria; Peltecu, Gheorghe; Gică, Nicolae",Healthcare (Basel),41,16

In this review we aimed at summarizing all the relevant information to the orthopedic surgery community. To do this, a comprehensive search was performed with all related terms on two scientific search engines, PubMed and SCOPUS, and the results were filtered by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The result was 72 articles that were further reduced to 33 articles after full text reading. The resultant information was organized under 5 main headings; the impact of pandemic on the orthopedic practice, COVID-19 and the trauma patient, elective and emergency surgeries during the pandemic, peri-operative management of the patient with COVID-19, Miscellaneous effects of the pandemic such as those on training programs and the evolution of telemedicine. This review represents the most up to date information published in the literature that is a must-know to every orthopedic surgeon.","Abdelnasser, Mohammad Kamal; Morsy, Mohamed; Osman, Ahmed E.; AbdelKawi, Ayman F.; Ibrahim, Mahmoud Fouad; Eisa, Amr; Fadle, Amr A.; Hatem, Amr; Anter Abdelhameed, Mohammed; Hassan, Ahmed Abdelazim A.; Shawky Abdelgawaad, Ahmed",SICOT-J,41,20

Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) systems represent a potentially high efficient class of PoC tools. Here, we present a LoC system for automated pathogen analysis of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens. The device prepares total nucleic acids from extracted swab samples using magnetic silica beads. After reverse transcription the co-purified viral RNA is amplified in accordance with the QIAplex multiplex PCR technology. Hybridized to corresponding QIAGEN LiquiChip beads and labelled with streptavidin R-phycoerythrin, the amplified target sequences are finally detected using a QIAGEN LiquiChip200 workstation. All chemicals needed are either stored freeze-dried on the disposable chip or are provided in liquid form in a reagent cartridge for up to 24 runs. Magnetic stir bars for mixing as well as turning valves with metering structures are integrated into the injection-moulded disposable chip. The core of the controlling instrument is a rotating heating bar construction providing fixed temperatures for fast cycling. PCR times of about half an hour (for 30 cycles) could be achieved for 120 μl reactions, making this system the fastest currently available high-volume PCR chip. The functionality of the system was shown by comparing automatically processed nasopharyngeal samples to ones processed manually according to the QIAGEN “ResPlex™ II Panel v2.0” respiratory virus detection kit. A prototype of the present instrument revealed slightly weaker signal intensities with a similar sensitivity in comparison to the commercially available kit and automated nucleic acid preparation devices, even without protocol optimization.","Ritzi-Lehnert, Marion; Himmelreich, Ralf; Attig, Hans; Claußen, Jan; Dahlke, Rainer; Großhauser, Gerd; Holzer, Eva; Jeziorski, Markus; Schaeffer, Eva; Wende, Andy; Werner, Sabine; Wiborg, Jens Ole; Wick, Isabell; Drese, Klaus Stefan; Rothmann, Thomas",Biomed Microdevices,41,16

This has led the scientific community to explore the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, establishes productive infection, and causes life-threatening pathophysiology. Very few targeted therapeutics for COVID-19 currently exist, such as remdesivir. Recently, a proteomic approach explored the interactions of 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with cellular targets in human cells and identified 67 interactions as potential targets for drug development. Two of the critical targets, the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR, are inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 at nanomolar potency. SF2523 is the only known mTOR PI3K-α/(BRD2/BRD4) inhibitor with potential to block two orthogonal pathways necessary for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in human cells. Our results demonstrate that SF2523 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, showing an IC50 value of 1.5 µM, comparable to IC50 value of remdesivir (1.1 µM). Further, we demonstrated that the combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly synergistic: it allows for the reduction of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir by 25-fold and 4-fold, respectively, to achieve the same potency observed for a single inhibitor. Because SF2523 inhibits two SARS-CoV-2 driven pathogenesis mechanisms involving BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR signaling, our data suggest that SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir could be a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence be beneficial in preventing severe COVID-19 disease evolution.

Smartphone-based one-lead ECG monitors (sECG) were initially developed for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. No data have been published regarding their potential role in differentiating inappropiate sinus tachycardia (IST) from regular SVT. If cardiologists could distinguish IST from SVT in sECG, economic health care burden might be significantly reduced. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 75 consecutive patients with known SVT undergoing an EP study. In all patients, four ECG were recorded: a sECG during SVT and during sinus tachycardia and respective 12-lead ECG. Two experienced electrophysiologists were blinded to the diagnoses and separately evaluated all ECG. RESULTS: Three hundred individual ECG were recorded in 75 patients (47 female, age 50 ± 18 years, BMI 26 ± 5 kg/m(2), 60 AVNRT, 15 AVRT). The electrophysiologists’ blinded interpretation of sECG recordings showed a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 91% for the detection of SVT (interobserver agreement κ = 0.76). In high-quality sECG recordings (68%), sensitivity rose to 95% with a specificity of 92% (interobserver agreement of κ = 0.91). Specificity increased to 96% when both electrophysiologists agreed on the diagnosis. Respective 12-lead ECG had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 98% for the detection of SVT. CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based one-lead ECG monitor allows for differentiation of SVT from IST in about 90% of cases. These results should encourage cardiologists to integrate wearables into clinical practice, possibly reducing time to definitive diagnosis of an arrhythmia and unnecessary EP procedures. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: A smartphone-based one lead ECG device (panel A) can be used reliably to differentiate supraventricular tachycardia (panel B) from inappropriate sinus tachycardia when compared to a simultaneously conducted gold-standard electrophysiology study (panels C, D).

The gut microbiome critically affects the immune system, and some respiratory infections are associated with changes in the gut microbiome; here, we evaluated the role of nutritional and lifestyle habits that modulate gut microbiota on COVID-19 outcomes in a longitudinal cohort study that included 200 patients infected with COVID-19. Of these, 122 cases were mild and seventy-eight were moderate, according to WHO classification. After detailed explanation by a consultant in clinical nutrition, participants responded to a written questionnaire on daily sugar, prebiotic intake in food, sleeping hours, exercise duration and antibiotic prescription, during the past 1 year before infection. Daily consumption of prebiotic-containing foods, less sugar, regular exercise, adequate sleep and fewer antibiotic prescriptions led to a milder disease and rapid virus clearance. Additionally, data on these factors were compiled into a single score, the ESSAP score (Exercise, Sugar consumption, Sleeping hours, Antibiotics taken, and Prebiotics consumption; 0–11 points), median ESSAP score was 5 for both mild and moderate cases; however, the range was 4–8 in mild cases, but 1–6 in moderate (P = 0·001, OR: 4·2, 95 % CI 1·9, 9·1); our results showed a negative correlation between regular consumption of yogurt containing probiotics and disease severity (P = 0·007, OR: 1·6, 95 % CI 1·1, 2·1). Mild COVID-19 disease was associated with 10–20 min of daily exercise (P = 0·016), sleeping at least 8 h daily, prescribed antibiotics less than 5 times per year (P = 0·077) and ate plenty of prebiotic-containing food.","Hegazy, Mona; Ahmed Ashoush, Omar; Tharwat Hegazy, Mohamed; Wahba, Mahmoud; Lithy, Rania M.; Abdel-Hamid, Hoda M.; Ahmed Abd elshafy, Samah; Abdelfatah, Dalia; El-Din Ibrahim, Maha Hossam; Abdelghani, Ahmed",Br J Nutr,41,18

The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that, when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people’s reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default. Rather, socio-political individual variables such as speakers’ political orientation and source of information favor the acceptance of metaphor congruent entailments: right-wing participants and participants relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor, thus more inclined to prefer bellicose options.","Panzeri, Francesca; Di Paola, Simona; Domaneschi, Filippo",PLoS One,41,16

Persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 may transmit the virus to others and may have subclinical lung abnormalities. Some hospitals use SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests for pre-admission screening testing because they are relatively inexpensive, have a rapid turnaround time, and can be performed at the point of care; however, antigen tests are generally less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification tests with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Moreover, as the local COVID-19 prevalence increases, the negative predictive value of antigen tests may decrease, meaning that the probability of having false-negative results may increase. We present a case of a patient who, prior to admission for a surgical procedure, had a negative antigen test result for SARS-CoV-2, had no respiratory symptoms, and had no suspected or known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after admission. The only factor that led the healthcare team to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection was an unexpected finding of bilateral ground-glass opacities on an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), which was performed to assess the extent of a perianal abscess the patient presented.

We argue that the extra payment is warranted regardless of whether healthcare workers have a professional obligation to provide such risky healthcare. Payment for risk would meet four essential ethical requirements. First, assuming healthcare workers do not have a professional obligation to take on themselves the risks, payments in the form of incentives would preserve autonomy in deciding what risks to take on oneself. Second, even assuming that healthcare workers do have a professional obligation to take on themselves the risks, payments for risk would create fair working conditions by avoiding exploitation. Third, payments for risk would make it more likely that public healthcare systems can discharge their institutional responsibility to provide healthcare in circumstances where healthcare workers may otherwise (perhaps legitimately) opt out. Fourth, payments for risk would guarantee an efficient healthcare system in pandemic situations. Finally, we address two likely objections that some might raise against our proposal, particularly with regard to incentives, namely that such payments or incentives can themselves be coercive and that they represent a form of undue inducement.","Giubilini, Alberto; Savulescu, Julian",Bioethics,41,22

Previous studies report the utility and overall diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL in this vulnerable population, though none focused purely on microbiologic yield or made comparisons with less invasive means of pathogen detection. We sought to determine and elaborate on the microbiologic yield of BAL in SCT recipients, assess a correlation between BAL studies and less invasive means of pathogen detection, and assess the utility of repeating a BAL within 30 days.

Most Australian parents support vaccines, but some refuse and are often judged harshly by their community, especially during an outbreak. We sought the perspectives of Australian public health experts on the key issues faced when managing a measles outbreak in an area with high anti-vaccination sentiment. METHODS: A measles outbreak scenario formed the basis of a 3-round modified Delphi process to identify key practitioner concerns in relation to parents/carers who don’t follow the recommended vaccination schedule. We surveyed a range of professionals in the field: policymakers, infectious disease experts, immunisation program staff, and others involved in delivering childhood vaccinations, to identify key priorities when responding to an outbreak in a community with low vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Findings indicate that responses to measles outbreaks in communities with high anti-vaccination sentiment are motivated by concerns about the potential for a much larger outbreak event. The highest operational priority is to isolate infected children. The two most highly ranked practical issues are mistrust from non-vaccinating members of the local region and combatting misinformation about vaccines. Trying to change minds of such individuals is not a priority during an outbreak, nor is vaccinating their children. Using media and social media to provide information about the outbreak and measures the public can take to limit the spread of the disease was a focus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced during an outbreak and priorities for communicating with communities where there is a high level of anti-vaccination sentiment. In the context of a global pandemic, the results of this study also have implications for managing public health responses to community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as COVID-19 vaccines becomes widely available.

In most studies, patients with various levels of COVID-19 severity were pooled and analyzed which may prevent accurate evaluation of the relationship between LDH and disease progression and in-hospital death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of LDH with in-hospital mortality in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: This single-center retrospective study enrolled 119 patients. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine the independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Receiver-operator curves (ROCs) were constructed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of LDH and other prognostic biomarkers. Results: Compared to the survival group, LDH levels in the dead group were significantly higher [559.5 (172, 7575) U/L vs 228 (117, 490) U/L, (P < 0.001)]. In Multivariate Cox regression, it remained an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (Hazard ratio 5.985, 95.0%CI: 1.498-23.905; P=0.011). A cutoff value of 353.5 U/L predicted the in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 89.2% respectively. Conclusion: LDH is a favorable prognostic biomarker with high accuracy for predicting in-hospital mortality in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19.

However, the mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as infection, contribute to the pathogenesis and/or symptom exacerbation remain to be fully elucidated. Relapse frequency in MS patients contributes to neurological impairment and, in the initial phases of disease, serves as a predictor of poor disease prognosis. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence that supports a role for peripheral infection in modulating the natural history of this disease. Evidence supporting a role for infection in promoting exacerbation in animal models of MS is also reviewed. Finally, a few mechanisms by which infection may exacerbate symptoms of MS and other neurological diseases are discussed. Those who comprise the majority of MS patients acquire approximately two upper-respiratory infections per year; furthermore, this type of infection doubles the risk for MS relapse, underscoring the contribution of this relationship as being potentially important and particularly detrimental.","Steelman, Andrew J.",Front Immunol,41,16

Forty‐two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients. Consequently, we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera (n = 45) at 6‐month post‐infection. The significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies specific to three (S791, M207 and N161) of 42 peptides were detectable in the post‐infection sera from 23 (51%), 27 (60%) and 19 (42%) of 45 patients, respectively.

Design Retrospective chart review. Setting and Participants Nursing home residents (n=963) or their surrogate decision makers had at least one ACP conversation with a primary healthcare practitioner between April 1, 2020-May 30, 2020 and made decisions of any changes in code status and hospitalization preferences. Methods Healthcare practitioners conducted ACP conversations proactively with residents or their surrogate decision makers at 15 nursing homes in a metropolitan area of the Southwestern United States between April 1, 2020-May 30, 2020. ACP conversations reviewed code status and goals of care including Do Not Hospitalize (DNH) care preference. Resident age, gender, code status and DNH choice before and after the ACP conversations were documented. Descriptive data analyses identified significant changes in resident care preferences before and after ACP conversations. Results Prior to the most recent ACP discussion, 361 residents were full code status and the rest were Out of Hospital Do Not Resuscitate (DNR). Of the individuals with Out of Hospital DNR, 188 residents also chose DNH. After the ACP conversation, 88 residents opted to change from full code status to Out of Hospital DNR, thereby increasing the percentage of residents with Out of Hospital DNR from 63% to 72%. Almost half of the residents decided to keep or change to the DNH care option after the ACP conversation. Conclusion and Implications: Proactive ACP conversations during COVID-19 increased DNH from less than a quarter to almost half among the nursing home residents. Out of Hospital DNR increased by 9%. It is important for all healthcare practitioners to proactively review ACP with nursing home residents and their surrogate decision makers during a pandemic, thereby ensuring care consistent with personal goals of care and avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations.","Ye, Ping; Fry, Liam; Champion, Jane Dimmitt",J Am Med Dir Assoc,41,28

This is one of the first longitudinal studies to assess the impact of primary health care coverage on health conditions and inequalities. Our aim is to investigate the prevalence, incidence and trends of risk factors, health behaviours, social relationships, non-communicable diseases, geriatric diseases and disorders, hospitalisation, self-perceived health, and all-cause and specific-cause mortality. In addition, we aim to evaluate socioeconomic and health inequalities and the impact of primary health care on the outcomes under study. METHODS/DESIGN: The study covers participants aged 60 or over, selected by probabilistic (representative) sampling of the urban area of the city of Bagé, which is covered by Primary Health Care Services. The baseline examination included 1593 older adults and was conducted from July 2008 to November 2008. After eight to nine years (2016/2017), the first follow-up was conducted from September 2016 to August 2017. All participants underwent an extensive core assessment programme including structured interviews, questionnaires, cognitive testing (baseline and follow-up), physical examinations and anthropometric measurements (follow-up). RESULTS: Of the original participants, 1395 (87.6%) were located for follow-up: 757 elderly individuals (47.5%) were re-interviewed, but losses in data transfer occurred for 22. The remaining 638 (40.1%) had died. In addition, we had 81 (5.1%) refusals and 117 (7.3%) losses. Among the 1373 older adults who were followed down, there was a higher proportion of female interviewees (p=0.042) and a higher proportion of male deaths (p=0.001) in 2016/2017. There were no differences in losses and refusals according to gender (p=0.102). There was a difference in average age between the interviewees (68.8 years; SD ±6.5) and non-interviewees (73.2 years; SD ±9.0) (p<0.001).

Non-surgical treatment may be effective in ∼50% of cases. Endoscopic surgery has gained popularity as an option for non-responsive patients because of its non-invasive characteristics, faster recovery and encouraging results. This study compares two different sites of endoscopic psoas tenotomy performed following THA: at the edge of the acetabulum (AR) versus at the lesser trochanter (LT). This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single-surgeon case series. Thirty-five iliopsoas tenotomy cases which had >24-month follow-up were identified. There were 21 tenotomies at the lesser trochanter. Demographic data, preop and postop pain, mHHS and NAHS scores, strength and patient satisfaction data were collected and analysed. Average age at the time of surgery was 62. Mean follow-up for the LT group was 49.11 months and 42.42 months for the AR group. Pain decreased significantly for both groups (P < 0.001). Both mHHS and NAHS showed superiority in the LT group, but this difference did not reach significance (P = 0.06). LT patients showed better strength with 71.42% of them having normal strength at latest follow-up, compared with 41.6% in the AR group. There were no complications in either group. Endoscopic tenotomy is a safe and reliable surgical option, giving significant pain relief and good functional outcomes. Tenotomy at the level of the lesser trochanter might be preferable since it shows better outcomes. Larger studies are necessary to achieve statistically significant results.","Valenzuela, Joaquin; O’Donnell, John M",J Hip Preserv Surg,41,1

Effective communication of measures by credible sources throughout the epidemic is one of the crucial factors for the containment of the disease, and the official communication about pandemics is straightforwardly directed toward changes in behavior via engagement in (self-)protective measures. Calls for the adherence to these measures are aimed at the general population, but people's reactions to these calls vary depending on, for example, their individual differences in cognitive and emotional responses to the situation. The focus of our study was the general narrative about the epidemic as conveyed by both state officials and media outlets in times of decreased social contacts due to the quarantine, in which relying on these sources of information is even more pivotal. Our aim was to explore the stability of the proposed mediational model during the course of the epidemic in Serbia. In the model, we tested the relationship between perceived credibility of information (PCI) and two types of protective behavior—the actual self-protective behavior (ASPB) and the hypothetical protective behavior (HPB), as well as the potential mediating role of alertness in these relationships time-wise. A cross-sectional study (N = 10,782, female = 79.1%) was being administered daily during the first epidemic wave and in three more 2-week time frames during the second wave. Based on the variability of these measures during the first epidemic wave, three stages of psychological responses were mapped (acute, adaptation, and relaxation stage), which were observed, with some deviations, also in the second wave. The mediational model was relatively robust after the initial few weeks, but the strength of pairwise relationships was more changeable. With both types of protective behaviors, the predictive power of PCI was partially mediated through alertness. This suggests that, while individual differences in cognitive and affective responses are important, so is coherent, focused, and credible communication in all stages of the epidemic, which emphasizes the communality aspect of the social containment of the infection. Our findings can thus be valuable in informing the planning of effective future communication.","Lep, Žan; Ilić, Sandra; Teovanović, Predrag; Hacin Beyazoglu, Kaja; Damnjanović, Kaja",Front Psychol,41,1

A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19.

TRIAL DESIGN: The trial will be closed label, randomized and placebo-controlled with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio and superiority framework. PARTICIPANTS: All PCR confirmed COVID-19 adult patients including non-pregnant females, with mild to moderate disease, will be enrolled from Shaikh Zayed Post-Graduate Medical Complex, Ali Clinic and Doctors Lounge in Lahore (Pakistan). Patients with any pre-existing chronic illness will be excluded from the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In this multi-armed study ionic-iodine polymer complex with 200 mg of elemental iodine will be given using three formulations to evaluate efficacy. Patients will be receiving either encapsulated iodine complex of 200 mg (arm A), iodine complex syrup form 40 ml (arm B), iodine complex throat spray of 2 puffs (arm C) or empty capsule (arm D) as placebo; all three times a day. All the 4 arms will be receiving standard care as per version 3.0 of the clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 established by the Ministry of National Health Services of Pakistan. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes will be viral clearance with radiological and clinical improvement. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and HRCT chest scans will be done on the admission day and then after every fourth day for 12 days or till the symptoms are resolved. RT-PCR will only be shown as positive or negative while HRCT chest scoring will be done depending on the area and severity of lung involvement [2]. Time taken for the alleviation of symptoms will be calculated by the number of days the patient remained symptomatic. 30-day mortality will be considered as a secondary outcome. RANDOMISATION: Stratification for initial COVID-19 status (or days from initial symptoms as a proxy), age groups, gender, baseline severity of symptoms and co-morbidities will be used to ensure that the study arms remain balanced in size for the 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization will be done using the lottery method. As patients are being admitted at different times, they will be recruited after obtaining their voluntary written informed consent following all standard protocols of the infection, control and disinfection. BLINDING (MASKING): This is a quadruple (participants, care providers, investigators and outcomes assessors) blinded study where only the study’s Primary Investigator will have information about the arms and their interventions.

Nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is common and is associated with VTE events. Our objective was to determine whether nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is more common in patients with COVID-19 versus other hospitalized patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients discharged from the Johns hopkins hospital between Mar 1 and May 12, 2020, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, VTE outcomes, prescription and administration of VTE prophylaxis between COVID-19 positive, negative, and not tested groups. RESULTS: Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly older, and more likely to be Hispanic, have a higher median body mass index, have longer hospital length of stay, require mechanical ventilation, develop pulmonary embolism and die (all p < 0.001). COVID-19 patients were more likely to be prescribed (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.38–1.66) and receive all doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36–1.62). The number of patients who missed at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis and developed VTE was similar between the three groups (p = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that high rates of VTE in COVID-19 are due to nonadministration of doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Hence, we should prioritize research into alternative approaches to optimizing VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.","Varasteh Kia, Mujan; Lau, Brandyn D.; Owodunni, Oluwafemi P.; Kraus, Peggy S.; Holzmueller, Christine G.; Hobson, Deborah B.; Shaffer, Dauryne L.; Streiff, Michael B.; Haut, Elliott R.",J Thromb Thrombolysis,41,20

N is relatively conserved among coronaviruses and consists of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), which are flanked by three disorganized regions. N is highly immunogenic and has been widely used to develop a serological assay as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 infection, although there is a concern that the natural propensity of N to associate with RNA might compromise the assay’s specificity. We expressed and purified from bacterial cells two recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 N, one from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysates that is strongly associated with bacterial RNAs and the other that is completely devoid of RNAs. We showed that both forms of N can be used to develop enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the specific detection of human and mouse anti-N monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as well as feline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive serum samples, but that the RNA-free form of N exhibits a slightly higher level of sensitivity than the RNA-bound form to react to anti-N mouse mAb. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we also showed that N preferentially binds ssRNA in a sequence-independent manner and that both NTD and CTD of N contribute to RNA-binding activity. Collectively, our study describes methods to express, purify, and biochemically characterize the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and to use it for the development of serological assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Di, Da; Dileepan, Mythili; Ahmed, Shamim; Liang, Yuying; Ly, Hinh",Pathogens,41,16

Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a local level is becoming increasingly important to guide measures to control the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number (R(0)) to understand the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at a district level. We used standard mathematical modeling approaches to assess the utility of these factors in determining the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses and projecting the size of the epidemic. METHODS: Contact tracing of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 was performed to obtain the serial intervals. The median and 95th percentile values of the SARS-CoV-2 serial interval were obtained from the best fits with the weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, gamma, and generalized gamma distributions. Aggregate and instantaneous R(0) values were derived with different methods using the EarlyR and EpiEstim packages in R software. RESULTS: The median and 95th percentile values of the serial interval were 5.23 days (95% CI 4.72-5.79) and 13.20 days (95% CI 10.90-18.18), respectively. R(0) during the first 30 days of the outbreak was 1.62 (95% CI 1.07-2.17), which subsequently decreased to 1.15 (95% CI 1.09-1.21). The peak instantaneous R(0) values obtained using a Poisson process developed by Jombert et al were 6.53 (95% CI 2.12-13.38) and 3.43 (95% CI 1.71-5.74) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. The peak R(0) values obtained using the method by Wallinga and Teunis were 2.96 (95% CI 2.52-3.36) and 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. R(0) values of 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.34) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21) for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively, were obtained on July 6, 2020, using method by Jombert et al. Using the method by Wallinga and Teunis, values of 0.32 (95% CI 0.27-0.36) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.58-0.63) were obtained for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively. The projection of cases over the next month was 2131 (95% CI 1799-2462). Reductions of transmission by 25% and 50% corresponding to reasonable and aggressive control measures could lead to 58.7% and 84.0% reductions in epidemic size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The projected transmission reductions indicate that strengthening control measures could lead to proportionate reductions of the size of the COVID-19 epidemic. Time-dependent instantaneous R(0) estimation based on the process by Jombart et al was found to be better suited for guiding COVID-19 response at the district level than overall R(0) or instantaneous R(0) estimation by the Wallinga and Teunis method. A data-driven approach at the local level is proposed to be useful in guiding public health strategy and surge capacity planning.","Saurabh, Suman; Verma, Mahendra Kumar; Gautam, Vaishali; Kumar, Nitesh; Goel, Akhil Dhanesh; Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Misra, Sanjeev",JMIR Public Health Surveill,41,1

About 90% and 100% of the dispensing units in Chagni Primary Hospital and Injibara general hospital were utilizing bin-cards, respectively. Besides, 50% and 80% of the bin-cards in Chagrin Primary Hospital and Injibara General Hospital were regularly updated, respectively. About 80% and 75% of the IFRRs in Chagni Primary Hospital and Injibara General Hospital reported valid data, respectively. Besides, 66.67% and 50% of the RRFs reviewed at Chagni Primary Hospital and Injibara General Hospital reported valid data, respectively. Medicine stockouts, poor staff commitment, and workload were the major bottlenecks for IPLS execution. CONCLUSION: The status of most of the IPLS implementation indicators in both hospitals was good. Especially, the availabilities of IPLS materials and the calculation accuracy of both RRFs and IFRRs were encouraging in both hospitals. However, the validity of the data reported in IFRRs and RRFs, and the status of the storage conditions in both hospitals need some improvement during the implementations of IPLS.","Tefera, Bereket Bahiru; Yihunie, Wubetu; Bekele, Azmeraw",J Multidiscip Healthc,41,7

Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non‐intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID‐19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO(2). SpO(2) measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non‐rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post‐proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO(2) at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO(2) improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre‐ to post‐median by the Wilcoxon Rank‐sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. CONCLUSION: Awake early self‐proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID‐19 positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.","Caputo, Nicholas D.; Strayer, Reuben J.; Levitan, Richard",Acad Emerg Med,41,16

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays to screen antiviral humoral responses, and define correlates of immune protection, and to down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we describe a highly infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein that closely resembles the authentic agent in its entry-related properties. We show that the neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and that neutralization of the rVSV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.","Dieterle, M.

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of hospitalized patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical signs of COVID-19 and computed tomography (CT) scan-proven pulmonary involvement, in order to identify relationships between clinical, serological, imaging data and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Clinical and serological records of patients admitted to two COVID-19 Units of the Abruzzo region in Italy with proven SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary involvement investigated with CT scan, assessed at the time of admission to the hospital, were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-one patients (22 females and 39 males) of median age 65 years were enrolled. Fifty-six patients were discharged while death occurred in 5 patients. None of the lung abnormalities detected by CT was different between discharged and deceased patients. No differences were observed in the features and extent of pulmonary involvement according to age and gender. Logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile were associated with the involvement of all 5 pulmonary lobes (OR = 14.5, 95% CI 2.3–90.9, p = 0.004), the presence of septal thickening (OR = 8.2, 95% CI 1.6–40.9, p = 0.011) and the presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (OR = 12.0, 95% CI 1.1–127.5, p = 0.039) independently of age and gender. We demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile are associated with a more severe pulmonary involvement, independently of age and gender and not associated with disease outcomes. The identification of reliable biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 may help guiding clinical decision, tailoring therapeutic approaches and ultimately improving the care and prognosis of patients with this disease.","Carubbi, Francesco; Salvati, Lia; Alunno, Alessia; Maggi, Fabio; Borghi, Erika; Mariani, Rinalda; Mai, Francesca; Paoloni, Maurizio; Ferri, Claudio; Desideri, Giovambattista; Cicogna, Sabrina; Grassi, Davide",Sci Rep,41,16

Data were gathered through the first wave of the online COVID-19 Pandemic and Emotional Well-Being study, a prospective panel study of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline workers and the general public. This study focused on three extended-response questions about definitions of and strategies for emotional connectedness. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Participants conceptualize emotional connectedness as having empathy and value, help and support, presence, and vulnerability. They also describe emotionally connected relationships as being characterized by mutuality and frequent contact. Participants identify current behavioral strategies for cultivating emotional connectedness, such as using technology, providing instrumental help or sending gifts via mail, and building quality time within their households. They also report challenges in maintaining these connections. Future research must contribute knowledge about effective interventions for essential healthcare workers in the aftermath of COVID-19.

They have been identified as natural hosts for coronaviruses, causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in humans. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 interest in the prevalence of coronaviruses in bats was newly raised. In this study we investigated different bat species living in a sympatric colony in the Wavul Galge cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). In three field sessions (in 2018 and 2019), 395 bats were captured (Miniopterus, Rousettus, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus spp.) and either rectal swabs or fecal samples were collected. From these overall 396 rectal swab and fecal samples, the screening for coronaviruses with nested PCR resulted in 33 positive samples, 31 of which originated from Miniopterus fuliginosus and two from Rousettus leschenaultii. Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained 384-nt fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase revealed that the examined M. fuliginosus bats excrete alphacoronaviruses and the examined R. leschenaultii bats excrete betacoronaviruses. Despite the sympatric roosting habitat, the coronaviruses showed host specificity and seemed to be limited to one species. Our results represent an important basis to better understand the prevalence of coronaviruses in Sri Lankan bats and may provide a basis for pursuing studies on particular bat species of interest.","Muzeniek, Therese; Perera, Thejanee; Siriwardana, Sahan; Bas, Dilara; Kaplan, Fatimanur; Öruc, Mizgin; Becker-Ziaja, Beate; Schwarz, Franziska; Premawansa, Gayani; Premawansa, Sunil; Perera, Inoka; Yapa, Wipula; Nitsche, Andreas; Kohl, Claudia",Vaccines (Basel),41,1

The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people's lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale , emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents.

Embryos in group 1 were inoculated with IBV. Group 2 was inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture. Group 3 was used as a control and inoculated with sterile PBS. Allantoic fluid was collected for hemagglutination titer assay. In addition, weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes for each group were recorded. The results showed that no distinct pathological changes were found in chick embryos after they were inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture and the mortality was reduced remarkably compared with the IBV-infected group. Weight gain of embryos in the SIAMP-IBV intermixture group was significantly higher than the IBV-infected embryos (P < 0.01), which was also higher than the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the hemagglutination titer in the SIAMP-IBV group was significantly lower than that in the IBV-infected group (P < 0.01).

The impact of these on living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) activity and outcome is not known. We performed LDLT only for sick or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in this period, with special COVID protocols. METHODS: Patients undergoing LDLT counseling, evaluation and transplant in the period March to June 2020 (group A) under COVID-19 restrictions and special protocols were included. LDLT activity and outcomes among these patients was compared to those in the same period in 2019 (group B). RESULTS: In the period March 15-June 10, we performed 39 and 23 (59%) LDLTs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The adult patients with cirrhosis in-group A (n=20) had significantly higher MELD score, 19.8±7.0 versus 16.1±5.6 in-group B (n=36), p=0.034.

One out of 23 post-transplant recipients, 3/71 recipients and donors during evaluation, and 8/125 health care workers (HCWs) developed COVID-19, all of whom recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSION: LDLT activity substantially reduced during the COVID era. The incidence and outcome of COVID-19 among the waiting or transplanted patients and HCWs was similar to the general population. The outcome after LDLT in the COVID era was similar to non-COVID times.

We demonstrate HBoV1 replication in Caco-2 cultures supplemented with DEAE-dextran after inoculation with respiratory material from infected patients presenting with acute respiratory infection. A viral cycle of rapid development is displayed. However, in spite of HBoV1 DNA 4-fold increment in the supernatants and monolayers by day 1, evidencing that the system allows the virus genome replication after the entry occurred, infectious progeny particles were not produced. These results are consistent with an infection that is limited to a single growth cycle, which can be associated to mutations in the NS1 and VP1/VP2 regions of HBoV1 genome.

Methods: In the Ile-de-France region, from February 20 to May 5, 2020, emergency medical service (EMS) calls and the response provided (ambulances) together the percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, general practitioner (GP) and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients were recorded daily and compared to the number of COVID-19 ICU patients. Correlation curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient (R), depending on the number of days the indicator has been shifted. A delay [≥]7 days was considered as an early alert, and a delay [≥]14 days a very early alert. Findings: EMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipate ICU bed requirement. Interpretation: The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis in the Ile-de-France region, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits.

In phase 2b and 3 studies, tezepelumab significantly reduced exacerbations versus placebo in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers. We investigated the mechanism of action of tezepelumab by assessing its effects on airway inflammatory cells, airway remodelling, and airway hyperresponsiveness. METHODS: CASCADE was an exploratory, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study done in 27 medical centres in Canada, Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18-75 years with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for a planned 28 weeks, extended to up to 52 weeks if COVID-19-related disruption delayed participants' end-of-treatment assessments. Randomisation was balanced and stratified by blood eosinophil count. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the number of airway submucosal inflammatory cells in bronchoscopic biopsy samples. Eosinophils, neutrophils, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, tryptase+ mast cells, and chymase+ mast cells were evaluated separately. This endpoint was also assessed in subgroups according to baseline type 2 inflammatory biomarker levels, including blood eosinophil count. Airway remodelling was assessed via the secondary endpoints of change from baseline in reticular basement membrane thickness and epithelial integrity (proportions of denuded, damaged, and intact epithelium). Exploratory outcomes included airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol. All participants who completed at least 20 weeks of study treatment, had an end-of-treatment visit up to 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug, and had evaluable baseline and end-of-treatment bronchoscopies were included in the primary efficacy analysis. All participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03688074. FINDINGS: Between Nov 2, 2018, and Nov 16, 2020, 250 patients were enrolled, 116 of whom were randomly assigned (59 to tezepelumab, 57 to placebo). 48 in the tezepelumab group and 51 in the placebo group completed the study and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Treatment with tezepelumab resulted in a nominally significantly greater reduction from baseline to the end of treatment in airway submucosal eosinophils versus placebo (ratio of geometric least-squares means 0·15 [95% CI 0·05-0·41]; nominal p<0·0010), with the difference seen across all baseline biomarker subgroups. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the other cell types evaluated (ratio of geometric least-squares means: neutrophils 1·36 [95% CI 0·94-1·97]; CD3+ T cells 1·12 [0·86-1·46]; CD4+ T cells 1·18 [0·90-1·55]; tryptase+ mast cells 0·83 [0·61-1·15]; chymase+ mast cells 1·19 [0·67-2·10]; all p>0·10). In assessment of secondary endpoints, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in reticular basement membrane thickness and epithelial integrity. In an exploratory analysis, the reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol was significantly greater with tezepelumab versus placebo (least-squares mean change from baseline in interpolated or extrapolated provoking dose of mannitol required to induce &#8805;15% reduction in FEV1 from baseline: tezepelumab 197·4 mg [95% CI 107·9 to 286·9]; placebo 58·6 mg [-30·1 to 147·33]; difference 138·8 [14·2 to 263·3], nominal p=0·030). Adverse events were reported in 53 (90%) patients in the tezepelumab group and 51 (90%) patients in the placebo group, and there were no safety findings of concern. INTERPRETATION: The improvements in asthma clinical outcomes observed in previous studies with tezepelumab are probably driven, at least in part, by reductions in eosinophilic airway inflammation, as shown here by reduced airway eosinophil counts regardless of baseline blood eosinophil count. Tezepelumab also reduced airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol, indicating that TSLP blockade might have additional benefits in asthma beyond reducing type 2 airway inflammation.

They provide remarkable information in the diagnoses of skin lesions. There have been developments in modern diagnostic systems that can help detect melanoma in its early stages to save the lives of many people. There is also a significant growth in the design of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using advanced artificial intelligence. The purpose of the present research is to develop a system to diagnose skin cancer, one that will lead to a high level of detection of the skin cancer. The proposed system was developed using deep learning and traditional artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms. The dermoscopy images were collected from the PH2 and ISIC 2018 in order to examine the diagnose system. The developed system is divided into feature-based and deep leaning. The feature-based system was developed based on feature-extracting methods. In order to segment the lesion from dermoscopy images, the active contour method was proposed. These skin lesions were processed using hybrid feature extractions, namely, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods to extract the texture features. The obtained features were then processed using the artificial neural network (ANNs) algorithm. In the second system, the convolutional neural network (CNNs) algorithm was applied for the efficient classification of skin diseases; the CNNs were pretrained using large AlexNet and ResNet50 transfer learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-art methods for HP2 and ISIC 2018 datasets. Standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, recall, and F-score were employed to evaluate the results of the two proposed systems. The ANN model achieved the highest accuracy for PH2 (97.50%) and ISIC 2018 (98.35%) compared with the CNN model. The evaluation and comparison, proposed systems for classification and detection of melanoma are presented.","Alsaade, Fawaz Waselallah; Aldhyani, Theyazn H.
