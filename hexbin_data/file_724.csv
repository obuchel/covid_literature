The taxa include the largest mammals on earth, the baleen whales, as well as marine and freshwater toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Pathologies of these species include infectious, toxic, and other disease processes, such as ship strike and entanglements in free-ranging animals. In animals under managed care, concerns include nutritional, degenerative and geriatric processes, such as formation of ammonium urate renal calculi. Due to potential population level effects and individual animal health concerns, viral agents of interest include morbilliviruses, pox virus, and herpes viruses. Both free ranging and captive animals have important neoplasms, including a variety of toxin-related tumors in beluga whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary and oral squamous cell carcinomas in bottlenose dolphins in managed care.","St. Leger, Judy; Raverty, Stephen; Mena, Alexandria",Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals,724,1

However, current measurement techniques are limited since they are assessed intermittently at non-physiological frequencies or involve specialized equipment. To this end, we introduce ZVV, a practical approach to continuously track resistance and elastance during Variable Ventilation (VV), in which frequency and tidal volume vary from breath-to-breath. ZVV segments airway pressure and flow recordings into individual breaths, calculates resistance and elastance for each breath, bins them according to frequency or tidal volume and plots the results against bin means. ZVV's feasibility was assessed clinically in five human patients with acute lung injury, experimentally in five mice ventilated before and after lavage injury, and computationally using a viscoelastic respiratory model. ZVV provided continuous measurements in both settings, while the computational study revealed <2% estimation errors. Our findings support ZVV as a feasible technique to assess respiratory mechanics under physiological conditions. Additionally, in humans, ZVV detected a decrease in resistance and elastance with time by 12.8% and 6.2%, respectively, suggesting that VV can improve lung recruitment in some patients and can therefore potentially serve both as a dual diagnostic and therapeutic tool.","Bou Jawde, Samer; Walkey, Allan J; Majumdar, Arnab; O'Connor, George T; Smith, Bradford J; Bates, Jason H T; Lutchen, Kenneth R; Suki, Béla",Scientific reports,724,6

We used reassortant viruses isolated from crosses of wild-type (wt) reovirus strain, type 1 Lang, and three independent PI viruses, L/C, PI 2A1, and PI 3-1, to identify viral genes that segregate with the capacity of PI viruses to grow in cells treated with ammonium chloride. Growth of reassortant viruses in ammonium chloride-treated cells segregated with the S1 gene of L/C and the S4 gene of PI 2A1 and PI 3-1. The S1 gene encodes viral attachment protein sigma1, and the S4 gene encodes outer-capsid protein sigma3. To identify mutations in sigma3 selected during persistent reovirus infection, we determined the S4 gene nucleotide sequences of L/C, PI 2A1, PI 3-1, and four additional PI viruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of sigma3 protein of six of these PI viruses contained a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at residue 354. To determine whether mutations selected during persistent infection alter cleavage of the viral outer capsid, the fate of viral structural proteins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after treatment of virions of wt and PI viruses with chymotrypsin in vitro. Proteolysis of PI virus outer-capsid proteins sigma3 and mu1C occurred with faster kinetics than proteolysis of wt virus outer-capsid proteins. These results demonstrate that mutations in either the S1 or S4 gene alter acid-dependent disassembly of the reovirus outer capsid and suggest that increased efficiency of proteolysis of viral outer-capsid proteins is important for maintenance of persistent reovirus infections of cultured cells.","Wetzel, J D; Wilson, G J; Baer, G S; Dunnigan, L R; Wright, J P; Tang, D S; Dermody, T S",Journal of virology,724,1

METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search. RESULTS: A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes. High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials. At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov. Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro. There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.","Stahlmann, Ralf; Lode, Hartmut",Dtsch Arztebl Int,724,5

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to many other microorganisms, was found to be prevalent in the mucous and salivary secretions of the infected patients. The proximity of dentists to these bodily fluids demands appropriate enhancement of the safety precautions followed to avoid the spread of infection. During the initial phase of the pandemic lockdowns globally, most dental practices were closed, except for emergency procedures. The fear of the virus was largely prevalent. However, prolonged closures of dental practices with the subsequent halt of all routine and elective dental procedures led to the additional fear of financial losses. This questionnaire study intends to gauge the awareness of Covid-19 risks among dentists and evaluate the modifications done in their practices to enhance safety and avoid the spread of infection. METHODS 311 dentists participated in an online questionnaire study conducted via google survey. Answers were recorded and statistically analysed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). RESULTS 97.4 % of the dentists were aware of Covid-19 while 95.2 % had made at least one or more modifications in their clinical practice to prevent risk of spread of covid-19 viral infection. CONCLUSIONS On the whole, this study implies that majority of the dentists are aware of Covid-19 and have taken some safety precautions to curb the viral spread. In order to ensure that the left out people have sufficient knowledge, help or support, recommendations have been given whenever possible.","Jhamunarani, J.

METHODS: This was a randomized-controlled study that enrolled older participants that were allocated to either an experimental group performing the six-months exercise prescription (EXE) or a control group (CON). At the beginning (PRE), and after 6 months (POST), participants were assessed for muscle strength, balance, gait assessment and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Normality distribution of data was checked with the D'Agostino and Pearson test and changes between PRE and POST were assessed by paired Student's t-test while percentage and absolute changes between groups at POST were tested by unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Nine participants were included for the final analysis: EXE, n = 5 (age: 66 ± 4; BMI: 27.5 ± 3.7) and CON, n = 4 (age: 71 ± 9; BMI: 24.2 ± 4.1). Significant PRE-to-POST changes were observed in the EXE group only in the chair-stand test (+19.8%, p = 0.048 and ES:1.0, moderate) and in total fat mass (+5.0%, p = 0.035 and ES:1.4, large) with no between-group differences. Moreover, EXE had significantly higher absolute thigh CSA values than CON at POST (14.138 ± 2977 vs. 9039 ± 1015, p = 0.0178, ES = 1.7). No other within- and between-group differences were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The home-based resistance-training program during the lockdown period, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, determined only within-group improvement in lower limb muscle strength but not in muscle mass and composition in older subjects. Home confinement may partially explain the increase in total body fat due to a reduced daily PA regime and altered diet pattern.","Vitale, Jacopo Antonino; Bonato, Matteo; Borghi, Stefano; Messina, Carmelo; Albano, Domenico; Corbetta, Sabrina; Sconfienza, Luca Maria; Banfi, Giuseppe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),724,1

OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent (2015) MERS-CoV outbreak at a large tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiologic outbreak investigation, including case finding and contact tracing and screening. MERS-CoV cases were categorized as suspected, probable, and confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Of the 130 suspected cases, 81 (62%) were confirmed and 49 (38%) were probable. These included 87 patients (67%) and 43 healthcare workers (33%). Older age (mean [SD], 64.4 [18.3] vs 40.1 [11.3] years, P<.001), symptoms (97% vs 58%, P<.001), and comorbidity (99% vs 42%, P<.001) were more common in patients than healthcare workers. Almost all patients (97%) were hospitalized whereas most healthcare workers (72%) were home isolated. Among 96 hospitalized cases, 63 (66%) required intensive care unit management and 60 (63%) required mechanical ventilation. Among all 130 cases, 51 (39%) died; all were patients (51 [59%]) with no deaths among healthcare workers. More than half (54%) of infections were believed to be caught at the emergency department. Strict infection control measures, including isolation and closure of the emergency department, were implemented to interrupt the chain of transmission and end the outbreak.

Our study aimed to assess the addiction levels and profiles of university students in Lebanon, and thus to evaluate the rapid rising in dependence regarding smoking, alcohol, and illegal drug use during this crisis. This cross-sectional study was carried out between February and September 2020. A total of 467 participants (315 females, 152 males; Mage = 23.48 ± 6.03) were recruited through convenience sampling through several universities in Lebanon’s governorates. Participants received the online link to the survey. Students were divided into three clusters as follows: cluster 1, which corresponds to students with moderate addictions; cluster 2, which corresponds to students with high addictions; and cluster 3, which corresponds to students with low addictions. When comparing cluster 1 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that older age (aOR=1.08) and having a high monthly income compared to no income (aOR=2.78) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 1 compared to cluster 3. When comparing cluster 2 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that female gender (aOR=0.19) was significantly associated with lower odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3, whereas having a dead (aOR=16.38) or divorced parent (aOR=6.54) and having a low (aOR=3.93) or intermediate income compared to zero income (aOR=4.71) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3. The results of our study revealed a considerable prevalence of addiction to alcohol, illicit drugs, and specially to smoking, among Lebanese university students. These findings emphasize the need to implement firm policies and rules in an attempt to minimize the tendency of the young population to engage in such addictions.","Chalhoub, Clarissa; Obeid, Sahar; Hallit, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Hallit, Souheil",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,724,1

Providers and administrators in public mental health systems recognize the widespread experience of trauma, as well as their limited ability to address trauma within their communities. In response, the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health funded nine regionally based community partnerships to build capacity to address trauma. We describe partnership and community capacity-building efforts and examine community impact, defined as successful linkages to resources and changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members. METHODS: We conceptualized community capacity-building as dissemination of trauma-informed education and training, community outreach and engagement, and linkage of community members to resources. We measured trauma-informed trainings among partnership members (N = 332) using the Trauma-Informed Organizational Toolkit. Outreach, engagement and linkages were documented using Event and Linkage Trackers. We examined changes in the type of successful linkage after the issuance of statewide mandatory restrictions in response to COVID-19. We examined changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members (N = 699) who were engaged in ongoing partnership activities using the 10-item Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale; the 28-item Coping Orientation to Problems; and the pictorial Inclusion of Community in Self Scale. RESULTS: Training and education opportunities were widespread: 66% of members reported opportunities for training in 13 or more trauma-informed practices. Partnerships conducted over 7800 community capacity-building events with over 250,000 attendees. Nearly 14,000 successful linkages were made for a wide range of resources, with consistent linkage success prior to (85%) and during (87%) the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, linkage type significantly shifted from basic services and health care to food distribution (p < .01). Small but significant improvements occurred in coping through emotional and instrumental support; and sense of community connectedness (p < .05 each). CONCLUSIONS: Community-based partnerships demonstrated effective capacity-building strategies. Despite the pandemic, community members did not report reduced stress tolerance, instead demonstrating gains in external help-seeking (use of emotional and instrumental supports) and perception of community connectedness. Future work will use qualitative methods to examine the impact of community capacity-building and the sustainability of this approach for addressing the impact of trauma within communities.","Gilmer, Todd P.; Center, Kimberly; Casteel, Danielle; Choi, Kyle; Innes-Gomberg, Debbie; Lansing, Amy E.",BMC Public Health,724,21

Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS and there is also accumulating evidence of neutrophil mediated lung injury in patients who succumb to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We undertook a functional proteomic and metabolomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS to understand the molecular basis of neutrophil dysregulation. Results: Expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in ARDS, irrespective of cause. Release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and upregulation of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex with formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is exaggerated in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I interferon responses is seen in ARDS following infection with SARS-CoV-2, with associated rewiring of neutrophil metabolism, and the upregulation of antigen processing and presentation. Whilst dexamethasone treatment constricts the immature low density neutrophil population, it does not impact upon prothrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil signatures. Conclusions: Given the crucial role of neutrophils in ARDS and the evidence of a disordered myeloid response observed in COVID-19 patients, this work maps the molecular basis for neutrophil reprogramming in the distinct clinical entities of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS.","Reyes, Leila; A.

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.","Quwaider, Muhannad; Jararweh, Yaser",Simul Model Pract Theory,724,32

Around the world, researchers are continuously trying to identify small molecule inhibitors or vaccine candidates by targeting different drug targets. The SARs-CoV-2 macrodomain-I, which helps in viral replication and hijacking the host immune system, is also a potential drug target. Hence, this study targeted viral macrodomain-I by using drug similarity, virtual screening, docking and re-docking approaches. A total of 64,043 compounds were screened, and potential hits were identified based on the docking score and interactions with the key residues. The top six hits were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and Free energy calculations and repeated three times each. The per-residue energy decomposition analysis reported that these compounds significantly interact with Asp22, Ala38, Asn40, Val44, Phe144, Gly46, Gly47, Leu127, Ser128, Gly130, Ile131, Phe132 and Ala155 which are the critical active site residues. Here, we also used ADPr as a positive control to compare our results. Our results suggest that our identified hits by using such a complicated computational pipeline could inhibit the SARs-CoV-2 by targeting the macrodomain-1. We strongly recommend the experimental testing of these compounds, which could rescue the host immune system and could help to contain the disease caused by SARs-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
