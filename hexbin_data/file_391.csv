3131,DIVA metabolomics: Differentiating vaccination status following viral challenge using metabolomic profiles,2018-04-05,"Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a major source of economic loss within the agricultural industry. Vaccination against BRD-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread. Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines, but during virus outbreaks DIVA responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis. Previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination. The current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals following infection-challenge. Male Holstein Friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated (Pfizer RISPOVAL(®)PI3+RSV) and subsequently challenged with Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type-3 (BPI3V) via nasal inoculation. Metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p.i., with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status. Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased 3-indolepropionic acid in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p.i. may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre. During latter stages of infection, increased levels of N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses. Levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p.i. These findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals.","Gray, Darren W.; Welsh, Michael D.; Mansoor, Fawad; Doherty, Simon; Chevallier, Olivier P.; Elliott, Christopher T.; Mooney, Mark H.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886402/,391
4301,Maxillofacial Nursing: Assessing the Knowledge and Awareness of Nurses in Handling Maxillofacial Injuries Through a Comprehensive Survey,2019-06-14,"AIM: To assess the knowledge and awareness of nurses in handling maxillofacial injuries. METHOD: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among the staff nurses of the multi-specialty Gokul Newtech Hospital, Jamnagar, Gujarat. Forty nursing staff were included in the study. Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, Spearman’s correlation and Mann–Whitney U tests were applied for statistical analysis. RESULT: There was no statistically significant difference between the mean knowledge score concerning the study participant’s age, work experience, and education. According to the survey, a majority of the nurses either did not know the answer or answered incorrectly. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is a requirement of new guidelines and recommendations in the existing teaching and training modules being followed by the nursing schools across the country.

5131,Smallpox and New York City’s Smallpox Hospital,2005,"A 70-year-old woman with secretory diarrhea was studied with a novel technique of recording small intestinal myoelectrical activity which allowed us to obtain long, uninterrupted records of slow waves and spikes at eight or more different intestinal levels simultaneously. Typical migrating action potential complexes (MAPCs) were observed, consisting of spike bursts that extended over more than one slow wave and migrated distally at the same propagation velocity as the slow waves. This motility pattern occurred frequently during the period the patient presented with secretory diarrhea and disappeared with the disappearance of the diarrhea. It was observed only once in a series of 10 normal control subjects. This is the first report on MAPC activity in man and on the association of this myoelectrical pattern with secretory diarrhea in man.","Coremans, G.; Janssens, J.; Vantrappen, G.; Chaussade, S.; Ceccatelli, P.",Dig Dis Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087827/,391
10044,Two Nursing Home Outbreaks of Respiratory Infection with Legionella sainthelensi,2015-04-27,"Analysis of hospital admissions for 20 years suggests that there has been an increase in childhood asthma in Brisbane. The characteristic seasonal pattern of asthma with waves in autumn and spring is evident from the second year of age and continues into adult life. It has not been explained, although respiratory infections, allergens and cold changes probably contribute to it. Unlike adults, children shown an increase in asthma in February‐March, ascribed to infections spread at school. Maximal asthma is associated with a mean temperature of 20–21°C. This may be optimal for the production of allergens. Further viral studies of asthmatic attacks are desirable.","DERRICK, E.

11373,“Quality of life”: parent and neonatologist perspectives,2020-03-25,"PURPOSE: To determine the level of recall, satisfaction, and perceived benefits of early mobility (EM) among ventilated cancer patients after extubation in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A survey of patients’ perceptions and recollections of EM was administered within 72 h of extubation. Data on recall of EM participation, activities achieved, adequacy of staffing and rest periods, strength to participate, activity level of difficulty, satisfaction with staff instructions, breathing management, and overall rating of the experience were analyzed. The Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) was used for delirium screening. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients comprised the study group. Nearly 90% reported satisfaction with instructions, staffing, rest periods, and breathing management during EM. Participants indicated that EM maintained their strength (67%) and gave them control over their recovery (61%); a minority felt optimistic (37%) and safe (22%). Patients who achieved more sessions and “out-of-bed” exercises had better recall of actual activities compared with those who exercised in bed. Overall, patients with CAM-ICU-positive results (33%) performed less physical and occupational therapy exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilated cancer patients reported an overall positive EM experience, but factual memory impairment of EM activities was common. These findings highlight the needs and the importance of shaping strategies to deliver a more patient focused EM experience.

14367,A systematic scoping review to identify the design and assess the performance of devices for antenatal continuous fetal monitoring,2020-12-01,"The maintenance of buildings has become an important issue with the construction of many high-rise buildings in recent years. However, the cleaning of the outer walls of buildings is performed in highly hazardous environments over long periods, and many accidents occur each year. Various robots are being studied and developed to reduce these incidents and to relieve workers from hazardous tasks. Herein, we propose a method of spraying high-pressure water using a pump and nozzle, which differs from conventional methods. The cleaning performance parameters, such as water pressure, spray angle, and spray distance, were optimized using the Taguchi method. Cleaning experiments were performed on window specimens that were contaminated artificially. The cleaning performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the image-evaluation method. The optimum condition was determined based on the results of a sensitive analysis performed on the image data. In addition, the reaction force due to high pressure and impact force on the specimens were investigated. These forces were not sufficient to affect the propeller thrust or cause damage to the building’s surface. We expect to perform field tests in the near future based on the output of this research.","Lee, Youngjoo; Kwon, Daesung; Park, Changmin; Seo, Myoungjae; Seo, TaeWon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7714119/,391
14487,Central processing of leg proprioception in Drosophila,2020-12-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Plants have leaves that are specialized organs to capture light energy. This energy is used to support photosynthesis, a process in which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is incorporated into organic compounds in the plant to allow the plant to grow. Other parts of the plant, such as the stem, flowers, or seeds are also able to conduct photosynthesis to contribute to growth in many plant species. The main contribution of photosynthesis in these parts of the plant may be to use carbon dioxide produced by the plant in respiration rather than from the surrounding atmosphere. The biochemical processes used by the plant in these organs may be different from those used in the leaves of the same plant. This process is enhanced in plants under stress and may be important for plant survival in some situations. Increased knowledge of these processes may be used to develop plant varieties that are more tolerant of environmental extremes and could help adapt agriculture to climate change. ABSTRACT: Plants have leaves as specialised organs that capture light energy by photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is also found in other plant organs. Photosynthesis may be found in the petiole, stems, flowers, fruits, and seeds. All photosynthesis can contribute to the capture of carbon and growth of the plant. The benefit to the plant of photosynthesis in these other tissues or organs may often be associated with the need to re-capture carbon especially in storage organs that have high respiration rates. Some plants that conduct C(3) photosynthesis in the leaves have been reported to use C(4) photosynthesis in petioles, stems, flowers, fruits, or seeds. These pathways of non-leaf photosynthesis may be especially important in supporting plant growth under stress and may be a key contributor to plant growth and survival. Pathways of photosynthesis have directionally evolved many times in different plant lineages in response to environmental selection and may also have differentiated in specific parts of the plant. This consideration may be useful in the breeding of crop plants with enhanced performance in response to climate change.","Henry, Robert J.; Furtado, Agnelo; Rangan, Parimalan",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760132/,391

Standard pelvic radiographs revealed an unstable displaced left neck of femur (NOF) fracture. A CT scanner and MRI showed diffuse osteopaenia of the left proximal femur and the corresponding acetabulum. A diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) complicated by a pathological displaced subcapital NOF fracture was established. The patient underwent total hip arthroplasty without complication and recovered excellent function after rehabilitation. Awareness of the differential diagnosis of TOH in pregnancy, a high index of suspicion and early MRI to make an early diagnosis and to prevent devastating fracture complications are mandatory.","Al-Dourobi, Karim; Corbaz, Jocelyn; Bauer, Stefan; Ngassom Leumessi, Eric",BMJ Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818818/,391
15331,Preemptive ganciclovir for mechanically ventilated patients with cytomegalovirus reactivation,2021-02-11,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine how compositions of 24-h time use and time reallocations between movement behaviors are associated with cardiometabolic health in a population-based sample of middle-age Finnish adults. METHODS: Participants were 3443 adults 46 yr of age from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 study. Participants wore a hip-worn accelerometer for 14 d from which time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) were determined. These data were combined with self-reported sleep to obtain the 24-h time-use composition. Cardiometabolic outcomes included adiposity markers, blood lipid levels, and markers of glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis, using a compositional data analysis approach based on isometric log-ratio transformation, was used to examine associations between movement behaviors with cardiometabolic outcomes. RESULTS: More daily time in MVPA and LPA, relative to other movement behaviors, was consistently favorably associated with all cardiometabolic outcomes. For example, relative to time spent in other behaviors, 30 min·d(−1) more MVPA and LPA were both associated with lower 2-h post–glucose load insulin level (−11.8% and −2.7%, respectively). Relative to other movement behaviors, more daily time in SB was adversely associated with adiposity measures, lipid levels, and markers of insulin sensitivity, and more daily time asleep was adversely associated with adiposity measures, blood lipid, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h insulin. For example, 60 min·d(−1) more SB and sleep relative to the remaining behaviors were both associated with higher 2-h insulin (3.5% and 5.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Altering daily movement behavior compositions to incorporate more MVPA at the expense of any other movement behavior, or more LPA at the expense of SB or sleep, could help to improve cardiometabolic health in midadulthood.","FARRAHI, VAHID; KANGAS, MAARIT; WALMSLEY, ROSEMARY; NIEMELÄ, MAISA; KIVINIEMI, ANTTI; PUUKKA, KATRI; COLLINGS, PAUL J.; KORPELAINEN, RAIJA; JÄMSÄ, TIMO",Med Sci Sports Exerc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879600/,391

17614,Compounded trauma: A qualitative study of the challenges for refugees living with advanced cancer,2021-03-26,"The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data is a challenging problem in systems biology. The stochasticity or fluctuations in the biochemical processes that regulate the transcription process poses as one of the major challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel GRN inference approach, named the Probabilistic Extended Petri Net for Gene Regulatory Network (PEPN-GRN), for the inference of gene regulatory networks from noisy expression data. The proposed inference approach makes use of transition of discrete gene expression levels across adjacent time points as different evidence types that relate to the production or decay of genes. The paper examines three variants of the PEPN-GRN method, which mainly differ by the way the scores of network edges are computed using evidence types. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark DREAM4 in silico data sets and a real time series data set of E. coli from the DREAM5 challenge. The PEPN-GRN_v3 variant (the third variant of the PEPN-GRN approach) sought to learn the weights of evidence types in accordance with their contribution to the activation and inhibition gene regulation process. The learned weights help understand the time-shifted and inverted time-shifted relationship between regulator and target gene. Thus, PEPN-GRN_v3, along with the inference of network edges, also provides a functional understanding of the gene regulation process.","Vatsa, Deepika; Agarwal, Sumeet",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121333/,391
17629,Rural family physician perspectives on communication with urban specialists: a qualitative study,2021-05-13,"Oral swab analysis (OSA) has been shown to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). In previous analyses, qPCR testing of swab samples collected from tongue dorsa was up to 93% sensitive relative to sputum GeneXpert, when 2 swabs per patient were tested. The present study modified sample collection methods to increase sample biomass and characterized the viability of bacilli present in tongue swabs. A qPCR targeting conserved bacterial ribosomal rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences was used to quantify bacterial biomass in samples. There was no detectable reduction in total bacterial rDNA signal over the course of 10 rapidly repeated tongue samplings, indicating that swabs collect only a small portion of the biomass available for testing. Copan FLOQSwabs collected ~2-fold more biomass than Puritan PurFlock swabs, the best brand used previously (p = 0.006). FLOQSwabs were therefore evaluated in patients with possible TB in Uganda. A FLOQSwab was collected from each patient upon enrollment (Day 1) and, in a subset of sputum GeneXpert Ultra-positive patients, a second swab was collected on the following day (Day 2). Swabs were tested for MTB DNA by manual IS6110-targeted qPCR. Relative to sputum GeneXpert Ultra, single-swab sensitivity was 88% (44/50) on Day 1 and 94.4% (17/18) on Day 2. Specificity was 79.2% (42/53). Among an expanded sample of Ugandan patients, 62% (87/141) had colony-forming bacilli in their tongue dorsum swab samples. These findings will help guide further development of this promising TB screening method.","Wood, Rachel C.; Andama, Alfred; Hermansky, Gleda; Burkot, Stephen; Asege, Lucy; Job, Mukwatamundu; Katumba, David; Nakaye, Martha; Mwebe, Sandra Z.; Mulondo, Jerry; Bachman, Christine M.; Nichols, Kevin P.; Le Ny, Anne-Laure M.; Ortega, Corrie; Olson, Rita N.; Weigel, Kris M.; Olson, Alaina M.; Madan, Damian; Bell, David; Cattamanchi, Adithya; Worodria, William; Semitala, Fred C.; Somoskovi, Akos; Cangelosi, Gerard A.; Minch, Kyle J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8128230/,391
18922,Next steps in long term care: How can nursing help?,2021-07-03,"PURPOSE: Liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) classification, especially the identification of LR-3 to 5 lesions with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) probability, is of great significance to treatment strategy determination. We aimed to develop a semi-automatic LI-RADS grading system on multiphase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: An internal data set of 439 patients and external data set of 71 patients with suspected HCC were included and underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The expert-guided LI-RADS grading system consisted of four deep 3D CNN models including a tumor segmentation model for automatic diameter estimation and three classification models of LI-RADS major features including arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE), washout and enhancing capsule. An end-to-end learning system comprising single deep CNN model that directly classified the LI-RADS grade was developed for comparison. RESULTS: On internal testing set, the segmentation model reached a mean dice of 0.84, with the accuracy of mapped diameter intervals as 82.7% (95% CI: 74.4%, 91.7%). The area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.941 (95% CI: 0.914, 0.961), 0.859 (95% CI: 0.823, 0.890) and 0.712 (95% CI: 0.668, 0.754) for APHE, washout and capsule, respectively. The expert-guided system significantly outperformed the end-to-end system with a LI-RADS grading accuracy of 68.3% (95% CI: 60.8%, 76.5%) vs 55.6% (95% CI: 48.8%, 63.0%) (P<0.0001). On external testing set, the accuracy of mapped diameter intervals was 91.5% (95% CI: 81.9%, 100.0%). The AUCs were 0.792 (95% CI: 0.745, 0.833), 0.654 (95% CI: 0.602, 0.703) and 0.658 (95% CI: 0.606, 0.707) for APHE, washout and capsule, respectively. The expert-guided system achieved an overall grading accuracy of 66.2% (95% CI: 58.0%, 75.2%), significantly higher than the end-to-end system of 50.1% (95% CI: 43.1%, 58.1%) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: We developed a semi-automatic step-by-step expert-guided LI-RADS grading system (LR-3 to 5), superior to the conventional end-to-end learning system. This deep learning-based system may improve workflow efficiency for HCC diagnosis in clinical practice.","Sheng, Ruofan; Huang, Jing; Zhang, Weiguo; Jin, Kaipu; Yang, Li; Chong, Huanhuan; Fan, Jia; Zhou, Jian; Wu, Dijia; Zeng, Mengsu",J Hepatocell Carcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8255313/,391

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Luoyang, Henan province, China from January 2018 to January 2020. Children (<18 years) with influenza-associated neurological disease were enrolled in the study. Children with indications for CBP and parental consent received CBP (Continuous Blood purification), while others received maximal intensive care treatment because of the absence of parental consent. The outcomes of the CBP and non-CBP groups were compared. Categorical variables were presented as percentage and compared by Chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile ranges) and compared with non-parametric independent sample test. Statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS (version 26.0) and p < 0.05 (2 tailed) was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: 30 children with influenza-associated neurological disease were recruited to the study. 18 received CBP and the other 12 received maximal intensive care. There were no differences between CBP and non-CBP children in age, sex, body weight, type of influenza virus, neurological complications, Glasgow score, PIM-2 score and PCIS at admission (p > 0.05). The inflammatory factors (CRP, PCT and IL-6) of 30 cases were tested at admission and after 3 days of admission. In the CBP group, there was a significant decrease in IL-6 levels at 3 days of admission (p = 0.003) and a decrease in CRP and PCT levels, but no significant difference (p > 0.05). In the non-CBP group, there were no significant difference on levels of CRP, PCT and IL-6 at admission and 3-day of admission (p > 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the CBP group compared with the non-CBP group (11.11% vs. 50%, p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: CBP definitely reduces IL-6 levels significantly. We did find that the survival rate of patients in the CBP group was improved. But we don’t know if there is a relationship between the reduction of IL-6 levels and the survival rate.

19497,The COVID-19 pandemic as a factor of hospital staff compliance with the rules of hand hygiene: assessment of the usefulness of the “Clean Care is a Safer Care” program as a tool to enhance compliance with hand hygiene principles in hospitals,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Global reports have described inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) interventions, but little is known about how socioeconomic inequality in intervention coverage varies across multiple low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess the association between wealth-related inequalities in coverage of RMNCH interventions. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we identified publicly available Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from LMICs containing information on household characteristics, reproductive health, women's and children's health, nutrition, and mortality. We identified the most recent survey from the period 2010–19 for 36 countries that contained data for our preselected set of 18 RMNCH interventions. 21 countries also had information on two common malaria interventions. We classified interventions into four groups according to their predominant delivery channels: health facility based, community based, environmental, and culturally driven (including breastfeeding practices). Within each country, we derived wealth quintiles from information on household asset indices. We studied two summary measures of within-country wealth-related inequality: absolute inequalities (akin to coverage differences among children from wealthy and poor households) using the slope index of inequality (SII), and relative inequalities (akin to the ratio of coverage levels for wealthy and poor children) using the concentration index (CIX). Pro-poor inequalities are present when intervention coverage decreased with increasing household wealth, and pro-rich inequalities are present when intervention coverage increased as household wealth increased. FINDINGS: Across the 36 LMICs included in our analyses, coverage of most interventions had pro-rich patterns in most countries, except for two breastfeeding indicators that mostly had higher coverage among poor women, children and households than wealthy women, children, and households. Environmental interventions were the most unequal, particularly use of clean fuels, which had median levels of SII of 48·8 (8·6–85·7) and CIX of 67·0 (45·0–85·8). Interventions primarily delivered in health facilities—namely institutional childbirth (median SII 46·7 [23·1–63·3] and CIX 11·4 [4·5–23·4]) and antenatal care (median SII 26·7 [17·0–47·2] and CIX 10·0 [4·2–17·1])—also usually had pro-rich patterns. By comparison, primarily community-based interventions, including those against malaria, were more equitably distributed—eg, oral rehydration therapy (median SII 9·4 [2·9–19·0] and CIX 3·4 [1·3–25·0]) and polio immunisation (SII 12·1 [2·3–25·0] and CIX 3·1 [0·5–7·1]). Differences across the four types of delivery channels in terms of both inequality indices were significant (SII p=0·0052; CIX p=0·0048). INTERPRETATION: Interventions that are often delivered at community level are usually more equitably distributed than those primarily delivered in fixed facilities or those that require changes in the home environment. Policy makers need to learn from community delivery channels to promote more equitable access to all RMNCH interventions. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust.

20510,Patient-Centered Care for Patients with Depression or Anxiety Disorder: An Integrative Review,2021-08-10,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV), the causative pathogen of hepatitis A, induces severe acute liver injuries in humans and is a serious public health concern worldwide. However, appropriate therapeutics have not yet been developed. The enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) exerts antiviral activities in cells infected with several viruses including hepatitis B and C viruses. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the suppression of virus replication by HO-1 in cells infected with HAV. Hemin (HO-1 inducer) induced HO-1 mRNA and protein expression, as expected, and below 50 mM, dose-dependently reduced the viral RNA and proteins in the HAV-infected cells without cytotoxicity. Additionally, HO-1 protein overexpression using a protein expression vector suppressed HAV replication. Although ZnPP-9, an HO-1 inhibitor, did not affect HAV replication, it significantly inhibited hemin-induced antiviral activity in HAV-infected cells. Additionally, FeCl(3), CORM-3, biliverdin, and the HO-1 inducers andrographolide and CoPP inhibited HAV replication in the HAV-infected cells; andrographolide and CoPP exhibited a dose-dependent effect. In conclusion, these results suggest that HO-1 effectively suppresses HAV infection in vitro, and its enzymatic products appear to exert antiviral activity. We expect that these results could contribute to the development of a new antiviral drug for HAV.","Kim, Dong-Hwi; Ahn, Hee-Seop; Go, Hyeon-Jeong; Kim, Da-Yoon; Kim, Jae-Hyeong; Lee, Joong-Bok; Park, Seung-Yong; Song, Chang-Seon; Lee, Sang-Won; Choi, In-Soo",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401830/,391
22092,"The Perceptions of Patients, Families, Doctors, and Nurses Regarding Malignant Bone Tumor Disclosure in China: A Qualitative Study",2021-04-15,"Over the last few decades, various models have been established within gastroenterological research that have significantly contributed to a better understanding of the (patho)physiological processes of various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (inflammation, organ injuries, carcinomas). This review will focus on such models including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), xenografts, and organoid-based culture systems. GEMMs laid the foundation for successful modeling of such diseases. These have the decisive advantage that diseases can be assessed in their physiological environment and thus allow the examination of cell–cell communications of various cell types (epithelium, fibroblast, immune cells). However, the discrepancy between the genetic background of mice and humans reflected a pivotal disadvantage that could at least partially be circumvented by transplanting human cells into immunocompromised host animals. The time-consuming and labor-intensive generation of such xenograft models, however, considerably limits their usefulness for timely preclinical drug screenings. Thus, novel organoid-based human cell culture systems from adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells are a promising human tool for modeling GI diseases. The first results already show their usefulness in the regulation of adult tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and tumor development. In addition, this system can be easily established in clinical diagnostics and thus enables real-time ex vivo pharmacotyping to develop personalized therapy strategies, particularly for cancer patients.","Arnold, Frank; Kleger, Alexander",Pathologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498756/,391
24790,Pharyngitis,2008,"Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a life-threatening complication of blood product transfusion. It is the leading cause of blood product transfusion related death in the USA. The syndrome is defined by hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray in the setting of a blood transfusion and absence of cardiac failure. The exact incidence of TRALI is unknown, but the incidence is higher in the critically ill patient population. Multiple patient and donor related risk factors for TRALI exist, including critically illness, alcohol use, and receiving transfusions with high plasma volumes. Practitioners should have a low index of suspicion for the diagnosis of TRALI, and blood bank reporting is vital to aid in diagnosis and future prevention. Management is primarily supportive care, with supplemental oxygen as the mainstay for therapy. Despite the transient course of TRALI, its morbidity is severe with the majority of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and treatment in the intensive care unit. For patients that survive TRALI, outcomes are promising without residual pulmonary deficits. Prevention strategies over the past 10 years have helped to decrease the incidence of TRALI and have led to increased awareness of this condition in the medical field.","Mannem, Hannah C.; Donahoe, Michael P.",Hematologic Abnormalities and Acute Lung Syndromes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121220/,391

41910,Zambia field epidemiology training program: strengthening health security through workforce development,2020-08-21,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: This is a case of Pakistani female with limited systemic sclerosis and associated mild interstitial lung disease. The lung disease was complicated by SARS-COV-2 related pneumonitis in April 2020 and that led to treatment challenges. She was previously seen in multiple private hospitals and labelled as Rheumatoid arthritis. She was being treated with long term steroids and Methotrexate. After her initial presentation to our Rheumatology services, her diagnosis was correctly revised to Systemic Sclerosis with phenotype of CREST. Her treatment was adjusted to Vasodilators and Mycophenolate due to skin and Lung involvement. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case of 40-year-old Pakistani female who had been having multiple joint pains since 2010. She also experienced severe Raynaud’s. She presented to our Rheumatology clinic in December 2018. Her symptoms included recurrent digital ulcers, tight and tough skin at fingers and Raynaud’s worse during winter months. Her examination confirmed peripheral cyanosis with multiple digital ulcers with superimposed infection, marked sclerodactyly and calcinosis. She was started on Vasodilator therapy including calcium channel blocker and PDE5 inhibitor due to severity of ulceration. Infection was managed with prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy. Her immunology showed positive anti nRNP/Sm. Anti-centromere and anti Scl 70 were negative. Her condition fit description of CREST (Calcinosis, RP, Oesophageal dysmotility, telangiectasia). Her management included weaning off Methotrexate and reduction in the dose of corticosteroids. In February 2019, Respiratory work up showed normal Chest radiograph, High resolution CT chest showing no significant abnormality and FEV1 82%, FVC 86%, and DLCO 77%. Her PASP was 25mmHg. Overall, her condition remained stable over the course of next year. Her medication included Cellcept, low dose prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, and Sildenafil. More importantly, Digital ulcers have been well controlled with combined vasodilator therapy. In April 2020, she developed SARS-CoV-2 with mild respiratory symptoms and was admitted to a different hospital. Fortunately, she responded well to ward based supportive and symptomatic treatment with no need for respiratory support. Subsequently, she has seen a different respiratory physician and had repeat imaging of chest which has led to dilemma whether the ground glass opacities in both lungs is due to scleroderma lung or COVID-19 related lung disease. She was given high dose prednisolone by the respiratory physician which has been reduced in rheumatology clinic. The new findings on chest imaging are sequelae of SARS-COV-2. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: 1. Systemic sclerosis diagnosis was not made for many years even though she has had severe digital ulcers for a long time. She was being managed as Rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic sclerosis remains a difficult disease to diagnose and is still under recognised. . 2. SARS-COV-2 related illness has not affected this patient adversely despite the fact of being on long term maintenance prednisolone of 7.5mg daily dose and Cellcept 2gm. Her cellcept was temporarily stopped during acute illness. . 3. We know that viral pneumonitis can present with typical ground glass opacities in bilateral areas of lungs and differential diagnosis does include connective tissue related lung disease but this lady had no significant respiratory involvement prior to COVID-19 illness and follow up scan will help to decide if this is disease progression or related to viral cause. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: 1. Continuity of care under same primary team can avoid confusion related to diagnosis and diagnosis related complications. This lady had none, or mild subclinical lung involvement related to systemic sclerosis prior to contracting COVID-19 illness. Her CT chest findings after the episode of SARS-COV-2 were attributed to systemic sclerosis as she was seen by different respiratory team. This continuity is not always possible, but MDT collaboration needs to be improved across hospitals and across various departments. . 2. Systemic sclerosis remains an under diagnosed and under recognized complex rheumatic disorder and more primary care physicians need to be educated so they can appropriately refer these cases to Rheumatology services. 3. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between Rheumatology, Respiratory and other specialties is the key point to manage these complex cases. . 4. This case also highlights an interesting observation that presence of significant immune disorder and immunosuppressant medication does not always equate to worse outcome if patient contracts SARS-COV-2. Supportive care, appropriate observation, and temporary suspension of DMARD in such cases can avoid any further complications.","Malik, Dr Saadia; Younas, Dr Hadi; Dhahir, Dr Loay Al",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607361/,391

Such applications include identifying disease-associated screenable phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity or mechanism of action. Several of these applications have been recently validated and have moved into production mode within academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Some of these have yielded disappointing results in practice but are now of renewed interest due to improved machine-learning strategies that better leverage image-based information.

44291,Multivariate analysis of early surgical management factors affecting posttraumatic penoscrotal avulsion injury: a level I trauma center study,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Initial CDC recommendations for passive monitoring of COVID-19 related symptoms among staff may not be sufficient in preventing the introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings. We therefore implemented active monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) at an academic medical center during the COVID-19 epidemic in northeast US. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of HCWs at Yale New Haven Hospital who worked in COVID-19 units and did not have COVID-19 related symptoms between March 28 and June 1, 2020. During follow-up, participants provided daily information on symptoms by responding to a web-based questionnaire, self-administered nasopharyngeal (NP) and saliva specimens every 3 days, and blood specimens every 14 days. We performed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and an anti-spike protein IgM and IgG ELISA to identify virological and serological-confirmed infection, respectively. RESULTS: We enrolled 525 (13%) amongst 4,136 HCW of whom daily information on symptoms and NP, saliva, and blood specimens were obtained for 66% (of 13208), 42% (or 1977), 44% (of 2071) and 65% (of 1099), respectively, of the follow-up measurement points. We identified 16 (3.0% of 525) HCWs with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an additional 12 (2.3% of 525) who were not tested by PCR or had negative PCR results but had serological evidence of infection. The overall cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.3% (28 of 525) amongst HCWs. Cases were not identified by hospital protocols for passive staff self-monitoring for symptoms. Amongst 16 PCR-confirmed cases, 9 (56%) of the 16 PCR-confirmed HCW had symptoms during or after the date of initial detection. We did not identify an epidemiological link between the 28 confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: We found that a significant proportion (5.3%) of HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic. In the setting of universal PPE use, infections were possibly acquired in the community rather than stemming from patient-HCW or HCW-HCW transmission. Passive monitoring of symptoms is inadequate in preventing introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the healthcare setting due to asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic presentations.

This chapter considers the 2019 election as a test of whether populist and nationalist themes, kept relatively isolated in recent Canadian elections, are used as election tactics. It considers the failures of both the People’s Party and Maxime Bernier, and the Green Party and Elizabeth May, in capturing either right wing or left wing populism around issues such immigration and the environment, during an era that seems ripe for these kinds of appeals. The chapter raises the question of whether in Canadian political culture, given the resilience of non-partisan voters and the lack of party identification, these types of appeals are effective.","Gillies, Jamie",Political Marketing in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979174/,391

One of these changes has been the introduction of virtual consultations in outpatient clinics to replace traditional face to face appointments. Methods A retrospective analysis of patient feedback from adult outpatient virtual appointments in a 4-month period was collated and reviewed (May-September 2020). After an appointment, patients were sent a text message asking for feedback. The text consisted of one main question asking patients to rate their experience and a comment section. The data from this brief patient survey was obtained for all rheumatology patient responses. At the end of the text there was a link for a more comprehensive online survey which patients could fill out if they wish to provide more detailed feedback. Responses to this survey encompasses all adult outpatient specialities including musculoskeletal services. Results There were 269 responses to the detailed patient survey from various adult outpatient clinics. The most common type of virtual consultation was telephone which was the case in 79%, of which 91% of patients stated the caller was polite and 89% felt they had an opportunity to ask questions. When asked what their overall view 43% of patients stated they would not mind conducting all future appointments via telephone, 23.5% felt that in the current situation a telephone consultation was acceptable but would have preferred a face to face and 7% were completely unsatisfied. From the musculoskeletal group there were 36 responses (20 orthopaedic, 15 rheumatology and 1 musculoskeletal). 92% of patients stated they were given the opportunity to ask questions and 86% were satisfied with the advice given to them. 33% (n = 12) stated they would not mind having virtual consultations in the future even after the pandemic, but 28% stated they would have preferred a face to face consultation. There were 784 responses to the shorter patient survey via text message from rheumatology patients. When asked to rate their experience 94% (n = 739) of patients stated it was either good or very good, and only 1% said it was poor or very poor. There were largely positive comments in the feedback. Most frequent points were patients felt listened to, communication was good and virtual consultations were less stressful. Conclusion At present the use of virtual clinics seems to be well received by patients and most importantly their quality of care is not compromised. From a patient’s perspective there are many benefits and cumulative feedback so far suggests that majority of the patients are willing to adapt to this new approach to outpatient appointments both now and post-COVID-19.

57469,Coexisting Substance Use Disorder and Chronic Pain During COVID-19,2021-09-06,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of different vascular accesses on dialysis quality and infection risk factors of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 162 patients with end-stage renal disease admitted to our hospital from February 2018 to July 2020 were divided into two groups: cuff tunnel conduit (CTC) group and native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) group. Peripheral blood was collected before and 6 months after dialysis. The incidence of vascular recirculation was measured, and the risk factors of infection were analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of HB, Alb, CRP, BUN, Scr, and TP after dialysis in the two groups were lower than those before dialysis (P < 0.05). The Kt/V of patients in both groups did not exceed 1.2, and the URR value exceeded 60%. The results of independent-samples T test analysis documented that the Kt/V level of patients in the AVF group was higher than that of those in the CTC group after dialysis (P < 0.05). The results of the urea method revealed that 22 of 68 patients (32.35%) in the CVC group and 21 of 94 (22.34%) in the AVF group had vascular pathway recirculation. The χ(2) test showed that there was no remarkable difference in the incidence of vascular pathway recirculation between both groups (P > 0.05). However, the results of the nonurea method revealed that the incidence of vascular pathway recirculation in the AVF group was lower than that in the CVC group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression was used to further analyze the factors with statistical significance in the single factor results. It showed that age >60 years, dialysis duration >1 year, dialysis times, diabetes, hypertension, and CTC were all independent risk factors causing vascular access infection. CONCLUSION: If all conditions permit, AVF hemodialysis is a better choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. For the elderly, long-term hemodialysis, and those with diabetes and hypertension, it is necessary to make detailed plans, strengthen the operation proficiency of CTC, and reduce the incidence of infection.","Wu, Huaping; Li, Xiang; Zeng, Cunliang; Zhang, Li; Song, Huanhuan; Lv, Kaiping",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8413044/,391

DATA: We identified 20 hot spots of 150m(2) each on the basis of community violence defined as serious assaults, robbery, and drug dealing in the Southend-on-Sea area of Essex Police, with boundaries geo-fenced to collect GPS measures of foot patrol presence generated by hand-held electronic trackers issued to officers directed to perform patrols. All street-visible crimes were counted for each of the 90 days of the experiment in each hot spot. METHODS: Daily random assignment of each hot spot to either control or treatment conditions (N = 90 X 20 = 1800 place-days) prescribed 720 place-days to receive extra patrols by Operational Support Group officers, which were compared to 1080 place-days with no extra patrols, using an intent-to-treat design, with 98% compliance with assigned treatments. Independent measures of other police presence in the area were tracked by the force-wide GPS telematics measures. All crimes were coded with the Cambridge Crime Harm Index for their CHI value. FINDINGS: The 20 harm spots comprised just 2.6% of the geographical area of the Southend-on-Sea area, with 41% of all its Cambridge CHI crime harm in the year preceding the experiment. Background patrol presence was about 2 min per day on control days and 1 min per treatment day. Crime harm scores for serious community violence were 88.5% lower on experimental days with extra patrols (mean = 1.07 CHI per treatment place-day) than without it (mean = 9.30 CHI per control place-day). Crime harm scores for all street-visible offences were 35.6% lower on treatment days (mean = 7.94 CHI per treatment place-day) than control days (mean = 12.33 CHI per control place-day), while the mean count of all street-visible offences was 31% lower on treatment days (mean count = 0.09 crimes per treatment place-day) than on control days (mean count = 0.13 crimes per control place-day). The estimated effect of the 720 days with 15-min patrols was to prevent crimes with recommended imprisonment of 3161 days, or 8.66 years. CONCLUSION: The use of two-officer foot patrol can be highly effective at preventing serious violence in street-visible settings in small areas in which such violence is heavily concentrated.","Basford, Lewis; Sims, Chris; Agar, Iain; Harinam, Vincent; Strang, Heather",Camb J Evid Based Polic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420151/,391

Methods: A total of 60 patients with moderate or severe forearm hematoma following transradial coronary intervention were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into two groups, as follows: an Idealast-haft elastic bandage group (the observation group) and a control group. The patients in the Idealast-haft elastic bandage group received compression bandaging with Idealast-haft elastic bandages and the patients in the control group received compression bandaging with Nylexorgrip elastic bandages. Observation indexes related to, for example, forearm pain, arterial pulsation, blistering, skin color, and hemostasis time were compared between the two groups. Results: The results revealed that the times taken for pain disappearance, arterial pulse recovery, blister disappearance, skin color recovery, and compression hemostasis were significantly shorter in the Idealast-haft elastic bandage group than in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The hematoma range and the arm circumference at the severest part of the hematoma decreased faster in the observation group than in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The Idealast-haft elastic bandage is more effective than the Nylexorgrip elastic bandage in patients with forearm hematoma following transradial coronary intervention and should therefore be used in such cases.","An, Lei; Du, Wei-liang; Yang, Xiao-Ning; Zhang, Chun-Yan; Xue, Zeng-Ming",Front Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481800/,391

The development and validation of a novel, sensitive and specific assay for diagnosing chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is urgently needed. Methods: From April 2018 to June 2019, 53 patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), 32 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 48 healthy controls were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Clinical characteristics and samples were collected at enrollment. All exhaled breath samples were analyzed offline using thermal desorption single-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; to analyze the metabolic pathways of the characteristic volatile organic compounds, serum samples were subjected to ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography. Results: We identified characteristic volatile organic compounds in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, which mainly consisted of phenol, neopentyl alcohol, toluene, limonene and ethylbenzene. These compounds were assessed using a logistic regression model. The sensitivity and specificity were 95.8 and 96.9% for discriminating patients in the CPA group from those in the CAP group and 95.8 and 97.9% for discriminating patients in the CPA group from healthy controls, respectively. The concentration of limonene (m/z 136) correlated significantly positively with anti-Aspergillus fumigatus IgG antibody titers (r = 0.420, P < 0.01). After antifungal treatment, serum IgG and the concentration of limonene (m/z 136) decreased in the subgroup of patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.

Given the limited utility of the test, we aimed to estimate the effectivity of ordering ANA testing in childhood. METHODS Children referred to our department to be examined due to ANA positivity between 2008 and 2020 were included in the study. Those with less than one-year follow-up period, those with previously known rheumatic or autoimmune disease, and those diagnosed as an autoimmune and/or rheumatic disease at the first visit were excluded. Data were obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. The parents of all of the patients were called via phone, data were verified, and missing information was collected. RESULTS Three hundred and fifty-eight patients (230 females) were eligible for the study. The median age at ANA positivity was found is 9.31 (1.3-17.86) years old and the median follow-up duration was 4.85 (1-11.91) years. Most of the patients had no underlying disease (n=337, 94.1%). The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was to evaluate musculoskeletal system symptoms (n=225, 62.8%). None of our patients referred to us due to ANA positivity developed any autoimmune conditions or ANA associated rheumatic disease.

60604,"Evaluation of Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Initiation of Kidney Failure Treatment During the First 4 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND Hyper- and hyponatremia are frequently observed in patients after subarachnoidal hemorrhage, and are potentially related to worse outcome. We hypothesized that the fluid regimen in these patients is associated with distinct changes in serum electrolytes, acid-base disturbances, and fluid balance. METHODS Thirty-six consecutive patients with SAH were randomized double-blinded to either normal saline and hydroxyethyl starch dissolved in normal saline (Voluven(®); saline) or balanced crystalloid and colloid solutions (Ringerfundin(®) and Tetraspan(®); balanced, n = 18, each) for 48 h. Laboratory samples and fluid balance were evaluated at baseline and at 24 and 48 h. RESULTS Age [57 ± 13 years (mean ± SD; saline) vs. 56 ± 12 years (balanced)], SAPS II (38 ± 16 vs. 34 ± 17), Hunt and Hess [3 (1-4) (median, range) vs. 2 (1-4)], and Fischer scores [3.5 (1-4) vs. 3.5 (1-4)] were similar. Serum sodium, chloride, and osmolality increased in saline only (p ≤ 0.010, time-group interaction). More patients in saline had Cl >108 mmol/L [16 (89 %) vs. 8 (44 %); p = 0.006], serum osmolality >300 mosmol/L [10 (56 %) vs. 2 (11 %); p = 0.012], a base excess <-2 [12 (67 %) vs. 2 (11 %); p = 0.001], and fluid balance >1,500 mL during the first 24 h [11 (61 %) vs. 5 (28 %); p = 0.046]. Hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality were not more frequent in the balanced group. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with saline-based fluids resulted in a greater number of patients with hyperchloremia, hyperosmolality, and positive fluid balance >1,500 mL early after SAH, while administration of balanced solutions did not cause more frequent hyponatremia or hypo-osmolality.

60729,Disability in children and adolescents must be integrated into the global health agenda.,2021-03-19,"OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CoreValve transcatheter heart valve (THV) for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in patients at extreme risk for surgery. BACKGROUND Untreated severe aortic stenosis is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis is a potentially effective therapy. METHODS We performed a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized investigation evaluating the safety and efficacy of self-expanding TAVR in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with prohibitive risks for surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or major stroke at 12 months, which was compared with a pre-specified objective performance goal (OPG). RESULTS A total of 41 sites in the United States recruited 506 patients, of whom 489 underwent attempted treatment with the CoreValve THV. The rate of all-cause mortality or major stroke at 12 months was 26.0% (upper 2-sided 95% confidence bound: 29.9%) versus 43.0% with the OPG (p < 0.0001). Individual 30-day and 12-month events included all-cause mortality (8.4% and 24.3%, respectively) and major stroke (2.3% and 4.3%, respectively). Procedural events at 30 days included life-threatening/disabling bleeding (12.7%), major vascular complications (8.2%), and need for permanent pacemaker placement (21.6%). The frequency of moderate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation was lower 12 months after self-expanding TAVR (4.2%) than at discharge (10.7%; p = 0.004 for paired analysis). CONCLUSIONS TAVR with a self-expanding bioprosthesis was safe and effective in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at prohibitive risk for surgical valve replacement.

We examined prasugrel use and outcomes according to PCI complexity, as well as analyzing treatment effects according to thienopyridine type. METHODS PROMETHEUS was a multicentre observational study that compared clopidogrel vs prasugrel in acute coronary syndrome patients who underwent PCI (n = 19,914). Complex PCI was defined as PCI of the left main, bifurcation lesion, moderate-severely calcified lesion, or total stent length ≥ 30 mm. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned revascularization. Outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression for effect of PCI complexity and propensity-stratified analysis for effect of thienopyridine type. RESULTS The study cohort included 48.9% (n = 9735) complex and 51.1% (n = 10,179) noncomplex patients. Second generation drug-eluting stents were used in 70.1% complex and 66.2% noncomplex PCI patients (P < 0.0001). Complex PCI was associated with greater adjusted risk of 1-year MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.39; P < 0.001). Prasugrel was prescribed in 20.7% of complex and 20.1% of noncomplex PCI patients (P = 0.30). Compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel significantly decreased adjusted risk for 1-year MACE in complex PCI (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92) but not noncomplex PCI (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.08), albeit there was no evidence of interaction (P interaction = 0.281). CONCLUSIONS Despite the use of contemporary techniques, acute coronary syndrome patients who undergo complex PCI had significantly higher rates of 1-year MACE. Adjusted magnitude of treatment effects with prasugrel vs clopidogrel were consistent in complex and noncomplex PCI without evidence of interaction.","Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Aquino, Melissa; Kini, Annapoorna S; Rao, Sunil; Weintraub, William; Henry, Timothy D; Farhan, Serdar; Vogel, Birgit; Sorrentino, Sabato; Ge, Zhen; Kapadia, Samir; Muhlestein, Joseph B; Weiss, Sandra; Strauss, Craig; Toma, Catalin; DeFranco, Anthony; Effron, Mark B; Keller, Stuart; Baker, Brian A; Pocock, Stuart; Dangas, George; Mehran, Roxana",The Canadian journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2017.12.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29475531/,391

61348,"COVID-19, social vulnerability and mental health of LGBTQIA+ populations.",2021,"BACKGROUND Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity appears to be linked to worse global outcome in adult traumatic brain injury (TBI). Literature suggests that current treatments administered in TBI care, in the intensive care unit (ICU), fail to greatly impact recorded cerebrovascular reactivity measures. In particular, the impact of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear in vivo. The goal of this study was to preliminarily assess the relationship between objectively measured depth of sedation and cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. METHODS Within, we describe a case series of 5 adult TBI patients with TBI, during which objective high-frequency physiology for sedation depth, using bispectral index (BIS), and both intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were recorded. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) and RAP (a metric of cerebral compensatory reserve) were derived. Relationships between cerebrovascular reactivity and compensatory reserve monitoring with BIS metrics were explored using descriptive plots. RESULTS A total of 5 cases in our prospectively maintained database with high-frequency physiology for ICP, ABP, and BIS. Through error bar plotting, it can be seen that each patient displays a parabolic relationship between BIS and PRx. This suggests a potential ""optimal"" depth of sedation where cerebrovascular reactivity is the most intact. CONCLUSIONS This small series highlights the potential impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. It suggests that there may be an individual optimal depth of sedation, so as to optimize cerebrovascular reactivity. Further study of objective depth of sedation and its impact on cerebrovascular physiology in TBI is required.","Froese, L; Dian, J; Gomez, A; Zeiler, F A",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04662-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404872/,391

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 24 patients and 27 healthy subjects were included. The patients underwent neuropsychological tests and took twice resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) (before and after HD). Healthy group had one rs-fMRI. The zALFF based on rs-fMRI was calculated. Paired t and independent t test was applied to compare zALFF among groups. The associations between zALFF and duration of HD, ultrafiltration volume, and neuropsychological tests was calculated by partial correlation. RESULTS Compared to healthy group, patients before HD showed significant worse performances on digit symbol test (DST) and serial dotting test (SDT). Patients after HD performed DST better than before HD. The patients after HD showed higher zALFF in left putamen than before HD. Multiple regions of both HD groups showed significant lower zALFF than healthy group. The zALFF of left putamen of patients after HD was significant negative correlated with the ultrafiltration volume (R = -0.679). The zALFF in patients before HD exhibited significantly positive or negative correlations with DST and SDT in multiple regions. The zALFF of patients after HD significantly negative correlated with DST in right temporal, positive and negative correlated with ultrafiltration volume in right frontal, left putamen respectively. CONCLUSION ESRD patients showed changed spontaneous brain activity and cognitive impairments. After a single HD session, patients performed better in neuropsychological test, and spontaneous brain activity changed in left putamen. Ultrafiltration volume might be associated with activity of left putamen.","Peng, Cong; Yang, Hua; Ran, Qian; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Chengxuan; Fang, Yu; Liu, Yingjiang; Cao, Yi; Liang, Renrong; Ren, He; Hu, Qinqin; Mei, Xiuting; Jiang, Yang; Luo, Tianyou",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00915-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601841/,391

The direct effects of the perceived threat of COVID-19 and positive youth development (PYD) qualities, as well as the moderating effect of PYD qualities on PTSD symptoms, were studied. METHODS Five schools in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, participated in this study. Two waves of data were collected before school lockdown (Wave 1, between December 2019 and January 2020) and after school resumption (Wave 2, between June 2020 and July 2020), respectively. A total of 4,981 adolescents aged above 11 years (Mean age = 13.15, SD = 1.32 at Wave 1, 51.5% girls) completed questionnaires at both waves. Students responded to measures of PYD qualities at both waves and perceived threat and PTSD symptoms at Wave 2. RESULTS A total of 517 adolescents (10.4%) could be regarded as having PTSD. Results indicated significant unique main effects of perceived threat (β = .13, p < .001) and Wave 1 PYD qualities (β = -.16, p < .001) on PTSD symptoms. Besides, results showed a significant moderating effect of PYD qualities in mitigating the negative impact of perceived threat on PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed the protective effect of PYD attributes in reducing the negative influence of traumatic situations such as COVID-19 on adolescent mental health. Results underscore the importance of promoting PYD qualities in adolescents in mainland China via effective PYD programs.","Shek, Daniel T L; Zhao, Li; Dou, Diya; Zhu, Xiaoqin; Xiao, Chenghan",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583684/,391

BACKGROUND Given that both dental caries and periodontitis are behaviourally mediated, biofilm-based diseases that are largely preventable with attention to regular oral hygiene practices and preventive dental visits, strategies to arrest or even heal carious lesions and high-quality maintenance care and plaque control without the need to resort to aerosol-generating surgical approaches are evidence-based best practices. Older immigrants have poorer oral health than older US-born natives, motivating the need for delivery of more effective and affordable services to this vulnerable population. MATERIALS AND METHODS CHWs were trained by the NYU College of Dentistry dental hygienist faculty members using dental models and flip charts to instruct patients on proper brushing and flossing techniques. In addition, they discussed the presented oral health promotion information one-on-one with patients, addressed any expressed concerns and encouraged prevention of oral conditions through regular dental visits and brushing with fluoride toothpaste. RESULTS More than 98% of the 74 older Chinese adult participants strongly agreed/agreed that the CHWs helped them to improve how they take care of their health, the CHWs answered their questions and concerns, the information and topics were informative, and the in-person demonstrations were helpful in improving oral health. CONCLUSION The health of all communities depends on access to comprehensive care, including oral health care, in the wake of COVID-19.

They were premedicated with intravenous (IV) xylazine (1.3 mg/kg); an additional dose of xylazine (0.3 mg/kg IV) was administered in case of inadequate depth of sedation. Anaesthesia was induced with IV thiopental (6 mg/kg). The quality of sedation and induction was recorded. Anaesthesia was maintained with an infusion of guaiphenesin (50 mg/mL), ketamine (2 mg/mL) and xylazine (1 mg/mL) (GKX). The spermatic cord of each testis was infiltrated with 5 mL of 2% lidocaine. During anaesthesia heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT) and haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured every 5 min. The data were analysed with simple one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Time of anesthesia, time of surgery and time of recovery were recorded. RESULTS Only one mule required an additional dose of xylazine to achieve a satisfactory depth of sedation. Thiopental at the dose of 6 mg/kg IV resulted in smooth induction and lateral recumbency in all animals. GKX provided adequate anaesthesia to perform castration in all mules. Muscle relaxation was deemed adequate and physiological variables remained stable and within references values during the anaesthesia and did not change in response to surgical stimulation. Time (mean ± standard deviation) from the end of the infusion to sternal recumbency and time from sternal recumbency to standing were 27.7 ± 4.6 and 30.1 ± 7.7 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The combination of xylazine, thiopental and GKX provides satisfactory short-term anaesthesia in mules undergoing field castration.","Vullo, Cecilia; Carluccio, Augusto; Robbe, Domenico; Meligrana, Marina; Petrucci, Linda; Catone, Giuseppe",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-017-0335-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020956/,391

Of the factors that influence seal integrity, vessel (artery) diameter has been considered the most important variable. In this study we hypothesized that the relative ratio of the components that form the seal (collagen and elastin) determine the degree of vessel distensibility and play an equally important role in defining seal strength. METHODS Porcine carotid, renal, iliac, and femoral arteries were sealed using a bipolar electrosurgical device in vivo. Following removal, arterial diameter was measured and vessels' seals tested for arterial burst pressure (ABPr). Samples were then analyzed histologically and biochemically for collagen and elastin content. RESULTS Arteries with the highest collagen-elastin ratio (C/E) (renal) consistently demonstrated significantly higher burst pressures than those arteries with lower C/E ratios (iliac and femoral) independent of artery diameter. CONCLUSION Using arteries of distinct anatomical origin and physiological function, we demonstrate that total collagen content, and more specifically C/E ratio, in porcine arteries is a more accurate predictor of ABPr than vessel size alone.","Sindram, David; Martin, Kimberly; Meadows, Jarrod P; Prabhu, Ajita S; Heath, Jessica J; McKillop, Iain H; Iannitti, David A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1606-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21404086/,391

Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with Covid-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus proinflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen Covid-19 patients at high risk of worsening. METHODS Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score= SOFA], MuLBSTA Score (Multilobular infiltration, Hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension, and Age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). RESULTS In our study, mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION According to results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors those emphasize the use of Anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors those enhance the use of Anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects or no success to antiviral treatment.

METHODS The caecal ligation and puncture model was used to induce peritonitis in 144 rats. Seven commercially available meshes were implanted intraperitoneally: six non-absorbable meshes, of which three had an absorbable coating, and one biological mesh. Mesh infection, intra-abdominal abscess formation, adhesion formation, incorporation and shrinkage were evaluated after 28 and 90 days. Histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin and picrosirius red staining was performed. RESULTS No mesh infections occurred in Sepramesh(®) , Omyramesh(®) and Strattice(®) . One mesh infection occurred in Parietene(®) and Parietene Composite(®) . Significantly more mesh infections were found in C-Qur(®) (15 of 16; P ≤ 0·006) and Dualmesh(®) (7 of 15; P ≤ 0·035). Sepramesh(®) showed a significant increase in adhesion coverage from 12·5 per cent at 28 days to 60·0 per cent at 90 days (P = 0·010). At 90 days there was no significant difference between median adhesion coverage of Parietene Composite(®) (35·0 per cent), Omyramesh(®) (42·5 per cent), Sepramesh(®) (60·0 per cent) and Parietene(®) (72·5 per cent).

The esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) is widely used, but has several limitations. The NICOM, a completely noninvasive cardiac output monitor (Cheetah Medical), may be appropriate for guiding GDFT. No prospective studies have compared the NICOM and the EDM. We hypothesized that the NICOM is not significantly different from the EDM for monitoring during GDFT. METHODS One hundred adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery participated in this study. Patients in phase I (n = 50) had intraoperative GDFT guided by the EDM while the NICOM was connected, and patients in phase II (n = 50) had intraoperative GDFT guided by the NICOM while the EDM was connected. Each patient's stroke volume was optimized using 250-mL colloid boluses. Agreement between the monitors was assessed, and patient outcomes (postoperative pain, nausea, and return of bowel function), complications (renal, pulmonary, infectious, and wound complications), and length of hospital stay (LOS) were compared. RESULTS Using a 10% increase in stroke volume after fluid challenge, agreement between monitors was 60% at 5 minutes, 61% at 10 minutes, and 66% at 15 minutes, with no significant systematic disagreement (McNemar P > 0.05) at any time point. The EDM had significantly more missing data than the NICOM. No clinically significant differences were found in total LOS or other outcomes. The mean LOS was 6.56 ± 4.32 days in phase I and 6.07 ± 2.85 days in phase II, and 95% confidence limits for the difference were -0.96 to +1.95 days (P = 0.5016). CONCLUSIONS The NICOM performs similarly to the EDM in guiding GDFT, with no clinically significant differences in outcomes, and offers increased ease of use as well as fewer missing data points.

In this article, we present a case of an infant with a subglottic lesion with endoscopic features consistent with haemangioma. After initial clinical response to propranolol, the patient represented with progressive stridor no longer responding to therapy. Open excision of the lesion was performed, and histopathology revealed ectopic thymus tissue. In this case, ectopic thymus tissue mimicked the presentation of subglottic haemangioma, and confirmation bias persisted due to an apparent initial clinical response to treatment with propranolol.

There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year and adults have two to four.Objectives To determine whether garlic (Allium sativum) is effective for the prevention or treatment of the common cold, when compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments.Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7),OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965),MEDLINE (January 1966 to July week 5, 2014), EMBASE(1974 to August 2014) and AMED (1985 to August 2014).Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of common cold prevention and treatment comparing garlic with placebo, no treatment or standard treatment.Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data.Main results In this updated review, we identified eight trials as potentially relevant from our searches. Again, only one trial met the inclusion criteria.This trial randomly assigned 146 participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily)for 12 weeks. The trial reported 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic intervention group compared with 65 in the placebo group (P value < 0.001), resulting in fewer days of illness in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery from an occurrence of the common cold was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, therefore limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self reported episodes of the common cold but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but more studies are needed to validate this finding. Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor-quality evidence.","Lissiman, Elizabeth; Bhasale, Alice L; Cohen, Marc",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006206.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25386977/,391
76652,Evaluation of Fear in Idiopathic Epilepsy Using Population-Based Survey and Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in Epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ).,2020,"Need for innovation There is a clear need for physician leaders with expertise in wellness given the high incidence of physician burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. A fellowship in physician wellness provides structured opportunity for the development of expertise in the science and administration of physician wellness through a tailored curriculum and academic scholarship. Background Currently, limited opportunities exist to pursue formal wellness training in graduate medical education. This lack of specific training may make the path to expertise and leadership in physician wellness difficult. Objective Our objective was to design and implement a physician wellness fellowship in a department of emergency medicine. Completion of this fellowship, with ongoing professional development, will give physicians the skills to fill various leadership roles within the house of medicine, such as chief wellness officer, department, organization, national wellness leader, or wellness consultant. Development process The fellowship curriculum was developed according to Kern's six-step approach with expert consultation. The Stanford WellMD Model of Professional Fulfillment was used as a framework to define the core content. The curriculum has five principal components developed utilizing competency-based education in medicine: dissemination of knowledge (teaching), clinical, educational foundation, implementation (administrative), and critical investigation (research). Implementation phase The physician wellness fellowship was implemented for the academic year 2019-2020. The fellow completed all the required fellowship activities. In addition, the fellow completed the American College of Emergency Physician's teaching fellowship program. The fellowship is budget neutral because the fellow's half-time clinical revenue is sufficient to cover the fellow's salary and education and support for fellowship direction. Reflective discussion Outcomes of this novel program will be measured over time. Although the format of this fellowship is designed for emergency medicine, the skills and content are relevant to and may be adopted in other medical specialties at other institutions.","Singh, Jessica; Poffenberger, Cori; Smith-Coggins, Rebecca",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471796/,391

However, concerns regarding the safety of uniportal procedures for complex cases such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, bronchial sleeves or vascular reconstructions still remains. As experience with uniportal VATS has increased, its application toward more technically demanding operations has also expanded. This article describes a uniportal cVATS left upper lobectomy with partial pulmonary arterioplasty for lung cancer with calcified lymph nodes. In order to reduce the risk of bleeding, we looped the left main pulmonary artery and applied two-stage maneuvering for left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus, cut the bronchus at the distal end and close the stump using a stapler at the end, which are conducive to maximal safety.","Wang, Guang-Suo; Wang, Jian; Rao, Zhan-Peng; Ding, Guang-Gui; Wang, Zheng",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.12.50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26793361/,391
77429,Theories Informing eHealth Implementation: Systematic Review and Typology Classification.,2021-05-31,"CHAPTER 1: HOW AUSTRALIA IMPROVED HEALTH EQUITY THROUGH ACTION ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Do not think that the social determinants of health equity are old hat. In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. CHAPTER 2: ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER CONNECTION TO CULTURE: BUILDING STRONGER INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WELLBEING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CHAPTER 3: PHYSICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: HEALTHY, LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: THE ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. CHAPTER 5: DISRUPTING THE COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. CHAPTER 7: GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH AND EQUITY: A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development.","Backholer, Kathryn; Baum, Fran; Finlay, Summer M; Friel, Sharon; Giles-Corti, Billie; Jones, Alexandra; Patrick, Rebecca; Shill, Jane; Townsend, Belinda; Armstrong, Fiona; Baker, Phil; Bowen, Kathryn; Browne, Jennifer; Büsst, Cara; Butt, Andrew; Canuto, Karla; Canuto, Kootsy; Capon, Anthony; Corben, Kirstan; Daube, Mike; Goldfeld, Sharon; Grenfell, Robert; Gunn, Lucy; Harris, Patrick; Horton, Kellie; Keane, Lewis; Lacy-Nichols, Jennifer; Lo, Selina N; Lovett, Raymond W; Lowe, Melanie; Martin, Jane E; Neal, Nadia; Peeters, Anna; Pettman, Tahna; Thoms, Aileen; Thow, Anne Marie T; Timperio, Anna; Williams, Carmel; Wright, Annemarie; Zapata-Diomedi, Belen; Demaio, Sandro",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934362/,391
78004,PEEP titration: the effect of prone position and abdominal pressure in an ARDS model.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Medina embolization device (MED) is a new flow disruption device combining the design of a detachable coil with an intrasaccular flow disrupter. Safety and short-term angiographic effectiveness of this device have recently been reported. However, long-term angiographic results are lacking. We report herein the 18 months' angiographic outcome in patients treated for a wide-neck intracranial aneurysm with the MED. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen patients (17 female, mean age 50 years) with 20 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms (six ruptured; 14 unruptured) were treated by the MED between January 2015 and June 2016. Procedure-related complications were systematically recorded; discharge and 6-9 months' follow-up modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed. Angiographic mid-term and long-term follow-up were performed with a mean delay of 6.4±1.5 months (n=16 aneurysms) and 17.7±4.2 months (n=15 aneurysms), respectively. Occlusion rates were evaluated after the procedure and at the mid-term and long-term follow-up using the Roy-Raymond scale. RESULTS Embolization with the MED was feasible in all except two cases (2/20, 10%). One per-procedural perforation was recorded (1/20, 5%) and one MED deployment failed because of the aneurysm's shape (1/20, 5%). Three cases of thromboembolic complications were observed (3/20, 15%). Only one thromboembolic complication was responsible for clinical sequelae. Grade A occlusion rate was 61% (11/18) after the procedure, 75% at 6 months' follow-up (12/16), and 80% (12/15) at long-term follow-up. Two cases (2/18, 11%) of recanalization at mid-term were documented angiographically. No recanalization occurred between the mid-term and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION MED is a hybrid embolization device, combining properties of a conventional coil with those of an intrasaccular flow disrupter. Our series focusing on long-term angiographic follow-up shows a satisfactory long-term occlusion rate. Larger series with longer angiographic follow-up times are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.","Haffaf, Idriss; Clarençon, Frédéric; Shotar, Eimad; Rolla-Bigliani, Claudia; Vande Perre, Saskia; Mathon, Bertrand; Drir, Mehdi; Sourour, Nader-Antoine",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30472677/,391

Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the prevention behaviors of COVID-19 among health staff based on the Extended Parallel Model (EPPM) in western Iran. STUDY DESIGN It was a cross-sectional study. . METHODS The present study was performed in the west of Iran in April 2020. In total, 1,664 cases were enrolled in this study via multi-stage sampling. The data were collected using a questionnaire, including the demographic characteristics of participants and EPPM constructs. All analyses were conducted in Stata software (version 14) at a 5% significant level. RESULTS As evidenced by the obtained results, 1,523 (91.53%), 1,226 (73.68%), 1,526 (91.71%), 893 (53.67%), and 862 (51.86%) of health staff wear gloves, use masks, avoid contact with others, maintain a good distance from other people, and wash their hands frequently with water and soap, respectively. In terms of using gloves and avoiding contacts with others, participants with high perceived threat had higher odds of observing health behaviors (OR= 3.14, 95% CI: 2.08, 4.73; P<0.001) and (OR= 3.1, 95% CI: 2.04, 4.69; P<0.001), respectively. In all categories of EPPM, the participants with high efficacy had higher odds of exhibiting health behaviors, compared to those with low efficacy (P<0.001). CONCLUSION The results of the present study demonstrated that health workers are expected to be at the highest level of threat and efficiency.

79267,[Challenges to the Nursing Practicum During the COVID-19 Pandemic].,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE To describe a technique in which percutaneous orbital atherectomy is used to debulk heavily calcified superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusions as an adjunct in patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting. TECHNIQUE The technique is demonstrated in a 62-year-old woman with a replaced right hepatic artery originating from an SMA occluded by densely calcified lesions. Via a left transbrachial approach, a 7-F MPA guide catheter was used to engage the ostium of the SMA, which was crossed using a catheter and guidewire. The calcified lesion was debulked using the 2-mm Diamondback 360° orbital atherectomy system. The wire was exchanged for a 0.014-inch filter wire and 0.018-inch guidewire. Using a 2-guidewire technique, the SMA was stented with a self-expanding stent for the distal lesion that crossed side branches and a balloon-expandable stent at the ostium. A 0.014-inch guidewire was placed into the replaced hepatic artery through a cell of the self-expanding stent, followed by deployment of a small balloon-expandable stent to address the residual lesion. CONCLUSION The use of orbital atherectomy to debulk occluded and heavily calcified SMA lesions may optimize the technical results with angioplasty and stenting.","Manunga, Jesse M; Oderich, Gustavo S",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/12-3900.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891827/,391

More than 2,200 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in humans from 27 countries, with a crude case fatality rate of 35% since the disease's emergence in the Middle East in 2012. In the coming years, MERS will continue to pose a severe threat to economic development as well as to the elimination of poverty and advances in food security. An important gap in the effort to keep MERS at bay is the lack of surveillance of animals in the Middle East. The authors identify the need for international collaboration to conduct MERS coronavirus (CoV) surveillance in animals in the Middle East, since the emergence of new MERS-CoV variants with the ability to sustain efficient person-to-person transmission is a genuine threat. However, effective surveillance will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. There are multiple obstacles in the region to overcome, including a lack of transparency as governments in the Middle East generally do not disclose detailed information on animal diseases. In addition, there is minimal collaboration between local and international agencies in both the human and animal health sectors and a limited number of readily available qualified laboratories to screen animals for MERS- CoV. Last, but not least, there is a lack of adequate active communication between all relevant laboratories, local and abroad. However, with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and other partners, the responsibility of the Mediterranean Zoonosis Control Centre in Athens, Greece, could be widened to include the countries of the Middle East. This would foster a stronger alliance and far more effective collaboration in the spirit of One Health.","Wernery, U; Woo, P C Y",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.38.1.2941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564740/,391

We sought to (1) describe resources and gaps in PEM fellowship research training and (2) assess agreement between fellow and program director (PD) perceptions of these in fellow research experience. Methods Surveys were distributed electronically to U.S. PEM fellows and PDs from March to April 2020. Fellows and PDs were queried on program research infrastructure and current gaps in fellow research experience. For programs that had at least one fellow and PD response, each fellow response was compared to their PD's corresponding response (reference standard). For each binary survey item, we determined the percent of responses with agreement between the fellow and PD. Results Of 79 fellowship programs, 70 (89%) were represented with at least one response, including responses from 59 PDs (75%) and 218 fellows (39% of all fellows, representing 80% of programs). Fellows and PDs identified mentorship and faculty engagement as the most important needs for successful fellowship research; for every one fellow there was a median of 0.8 potential faculty mentors in the division. Twenty percent of fellows were not satisfied with mentorship opportunities. There was no association between fellow career research intent (high, defined as ≥20% dedicated time, or low) with current year of training (p = 0.88), program size (p = 0.67), and area of research focus (p = 0.40). Fellows were often unaware of research being performed by division faculty. Conclusion PEM fellows were not consistently aware of resources available to support research training. To better support PEM fellows' research training, many programs may need to expand mentorship and increase fellows' awareness of local and external resources and opportunities.","DesPain, Angelica W; Gutman, Colleen K; Cruz, Andrea T; Aronson, Paul L; Chamberlain, James M; Chang, Todd P; Florin, Todd A; Kaplan, Ron L; Nigrovic, Lise E; Pruitt, Christopher M; Thompson, Amy D; Gonzalez, Victor M; Mistry, Rakesh D",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124527/,391

We sought to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on operating expenses and revenues of primary care practices.Using a microsimulation model incorporating national data on primary care utilization, staffing, expenditures, and reimbursements, including telemedicine visits, we estimated that primary care practices over the course of calendar year 2020 would be expected to lose $67,774 in gross revenue per full time physician (the difference between 2020 gross revenue with COVID-19 and the anticipated gross revenue if COVID-19 had not occurred, interquartile range: -$80,557, -$54,990). We further estimated that the cost would be $15.1 billion at a national level to neutralize the revenue losses caused by COVID-19 among primary care practices.

METHODS We introduce an adaptive transfer learning algorithm to classify and segment events from non-stationary multi-channel temporal data. Using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) the algorithm adaptively adjusts to shifts in distribution over time. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised and learns to label events without requiring \textit{a priori} information about true event states. The procedure is illustrated on experimental data collected from a cohort in a human viral challenge (HVC) study, where certain subjects have disrupted wake and sleep patterns after exposure to a H1N1 influenza pathogen. RESULTS Simulations establish that the proposed adaptive algorithm significantly outperforms other event classification methods. When applied to early time points in the HVC data the algorithm extracts sleep/wake features that are predictive of both infection and infection onset time. CONCLUSION The proposed transfer learning event segmentation method is robust to temporal shifts in data distribution and can be used to produce highly discriminative event-labeled features for health monitoring.

For 96,242 deaths, the definition for unexplained death was met and autopsy status was recorded. Most decedents were male, 40-49 years of age, and white. To identify factors associated with unexplained death, we used data from Arizona records. Multivariate analysis of Arizona records suggested that decedents of races other than white and black and decedents who had clinicopathologic syndromes in the cardiovascular, sepsis/shock, and multisyndrome categories recorded on the death certificate were least likely to have undergone autopsy; children with unexplained death were the most likely to have undergone autopsy. Improved understanding of unexplained deaths can provide opportunities for further studies, strengthen collaboration between investigators of unexplained deaths, and improve knowledge and awareness of infectious diseases of public health concern.","Liu, Lindy; Sinden, Laura L; Holman, Robert C; Blau, Dianna M",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1804.111311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22469466/,391

PURPOSE To assess the feasibility of three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (3D CBCT) fusion imaging with ""virtual probe"" positioning, to predict ablation volume in lung tumors treated percutaneously. MATERIAL AND METHODS Pre-procedural computed tomography contrast-enhanced scans (CECT) were merged with a CBCT volume obtained to plan the ablation. An offline tumor segmentation was performed to determine the number of antennae and their positioning within the tumor. The volume of ablation obtained, evaluated on CECT performed after 1 month, was compared with the pre-procedural predicted one. Feasibility was assessed on the basis of accuracy evaluation (visual evaluation [VE] and quantitative evaluation [QE]), technical success (TS), and technical effectiveness (TE). RESULTS Seven of the patients with lung tumor treated by percutaneous thermal ablation were selected and treated on the basis of the 3D CBCT fusion imaging. In all cases the volume of ablation predicted was in accordance with that obtained. The difference in volume between predicted ablation volumes and obtained ones on CECT at 1 month was 1.8 cm(3) (SD ± 2, min. 0.4, max. 0.9) for MW and 0.9 cm(3) (SD ± 1.1, min. 0.1, max. 0.7) for RF. CONCLUSION Use of pre-procedural 3D CBCT fusion imaging could be useful to define expected ablation volumes. However, more patients are needed to ensure stronger evidence.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Petrillo, Mario; Xhepa, Genti; Laganà, Domenico; Piacentino, Filippo; Floridi, Chiara; Duka, Ejona; Fugazzola, Carlo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1177/0284185115574874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25824206/,391

The severity of bleeding and related complications is proportional to the amount of residual circulating functional factor. The development of a safe and effective hemophilia treatment lasted several decades and has been mainly based on clotting factor replacement. Advances in the engineering and manufacturing of clotting concentrates have led to the widespread availability of extended half-life products that reduced the number of intravenous infusions needed to achieve adequate trough levels. The recent development of new nonfactor replacement treatments and biotechnology techniques has offered therapeutic alternatives for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These are characterized by an easier route of administration, low immunogenicity, and, regarding gene therapy and cell-based treatments, potential long-term protection from bleeding after a single treatment course.

While nanotubes have been employed in the fabrication of multiple sensors, little attention has previously been paid to how the nanotube density affects the biosensor performance. We conducted a systematic study of the effect of density on the performance of nanotube biosensors and discovered that this parameter is crucial to achieving consistently high performance. We found that devices with lower density offer higher sensitivity in terms of both detection limit and magnitude of response. The low density nanotube devices resulted in a detection limit of 1 pM in an electrolyte buffer containing high levels of electrolytes (ionic concentration ∼140 mM, matching the ionic strength of serum and plasma). Further investigation suggested that the enhanced sensitivity arises from the semiconductor-like behavior-strong gate dependence and lower capacitance-of the nanotube network at low density. Finally, we used the density-optimized nanotube biosensors to detect the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS virus and demonstrated improved detection limits under physiological conditions. Our results show that it is critical to carefully tune the nanotube density in order to fabricate sensitive and reliable devices.","Ishikawa, Fumiaki N; Curreli, Marco; Olson, C Anders; Liao, Hsiang-I; Sun, Ren; Roberts, Richard W; Cote, Richard J; Thompson, Mark E; Zhou, Chongwu",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/nn101198u; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21028792/,391

Despite this, most morbidly obese individuals maintain eucapnia. However, a subgroup of morbidly obese individuals will develop chronic daytime hypercapnia, described as the obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). While obesity is obviously a crucial component of this syndrome, the relationship between excess fat accumulation and the development of awake hypercapnia is complex and extends beyond simply impairments of pulmonary mechanics and lung volumes as a consequence of obesity. Various compensatory mechanisms operate to maintain eucapnia even in the presence of extreme obesity. However, if compensation is impaired, hypoventilation will ensue. While obesity alone does not account for the development of hypoventilation, weight loss will produce significant improvements in lung function and awake gas exchange. Such improvements have the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in these individuals. Nevertheless, many individuals remain overweight despite substantial weight loss, with persistence of upper airway obstruction. Attention to this residual abnormality is important given the high incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities, including pulmonary hypertension, in individuals with OHS.","Piper, Amanda J; Grunstein, Ronald R",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00713.2009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19875712/,391

However, not all pregnancies exposed to ZIKV result in an infant with apparent defects. During the 2015-2016 American outbreak of ZIKV, CZS rates varied by geographic location. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity in outcomes have not been well defined. Therefore, we sought to characterize and compare the pathogenic potential of multiple Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains in an established Ifnar1-/- pregnant mouse model. Here, we show significant differences in the rate of fetal demise following maternal inoculation with ZIKV strains from Puerto Rico, Panama, Mexico, Brazil, and Cambodia. Rates of fetal demise broadly correlated with maternal viremia but were independent of fetus and placenta virus titer, indicating that additional underlying factors contribute to fetus outcome. Our results, in concert with those from other studies, suggest that subtle differences in ZIKV strains may have important phenotypic impacts. With ZIKV now endemic in the Americas, greater emphasis needs to be placed on elucidating and understanding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to fetal outcome. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in 87 countries and territories around the globe. ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes including birth defects, microcephaly, neurological complications, and even spontaneous abortion. Rates of adverse fetal outcomes vary between regions, and not every pregnancy exposed to ZIKV results in birth defects. Not much is known about how or if the infecting ZIKV strain is linked to fetal outcomes. Our research provides evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity between Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains and provides insight into the underlying causes of adverse fetal outcomes. Understanding ZIKV strain-dependent pathogenic potential during pregnancy and elucidating underlying causes of diverse clinical sequelae observed during human infections is critical to understanding ZIKV on a global scale.","Bohm, Ellie K; Vangorder-Braid, Jennifer T; Jaeger, Anna S; Moriarty, Ryan V; Baczenas, John J; Bennett, Natalie C; O'Connor, Shelby L; Fritsch, Michael K; Fuhler, Nicole A; Noguchi, Kevin K; Aliota, Matthew T",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00818-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379510/,391

A statistical comparison between 114 patients of SILC and 201 patients of TLC was conducted during the same time period. The preoperative patient characteristics for SILC and TLC showed no statistical difference. In the operative result analysis, a significant disadvantage of SILC was the prolongation of operative time by only 15 minutes. The original SILC was as feasible and safe as TLC and virtually scarless cholecystectomy could be performed without any selection criteria.

92972,Considering the potential for an increase in chronic pain after the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND A wide variety of hemostats are available as adjunctive measures to improve hemostasis during surgical procedures if residual bleeding persists despite correct application of conventional methods for hemorrhage control. Some are considered active agents, since they contain fibrinogen and thrombin and actively participate at the end of the coagulation cascade to form a fibrin clot, whereas others to be effective require an intact coagulation system. The aim of this study is to provide an evidence-based approach to correctly select the available agents to help physicians to use the most appropriate hemostat according to the clinical setting, surgical problem and patient's coagulation status. METHODS The literature from 2000 to 2016 was systematically screened according to PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses] protocol. Sixty-six articles were reviewed by a panel of experts to assign grade of recommendation (GoR) and level of evidence (LoE) using the GRADE [Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation] system, and a national meeting was held. RESULTS Fibrin adhesives, in liquid form (fibrin glues) or with stiff collagen fleece (fibrin patch) are effective in the presence of spontaneous or drug-induced coagulation disorders. Mechanical hemostats should be preferred in patients who have an intact coagulation system. Sealants are effective, irrespective of patient's coagulation status, to improve control of residual oozing. Hemostatic dressings represent a valuable option in case of external hemorrhage at junctional sites or when tourniquets are impractical or ineffective. CONCLUSIONS Local hemostatic agents are dissimilar products with different indications. A knowledge of the properties of each single agent should be in the armamentarium of acute care surgeons in order to select the appropriate product in different clinical conditions.","Chiara, Osvaldo; Cimbanassi, Stefania; Bellanova, Giovanni; Chiarugi, Massimo; Mingoli, Andrea; Olivero, Giorgio; Ribaldi, Sergio; Tugnoli, Gregorio; Basilicò, Silvia; Bindi, Francesca; Briani, Laura; Renzi, Federica; Chirletti, Piero; Di Grezia, Giuseppe; Martino, Antonio; Marzaioli, Rinaldo; Noschese, Giuseppe; Portolani, Nazario; Ruscelli, Paolo; Zago, Mauro; Sgardello, Sebastian; Stagnitti, Franco; Miniello, Stefano",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-018-0398-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30157821/,391

However, risk factors and preventive measures for AL are not known sufficiently. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate risk factors associated with AL and to clarify strategies to prevent it. METHODS We analyzed a total of 296 cases with rectal cancer who had undergone laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique reconstruction at the National Cancer Center Hospital East. The relationship between AL and patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were retrospectively investigated. RESULTS There were 186 male and 110 female patients with a median age of 62. Overall, AL occurred in 24 cases (8.1%). Being a man, having an anal verge distance ≤7 cm, and undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were associated with an elevated risk for AL (P = 0.0005, 0.0034, and 0.0222, respectively). Neither an anal drainage tube nor diverting stoma creation correlated with incidence of AL. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being a man (odds ratio = 18.0; 95% confidence interval: 2.4-138) and having an anal verge distance ≤7 cm (odds ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-9.4) were significant risk factors. These two factors were present in 61 cases, including 14 who developed AL (23.0%). In this high-risk group, diverting stoma creation significantly reduced the occurrence of AL (P = 0.0363), but an anal drainage tube had no effect on incidence of AL (P = 0.3399). CONCLUSION We identified the high-risk population for AL after laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique reconstruction based on two factors. This will enable surgeons to appropriately recommend diverting stoma creation.","Hamabe, Atsushi; Ito, Masaaki; Nishigori, Hideaki; Nishizawa, Yuji; Sasaki, Takeshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230964/,391

Objective To determine whether low-intensity home-based walking exercise at a comfortable pace significantly improves walking ability in people with PAD vs high-intensity home-based walking exercise that induces ischemic leg symptoms and vs a nonexercise control. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 US centers and including 305 participants. Enrollment occurred between September 25, 2015, and December 11, 2019; final follow-up was October 7, 2020. Interventions Participants with PAD were randomized to low-intensity walking exercise (n = 116), high-intensity walking exercise (n = 124), or nonexercise control (n = 65) for 12 months. Both exercise groups were asked to walk for exercise in an unsupervised setting 5 times per week for up to 50 minutes per session wearing an accelerometer to document exercise intensity and time. The low-intensity group walked at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms. The high-intensity group walked at a pace eliciting moderate to severe ischemic leg symptoms. Accelerometer data were viewable to a coach who telephoned participants weekly for 12 months and helped them adhere to their prescribed exercise. The nonexercise control group received weekly educational telephone calls for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was mean change in 6-minute walk distance at 12 months (minimum clinically important difference, 8-20 m). Results Among 305 randomized patients (mean age, 69.3 [SD, 9.5] years, 146 [47.9%] women, 181 [59.3%] Black patients), 250 (82%) completed 12-month follow-up. The 6-minute walk distance changed from 332.1 m at baseline to 327.5 m at 12-month follow-up in the low-intensity exercise group (within-group mean change, -6.4 m [95% CI, -21.5 to 8.8 m]; P = .34) and from 338.1 m to 371.2 m in the high-intensity exercise group (within-group mean change, 34.5 m [95% CI, 20.1 to 48.9 m]; P < .001) and the mean change for the between-group comparison was -40.9 m (97.5% CI, -61.7 to -20.0 m; P < .001). The 6-minute walk distance changed from 328.1 m at baseline to 317.5 m at 12-month follow-up in the nonexercise control group (within-group mean change, -15.1 m [95% CI, -35.8 to 5.7 m]; P = .10), which was not significantly different from the change in the low-intensity exercise group (between-group mean change, 8.7 m [97.5% CI, -17.0 to 34.4 m]; P = .44). Of 184 serious adverse events, the event rate per participant was 0.64 in the low-intensity group, 0.65 in the high-intensity group, and 0.46 in the nonexercise control group. One serious adverse event in each exercise group was related to study participation. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with PAD, low-intensity home-based exercise was significantly less effective than high-intensity home-based exercise and was not significantly different from the nonexercise control for improving 6-minute walk distance. These results do not support the use of low-intensity home-based walking exercise for improving objectively measured walking performance in patients with PAD.

Multiplex fluorescent immunocytochemical (MF-ICC) assays are emerging as useful diagnostic tests in veterinary medicine, particularly for fluid samples. OBJECTIVE We aimed to develop and optimize an MF-ICC assay to detect feline coronavirus within macrophages, with the primary goal of determining the allowable/recommended sample storage conditions for clinical use of this assay. METHODS A feline macrophage cell line was infected with the FIP virus. Following harvest into EDTA tubes (simulating typical clinical collection of effusion), cells were stored at 4℃, 22℃, and 37℃. For each temperature condition, slides for MF-ICC were made at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days post-collection. To assess the stability of immunoreactivity following fixation, freshly harvested infected cells were fixed onto slides and maintained at 4℃ for 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks. All slides were analyzed by MF-ICC for the presence of mononuclear cells with co-expression of vimentin and coronaviral antigen. RESULTS MF-ICC confirmed that cells tested positive for coronavirus at 4℃ through 3 days post-harvest, 22℃ through 48 hours post-harvest, and 37℃ through 24 hours post-harvest. The MF-ICC assay was successfully performed on fixed slides through the 12-week time point. This assay also demonstrated positive results on a clinical sample of abdominal fluid from a cat later confirmed to have FIP.

102533,Seldom heard voices: a meta-narrative systematic review of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples healthcare experiences.,2020-12-14,"Many pain conditions in patients tend to co-occur, influencing the clinical expressions of each other in various ways. This paper summarizes the main concurrent pain conditions by analyzing the major interactions observed. In particular, co-occurrence will be examined in: visceral pain (especially ischemic heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, dysmenorrhea/endometriosis and urinary pain), fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain and headache. Two concurrent visceral pains from internal organs sharing at least part of their central sensory projection can give rise to viscero-visceral hyperalgesia, i.e., enhancement of typical pain symptoms from both districts. Visceral pain, headache and musculoskeletal pains (myofascial pain from trigger points, joint pain) can enhance pain and hyperalgesia from fibromyalgia. Myofascial pain from trigger points can perpetuate pain symptoms from visceral pain conditions and trigger migraine attacks when located in the referred pain area from an internal organ or in cervico-facial areas, respectively. The pathophysiology of these pain associations is complex and probably multifactorial; among the possible processes underlying the mutual influence of symptoms recorded in the associations is modulation of central sensitization phenomena by nociceptive inputs from one or the other condition. A strong message in these pain syndrome co-occurrence is that effective treatment of one of the conditions can also improve symptoms from the other, thus suggesting a systematic and thorough evaluation of the pain patient for a global effective management of his/her suffering.","Affaitati, Giannapia; Costantini, Raffaele; Tana, Claudio; Cipollone, Francesco; Giamberardino, Maria Adele",Journal of neural transmission,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-019-02107-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784821/,391
102850,"Response to ""The influence of teledermatology on healthcare access and equity"".",2020-12-23,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate changes in cuff pressure and position of tapered-cuff and cylindrical-cuff tracheal tubes (TTs) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy; to compare the frequency of endobronchial intubation and airway complaints with the two types of TT. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to intubation with a TT with a cylindrical cuff (group C) or a tapered cuff (group T). Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, O(2) and N(2)O after intubation. TT cuffs were inflated to 20 cm H(2)O; changes in cuff pressure and volume were measured up to 30 min after the start of N(2)O use. Distance between the TT tip and the carina was measured before and after pneumoperitoneum and position change. Frequency of sore throat, dysphagia and hoarseness in the two groups was recorded. RESULTS Cuff volume and pressure were significantly lower in group T than in group C (n = 32 per group). Cuff pressure and volume significantly increased 30 min after start of N(2)O use in both groups. Distance from the TT tip to the carina decreased during surgery in both groups. There were no cases of endobronchial intubation, and there were no between-group differences in the frequency of airway complaints. CONCLUSIONS The tapered cuff was associated with a smaller change in cuff pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than the cylindrical cuff, and therefore may be associated with increased preservation of tracheal mucosal perfusion.","Shin, Hye Won; Kim, Dong Hwan; Yoo, Hae Seun; Lee, Dong Kyu; Yoo, Young Dong; Lim, Choon Hak",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060515581670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116609/,391

All patients diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2015-2018 in six Dutch large teaching hospitals (Santeon network) were identified and followed-up from date of diagnosis until death or end of data collection. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from first-line (1L) pembrolizumab and second-line (2L) nivolumab were compared with clinical trial data by calculating hazard ratios (HRs). From 1950 diagnosed patients, 1005 (52%) started with any 1L treatment, of which 83 received pembrolizumab. Nivolumab was started as 2L treatment in 141 patients. For both settings, PFS times were comparable between real-world and trials (HR 1.08 (95% CI 0.75-1.55), and HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.14), respectively). OS was significantly shorter in real-world for 1L pembrolizumab (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.07-2.25). Receiving subsequent lines of treatment was less frequent in real-world compared to trials. There is no EE gap for PFS from immunotherapy in patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, there is a gap in OS for 1L pembrolizumab. Fewer patients proceeding to a subsequent line of treatment in real-world could partly explain this.","Cramer-van der Welle, Christine M; Verschueren, Marjon V; Tonn, Merel; Peters, Bas J M; Schramel, Franz M N H; Klungel, Olaf H; Groen, Harry J M; van de Garde, Ewoudt M W",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85696-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737641/,391

Relevant articles were searched in the databases of PubMED and PsycINFO. Articles were included if they measured BED, subclinical BED, binge eating and/or loss of control (LOC) eating in samples of up to 20 years of age or with a mean age below 20 years. Subclinical BED covers participants with < 4 OBEs but ≥ 1 OBE pr. month and studies measuring subclinical DSM-IV/DSM-5 BED, but where all criteria were not met. All study types and measuring methods were accepted, but studies were excluded if they did not assess and exclude cases of recurrent compensatory behaviors. Meta-analyses were used to obtain an overall estimate of the prevalence of BED and subclinical BED, while stratified meta-analyses were used to assess sources of heterogeneity. 39 studies measuring BED, subclinical BED and/or a low frequency of binge eating were included. Two meta-analyses resulted in an overall estimated prevalence of 1.32% BED and 3.0% subclinical BED in children and adolescents. The results were influenced by high heterogeneity. Potential sources to heterogeneity in the BED result were weight of participants and sample types as well as level of risk of bias in the included studies. BED seems to be as frequent in children and adolescents as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Hence, treatment of BED and BED symptoms in younger populations should be prioritized on the same terms as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.","Kjeldbjerg, Marie Lyngdrup; Clausen, Loa",European child & adolescent psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01850-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318368/,391

Thus, we investigated whether head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be detected by spraying EP-HMRG. METHODS Fluorescence imaging of 17 cases of HNSCCs resected using endoscopic or surgical resection was performed ex vivo after spraying EP-HMRG, and then the fluorescence intensity of the tumors and normal mucosa were measured. RESULTS Iodine-voiding lesions became fluorescent within a few minutes after the application of EP-HMRG in 12 resected tumors without a history of radiotherapy but this was not observed in the normal mucosa. Fluorescence intensity in tumor lesions was significantly higher than normal lesions. However, 5 other tumors that developed after radiotherapy did not have sufficient contrast against normal mucosa. CONCLUSION Fluorescence imaging with EP-HMRG would be useful for rapid detection of superficial HNSCC without a history of radiotherapy.","Mizushima, Takeshi; Ohnishi, Shunsuke; Shimizu, Yuichi; Hatanaka, Yutaka; Hatanaka, Kanako C; Kuriki, Yugo; Kamiya, Mako; Homma, Akihiro; Yamamoto, Keiko; Ono, Shouko; Urano, Yasuteru; Sakamoto, Naoya",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.25126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29509281/,391
104967,Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Cannabis Use in Cancer Patients.,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND The post-thrombotic syndrome frequently develops in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy. Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (hereafter ""pharmacomechanical thrombolysis"") rapidly removes thrombus and is hypothesized to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome. METHODS We randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis to receive either anticoagulation alone (control group) or anticoagulation plus pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting). The primary outcome was development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the post-thrombotic syndrome (47% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 48% in the control group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.11; P=0.56). Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led to more major bleeding events within 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3% of patients, P=0.049), but no significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism was seen over the 24-month follow-up period (12% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 8% in the control group, P=0.09). Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 18% of patients in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group versus 24% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P=0.04). Severity scores for the post-thrombotic syndrome were lower in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group than in the control group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up (P<0.01 for the comparison of the Villalta scores at each time point), but the improvement in quality of life from baseline to 24 months did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not result in a lower risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but did result in a higher risk of major bleeding.

METHOD Literature review through the Chinese CAJ full-text database. RESULTS The number of Chinese publications on mathematical modelling has at least quadrupled since the SARS epidemic in 2003. This increase not only included papers on SARS, but also on various other infectious diseases, indicating a substantial expansion of modelling experience in China. Typical problems of most studies were poor availability of data and lack of involvement of disease experts and decision-makers rendering the studies less useful for policies on control. CONCLUSIONS We expect that the recent experience on modelling and current better access to and exchange of epidemiological data have paved the way for a more substantial role of this discipline during possible future outbreaks of infectious diseases. By making Chinese modelling initiatives more visible to non-Chinese readers, we hope to attract more international collaborators.","Han, Xiao-Na; de Vlas, Sake J; Fang, Li-Qun; Feng, Dan; Cao, Wu-Chun; Habbema, J Dik F",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02244.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508434/,391

In this issue of the JCI, Ganatra et al. explored TB reactivation in the context of ART using TB and simian immunodeficiency virus-coinfected (TB/SIV-coinfected) nonhuman primates. The authors found that treating rhesus macaques with ART restored CD4+ T cells in whole blood, spleen, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not in the lung interstitium. TB risk was not decreased in the coinfected macaques treated with ART for 14-63 days, suggesting that ART does not decrease the short-term risk of reactivation. Reactivation occurred as CD4+ T cells were increasing, which is consistent with observations made in humans. This study provides a potential model for systematic evaluation of TB/SIV coinfection and different treatment regimens and strategies to prevent TB reactivation.","Sterling, Timothy R; Lin, Philana Ling",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci137294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831291/,391

The secondary aim is the evaluation of the impact of IVUS assistance in the procedural outcomes and long-term patency rates of carotid artery stenting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) during a 14-month period were evaluated prospectively. Thirty patients (50%) underwent IVUS assisted CAS, 30 patients (50%) underwent CAS using angiography as the unique diagnostic tool. All patients were enrolled through a primary duplex ultrasound evaluation; as a secondary evaluation, 54 patients (90%) underwent a preprocedural magnetic resonance angiography, whereas six patients (10%) underwent computed tomography-angiography. Patients with preocclusive stenoses (>85%) were excluded. Mean follow-up was 23 W 5.3 months. RESULTS No periprocedural or late complications were observed. No statistical significance was observed in long-term stent patency between the two groups. Mean procedural time length of IVUS-assisted procedures was 10.3 W 5 min longer than non-IVUS-assisted procedures. Virtual histology (VH) IVUS evaluation of plaque morphology led to a different stent choice in three patients. In two cases, the IVUS assessment revealed a suboptimal stent deployment, solved by angioplasty; in one patient VH-IVUS detected plaque protrusion through stent cells, immediately treated by manual aspiration. CONCLUSIONS Though not recommended as a routine intraprocedural evaluation, IVUS may be useful for a real-time CAS control when treating challenging plaques, such as 'soft' or lipidic ones or those prone to rupture, or whenever an intraprocedural morphologic evaluation is required for the appropriate stent choice, or when higher embolic risk is evaluated.","Chiocchi, Marcello; Morosetti, Daniele; Chiaravalloti, Antonio; Loreni, Giorgio; Gandini, Roberto; Simonetti, Giovanni",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0b013e32835898f1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292649/,391

A rapid, specific, sensitive, and practical method of detecting BVDV in bio-products is needed. The purpose of this study was to compare three assays with respect to their ability to accurately detect BVDV in biological samples, namely reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), SYBR green I-based real-time RT-PCR, and conventional RT-PCR. All assays detected BVDV nucleotide and differentiated between BVDV-free and -contaminated bovine sera successfully. In addition, the results were specific to BVDV: the amplification of samples containing the closely related classical swine fever virus or other pathogenic bovine viruses yielded negative results. The lowest detection threshold, 10(1) copies, was displayed by the SYBR green I-based real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assay. This assay was also the most effective in the detection of BVDV contamination in a set of commercially available bovine sera. The field conditions suggest that RT-LAMP is specific and sensitive to detecting BVDV in biological samples and may be used for quality control of biomaterials.","Zhang, Shu-Qin; Tan, Bin; Li, Peng; Wang, Feng-Xue; Guo, Li; Yang, Yong; Sun, Na; Zhu, Hong-Wei; Wen, Yong-Jun; Cheng, Shi-Peng",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.05.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25019170/,391

Results showed that AE could significantly improve the survival rate, increase the body weight and reduce the lung index of mice at the raw drug doses of 700 and 350 mg/kg. Histopathological observation results showed that the destruction degree of lung tissue structure in mice was significantly improved with the increase of AE dosage. Collagen deposition in lung interstitium was significantly reduced. The marker protein alpha-SMA involved in PF were significantly inhibited through repressing TGF-beta1/Smads pathway. The degree of inflammatory infiltration was significantly reduced and inflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited in mice through inhibiting the NF-kB-p65. Besides, oxidant stress level including upregulated ROS and down-regulated SOD and GSH was efficiently improved by AE through upregulation of Nrf2 and downregulation of NOX4.

Furthermore, we summarize studies assessing the feasibility of urinary NTproBNP levels as a non-invasive method to predict BPD in preterm infants. Multiple studies reported a strong association between NTproBNP serum levels and the onset of BPD. For urinary NTproBNP there is scarce evidence showing an association with BPD. Given the promising data obtained by preliminary studies, further assessment of this biomarker in both serum and urine is needed.

METHODS Electrogastrography (EGG), abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and bowel sound/acoustics (AC) monitoring were used simultaneously to obtain physiologic measures of the gastrointestinal system of 18 preterm and 5 term neonates who were tolerating enteral feedings. Measures of EGG slow wave voltage (EGG dominant power) and AC signal amplitude (AC dominant power) were obtained after spectral density analysis. Mean abdominal regional saturations (A-rSO2) were obtained directly from NIRS. The relationship of these 3 measures with postmenstrual age (PMA) was assessed. RESULTS The results of the 3 methods differed depending on whether the measurements were pre- or postprandial. Postprandial EGG dominant power increases with PMA (r = 0.67, P = 0.003), both pre- and postprandial abdominal NIRS mean regional saturation increase with PMA (r = 0.73, P < 0.001 and r = 0.55, P = 0.009), and postprandial AC dominant power (at 300-500 Hz) increases with PMA (r = -0.48, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS EGG, abdominal NIRS, and AC, whenever used simultaneously, can provide objective and synergistic measures that correlate with PMA. These findings may be helpful in the assessment of feeding readiness because they reveal quantitative measures suggestive of the developmental process of the gut.","Ortigoza, Eric B; Cagle, Jackson; Chien, Jui-Hong; Oh, Sungho; Brown, Larry Steven; Neu, Josef",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000001867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287010/,391
109396,Neurofilament Light Chain-It Is Not Just About Concussions.,2020-07-01,"Proteins and their mimics that contain negatively charged sequences are important in natural and biomimetic mineralization. The mechanism by which these sequences affect calcium phosphate mineralization is not well understood. Here, peptides containing different numbers of repeat units of contiguous glutamic acid residues, oligo(L-glutamic acid)n (n = 3, 7, 8, 10), were investigated with regards to the mechanism in delaying the crystallization of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) while holding the amount of carboxylic acid groups in solution constant. Increasing peptide chain length increases the stability of ACP at a certain total amount of carboxylic acid groups in solution. This effect is shown to be due to stronger binding as well as binding to more calcium ions per peptide by the longer oligopeptides compared to the shorter ones. It is proposed that these associations delay the structural rearrangement of calcium ions and the dehydration of ACP, which are required for the crystallization of hydroxyapatite. The initial nucleation and the local structure of ACP, however, do not vary with chain length. This second part of a two-part series provides an improved mechanistic understanding of how organic additives, especially those with contiguous acidic amino acid sequences, modulate the kinetics of calcium phosphate precipitation and phase transformation.","Ustriyana, Putu; Michel, F Marc; Wilson, Michael C; Harmon, Emma; Chen, Jiahui; Liu, Tianbo; Sahai, Nita",The journal of physical chemistry.

Structural stigma in this context relates to institutional policies, cultural norms, and organizational practices that limit consumers' access to health services, quality of care, and capacity to achieve optimal health and well-being. BPD is a serious mental illness with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotional and behavioral deregulation, which stem from significant traumatic childhood/life events, and/or biological etiologies. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore the international literature on structural stigma in healthcare systems specific to BPD, and to provide an overview of the impact of structural stigma on health services for BPD consumers and their carers/families. METHODS This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review guidelines. We will search the following electronic databases (from inception onwards): MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and JBI-Evidence databases. Grey literature will be identified through the Google search engine. We will include all types of literature in English, published and unpublished, including any study design, reviews, clinical practice guidelines, policy reports, and other documents. No restrictions on publication date of sources of evidence will be applied. International literature should examine structural stigma associated with BPD in any healthcare setting such as, outpatients, inpatients, primary health care, or community-based facilities. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and full-text citations. Quality appraisal of the included sources of evidence will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018 version. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., thematic analysis) methods. DISCUSSION This review is anticipated to enhance both identification and understanding of those structures in health systems (i.e., institutional policies, cultural norms, and practices) that manifest and perpetuate stigma experienced by consumers with BPD and their carers/families. The findings can be used to inform future research, policy, and practice relating to stigma reduction strategies that can be adopted to improve the provision of BPD-responsive services and care for this population.

112642,What is QOL in children and adolescents with physical disabilities? A thematic synthesis of pediatric QOL literature.,2021-02-07,"the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in December 2019 and still remains a major global health issue. Every country in the world has adopted drastic measures to contain the virus, although their stringency varies among countries, ranging from increased surveillance and focused interventions to strict lockdown (1). Italy was the second country where the disease had a major impact early in the pandemic, such that a strict nationwide lockdown was declared from March 9 to May 3, 2020. Nonetheless, between January and May 2020, there were 210,000 COVID-19 cases in Italy and 29,000 deaths were recorded (2). Due to the lockdown, universities (and in general all educational services) shifted to online classes, with students attending lessons and taking their exams from home. On-site activities were reduced to those considered indispensable. Research activities also had to be modified, such as by the adoption of a smart-working model (3). Between May and August 2020, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Italy decreased. In response, the lockdown was loosened and some activities were restarted, albeit with specific safety protocols (social distancing, use of masks, temperature checks at the workplace entry, environmental disinfection, mixed models of smart and in-office work). These actions were accompanied by periodic serological and PCR screening tests (4).","Cupertino, F; Spataro, S; Spinelli, G; Schirinzi, A; Bianchi, F P; Stefanizzi, P; Di Serio, F; Tafuri, S",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570091/,391

METHODS This was a retrospective comparative study. We measured the time necessary for the graft surface to be completely vascularized, as well as the fornix depth of the conjunctival sac in anophthalmic patients. RESULTS Ten patients underwent Permacol graft reconstruction, with 44 undergoing buccal mucosal graft reconstruction. Seven eyelids (70%) in the Permacol group had a good outcome, with improvement in lower eyelid position and prosthesis retention. Nine out of 10 eyelids (90%) in this group showed complete vascularization of the graft at 2.6 ± 1.9 months postoperatively, while the grafted buccal mucosa was fully vascularized at 1.1 ± 0.3 months postoperatively (p < 0.01). Postoperative fornix depth in the Permacol group was 9.1 ± 2.2 mm, compared to 14.9 ± 4.5 mm in the buccal mucosal graft group (p < 0.01). Mean increases in fornix depth were 33.1% and 67.9% of the mean vertical length of the implanted graft. CONCLUSIONS The Permacol graft can be useful as spacer graft material in anophthalmic socket patients. It takes longer to vascularize, and undergoes greater graft shrinkage with time, compared to the buccal mucosal graft.","Teo, Livia; Woo, Young Jun; Kim, Dong Kyu; Kim, Chang Yeom; Yoon, Jin Sook",Korean journal of ophthalmology : KJO,https://doi.org/10.3341/kjo.2017.31.1.9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28243018/,391

It is largely underdiagnosed, and a high index of suspicion is required for any patient with unexplained portal hypertension. The understanding of its etiology and pathology is improving with advances in diagnostic techniques. Recent studies reported an identifiable etiology in > 80% of cases. Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is the most common etiology, and genetic studies help in diagnosing latent MPN. Better cross-sectional imaging helps delineate the site of obstruction accurately. The majority of BCS patients are now treated by endovascular intervention and anticoagulation which have improved survival in this disease. Angioplasty of hepatic veins/inferior vena cava remains under-utilized at present. While surgical porto-systemic shunts are no longer done for BCS, liver transplantation is reserved for select indications. Some of the unresolved issues in the current management of BCS are also discussed in this review.","Sharma, A; Keshava, S N; Eapen, A; Elias, E; Eapen, C E",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06485-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691382/,391

113847,Non-Pharmacological Interventions in Osteosarcopenia: A Systematic Review.,2021,"OBJECT Flow diverter (FD) stents are relatively new and important devices in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The Flow Re-Direction Endoluminal Device has been recently released for clinical use. The authors' aim in this paper is to report their initial single-center FRED experience with short-term results. METHODS Between February 2012 and May 2013, 33 patients with 37 aneurysms (35 unruptured and 2 previously ruptured aneurysms) were treated with the FRED. Clinical and radiological data of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS In all patients only 1 device was used without any additional device or material, such as a stent or coil. All procedures were successfully performed. The procedural complication rate was 3% (1 of 33). Thirty patients underwent clinical and radiological follow-up. During the follow-up period, changes in stent morphology, such as ""fish mouth"" and ""foreshortening"" phenomena, occurred in 5 patients. The mortality and permanent morbidity rates were 0%. The complete occlusion rates were 32% (6 of 19) at 0-1 month, 67% (8 of 12) at 2-3 months, 80% (4 of 5) at 4-6 months, and 100% (8 of 8) at 7-12 months. The rates for some aneurysms were assessed at more than one time point. CONCLUSIONS The FRED has an ability to serve neurointerventionalists in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms with its different technical advantages. The occlusion rates with FRED are similar to those with other FD devices. However, these short-term results need to be confirmed with mid- and long-term follow-up results of multicenter large series.","Kocer, Naci; Islak, Civan; Kizilkilic, Osman; Kocak, Burak; Saglam, Muzaffer; Tureci, Ercan",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.1.jns131442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628615/,391

This study aimed at evaluating antiepileptic drug entry into developing brain. Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, within clinical range. Injectate included 3H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult and was dose-dependent except at E19; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and 3H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain. Entry of lamotrigine was little different at different ages and was not dose dependent.","Toll, Samuel J; Qiu, Fiona; Huang, Yifan; Habgood, Mark D; Dziegielewska, Katarzyna M; Nie, Shuai; Saunders, Norman R",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52607.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249340/,391

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 153 patients who underwent TLH for benign, premalignant, or malignant conditions between August 2010 and June 2013. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to BMI, and the following variables were analyzed: operation time, conversion rate, blood loss, total complications, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The mean BMI was 33.5 kg/m(2) (range, 22-61). Forty-four patients were non-obese (BMI <30), 73 were obese (30≤ BMI <40), and 36 were morbidly obese (BMI ≥40). In 138 patients (90.2%), hysterectomy was performed using an endoscopic technique. The rate of conversion to laparotomy (9.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.1-14.5), blood loss (70.5 ml; range, 10-700), total complications (5.9%), and length of hospital stay (2.9 d; range, 1-8) did not vary according to BMI. Operation time was longer in obese (p = 0.003) and morbidly obese (0.002) patients than in non-obese patients. CONCLUSION TLH could be considered a safe and feasible alternative to abdominal hysterectomy in obese and morbidly obese patients.","Guraslan, Hakan; Senturk, Mehmet Baki; Dogan, Keziban; Guraslan, Birgul; Babaoglu, Bulent; Yasar, Levent",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000367658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25660528/,391

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to characterize the design and rapid implementation of a complex, multimodal, technology response to COVID-19 led by the Intermountain Healthcare's (Intermountain's) Care Transformation Information Systems (CTIS) organization to build pandemic surge capacity. METHODS Intermountain has active community-spread cases of COVID-19 that are increasing. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pandemic Intervals Framework (the Framework) to characterize CTIS leadership's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 at Intermountain. We provide results on implementation feasibility and sustainability of health information technology (HIT) interventions as of June 30, 2020, characterize lessons learned and identify persistent barriers to sustained deployment. RESULTS We characterize the CTIS organization's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 in five relevant areas of the Framework enabling (1) incident management, (2) surveillance, (3) laboratory testing, (4) community mitigation, and (5) medical care and countermeasures. We are seeing increased use of traditionally slow-to-adopt technologies that create additional surge capacity while sustaining patient safety and care quality. CTIS leadership recognized early that a multimodal technology intervention could enable additional surge capacity for health care delivery systems with a broad geographic and service scope. A statewide central tracking system to coordinate capacity planning and management response is needed. Order interoperability between health care systems remains a barrier to an integrated response. CONCLUSION The rate of future pandemics is estimated to increase. The pandemic response of health care systems, like Intermountain, offers a blueprint for the leadership role that HIT organizations can play in mainstream care delivery, enabling a nimbler, virtual health care delivery system that is more responsive to current and future needs.","Knighton, Andrew J; Ranade-Kharkar, Pallavi; Brunisholz, Kimberly D; Wolfe, Douglas; Allen, Lauren; Belnap, Thomas W; Moores Todd, Tamara; Srivastava, Rajendu; Kapsandoy, Seraphine; Ize-Ludlow, Diego; Allen, Todd L",Applied clinical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327036/,391

The DFB-encapsulated gelatin hydrogels with different stiffnesses, GH-soft (1.1 kPa) and GH-hard (6.2 kPa), were prepared by controlling the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations. The GH-soft hydrogel was capable of facilitating the proliferation of DFBs and the synthesis of extracellular components, as compared to GH-hard hydrogels. In addition, the subcutaneously injected GH-soft hydrogel with bioluminescent reporter cells provided enhanced cell survival and local retention over 14 days. In vivo transplantation of DFB-encapsulated GH-soft hydrogels accelerated wound contraction, and promoted collagen deposition and neovascularization within the incisions performed on mice skin. Therefore, we expect that HRP-catalyzed in situ forming gelatin hydrogels can be useful for local delivery of cells with high viability in wounds, which holds great promise for advancing wound healing technologies and other tissue engineering applications.","Lee, Yunki; Bae, Jin Woo; Lee, Jin Woo; Suh, Wonhee; Park, Ki Dong",Journal of materials chemistry.

Our data indicate that FBS blocks HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The infectivity of HCV diluted in the RHMNB solution was more susceptible to the addition of FBS than that diluted in the cDMEM solution. In addition, FBS-mediated blocking of HCV infection occurred at the step of virus attachment to the target cells, suggesting that FBS contains factors that interfere with the early steps in HCV infection.","Qin, Zhao-ling; Ju, He-peng; Liu, Yuan; Gao, Ting-ting; Wang, Wen-bo; Aurelian, Laure; Zhao, Ping; Qi, Zhong-tian",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.06.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845899/,391

This is essential to support the care of people at the end of their lives or who are critically ill from COVID-19 or other life-limiting illnesses. Palliative care (PC) is centred on effective symptom control, promotion of quality of life, complex decision-making, and holistic care of physical, psychological, social and spiritual health. It is ideally placed to both provide and contribute to care for patients, families, communities and colleagues during the pandemic. Where recovery is uncertain, emphasis should be on care and relief of suffering, as well as survival. Where healthcare resources and facilities come under intense pressure, lessons can be learnt from models of care in other settings around the world. This article explores how the field can contribute by ensuring that PC principles and practices are woven into everyday healthcare practice.

One common approach to restoring or augmenting this impairment is the use of external electrical stimulation of the muscles, called functional electrical stimulation (FES). Typically targeted directly at the anatomical muscle belly, existing methodologies often involve high current amplitudes, limited superficial muscle activation, and early onset of muscle fatigue. We have recently explored the capabilities of a non-invasive peripheral nerve stimulation method for the dexterous control of finger and hand muscles. Further development of our stimulation system has enabled us to manually search across a variety of stimulation locations with increased consistency and efficiency. This study examined the preliminary results in two subjects of an automated stimulation system which can rapidly characterize a large combination of stimulation electrodes. Our preliminary findings suggested that the stimulation grid was able to produce a number of clustered EMG activities and finger forces.

125954,The burden of disease of idiopathic/genetic generalized epilepsy - A nationwide online survey.,2021-08-17,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for family caregivers of children with developmental disabilities (DD). The purpose of this study was to conduct a 6-month follow-up on the experiences of caregiver burden and psychological distress among caregivers of children with autism (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during COVID-19 pandemic, compare their experiences to caregivers of children without DD, and test the interaction between opportunities for self-care and caregiver burden and psychological distress. Results indicated caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD continued to report significantly higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden compared to caregivers of children without DD. Counter to study hypotheses decreased opportunities to engage in self-care as a result of the pandemic predicted higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden for caregivers of children without DD, whereas only caregiver burden was moderated by self-care for caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to negatively impact the psychological health of family caregivers of school-age children. In general, greater challenges are presented for caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD, but they seem to be more resilient to some COVID-19 challenges than caregivers of children without DD.","Iovino, Emily A; Caemmerer, Jacqueline; Chafouleas, Sandra M",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964709/,391

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 40 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy and 20 patients who underwent hysterectomy via natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Patients' age, body mass index, history of previous delivery and surgery, total operation time (from skin incision to closure), intraoperative and postoperative complications conversion to another surgical procedure, drop of hemoglobin level, postoperative pain at 1 and 18 h, average hospital stay, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Hysterectomy via transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery was superior to single-port hysterectomy concerning the length of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and visual analog scale at 1 h (p = 0.024) and 18 h (p < 0.001). In transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic group, postoperative complications were lower than single-port laparoscopy group (p = 0.023). In transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopy, group conversion to a standard vaginal hysterectomy occurred in two cases (10%). Four patients in the single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy group had umbilical herniation, three had port-site infections, and two patients had vaginal cuff hematoma. These patients required rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Despite hysterectomy via transvaginal natural orifice transluminal surgery has not yet found its place in routine practice in gynecology departments, it could be a prominent alternative approach to other minimally invasive surgical procedures in selected patients with many advantages including lesser pain and lower complication rates compared with single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy.","Basol, Gulfem; Cora, Ayfer Ozer; Gundogdu, Elif Cansu; Mat, Emre; Yildiz, Gazi; Kuru, Betul; Uzun, Navdar Dogus; Uzel, Kemine; Usta, Taner; Kale, Ahmet",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196084/,391

Suddenly, the medical community, and those who finance the health care sector, realized that telemedicine and telepresence are applicable, desirable, acceptable, and much sought after by our patients and we can manage just about every disease and condition. Although, by and large, telemedicine has faced challenges and perhaps some resistance, despite its great potential, it has become evident that telemedicine can provide rapid, safe, and high-quality care remotely during this pandemic, the largest one since 1918. Perhaps one benefit of suffering through the COVID-19 pandemic will be the establishment of a new virtual medical world order, and that telemedicine has taken its deserving place in health care: prime time and a center stage.","Latifi, Rifat; Doarn, Charles R",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408804/,391

To avoid non specific modification of CR2 and the potential for modifying lysine residues critical to the CR2/C3d contact surface, we engineered a new protein, recombinant CR2 (rCR2), to include the C-terminal sequence VFPLECHHHHHH, a hexahistidine tag (for site-specific radiolabeling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+)). The protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. To test the function of the recombinant CR2, binding to C3d was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The function was further confirmed by binding of rCR2 to C3d(+) red blood cells (RBC) which were generated by deposition of human or rat C3d and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The affinity of rCR2 for C3d(+), in presence of 150 mM NaCl, was measured using surface plasma resonance giving rise to a K(D)≈500 nM. Radiolabeling of rCR2 or an inactive mutant of rCR2 (K41E CR2) or an unrelated protein of a similar size (C2A) with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+) at gave radiochemical yields >95%. Site-specifically radiolabeled rCR2 bound to C3d to C3d(+) RBC. Binding of radiolabeled rCR2 to C3d was inhibited by anti-C3d and the radiolabeled inactive mutant K41E CR2 and C2A did not bind to C3d(+) RBCs. We conclude that rCR2-Tc(99m) has excellent radiolabeling, stability and C3d binding characteristics and warrants in vivo evaluation as an activated complement imaging agent.","Badar, Adam; DeFreitas, Sarah; McDonnell, James M; Yahya, Norhakim; Thakor, David; Razavi, Reza; Smith, Richard; Sacks, Steven; Mullen, Gregory E D",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21494666/,391

The ability to mediate the assembly of such charged nanoparticles using structurally simple small molecules would greatly facilitate the fabrication of nanostructured materials and harnessing their applications in catalysis, sensing and photonics. Here we show that small molecules with as few as three electric charges can effectively induce attractive interactions between oppositely charged nanoparticles in water. These interactions can guide the assembly of charged nanoparticles into colloidal crystals of a quality previously only thought to result from their co-crystallization with oppositely charged nanoparticles of a similar size. Transient nanoparticle assemblies can be generated using positively charged nanoparticles and multiply charged anions that are enzymatically hydrolysed into mono- and/or dianions. Our findings demonstrate an approach for the facile fabrication, manipulation and further investigation of static and dynamic nanostructured materials in aqueous environments.","Bian, Tong; Gardin, Andrea; Gemen, Julius; Houben, Lothar; Perego, Claudio; Lee, Byeongdu; Elad, Nadav; Chu, Zonglin; Pavan, Giovanni M; Klajn, Rafal",Nature chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-021-00752-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489564/,391

Methods: A joint investigation team of emergency response for COVID-19 epidemic by CDC professional workers of Liaocheng city and district at two levels on January 30, 2020. According to a indicator case from ZH supermarkets, close contacts and related subjects were tracked and screened on February 1, including ZH supermarket employees, family members having contact history with related cases during January 13-26, supermarket clients during January 16-30 and family members of related cases. an epidemiological investigation was carried on and their swab of nose /throat were collected and were sent to Liaocheng CDC laboratory, real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2. Results: a total of 8 437 people were screened during January 30 to February 9, 2020 (120 employees of supermarket, 93 family members, and 8224 clients of supermarket). The epidemic was caused by ZH cases and brought clustered cases in four families. A total 25 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the total infection rate of subjects was 0.30% (25/8 437) with 22 confirmed cases (0.26%, 22/8 437) and 3 asymptomatic patients (0.04%, 3/8 437), asymptomatic patients accounted for 12.00% (3/25) of all infection cases. The infection rates of supermarket employees, family members of confirmed cases and supermarket clients were 9.17% (11/120), 12.90% (12/93) and 0.02% (2/8 224).

We examined the long-term efficacy and safety of nivolumab in these patients treated for up to 5 years. METHODS Patients with squamous (N = 35) or non-squamous (N = 76) non-small cell lung cancer received nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) until disease progression/death. Overall survival and progression-free survival were assessed at 5 years after starting treatment in separate and pooled analyses. Safety was evaluated in terms of treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS A total of 17 patients were alive at the database lock (26 July 2019). The median overall survival (95% confidence interval) and 5-year survival rate were 16.3 (12.4-25.2) months and 14.3% in squamous patients, 17.1 (13.3-23.0) months and 19.4% in non-squamous patients and 17.1 (14.2-20.6) months and 17.8% in the pooled analysis, respectively. Programmed death ligand-1 expression tended to be greater among 5-year survivors than in non-survivors (P = 0.0703). Overall survival prolonged with increasing programmed death ligand-1 expression, with 5-year survival rates of 11.8, 21.8 and 41.7% in patients with programmed death ligand-1 expression of <1, ≥1-<50 and ≥50%, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events in ≥10% of patients (pooled analysis) included rash (15.3%), malaise (14.4%), decreased appetite (14.4%), pyrexia (14.4%) and nausea (10.8%).

We determined the outcome of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), an alternative to CEA, in the setting of CCO through an independent analysis of imaging and clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS Medical records of 26 consecutive patients with CCO who underwent CAS by a single operator using the same procedural protocol (with distal protection and closed-cell stents) were retrospectively evaluated. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores before and after CAS, periprocedural complications, and the restenosis rate were analyzed by independent stroke neurologists who were not involved in the care of the patients. RESULTS The median mRS score for the 26 patients was 1 (range 0-5) before and after CAS. All of the patients underwent clinical and imaging follow-up (mean 19.5 ± 14.3 and 11.6 ± 11.2 months, respectively). Thirty-day mortality/permanent morbidity rates were 0 %. One patient had hyperperfusion syndrome and was managed medically without sequelae; however, he had stent occlusion after 30 days, resulting in a decline in his mRS from 4 (preprocedure) to 5. Otherwise, there was no decline in mRS during the post-discharge follow-up. CONCLUSION According to an independent analysis of this single-operator series, CAS is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with CCO.","Peker, Ahmet; Sorgun, Mine Hayriye; Isikay, Canan Togay; Arsava, Ethem Murat; Topcuoglu, Mehmet Akif; Arat, Anil",Japanese journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-016-0554-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27230906/,391

Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to identify factors associated with a false-positive test.Results: After first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at 0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days. In samples from Baltimore, sensitivity was: 39% (95% CI 30, 49) 0-7 days; 86% (95% CI 79,92) 8-14 days; and 100% (95% CI 89,100) 15 days post positive PCR. The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 97.5,95.2) in Ugandan samples was significantly lower than samples from Baltimore 99.3% (95% CI 98.1,99.8), p<0.01. In Ugandan samples, individuals with a false positive result were more likely to be male (PR 2.04, 95% CI 1.03,3.69) or individuals who had a fever more than a month prior to sample acquisition (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12,7.35).Conclusions: Sensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore. The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples. False positive results in Ugandan samples appear to correlate with a recent history of a febrile illness, potentially indicative of a cross-reactive immune response in individuals from East Africa.","Baker, Owen R; Grabowski, M Kate; Galiwango, Ronald M; Nalumansi, Aminah; Serwanga, Jennifer; Clarke, William; Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang; Rothman, Richard E; Fernandez, Reinaldo E; Serwadda, David; Kagaayi, Joseph; Lutalo, Tom; Reynolds, Steven J; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Quinn, Thomas C; Laeyendecker, Oliver",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00837-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903166/,391
135772,Pediatric Emergency Department Visits at US Children's Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-23,"Severe financial crises could influence a country's suicide trends and characteristics. We aimed to highlight differences among suicide completers before and after the onset of Greece's serious debt crisis of 2010 based exclusively on forensic data. The sample's size permitted a further elaboration by means of a time series analysis too. Data were collected from the Piraeus Department of Forensic Medicine for the period 1992-2016. We extracted information on sociodemographic parameters, psychiatric medication and alcohol intake, suicide method, place and month of suicide. The ""after crisis onset"" group (2011-2016) was significantly older (p = 0.039)-primarily due to differences in the 55-64 age group-, had more frequently used psychiatric medications (p < 0.001), less often alcohol (p = 0.001) and died more frequently by immolation (p = 0.001). These differences were-almost exclusively-due to changes regarding male suicidal behavior. Time series analysis indicates that no strong increasing trend in total (male + female) suicide count can be observed, despite a local increase in 2009-2010. Antidepressant-positive suicides show an increase after 2010, whereas alcohol-positive suicides show a decrease. Future predicted forecasts for antidepressant-positive suicides indicate a decrease (from 5.6 per year in 2018 to 4.3 per year in 2025) whereas an increase is predicted in alcohol-positive suicides (7.7 per year in 2017, 9.36 per year in 2025). Middle-aged men, compared to middle-aged women, presumably found it harder to adjust to economic hardship after the crisis onset. Finally, comparatively more men than women who died by suicide appear to have started and/or complied with psychiatric treatment after 2010.","Paraschakis, Antonios; Karageorgiou, Vasilios; Efstathiou, Vasiliki; Douzenis, Athanassios; Boyokas, Ilias; Michopoulos, Ioannis",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01939-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803401/,391

DESIGN Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. CONCLUSION Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes. While addressing the social determinants of health (e.g. income, education, medical trust) would be an effective path by which to diminish health disparities related to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations.

Overall, most daily time was spent in sedentary activities (614 ± 111 min or 69.1%) and light PA (181 ± 56 min or 20.2%). On average, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was performed during 10.6% of the day (93 ± 44 min). Time spent in MVPA was significantly higher in the NW compared to OB category (112.8 ± 51.5 vs. 81.0 ± 36.3; p = .021). The overweight group did not differ in time spent in MVPA when compared to NW and OB group. Overall, 75% of the participants spent more than 60 min a day in MVPA (NW: 83%; overweight: 81%; OB: 67%). Pearson's correlation between body mass index and total MVPA controlling for age was -.39 (p < .001). It was concluded that Mozambican older adult women living in urban and rural areas of Maputo province engaged in relatively high Physical Activity Intensities compared with individuals of similar ages in high-income countries, regardless of their nutritional status.","Daca, Timóteo; Prista, António; Tchonga, Francisco; Crochemore-Silva, Inacio; Reichert, Felipe F; Farinatti, Paulo; Tani, Go",Journal of aging and physical activity,https://doi.org/10.1123/japa.2019-0182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723929/,391

We report a unique renal neoplasm in a 66 year-old woman that initially mimicked MITF family translocation RCC due to mixed clear and eosinophilic cells, extensive stromal hyalinization, and psammoma bodies, yet which was negative for TFE3 and TFEB fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a next generation sequencing (NGS) gene fusion assay. Cytoplasmic stippling triggered consideration of TSC-associated neoplasms, and a targeted next generation sequencing assay revealed a variant in exon 21 of TSC1 resulting in c.2626G > T p.(Glu876*) truncating mutation. This report adds to the morphologic spectrum of TSC-related renal neoplasms, including prominent stromal hyalinization as a potentially deceptive pattern. Due to the overlap in cytoplasmic stippling between eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC and HOT / RCC with eosinophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm, it is debatable which category this example would best fit. Further understanding of these entities and other renal neoplasms with alterations in the TSC genes will elucidate whether they should be considered a family of tumors.

The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) may help in identification of germline mutations in genes involved in a common etiology for both tumors thus allowing a common effective therapeutic strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We describe the unexpected positive results obtained in a young woman with relapsed chemo-resistant stage IVB cervical and synchronous stage IV lung cancer, who underwent an interdisciplinary approach including palliative surgery with laparoscopic total pelvic exenteratio followed by a chemo-immunotherapy protocol with the anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody nivolumab plus metronomic cyclophosphamide. The treatment choice was based on tumor PD-Ligand 1 assessment and NGS analysis for the identification of potential treatment targets. Outcomes included tumor objective response and patient-centered outcomes (pain, performance status and overall quality of life). RESULTS Laparoscopic surgery obtained an immediate symptom control and allowed the early start of medical treatment. One month after combined therapy start the patient achieved a significant improvement in performance status, pain, overall Quality of life and after 3 months she resumed working. After 3 and 6 months of treatment we observed an objective dimensional and metabolic response. Currently, after 24 months (and 48 cycles of nivolumab) the patient is continuing to benefit from treatment: she is in complete remission, with good performance status and she is working and leading a self-dependent life. CONCLUSION Our study strongly affirms the efficacy of an interdisciplinary approach including surgical and innovative medical strategies based on immunotherapy in patients with advanced chemo-resistant synchronous cervical and lung cancer. The present findings support the use of NGS to drive a targeted rational treatment especially in heavily pre-treated patients.","Madeddu, Clelia; Kotsonis, Paraskevas; Lavra, Fabrizio; Chiappe, Giacomo; Melis, Luca; Mura, Ester; Scartozzi, Mario; Macciò, Antonio",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.26769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007844/,391

However, no large, multi-institutional study exists, which examines the role of nurses in trauma patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of nurses on trauma patient satisfaction. METHODS This retrospective, descriptive study of Level I-IV trauma centers in a multistate hospital system evaluated patients 18 years and older admitted with at least an overnight stay. Data were obtained electronically for patients discharged in 2018-2019 who returned an HCAHPS survey. Surveys were linked by an honest broker to demographic and injury data from the trauma registry, and then anonymized prior to analysis. Patients were categorized as ""trauma"" per the National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS) definition or as ""medical"" or ""surgical"" per the HCAHPS definition. RESULTS Of 112,283 surveys from 89 trauma centers, ""trauma"" patients (n = 5,126) comprised 4.6%, ""surgical"" 39.0% (n = 43,763), and ""medical"" 56.5% (n = 63,394). Nurses had an overwhelming impact on ""trauma"" patient satisfaction, accounting for 63.9% (p < .001) of the variation (adjusted R2) in the overall score awarded the institution-larger than for ""surgery"" (59.6%; p < .001) or ""medical"" (58.4%; p < .001) patients. The most important individual domain contributor to the overall rating of a facility was ""nursing communication.""

150760,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: No Survivors.,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND Cerebral hypoxia may occur during surgery but currently used cerebral oxygenation saturation (rSO2) monitors remain controversial with respect to improving clinical outcome. Novel neuroprotein biomarkers are potentially released into systemic circulation and combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could clarify the presence of per-operative cerebral hypoxia. We investigated changes to serum-neuroprotein concentrations postsurgically, paired with NIRS and cognitive outcome, in patients operated in the beach chair position (BCP). METHODS A prospective cohort in 28 shoulder surgery patients placed in the BCP. Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia, and 2 hours and 3-5 days postoperatively. We analysed blood-levels of biomarkers including tau and neurofilament light (NFL). We post hoc assessed the cross-wise relationship between biomarker levels and postsurgical changes in cognitive function and intraoperatively monitored rSO2 from NIRS. RESULTS Serum-NFL decreased from 24.2 pg/mL to 21.5 (P=0.02) 2 hours postoperatively, then increased to 27.7 pg/mL on day 3-5 (P=0.03). Conversely, s-tau increased from 0.77 pg/mL to 0.98 (2 h), then decreased to 0.81 on day 3-5 (P=0.08). In 14/28 patients, episodic rSO2 below 55% occurred, and the duration <55% was correlated to change in s-tau (P<0.05). The cognitive function z-score at 1 week and 3 mo. correlated to the change in tau (P=0.01), but not to NFL. CONCLUSION Some biomarkers were significantly changed with surgery in the beach chair position. The change was at some points associated to postoperative cognitive decline, and to intraoperative low rSO2.

To reduce this risk, a riboflavin-and-UV-light-based pathogen reduction process was evaluated against eight viral agents. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Riboflavin and UV light was evaluated against the following eight viral agents: encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A (FLUAV), La Crosse virus (LACV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), sindbis virus (SINV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Before treatment, a sample was removed to determine the product's initial viral load. After treatment the product's viral load was reevaluated and the log reduction was calculated. RESULTS Virus reduction after treatment with riboflavin and UV light is equivalent in platelet (PLT) and plasma units, as demonstrated by a 3.2-log reduction of EMC in plasma, PLTs, and PLT additive solution containing 35% plasma. Additionally, the following viral reductions values were observed: HAV 1.8 log, HCV at least 4.1 log, FLUAV at least 5.0 log, LACV at least 3.5 log, PRV 2.5 log, SINV 3.2 log, and VSV at least 6.3 log. CONCLUSIONS The results observed in this study suggest that treating PLT and plasma products with a riboflavin-and-UV-light-based pathogen reduction process could potentially eliminate window period transmission of screened viruses and greatly reduce the risk of transfusion transmission of unscreened viruses.","Keil, Shawn D; Bengrine, Abderrahmane; Bowen, Richard; Marschner, Susanne; Hovenga, Nick; Rouse, Lindsay; Gilmour, Denise; Duverlie, Gilles; Goodrich, Raymond P",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.13030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25731607/,391

METHODS Fifty-four patients (25 men and 29 women) with a median age of 76 years (range, 60-89 years) were enrolled from 16 US centers; 51 patients were eligible for evaluation (they had biopsy-proven stage IA NSCLC and were deemed medically inoperable by a board-certified thoracic surgeon). Pulmonary function tests were performed within the 60 days before RFA and 3 and 24 months after RFA. Adverse events were recorded and categorized. Patients were followed with CT and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Local control rate and recurrence patterns were analyzed. RESULTS The overall survival rate was 86.3% at 1 year and 69.8% at 2 years. The local tumor recurrence-free rate was 68.9% at 1 year and 59.8% at 2 years and was worse for tumors > 2 cm. In the 19 patients with local recurrence, 11 were re-treated with RFA, 9 underwent radiation, and 3 underwent chemotherapy. There were 21 grade 3 adverse events, 2 grade 4 adverse events, and 1 grade 5 adverse event in 12 patients within the first 90 days after RFA. None of the grade 4 or 5 adverse events were attributable to RFA. There was no significant change in the forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration or the diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide after RFA. A tumor size less than 2.0 cm and a performance status of 0 or 1 were associated with statistically significant improved survival of 83% and 78%, respectively, at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS RFA is a single, minimally invasive procedure that is well tolerated in medically inoperable patients, does not adversely affect pulmonary function tests, and provides a 2-year overall survival rate that is comparable to the rate reported after stereotactic body radiotherapy in similar patients.","Dupuy, Damian E; Fernando, Hiran C; Hillman, Shauna; Ng, Thomas; Tan, Angelina D; Sharma, Amita; Rilling, William S; Hong, Kelvin; Putnam, Joe B",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.29507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26096694/,391

For instance, though palliative care has been shown to benefit all people with a life-threatening illness, its main reach continues to be for those with cancer. Drawing on relational models of research use, we set out to engage policy-makers, educators, clinicians, commissioners and service providers in a knowledge exchange process to identify implications of research for Scottish palliative care priorities. First, we mapped the existing palliative care research evidence in Scotland. We then organised evidence review meetings and a wider stakeholder event where research producers and users came together to coproduce implications of the evidence for policy, education and practice. We used questionnaires and key stakeholder feedback meetings to explore impacts of this process on research uptake and use immediately after the events and over time. In this paper, we reflect on this knowledge exchange process and the broader context in which it was set. We found that participation fostered relationships and led to a rich and enthusiastic exploration of research evidence from multiple perspectives. Potential impacts relating to earlier identification for palliative care, education and need-based commissioning ensued.

155615,Usefulness of PCR Screening in the Initial Triage of Trauma Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-10-01,"Helicobacter pylori is the leading cause of peptic ulcer disease. The infection has been implicated in more than 75% of duodenal ulcer cases and 17% of gastric ulcer cases. H. pylori has been classified as a human carcinogen, since it is the main cause of distal gastric adenocarcinoma and B cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Evidence also links H. pylori with extragastric conditions including iron deficiency anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Studies indicate that H. pylori may be protective against other conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., reflux esophagitis and related pathologies) and elsewhere in the body (e.g., asthma). The infection is asymptomatic in the vast majority of cases; more serious outcomes occur in only 10-15% of infected individuals.

157523,Controversies in Respiratory Protective Equipment Selection and Use During COVID-19.,2020-05-01,"The Immucillins are chemically stable analogues that mimic the ribocation and leaving-group features of N-ribosyltransferase transition states. Infectious disease agents often rely on ribosyltransferase chemistry in pathways involving precursor synthesis for nucleic acids, salvage of nucleic acid precursors, or synthetic pathways with nucleoside intermediates. Here, we review three infectious agents and the use of the Immucillins to taget enzymes essential to the parasites. First, DADMe-Immucillin-G is a purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) inhibitor that blocks purine salvage and shows clinical potential for treatment for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a purine auxotroph requiring hypoxanthine for purine nucleotide synthesis. Inhibition of the PNPs in the host and in parasite cells leads to apurinic starvation and death. Second, Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent of human ulcers, synthesizes menaquinone, an essential electron transfer agent, in a pathway requiring aminofutalosine nucleoside hydrolysis. Inhibitors of the H. pylori methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN) are powerful antibiotics for this organism. Synthesis of menaquinone by the aminofutalosine pathway does not occur in most bacteria populating the human gut microbiome. Thus, MTAN inhibitors provide high-specificity antibiotics for H. pylori and are not expected to disrupt the normal gut bacterial flora. Third, Immucillin-A was designed as a transition state analogue of the atypical PNP from Trichomonas vaginalis. In antiviral screens, Immucillin-A was shown to act as a prodrug. It is active against filoviruses and flaviviruses. In virus-infected cells, Immucillin-A is converted to the triphosphate, is incorporated into the viral transcript, and functions as an atypical chain-terminator for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Immucillin-A has entered clinical trials for use as an antiviral. We also summarize other Immucillins that have been characterized in successful clinical trials for T-cell lymphoma and gout. The human trials support the potential development of the Immucillins in infectious diseases.","Evans, Gary B; Tyler, Peter C; Schramm, Vern L",ACS infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151351/,391
157982,Physical Activity in Obese Type 2 Diabetes After Gastric Bypass or Medical Management.,2017,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is beginning to include advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. However, the efficacy of LESS Heller myotomy has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the authors' initial experience with LESS Heller myotomy for achalasia. METHODS Transumbilical LESS Heller myotomy with concomitant anterior fundoplication for achalasia was undertaken for 66 patients after October 2007. Outcomes including operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded and compared with those for an earlier contiguous group of 66 consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication. Symptoms before and after myotomy were scored by the patients using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never/not severe) to 10 (always/very severe). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. RESULTS Patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomy were similar to those undergoing conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomy in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), blood loss, and length of hospital stay. However, the patients undergoing LESS Heller myotomies had operations of significantly longer duration (median, 117 vs. 93 min with the conventional laparoscopic approach) (p<0.003). For 11 patients (16%) undergoing LESS Heller myotomy, additional ports/incisions were required. No patients were converted to ""open"" operations, and no patients had procedure-specific complications. Symptom reduction was dramatic and satisfying after both LESS and conventional laparoscopic myotomy with fundoplication. The symptom reduction was similar with the two procedures. The LESS approach left no apparent umbilical scar. CONCLUSION Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication effectively treats achalasia. The findings showed LESS Heller myotomy with anterior fundoplication to be feasible, safe, and efficacious. Although the LESS approach increases operative time, it does not increase procedure-related morbidity or hospital length of stay and avoids apparent umbilical scarring. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery represents a paradigm shift to more minimally invasive surgery and is applicable to advanced laparoscopic operations such as Heller myotomy and anterior fundoplication.","Barry, Linda; Ross, Sharona; Dahal, Sujat; Morton, Connor; Okpaleke, Chinyere; Rosas, Melissa; Rosemurgy, Alexander S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1454-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21487889/,391

As professional antigen-presenting cells, they are essential for induction of adaptive immune responses. Consequently, knowledge on this cell type is required to understand the immune systems of veterinary mammals, including cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, and horses. Recent ontogenic studies define bona fide DC as an independent lineage of hematopoietic cells originating from a common precursor. Distinct transcription factors control the development into the two subsets of classical DC and plasmacytoid DC. These DC subsets express a distinguishable transcriptome, which differs from that of monocyte-derived DC. Using a comparative approach based on phenotype and function, this review attempts to classify DC of veterinary mammals and to describe important knowledge gaps.","Summerfield, Artur; Auray, Gael; Ricklin, Meret",Annual review of animal biosciences,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-animal-022114-111009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25387110/,391

The present work has addressed the updated literature on the topic of coronaviruses transmission through water and wastewater as well as identified gaps in research to inform future studies. In total, 198 articles were selected, then after screening, 48 eligible studies were fully reviewed. Accordingly, the studies showed that the coronavirus has been isolated and identified from water as well as wastewater. The results of researches show that the presence of SARS-Co-2 virus in municipal wastewater is possible due to the excretion of the virus in human feces. In addition, the SARS-Co-2 virus was isolated from contaminated water and rivers, but there is insufficient evidence for virus transmission by water and wastewater. Water and wastewater treatment methods are able to reduce the pollution load caused by this virus in water sources. Water disinfection has an effective role in removing it from water and wastewater sources. Due to the short period of time in the global pandemic and the small number of studies in this field, further studies are needed to make a definite statement about the transferability of virus in water and wastewater.","Godini, Hatam; Hoseinzadeh, Edris; Hossini, Hooshyar",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594845/,391

T cell exhaustion is characterized by stepwise and progressive loss of T cell function, which is probably the main reason for the failed immunological control of chronic pathogens and cancers. Recent observations have detailed some of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the severity of T cell exhaustion. Duration and magnitude of antigenic activation of T cells might be associated with up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, which is a major intrinsic factor of T cell exhaustion. Extrinsic factors might include the production of suppressive cytokines, T cell priming by either non-professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs), and alteration of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Further investigation of the cellular and molecular processes behind the development of T cell exhaustion can reveal therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of chronic infections and cancers. Here, we report the properties and the mechanisms of T cell exhaustion in a chronic environment.","Jin, Hyun-Tak; Jeong, Yun Hee; Park, Hyo Jin; Ha, Sang-Jun",BMB reports,https://doi.org/10.5483/bmbrep.2011.44.4.217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524346/,391

In this work, to assist the design of urgently needed crystals with large birefringence in the infrared (IR) region, typical alkali-metal chalcogenides, KPSe6, Na2Ge2Se5, and Li2In2GeSe6 have been studied. They exhibit a hierarchical characteristic in the calculated birefringence by about 0.21, 0.11, and 0.04, respectively. To explore the origin of the birefringence difference, the polarizability anisotropy and the effect of electron distribution anisotropy are analyzed. The alkali-metal chalcogenides KPSe6, Na2Ge2Se5, and Li2In2GeSe6 feature infinite one-dimensional (1D) chains of [PSe6], 2D anionic framework of [Ge2Se5] layers and 3D [In2GeSe9] networks, respectively. It is found that the anionic group with low-dimensional configuration could enhance polarizability anisotropy and render large birefringence for the macroscopic structure. This provides evidence that a low-dimensionality configuration in the structure would be beneficial for the enhancement of optical anisotropy, which can motivate the exploration and design of novel IR birefringent materials.","Min, Jingmei; Abudurusuli, Ailijiang; Li, Junjie; Pan, Shilie; Yang, Zhihua",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp03521a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830214/,391

Eight subjects performed 20 s contractions [15 s at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) followed by 5 s MVC] separated by a 10 s rest period until task failure. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical femoral nerve stimulation (PNS) were delivered ∼ 2 s apart during 50% MVC, during MVC and after MVC in relaxed muscle. Voluntary activation was assessed by TMS (VATMS) immediately before and after exercise and then three times over a 6 min recovery period. During exercise, MVC and twitch force evoked by PNS in relaxed muscle decreased progressively to 48 ± 8 and 36 ± 16% of control values, respectively (both P < 0.01). Significant changes in voluntary activation assessed by PNS and twitch evoked by TMS during MVC were observed during the last quarter of exercise only (from 96.4 ± 1.7 to 86 ± 13%, P = 0.03 and from 0.76 ± 0.8 to 4.9 ± 4.7% MVC, P = 0.02, from baseline to task failure, respectively). The TMS-induced silent period increased linearly during both MVC (by ∼ 79 ms) and 50% MVC (by ∼ 63 ms; both P < 0.01). Motor-evoked potential amplitude did not change during the protocol at any force levels. Both silent period and VATMS recovered within 2 min postexercise, whereas MVC and twitch force evoked by PNS in relaxed muscle recovered to only 84 ± 9 and 73 ± 17% of control values 6 min after exercise, respectively. In conclusion, high-intensity single-joint quadriceps exercise induces supraspinal fatigue near task failure, with increased intracortical inhibition and, in contrast to previous upper-limb results, unchanged corticospinal excitability. These changes recover rapidly after task failure, emphasizing the need to measure corticospinal adaptations immediately at task failure to avoid underestimation of exercise-induced corticospinal changes.","Gruet, Mathieu; Temesi, John; Rupp, Thomas; Levy, Patrick; Verges, Samuel; Millet, Guillaume Y",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2014.078840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907029/,391

Due to the potential impact of this change on rheumatology clinical training, we investigated trainees' experiences with telemedicine. Objectives: To assess the impact of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatology training, including supervision. Methods: A voluntary, anonymous web-based survey was administered in English, Spanish, or French from 19/08/2020 to 05/10/2020. Adult and paediatric rheumatology trainees worldwide in training in 2020 were invited to participate via social media and email. Using multiple choice questions, Likert scales, and free text answers, we collected data regarding prior and current telemedicine use, training, and supervision. Results: 302 respondents from 33 countries completed the survey, with most (83%, 252/302) in adult rheumatology training. Reported use of telemedicine increased from 13% (39/302) pre-pandemic to 82% (247/302) (Table 1). European trainees predominantly utilised audio-only compared to trainees from the rest of the world (ROW) who predominantly utilised audio-video telemedicine. Most trainees continued to evaluate new patients using telemedicine (65%, 161/247). A larger proportion of trainees were comfortable using telemedicine to evaluate follow-up (69% 170/247) versus new patients (25%, 41/161) (Figure 1). Only 32% (97/302) were trained in telemedicine, with the highest proportion among United States (US) trainees (59%, 69/116);subjects included software, clinical skills, and billing. The majority of trainees found this helpful (92%, 89/97). Supervision was most frequently in the form of verbal discussion after the consultation (Table 1);24% (59/247) had no telemedicine supervision during the pandemic. In general, trainees found telemedicine negatively impacted their supervision (51%, 123/242) and clinical teaching quality (70%, 171/244);only 9% reported a positive impact on these areas. Conclusion: Adoption of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to areas of concern for rheumatology trainees including inadequate supervision and clinical teaching. Our results suggest a need for education on evaluation of new patients using telemedicine, increasing telemedicine training, and ensuring adequate supervisory arrangements.","Yeoh, S.

One principled idea is to mine implicit relevance feedback from user behavior recorded in search engine logs. All previous works on mining implicit relevance feedback target at relevance of web documents rather than passages. Due to several unique characteristics of QA tasks, the existing user behavior models for web documents cannot be applied to infer passage relevance. In this paper, we make the first study to explore the correlation between user behavior and passage relevance, and propose a novel approach for mining training data for Web QA. We conduct extensive experiments on four test datasets and the results show our approach significantly improves the accuracy of passage ranking without extra human labeled data. In practice, this work has proved effective to substantially reduce the human labeling cost for the QA service in a global commercial search engine, especially for languages with low resources.

Results: These parameters and C-reactive protein levels of the Covid-19 patients were found to be statistically significant in both admission to the intensive care and mortality. The upper limits of these determined cut-off values are predicted to be critical for admission to intensive care. The cut-off values for NLR, NMR, NPR and CRP for mortality rate were 9.5, 3.7, 0.022, 79.2. Among these parameters, it was seen that the best determinant for mortality rate was CRP (cut-off=79.2). Conclusion: It was observed that NLR, NMR, NPR and CRP values were significant in determining the need for intensive care unit and mortality rate in patients diagnosed with Covid-19.","Ozden Yildirim, Akan Oktay Bilgir",Eurasian Journal of Medical Investigation,https://doi.org/10.14744/ejmi.2021.14888,391

173512,Mental statuses of nursing students in the covid-19 pandemic period: A systematic review,2021,"Background COVID-19 virus travels in the air and collects indoors through tiny particles from exhaled breath, and remains a growing concern globally especially since case studies of vaccine breakthrough infections are being reported. Last year's wildfires resulted in the worst air quality on record in the Western US due to toxic wildfire smoke (PM 2.5 pollution) traveling from distant wildfires and this year can potentially be even worse due to extremely dry conditions. Precautions such as high-filtration (Hi-Fi) masks and HEPA air purifiers are useful to effectively reduce inhalation of most of these toxic aerosols. Whereas the lack of fit or filtration in a mask or use of an air purifier of insufficient size (capacity) for the room can inadvertently render these precautions ineffective. Here we investigate the public's concerns about wildfires and the COVID-19 variants (e.g. delta), their use of aerosol precautions, and whether these are being done in an effective manner. Methods We conducted possibly the largest, national survey (2,250 US residents) to date in order to understand the public concerns about airborne threats and their usage of airborne (aerosol) precautions. Results We find over 66% of US residents surveyed are worried about inhaling COVID-19 and its variants, and 52% are worried about toxic wildfire particles in the air. In the mountain and pacific regions the latter rises to 73%. Only a quarter are using masks with higher filtration and high level of fit (or Hi-Fi masks e.g. N95 or similar such as elastomeric N95 or KF94). Two-thirds are still using loose-fitting cloth or surgical masks. Just over 40% of respondents report using air purifiers at home, and of this group only 40% use it in their bedroom where they sleep. Of those using air purifiers, the majority said they chose the size of their air purifier based on ""most popular"" models, ""recommendations,"" or ""reviews."" However, of those using air purifiers only 42% reported doing a calculation (or using a calculator) to estimate the right size of air purifier needed for the room they are using it in. Notably, a much higher percentage of people (than average) reported use of Hi-Fi masks and home air purifiers in certain occupations such as doctors, healthcare, first responders, public safety, engineering, military, and construction. Conclusion National survey data suggests most Americans are worried about wildfire smoke and Covid variants (e.g. delta variant) but a majority are not prepared for it. This data reveals five specific things that can be immediately done by a majority of Americans with off-the-shelf products to prepare for these and other aerosolized risks (1) use HEPA air cleaners in rooms wherever significant time is spent such as bedrooms, living rooms, classrooms, offices, etc. (2) correctly estimate the size of the HEPA air cleaner for each room using a purpose-built calculator if needed (3) override the auto setting to maximum speed in shared spaces such as classrooms and offices since the fan-speed sensors in HEPA air cleaners typically detect wildfire smoke but not accumulation of virus from exhaled breath (4) use Hi-Fi masks instead of the more common cloth masks and loose-fitting surgical masks e.g. N95, elastomerics, KF94, surgical masks with fitters, etc. (5) ""stock up"" on HEPA air cleaners and Hi-Fi masks as needed in advance of the Western US wildfire season when there are expected to be shortages once the air quality rapidly deteriorates. Widespread access and adoption of these same aerosol precautions will be useful for future pandemics and national biodefense.","Srikrishna, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.21260660v1?rss=1,391

175724,Association of depression screening with diagnostic and treatment-related outcomes among youth,2021-05-01,"This paper focuses on the impact of fear emotion upon technology adoption by educators and students during Covid-19 pandemic. Mobile learning (m-learning) has been applied as the educational social platform within higher education institutes, public as well as private. The research hypotheses were associated with the Covid-19 influence on m-learning adoption with the rise of the coronavirus increasing types of fear. Such fears include fear caused by the education failure, family lockdown, and loss of social relationships. Teachers and students are mostly fearful of these aspects of the situation. An integrated model was established within the research, using theoretical models;the Planned Behavior theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, and the Expectation-Confirmation Model. The proposed integrated model (using PLS-SEM software) was analyzed using an online survey data, with 420 respondents from Zayed University, UAE. The findings indicated that attitude was the best predictor for using the m-learning system, followed by continuous intention, expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, perceived fear, behavioral control, and satisfaction. According to the research, during the coronavirus pandemic, if the m-learning system is adopted for educational reasons, the learning and teaching outcome proves quite promising. Yet there is a fear of the family being stressed, or of loss of friends, and also a fear of the results of future schooling. It is therefore necessary to assess the students efficiently during this pandemic so that the situation can be managed emotionally. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Alhumaid, K.",International Journal of Data and Network Science,https://doi.org/10.5267/j.ijdns.2021.6.012,391

Therefore, knowledge on how people’s education converts to jobs enables data-driven choices concerning human resources within an ever-changing job market. Moreover, the relationship between education and occupation is also relevant in times of global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare system overload and skill shortage on one hand, and job losses related to lock-downs on the other, have exposed a necessity to identify target groups with relevant education backgrounds in order to facilitate their occupational transitions. However, the relationship between education and employment is complex and difficult to model. This study aims to propose the methodology that would allow us to model education-to-skill mapping. Multiple challenges arising from administrative datasets, namely imbalanced data, complex labeling, hierarchical structure and textual data, were addressed using six neural network-based algorithms of incremental complexity. The final proposed mathematical model incorporates the textual data from descriptions of education programs that are transformed into embeddings, utilizing transformer neural networks. The output of the final model is constructed as the hierarchical classification task. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated using experiments on national level data, which covers whole population of Lithuania. Finally, we provide the recommendations for the usage of proposed model. This model can be used for practical applications and scenario forecasting. Some possible applications for such model usage are demonstrated and described in this article.

Current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the role of asymptomatic infection worldwide reported in family-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. DesignOnline literature search (PubMed, Google Scholar, medRixv, and BioRixv) was accomplished using standard Boolean operators, studies published till 07th June 2020. SettingStudies were included from case reports, short communication, and retrospective to cover sufficient asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission reported. ParticipantsFamilial-clusters, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. ResultsWe observed asymptomatic transmission among familial-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers with a proportion of 32% 37%, 26%, 6%, and 32%, respectively. This study observed an overall proportion of 31% (95%CI: 0.19-0.44) with heterogeneity of I2 (97.28%, p=<0.001) among all asymptomatic populations mentioned in this study. Among children and healthcare workers, this study showed no heterogeneity; to overcome the interpretation from a fixed model, the random effect model was also applied to estimate the average distribution across studies included in the meta-analysis. ConclusionWe found and suggest the rigorous epidemiological history, early isolation, social distancing, and increased quarantine period (at least 28 days) after screening asymptomatic cases as well as their close contacts for chest CT scan even after their negative nucleic acid testing to minimize the spread among the community. This systematic review and meta-analysis support asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission between person to person depending on the variation of virus incubation period among individuals.

177999,COVID-19 Vaccination acceptance in the canton of Geneva: A Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study,2021-07-06,"Research Question (RQ): What challenges did students recognize in the sudden transition to e-learning due to the outbreak of COVID-19? Which suggestions facilitated in the improvement of implementing e-learning and to what extent did the students think that following their recommendations contributed to better e-learning? Purpose: With the research, we wanted to determine what challenges students at higher vocational schools perceived during the e-learning process. Due to the sudden appearance of COVID-19, the educational approach swiftly changed, and both teachers and students were faced with many challenges. Method: Content analysis was used on domestic and international research studies. The literature was reviewed and analyzed using keywords. For the empirical research, we collected data by surveying students from the southeastern part of Slovenia in seven different short cycle higher education programs. The questionnaire was designed based on self-evaluation reports and previously analyzed professional literature dealing with this area. Results: Results are depicted based on the challenges that students faced in the sudden onset of e-learning due to the pandemic. By following recommendations provided by students, teachers were able to improve their e-learning approach, in which everyone was involved, and thus facilitated the learning process. Organization: The results of the research enable schools to implement the identified challenges that students perceived during the educational process to improve e-learning. The research findings portray a possible answer on what needs to be improved in e-learning and how to adapt approaches in a way that is tailored to the student. Society: Recognizing students' e-learning challenges is the foundation for improving the entire e-learning process, which contributes to better achievement of educational goals and greater contribution of knowledge to society. Originality: Several studies on e-learning have already been conducted, but we have not found any that address the challenges posed by short cycle higher education students in the face of the immediate and unexpected introduction of e-learning due to the global health situation. Limitations/Future Research: We have limited ourselves to research that has already been conducted in this area. The resulting questionnaire was created as a pilot survey on a larger sample to determine reliability and to obtain a starting point for implementing improvements in practice and the possibility of further testing on an even larger number of students. The research also offers a starting point for the preparation of a questionnaire intended for higher education teachers who already have conducted e-learning.Alternate abstract:Raziskovalno vprašanje (RV): Katere izzive so študentje pri nenadnem prehodu na e-izobraževanje zaradi pojava virusa covid-19 prepoznali?

178123,International advances in self-direction: themes from a disability leadership exchange: Managing Community Care,2021,"Background and Objectives The goals of depression screening, which is universally recommended in primary care settings in the U.S., are to identify adolescents with depression and connect them to treatment. However, little is known about how depression screening affects the likelihood of being diagnosed with a mental disorder or accessing mental health care over time. Methods This longitudinal cohort study used insurance claims data from 57,732 adolescents who had at least one routine well-visit between 2014 and 2017. Using propensity score matching, we compared adolescents who were screened for depression to similar adolescents who were not screened for depression during the well-visit. Diagnostic and treatment-related outcomes were examined over 6-month follow-up and included depression diagnoses, mood-related diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, any mental health-related prescriptions, and psychotherapy. We also examined heterogeneity of associations by sex. Results Compared to adolescents who were not screened for depression, adolescents screened for depression were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with depression (RR=1.30, 95% CI=1.11-1.52) and 17% more likely to receive a mood-related diagnosis (RR=1.17, 95% CI=1.08-1.27), but were not more likely to be treated with an antidepressant prescription (RR=1.11, 95% CI=0.82-1.51), any mental health prescription (RR=1.15, 95% CI=0.87-1.53), or psychotherapy (RR=1.13, 95% CI=0.98-1.31). In general, associations were stronger among females. Conclusions Adolescents who were screened for depression during a well-visit were more likely to receive a diagnosis of depression or a mood-related disorder in the six months following screening. Future research should explore methods for increasing access to treatment and treatment uptake following screening.","Riehm, K.; Brignone, E.; Stuart, E. A.; Gallo, J.

178296,Dissociating compulsive washing and hoarding tendencies through differences in comorbidities and the content of concerns,2021,"The ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and is dependent on a complex interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility and population immunity. In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses – even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","Simmonds, P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200,391
179085,Effect of COVID-19 anxiety on perceived risks and avoidance behaviors,2021,"A substantial reduction in global transport and industrial processes stemming from the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and subsequent pandemic resulted in sharp declines in emissions, including for NO2. This has implications for human health, given the role that this gas plays in pulmonary disease and the findings that past exposure to air pollutants has been linked to the most adverse outcomes from COVID-19 disease, likely via various co-morbidities. To explore how much COVID-19 shutdown policies impacted urban air quality, we examined ground-based NO2 sensor data from 11 U.S. cities from a two-month window (March–April) during shutdown in 2020, controlling for natural seasonal variability by using average changes in NO2 over the previous five years for these cities. Levels of NO2 and VMT reduction in March and April compared to January 2020 ranged between 11–65% and 11–89%, consistent with a sharp drop in vehicular traffic from shutdown-related travel restrictions. To explore this link closely, we gathered detailed traffic count data in one city—Indianapolis, Indiana—and found a strong correlation (0.90) between traffic counts/classification and vehicle miles travelled, a moderate correlation (0.54) between NO2 and traffic related data, and an average reduction of 1.11 ppb of NO2 linked to vehicular data. This finding indicates that targeted reduction in pollutants like NO2 can be made by manipulating traffic patterns, thus potentially leading to more population-level health resilience in the future.","Heintzelman, Asrah Filippelli Gabriel Lulla Vijay",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169030,391

To this end, it develops three stylised COVID-19 recovery pathways (""Rebound"", ""Decoupling"" and ""Wider well-being"") that differ in the extent to which they encompass greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and the integration of mitigation and wider well-being outcomes or, broadly equivalently, SDGs. A number of real-world examples of COVID-19 recovery measures in the surface transport and residential sectors were identified, and the paper maps these measures onto these three stylised pathways. The paper finds a wide divergence in the environmental and social impacts of COVID-19 recovery measures developed to date, with several countries putting in place measures that correspond to all three pathways. The nature and pace of economic recovery in different countries and in aggregate will have important implications for existing, updated and new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, and the paper also highlights the possible impact of the COVID-19 recovery measures being put in place on NDCs- including on the ambition of both current and future NDCs.

An examination of emergency medical technicians,2021,"Given the underestimate of seroprevalence in the US due to insufficient testing, accurate estimates of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinations do not exist. Although model-based estimates have been proposed, they require inputting unknown parameters such as viral reproduction number, longevity of immune response, and other dynamic factors. In contrast to a model-based approach for estimating population immunity, or simplistic summing of natural- and vaccine- induced immunity, the current study presents a data-driven statistical procedure for estimating the total immunity rate in a region using prospectively collected serological data along with state-level vaccination data. We present a detailed procedure so that efforts can be replicated regionally to inform policy-making decisions relevant to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we conducted a prospective longitudinal statewide cohort serological survey with 10,482 participants and more than 14,000 blood samples beginning on September 30, 2020. Along with Department of State Health Services vaccination data, as of July 4, 2021, the estimated percentage of those with naturally occurring antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Texas is 35.3% (95% CI = (33.7%, 36.9%) and total estimated immunity is 69.1%.We conclude the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is 4 times higher than the state-confirmed COVID-19 cases (8.8%).

181536,A Conversation about Ageism: Time to Deinstitutionalize Long-Term Care?,2021,"In recent work, we proposed that effective therapeutic drugs aimed at treating the SARS-CoV-2 infection could be developed based on interdicting in the early steps of the folding pathway of key viral proteins, including the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. In order to provide for a drug target on the protein, the earliest contact-formation event along the dominant folding pathway of the RBD spike protein was predicted employing the Sequential Collapse Model (SCM). The segments involved in the predicted earliest contact were suggested to provide optimal folding interdiction target regions (FITRs) for potential therapeutic drugs, with a focus on folding interdicting peptides (FIPs). In this paper, we extend our analysis to include 13 known single mutations of the RBD spike protein as well as the triple mutation B1.351 and the recent double mutation B1.617.2. The results show that the location of the FITR does not change in any of the 15 studied mutations, providing for a mutation-resistant drug design strategy for the RBD-spike protein.","Bergasa-Caceres, Fernando Rabitz Herschel A.",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010023,391

Participants - 780 patients and 522 staff testing SARS-CoV-2 positive between 1st March 2020 and 25th July 2020 (Wave 1); and 580 patients and 299 staff testing SARS-CoV-2 positive between 30th November 2020 and 24th January 2021 (Wave 2). Main outcome measures - Transmission pairs including who-infected-whom; location of transmission events in hospital; number of secondary cases from each individual, including differences in onward transmission from community and hospital onset patient cases. Results - Staff-to-staff transmission was estimated to be the most frequent transmission type during Wave 1 (31.6% of observed hospital-acquired infections; 95% CI 26.9 to 35.8%), decreasing to 12.9% (95% CI 9.5 to 15.9%) in Wave 2. Patient-to-patient transmissions increased from 27.1% in Wave 1 (95% CI 23.3 to 31.4%) to 52.1% (95% CI 48.0 to 57.1%) in Wave 2, to become the predominant transmission type. Over 50% of hospital-acquired infections were concentrated in 8/120 locations in Wave 1 and 10/93 locations in Wave 2. Approximately 40% to 50% of hospital-onset patient cases resulted in onward transmission compared to less than 4% of definite community-acquired cases. Conclusions - Prevention and control measures that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had a significant impact on reducing infections between healthcare workers, but were insufficient during the second wave to prevent a high number of patient-to-patient transmissions. As hospital-acquired cases appeared to drive most onward transmissions, more frequent and rapid identification and isolation of these cases will be required to break hospital transmission chains in subsequent pandemic waves","Lindsey, B.

A high stress level is associated with risk of burnout. Resilience and personal accomplishment can effectively help mitigate and reduce emergency stress levels and emotional exhaustion. The main aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of emergency stress and hardiness with burnout among emergency workers. The participants included 494 emergency volunteers from the Red Cross Committee in Veneto, Italy, engaged in various health, emergency, and social activities aimed at COVID-19 patients and people at risk of contracting the virus. Questionnaires used to measure emergency stress, hardiness and burnout were administered on an online platform. We analyzed the influence of age, sex, weekly hours of service, stress risk factors, and use of personal protective equipment. To verify the predictive effects of risk and protective factors on burnout, correlational and multivariate analyses, and regressions were conducted. Hardiness showed an effect in reducing emergency stress levels, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization and simultaneously increased personal accomplishment.","Vagni, Monia Giostra Valeria Maiorano Tiziana Santaniello Giuliano",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12219071,391
184486,"Research gaps in protecting healthcare workers from SARS and other respiratory pathogens: an interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder, evidence-based approach.",2005,"Career and professional development competencies are critical for biomedical PhD and postdoctoral training. In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to enable equity in professional skill building and fostering lifelong growth mindset.","Gardner, Margery Evans; Bodiya, Elizabeth C; Subramanian, Shoba",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.328492,391
185892,"Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Social Distancing, Isolation and Quarantine are Key Success Factors of Nepal's Public Health Practices or Something Else?",2020,"Objectives: To determine stress grades of doctors working in tertiary care hospitals by using a standard measuring tool i.e. Kessler 10 psychological distress scale along with finding out different coping methods adopted by doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: Cross Sectional study. Setting: Tertiary Care Hospitals of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. Period: 15 March 2020 to 20 June 2020. Material & Methods: A structured questionnaire was sent online to the junior and senior doctors working during the pandemic. The data was automatically collected with the help of Google docs and then analysed using SPSS 26. Results: Of the 219 doctors who completed the questionnaire 142 were males (64.8%) and 77 were females (35.2%). Interestingly, analysis of the score revealed that 38.8% of the doctors were found likely to be well, 16.4% of the doctors were likely to have mild disease and 20.5% were likely to have a moderate disorder while 24.2% were likely to have a severe disorder. Further analysis showed that the mean of Kessler's score was greater for junior doctors as compared to Consultants which was found to be statistically significant (p=0.044). Conclusion: The impact of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) on the stress levels of health workers warrants considerable attention as it was declared a pandemic. Assessing the psychological impact and ways to tackle them will not only help the health care workers during this pandemic but will be beneficial in future pandemics as well.

188180,The emerging threat of MERS.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic-assisted colonic resection has been well described for multiple surgical indications. This typically requires an abdominal incision for specimen removal that is associated with the majority of postoperative pain. We describe the first laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal approach for sigmoidectomy and rectocolpopexy for the treatment of rectal prolapse. METHODS Mobilization of the sigmoid colon was performed laparoscopically using a 12-mm vaginal port and 3 additional 5-mm abdominal ports. A laparoscopic stapler was used through the vaginal port to transect the distal sigmoid colon. The specimen was subsequently externalized through the colpotomy to complete the resection and prepare the remaining bowel for intracorporeal, end-to-end, stapled anastomosis. The colpotomy was then repaired, and the colorectal anastomosis and rectocolpopexy were completed laparoscopically. RESULTS Sigmoidectomy and rectocolpopexy were successfully performed laparoscopically by using a transvaginal approach without the need for an abdominal incision for specimen removal. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, complained of minimal pain, and was discharged home on postoperative day 3. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal sigmoidectomy and rectocolpopexy is a feasible option that appears to be associated with little incisional pain and rapid recovery.","Sanchez, Jaime E; Rasheid, Sowsan H; Krieger, Beth R; Frattini, Jared C; Marcet, Jorge E",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19660219/,391

The Lyssavirus genus comprises seven genotypes (GTs) of rabies and rabies-related viruses. The ability of p75NTR to interact with the glycoprotein of representative lyssaviruses from each GT was investigated. This investigation was based on a specific binding assay between BSR cells infected with a lyssavirus and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells expressing p75NTR on the cell surface. A specific interaction was observed with the glycoprotein of GT 1 RV (challenge virus standard or Pasteur virus strains) as well as wild-type RV and the glycoprotein of GT 6 European bat lyssavirus type 2. In contrast, no interaction was detected with the glycoprotein of lyssaviruses of GTs 2-5 and 7. Therefore, p75NTR is only a receptor for some lyssavirus glycoproteins, indicating that the other GTs must use an alternative specific receptor.","Tuffereau, C; Desmézières, E; Bénéjean, J; Jallet, C; Flamand, A; Tordo, N; Perrin, P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11714960/,391

SEven virus-specific RNA species with molecular weights of 0.6 X 10(6), 0.9 X 10(6), 1.2 X 10(6), 1.5 X 10(6), 3.0 X 10(6), 4.0 X 10(6), and 5.4 X 10(6) (equivalent to the viral genome) were detected. T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies suggested that the sequences of each RNA species were totally included within the next large RNa species. The oligonucleotides of each RNA species were mapped on the 60S RNA genome of the virus. Each RNA species contained the oligonucleotides starting from the 3' end of the genome and extending continuously for various lengths in the 3' leads to 5' direction. All of the viral RNA species contained a polyadenylate stretch of 100 to 130 nucleotides and probably identical sequences immediately next to the polyadenylate. These data suggested that the virus-specific RNAs are mRNA's and have a stairlike structure similar to that of infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus. A proposal is presented, based on the mRNA structure, for the designation of the genes on the MHV genome. Using this proposal, the sequence differences between A59, a weakly pathogenic strain, and MHV-3, a strongly hepatotropic strain, were localized primarily in mRNA's 1 and 3, corresponding t genes A and C.","Lai, M M; Brayton, P R; Armen, R C; Patton, C D; Pugh, C; Stohlman, S A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6169842/,391
190558,COVID-19: Transforming Global Health.,2020-05-01,"Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus produces acute and chronic demyelination. The contributions of perforin-mediated cytolysis and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by CD8(+) T cells to the control of infection and the induction of demyelination were examined by adoptive transfer into infected SCID recipients. Untreated SCID mice exhibited uncontrolled virus replication in all CNS cell types but had little or no demyelination. Memory CD8(+) T cells from syngeneic wild-type (wt), perforin-deficient, or IFN-gamma-deficient (GKO) donors all trafficked into the infected CNS in the absence of CD4(+) T cells and localized to similar areas. Although CD8(+) T cells from all three donors suppressed virus replication in the CNS, GKO CD8(+) T cells expressed the least antiviral activity. A distinct viral antigen distribution in specific CNS cell types revealed different mechanisms of viral control. While wt CD8(+) T cells inhibited virus replication in all CNS cell types, cytolytic activity in the absence of IFN-gamma suppressed the infection of astrocytes, but not oligodendroglia. In contrast, cells that secreted IFN-gamma but lacked cytolytic activity inhibited replication in oligodendroglia, but not astrocytes. Demyelination was most severe following viral control by wt CD8(+) T cells but was independent of macrophage infiltration. These data demonstrate the effective control of virus replication by CD8(+) T cells in the absence of CD4(+) T cells and support the necessity for the expression of distinct effector mechanisms in the control of viral replication in distinct CNS glial cell types.","Bergmann, Cornelia C; Parra, Beatriz; Hinton, David R; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Dowdell, Konechi C; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747539/,391
190937,Making hospitals health promotive.,2021-09-01,"Unlike nuclear localization signals, there is no obvious consensus sequence for the targeting of proteins to the nucleolus. The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure which is crucial to the normal operation of the eukaryotic cell. Studying nucleolar trafficking signals is problematic as many nucleolar retention signals (NoRSs) are part of classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs). In addition, there is no known consensus signal with which to inform a study. The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Mutagenesis was used to delineate a novel eight amino acid motif that was necessary and sufficient for nucleolar retention of N protein and colocalize with nucleolin and fibrillarin. Additionally, a classical nuclear export signal (NES) functioned to direct N protein to the cytoplasm. Comparison of the coronavirus NoRSs with known cellular and other viral NoRSs revealed that these motifs have conserved arginine residues. Molecular modelling, using the solution structure of severe acute respiratory (SARS) coronavirus N-protein, revealed that this motif is available for interaction with cellular factors which may mediate nucleolar localization. We hypothesise that the N-protein uses these signals to traffic to and from the nucleolus and the cytoplasm.","Reed, Mark L; Dove, Brian K; Jackson, Richard M; Collins, Rebecca; Brooks, Gavin; Hiscox, Julian A",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16734668/,391

Furthermore, pretreatment of erythrocytes with either influenza C virus or bovine coronavirus eliminates subsequent binding and agglutination by either coronaviruses or influenza C virus, whereas binding of influenza A virus remains intact. In addition, hemagglutination by coronaviruses can be inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with Arthrobacter ureafaciens or Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase or by addition of sialic acid-containing gangliosides. These results suggest that, like influenza C viruses, human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus recognize O-acetylated sialic acid or a similar derivative as cell receptor.","Vlasak, R; Luytjes, W; Spaan, W; Palese, P",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3380803/,391

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: We identified consecutive patients who underwent BAV procedures between May 2019 and March 2020 using Valver balloon catheters. Demographic data, medical history, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively collected in all study patients together with periprocedural data as well as 12-month follow-up data. RESULTS Results: We included 18 patients. The mean population age was 78.1±8.9 years, and women were 61.1%. The most common co-morbidities were arterial hypertension (88.9%), dyslipidemia (83.3%), and coronary artery disease (72.2%). The baseline mean aortic valve pressure gradient was 49.94±27.02 mmHg and the mean aortic valve area (AVA) was 0.65±0.20 cm2. In all cases, the procedure was performed from the femoral access via the 8F sheath. Two Valver balloon catheter sizes were used 18x40mm (33.3%) and 20x40mm (66.7%). Three periprocedural complications were observed, and none was associated with the Valver balloon catheter per se. The transthoracic echocardiography after the procedure revealed a decrease in the mean pressure gradient of 11.1±8.85 mmHg, and an increase in AVA of 0.21±0.19 cm2. At 12-month follow-up, the mortality rate was 38.9%. CONCLUSION Conclusions: BAV is a procedure increasingly performed in catheterization laboratories worldwide. This paper confirmed the relative safety of BAV with Valver balloon catheters in the modern era, showing a low incidence of valve and vascular complications.","Bil, Jacek; Modzelewski, Paweł; Pawlak, Agnieszka; Gil, Robert J",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459762/,391

METHODS A study was conducted of 484 consecutive patients seen in the emergency department (ED) of our tertiary care center during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The scoring system was divided into triage and screening station stages. Data were analysed with multivariable and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 737 patients who presented to our ED for possible SARS from March to June 2003, we enrolled 484 patients with a temperature >38.0 degrees C (>100.3 degrees F) (age >18 years). Dyspnoea, diarrhoea, travel, close contact, hospital exposure, and household history were identified as predictive indicators in the triage stage. The triage score was the total of six items. With a one-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.8% (18/22) and 73.6% (340/462). Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CXR were identified as predictive indicators in the fever screening stage. Screening station scores (the sum of 10 items) consisted of triage scores, white blood cell count, and CXR. With a three-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% (21/22) and 87.2% (403/462).

METHODS BALB/c mice were injected with the recombinant N protein of SARS-Cov into the foot-pads for the immunization, and the popliteal lymph nodes were isolated 15 d later for mAb-producing hybridomas, from which the mAbs against the N protein of SARS-Cov were screened. The identification of the mAb against the N protein of SARS-Cov was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent-antibody assay (IFA), and Western immunoblotting. RESULTS Four strains of hybridomas were obtained that produced the mAb specific to the N protein without detectable cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Of the 4 strains, 2 were identified as the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, 1 IgG2a, and the other IgG2b, with affinity constants (Ka) of 2 of the strains being 4.14 x 10(-9)M and 3.19 x 10(-9)M respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS Over the past year, researchers have described several polymorphisms in Henoch-Schonlein purpura and Kawasaki Disease as well as the association between various vasculitides and infections. International and multidisciplinary efforts in Kawasaki Disease have resulted in recommendations for its diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management to improve patient care and further increase global collaboration. Researchers are investigating the role of inflammation and its role in endothelial health and atherosclerosis. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications; however, we continue to have incomplete treatment successes. SUMMARY Vasculitides are rare conditions with significant morbidity and mortality whose prognosis has improved with newer diagnostic modalities and treatments; however, we continue to have insufficient knowledge of vasculitides and lack unambiguous diagnostic criteria. As technology continues to progress it is clear that a single cause of these diseases may be an oversimplification: the genetic makeup of individuals, as well as various environmental exposures, are of vital importance in the pathophysiology and evolution of disease processes, as well as response to therapy. Efforts should continue to improve international multicenter collaboration and interdisciplinary efforts to help solve this ever-growing puzzle.","Kim, Susan; Dedeoglu, Fatma",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282773/,391

After 1 minute of uncontrolled hemorrhage, Celox or TraumaDEX was poured into the wound, followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures with the exception of the hemostatic agents. In all groups, 5 minutes of direct manual pressure was applied to the wound, followed by a standard pressure dressing (3M Coban). After 30 minutes, dressings were removed, and the amount of bleeding was measured. There were statistically significant differences in bleeding between Celox and control (P = .01) and between TraumaDEX and control (P = .038), but no statistically significant difference in bleeding between Celox and TraumaDEX (P = .478). Celox and TraumaDEX may be effective hemostatic agents for use in civilian and military trauma.","Gegel, Brian T; Burgert, James M; Lockhart, Cheryl; Austin, Robert; Davila, Alejandro; Deeds, Jacob; Hodges, Lonnie; Hover, Andrew; Roy, John; Simpson, Glenn; Weaver, Stephen; Wolfe, William; Johnson, Don",AANA journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583456/,391

204190,The Coronavirus Pandemic: Experience From a Rural West Virginia Tertiary Care Hospital,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a move towards digital engagement in many parts of life. At the same time, it has halted large public gatherings such as music, sports or arts events. In this paper we discuss opportunities for such large- scale social events to create digital experiences that mirror, mimic or enhance traditional experiences, with new forms of digital twinning. Originating from the world of manufacturing, and popularized by the Industry 4.0 initiative, digital twins refer to the creation of digital representations of physical entities. In the context of large social events digital twins denote digital spaces inhabitable by visitors with their own digital twins in the form of avatars. In this paper we investigate how event coordinators can account for different kinds of social engagements in digital twinning spaces. We develop a framework for user interactions along two dimensions: interactions with the space itself, and social interactions between virtual visitors (avatars). Accounting for virtual visitations is more challenging but offers unique opportunities compared to traditional attendance. We present four metrics, Views, Visits, Active Visits, and Interactive Visits, and we discuss considerations for implementing advanced digital social events. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

205353,COVID-19 and Type 1 Diabetes: Concerns and Challenges,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 contains the furin cleavage PRRA motif in the S1/S2 region, which enhances viral pathogenicity but is absent in closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. It remains unknown if bat-like coronaviral variants without PRRA (&#916;PRRA) can establish natural infection in humans. METHODS: Here, we developed a duplex digital PCR assay to examine &#916;PRRA variants in Vero-E6-propagated isolates, human organoids, experimentally infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We found that currently transmitting SARS-CoV-2 contained a quasispecies of wildtype, &#916;PRRA variants and upstream variants that have mutations upstream the PRRA motif. Moreover, the &#916;PRRA variants were readily detected despite at a low intra-host frequency in transmitted founder viruses in hamsters and in COVID-19 patients including acute cases and a family cluster with a prevalence rate of 52.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that bat-like SARS-CoV-2&#916;PRRA not only naturally exists but remains transmissible in COVID-19 patients, which have significant implications to zoonotic origin and natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2.","Wong, Yik Chun; Lau, Siu Ying; Wang To, Kelvin Kai; Mok, Bobo Wing Yee; Li, Xin; Wang, Pui; Deng, Shaofeng; Woo, Kin Fai; Du, Zhenglong; Li, Cun; Zhou, Jie; Woo Chan, Jasper Fuk; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Chen, Honglin; Chen, Zhiwei",Clin. infect. dis,,391

207171,Caring for blind and vision-impaired dermatological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"One of the available treatment alternatives for COVID-19 is the administration of convalescent plasma (CP), blood plasma obtained from people who have undergone the disease. Administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. CP can also be used for production a specific immunoglobulin. Experience from previous epidemic infections, caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, shows that CP contains neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which are probably the main source of its therapeutic potential. However, other immune mechanisms cannot be ruled out, such as antibody-induced cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 spread during the first half of year 2020 in many countries worldwide and relatively common is also in the Czech Republic, where, at the end of August 2020, about 100 patients were treated with CP. The production and use of CP is governed by the national multidisciplinary guidelines from April 2020 and the recommended therapeutic dose are 2 TU RP (400-450 mL), resp. 4-6 mL/kg. CP is indicated mainly in severe cases of COVID-19, which require oxygen support, ideally within 2-3 days after diagnosis, but our and foreign experience shows a beneficial effect of CP even in moderately severe cases that do not need oxygen treatment.","Bohonek, Milos; Rezác, David; Holub, Michal",Cas Lek Cesk,,391

An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.","Jean, Shio-Shin; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,391

209364,"The Spread of COVID-19 Among 15,000 Physical Therapists in Italy: A Cross-Sectional Study",2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the respiratory isolation capacity in hospitals; many wards lacking high-frequency air changes have been repurposed for managing patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 requiring either standard or intensive care. Hospital-acquired COVID-19 is a recognised problem amongst both patients and staff, with growing evidence for the relevance of airborne transmission. This study examined the effect of air filtration and ultra-violet (UV) light sterilisation on detectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosols. MethodsWe conducted a crossover study of portable air filtration and sterilisation devices in a repurposed surge COVID ward and surge ICU. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) cyclonic aerosol samplers and PCR assays were used to detect the presence of airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosol with and without air/UV filtration. ResultsAirborne SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the ward on all five days before activation of air/UV filtration, but on none of the five days when the air/UV filter was operational; SARS-CoV-2 was again detected on four out of five days when the filter was off. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 was infrequently detected in the ICU. Filtration significantly reduced the burden of other microbial bioaerosols in both the ward (48 pathogens detected before filtration, two after, p=0.05) and the ICU (45 pathogens detected before filtration, five after p=0.05). ConclusionsThese data demonstrate the feasibility of removing SARS-CoV-2 from the air of repurposed surge wards and suggest that air filtration devices may help reduce the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2.

Other vulnerable regions, such as South Africa and several parts of South America have also seen cases rise, further impacting local economies and livelihoods. Despite substantial research efforts to date, it remains unresolved as to whether COVID-19 transmission has the same sensitivity to climate observed for other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza. Here, we look for empirical evidence of seasonality using a robust estimation framework. For 359 large cities across the world, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using logistic growth curves fitted to cumulative case data. We then assess evidence for association with climatic variables through ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We find evidence of seasonality, with lower R0 within cities experiencing greater surface radiation (coefficientâ¯=â¯-0.005, pâ¯&#8804;â¯0.001), after adjusting for city-level variation in demographic and disease control factors. Additionally, we find association between R0 and temperature during the early phase of the epidemic in China. However, climatic variables had much weaker explanatory power compared to socioeconomic and disease control factors. Overall, we detect a weak signal of climate variables on COVID-19 transmission. Rates of transmission and health burden of the continuing pandemic will be ultimately determined by population factors and disease control policies.","Metelmann, Soeren; Pattni, Karan; Brierley, Liam; Cavalerie, Lisa; Caminade, Cyril; Blagrove, Marcus S C; Turner, Joanne; Sharkey, Kieran J; Baylis, Matthew",One Health,,391

There is an increasing trend in the use of the internet as a search tool for health-related information. This study aims to determine how useful YouTube videos are to get information about PD. METHODS: YouTube videos were evaluated independently by two nephrologists. The videos' quality was assessed with DISCERN scoring system, global quality score (GQS) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) scoring system. We determined the quartile (Q) of the videos as follows: most reliable top 25% videos Q1 and others Q2-4. RESULTS: A total of 295 videos were evaluated. University or society-sourced videos made up 15% (n = 43) of all videos, and healthcare providers were the primary target audience compared to patients (p < 0.001). JAMA, GQS and DISCERN scores were significantly higher for the videos that were targeted healthcare providers compared to the patients (p < 0.001, for all). A total of 34% of the videos in Q1 were obtained from the university or society. Nevertheless, only 17% of the videos prepared for the patients were among the Q1. A small number of videos mentioned that PD maintains the residual kidney function (RKF) longer compared to haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Universities and societies should upload videos to provide easy-to-understand information on PD. Also, the important benefits of PD, like the preservation of RKF, should be further highlighted in these videos.

It causes severe respiratory syndromes which is one of the leading causes of death. Evidence shows that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has close similarities with other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. So, SARS-CoV-2 might use the similar mechanisms of these viruses to attack the host cells. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with various factors, one of the major reasons is immune dysregulation or immune suppression. Immunity plays a significant role in maintaining the body in a healthy condition. In order to induce a timely immune response against the invaded pathogens, both innate and adaptive immunity must be in an active state. During the viral infection, there will be an excessive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm and also, the antiviral agents in the body gets inhibited or inactivated through viral mechanisms. Thus, this might be the reason for the transition from mild symptoms to more severe medical conditions which leads to an immediate need for the invention of a new medicine.This review aims to show the host-viral interaction along with immune response, antiviral mechanism and effectiveness of oral low dose cytokines against the virus as a therapeutic approach.","M, Ratheesh; S, Sheethal; Jose, Svenia P; Rajan, Sony; Thomas, Sulumol; Jagmag, Tariq; Tilwani, Jayesh",Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,,391

During the 2020 COVID-19 period (29 February-30 April 2020), there was a 24% decline in PCI for overall ACS (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; p<0.001), including a 29% reduction in PCI for non-ST-elevation ACS (IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88; p=0.002) and an 18% reduction in PCI for STEMI (IRR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; p=0.061), as compared with the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (1 January-28 February 2020). A 22% (IRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; p=0.005) reduction of PCI for STEMI was seen as compared with the 2019 reference period. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant reduction in PCI procedures for the treatment of ACS since the COVID-19 outbreak in Ireland. The reasons for this decline are still unclear but patients need to be encouraged to seek medical attention when cardiac symptoms appear, in order to avoid incremental cardiac morbidity and mortality due to a reduction in coronary revascularisation for the treatment of ACS.","Connolly, Niall Patrick; Simpkin, Andrew; Mylotte, Darren; Crowley, James; O039,; Connor, Stephen; AlHarbi, Khalid; Kiernan, Thomas; Arockiam, Sacchin; Owens, Patrick; John, Amal; Blake, Gavin J; Fitzgerald, Sean; Cadogan, Diarmaid; Rosseel, Liesbeth",BMJ Open,,391
211793,Establishing and managing a quarantine and isolation centre in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"AIM: As an emergency measure during the coronavirus disease pandemic, the monitoring interval for clozapine use was temporarily extended beyond the regulatory requirement in Japan, which is the safest monitoring interval worldwide. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of this measure on patients undergoing clozapine treatment. METHODS: This retrospective chart review study included patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) who were undergoing clozapine treatment at four psychiatric institutions in Japan. Demographic characteristics and clinical information of these patients were collected on April 27, 2020, when Japanese psychiatrists were virtually allowed to prescribe clozapine beyond the regulatory requirement. Furthermore, information of adverse events related to the emergency measure was collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 41 patients with TRS included in this study, 19 patients underwent extended hematological monitoring during clozapine treatment. No psychiatric or hematological adverse events were observed in the patients during the extended monitoring interval. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that there were few adverse events of clozapine-treated patients related to emergency measures in Japan. However, hematological monitoring intervals during clozapine treatment have been emergently extended worldwide; hence, it is necessary to verify the results of these measures.","Hata, Masahiro; Fujimoto, Michiko; Kanai, Koji; Yoshiyama, Kenji; Nakatani, Yoshitaka; Nakabayashi, Daiji; Maemura, Saki; Kawata, Shinya; Hakozaki, Takaaki; Nishikura, Shuya; Umemoto, Aiko; Sasada, Toru; Iwata, Kazuhiko; Tanaka, Hideki; Mamoto, Akiko; Toi, Yuuki; Taniguchi, Norio; Saito, Makiko; Kimura, Yoshio; Kishimoto, Kazuko; Hayami, Megumi; Ikeda, Manabu",Neuropsychopharmacol. rep,,391
213093,"For Us, COVID-19 Is Personal",2020,"An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by an infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus belongs to the group of enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent plasma.","Maciorowski, Dawid; Ogaugwu, Christian; Durvasula, Subba Rao; Durvasula, Ravi; Kunamneni, Adinarayana",SLAS Discov,,391
213301,The Monthly Operating Cost of an Institutional COVID-19 Airway Response Team: A Financial Model and Sensitivity Analysis Based on Experience at an Academic Medical Center,2021,"PURPOSE: To investigate, in a meta-analysis, the frequency of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with COVID-19 and whether D-dimer assessment may be useful to select patients for computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies which reported the frequency of PE on CTPA in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of PE, the location of PE, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) of D-dimer levels between patients with and without PE were pooled by random effects models. RESULTS: Seventy-one studies were included. Pooled frequencies of PE in patients with COVID-19 at the emergency department (ED), general wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) were 17.9% (95% CI: 12.0-23.8%), 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2-32.7%), and 48.6% (95% CI: 41.0-56.1%), respectively. PE was more commonly located in peripheral than in main pulmonary arteries (pooled frequency of 65.3% [95% CI: 60.0-70.1%] vs. 32.9% [95% CI: 26.7-39.0%]; OR = 3.540 [95% CI: 2.308-5.431%]). Patients with PE had significantly higher D-dimer levels (pooled SMD of 1.096 [95% CI, 0.844-1.349]). D-dimer cutoff levels which have been used to identify patients with PE varied between 1000 and 4800 µg/L. CONCLUSION: The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries, which suggests local thrombosis to play a major role. D-dimer assessment may help to select patients with COVID-19 for CTPA, using D-dimer cutoff levels of at least 1000 µg/L. KEY POINTS: â¢ The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. â¢ PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries. â¢ D-dimer levels are significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 who have PE.","Kwee, Robert M; Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C",Eur. radiol,,391
213625,Urgent behavioral health phone calls from skilled nursing and long-term care facilities during COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"The economic and public health crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic is exposing existing inequalities between ethnic groups in England and Wales, as well as creating new ones. We draw on current mortality and case data, alongside pre-crisis labour force data to investigate the relative vulnerability of different ethnic groups to adverse health and economic impacts. After accounting for differences in population structure and regional concentration, we show that most minority groups have suffered excess mortality compared to the white British majority group. Differences in underlying health conditions such as diabetes may play a role; so too may occupational exposure to the virus, given the very different labour market profiles of ethnic groups. Distinctive patterns of occupational concentration also highlight the vulnerability of some groups to the economic consequences of social distancing measures, with Bangladeshi and Pakistani men particularly likely to be employed in occupations directly affected by the UK's 'lockdown'. We show that differences in household structures and inequalities in access to savings mean that a number of minority groups are also less likely to be able to weather short-term shocks to their income. Documenting these immediate consequences of the crisis reveals the potential for inequalities to become entrenched in the longer term. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of this study was to describe the sensitivity of case ascertainment and the completeness of person-level data received by CDC through national COVID-19 case surveillance. METHODS: We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts. Nationally, completeness in case surveillance records was highest for age (99.9%) and sex (98.8%). Data on race/ethnicity were complete for 56.9% of cases; completeness varied by region. Data completeness for each underlying medical condition assessed was <25% and generally declined during the study period. About half of case records had complete data on hospitalization and death status. CONCLUSIONS: Incompleteness in national COVID-19 case surveillance data might limit their usefulness. Streamlining and automating surveillance processes would decrease reporting burdens on jurisdictions and likely improve completeness of national COVID-19 case surveillance data.","Gold, Jeremy A W; DeCuir, Jennifer; Coyle, Jayme P; Duca, Lindsey M; Adjemian, Jennifer; Anderson, Kayla N; Baack, Brittney N; Bhattarai, Achuyt; Dee, Deborah; Durant, Tonji M; Ewetola, Raimi; Finlayson, Teresa; Roush, Sandra W; Yin, Shaoman; Jackson, Brendan R; Fullerton, Kathleen E",Public Health Rep,,391

The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tocilizumab in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The cure rate, changes of oxygen saturation and interference, and inflammation biomarkers were observed. Thirty-three patients were randomized to the tocilizumab group, and 32 patients to the control group. The cure rate in the tocilizumab group was higher than that in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (94.12% vs. 87.10%, rate difference 95% CI-7.19%-21.23%, P = 0.4133). The improvement in hypoxia for the tocilizumab group was higher from day 4 onward and statistically significant from day 12 (P = 0.0359).

In this context, it is also important to know the geographic extent of the infected population. Following this approach, a Gumpertz model was adapted with official data from the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, in order to estimate the people infected during this COVID-19 pandemic. We found, based on the adjusted data, the highest value in infected people according to official and theoretical data. Furthermore, using a geographical analysis based on geostatistical measures related to density of demographic and economic data, traffic level and geolocation, raster files were generated to estimate probability of coronavirus cases occurrence using the areas where the contagion may occur. We also distributed the maximum contagion obtained by the epidemic model, using these raster files, and a regression model to weight factors according their importance. Based on this estimated distribution, we found that most of the infected people were located in the southern border, a trend related to the economic strip in the southern part of Hidalgo State, associated with its vicinity to the Megacity of Mexico.","Hernández-Flores, Maria de la Luz; Escobar-Sánchez, Jair; Paredes-Zarco, Jesús Eduardo; Franyuti Kelly, Giorgio Alberto; Carranza-Ramírez, Lamán",,,391
228891,A multifactorial intervention to lower potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults in Argentina,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydrogen gas (H2 ) has entered the world of experimental therapeutics approximately four and a half decades ago. Over the years, this simple molecule appears to drive more and more scientific attention perhaps due to a dualism of H2 affirmative features demonstrated in numerous in vitro, animal and human studies on one side, and stillpuzzling mechanism(s) of its biological activity on the other. Up to this point, H2 was scrutinized for more than 170 different disease models and pathologies, and many research groups across the world have lately started to dynamically investigate its conceivable performance-enhancing potential. METHODS: We outlined here the studies indexed in leading research databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, JSTORE) that explored the effects of hydrogen on exercise performance, and also addressed important restraints, open questions, and windows of opportunities for forthcoming research and possible H2 enactment in exercise physiology. About two dozen trials have been identified in this domain, with most published during the past 5 years, while drinking hydrogen-rich water recognized as the most convenient method to deliver H2 in both animal and human studies. RESULTS: Either administered as an inhalational gas, enteral hydrogen-rich water, or intravenous hydrogen-rich saline, H2 seems to favorably affect various exercise performance outcomes and biomarkers of exercise-associated fatigue, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Not all studies have shown corroborative effects, and it appears that the gold-standard protocol for applying H2 in the field of exercise science does not exist at the moment, with studies markedly differ in the dose of H2 administered, the duration of a treatment, and the source of hydrogen. CONCLUSION: H2 is a newfangled and rather effective performance-enhancing agent yet its promising ergogenic potency has to be further validated and characterized in more well-controlled, appropriately sampled and long-term mechanistic trials. Also, appropriate regulation of hydrogen utilization in sport as an exotic medical gas may require distinctive legislative actions of relevant regulatory agencies in the future.","Ostojic, Sergej M",Curr. pharm. des,,391

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study involving young adult men who were qualified sperm donors at the Hunan Province Human Sperm Bank (China) during the pandemic wave (1 January 2020 to 30 January 2020) and after the wave and return to work (7 April 2020 to 30 May 30 2020). One hundred paired semen and blood specimens from 100 donors were included. One-step single-tube nested quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (OSN-qRT-PCR) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, to control the unacceptable risk of false-negative results, a second round of screening was performed with pooled RNA from negative semen samples using crystal digital PCR (cd-PCR). RESULTS: For individual blood and semen samples, the target genes, namely the nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame (ORF-1ab) genes, tested negative in all of the 100 paired samples. Further, as per cd-PCR results, there were >20,000 droplets per well in the RNA for each combined sample and no positive droplets were present for either of the aforementioned target genes. A total of 100 paired semen and blood samples from these two groups tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreserved semen at the Hunan Province Human Sperm Bank during and after the COVID-19 pandemic wave was free of SARS-CoV-2 and was judged safe for external use in the future.","Huang, Chuan; Zhou, Shuai-Feng; Gao, Li-Dong; Li, Shi-Kang; Cheng, Yu; Zhou, Wen-Jun; Huang, Zeng-Hui; Ji, Xi-Ren; Fan, Li-Qing; Zhang, Fan; Chen, Zi-Wei; Zhan, Zhi-Fei; Hu, Shi-Xiong; Wang, Shi-Ping; Ma, Xue-Jun; Zhu, Wen-Bing",Reprod. biomed. online,,391

However, its impact on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is unknown. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 61-year-old female RA patient who was receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated. The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved. Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications.","Song, Jehun; Kang, Seongmin; Choi, Seung Won; Seo, Kwang Won; Lee, Sunggun; So, Min Wook; Lim, Doo-Ho",Rheumatol Int,,391
234279,People with disabilities and other forms of vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic: Study protocol for a scoping review and thematic analysis,2020,"Scaling current cereal production to a growing global population will be a challenge. Wheat supplies approximately one-fifth of the calories and protein for human diets. Vertical farming is a possible promising option for increasing future wheat production. Here we show that wheat grown on a single hectare of land in a 10-layer indoor vertical facility could produce from 700 ± 40 t/ha (measured) to a maximum of 1,940 ± 230 t/ha (estimated) of grain annually under optimized temperature, intensive artificial light, high CO2 levels, and a maximum attainable harvest index. Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system. Nevertheless, maximum production potential remains to be confirmed experimentally, and further technological innovations are needed to reduce capital and energy costs in such facilities.","Asseng, Senthold; Guarin, Jose R; Raman, Mahadev; Monje, Oscar; Kiss, Gregory; Despommier, Dickson D; Meggers, Forrest M; Gauthier, Paul P G",Proc.

234923,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A View from New York City,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is reported in up to 27% of patients with COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dysregulated systemic inflammation and various patient traits are presumed to underlie this anomaly. Optimal VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients has not been established due to a lack of validated models for predicting VTE in this population. Our study aims to address this deficiency by identifying demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with increased VTE risk. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients (final sample, n = 355) hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia between March 1 and April 24, 2020. Demographic and clinical patient data were collected and factors associated with VTE were identified and analyzed using t-tests, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty patients (8.5%) developed VTE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels on admission (P = 0.045) and peak D-dimer levels (P < 0.0001), in addition to higher rates of vasopressor requirements (P = 0.038), intubation (P = 0.003), and death (P = 0.023). Age (OR 1.042), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 5.107), and need for intubation (OR 3.796) were associated with significantly increased odds of VTE. Peak D-dimer level was a good predictor of VTE (AUC 0.806, P < 0.0001) and a D-dimer cutoff of >6640 ng/mL had high (>70%) sensitivity and specificity for VTE. CONCLUSION: Peak D-dimer level may be the most reliable clinical marker in COVID-19 patients for predicting VTE and future prospective studies should attempt to further validate this.","Barnes, Drew H; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; DeJoy, Robert; Peterson, Eric; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Rangaswami, Janani; Carpio, Andres Mora; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),,391

The presented approach is applied to the analysis of COVID-19 mortality in the first wave affecting the Spanish Communities, since March 8, 2020 until May 13, 2020. An empirical comparative study with Machine Learning (ML) regression, based on random k-fold cross-validation, and bootstrapping confidence interval and probability density estimation, is carried out. This empirical analysis also investigates the performance of ML regression models in a hard- and soft-data frameworks.

Greece, however, presented a low burden of COVID-19 disease during the first pandemic outbreak. This is a retrospective study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Greece. Clinical data were extracted from medical records using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess the factors associated with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital death. Eighty-five patients were included in this study, 49 (57.7%) male with median (25th-75th) age 60 (49-72) years old. Sixty-one (72%) of them had at least one comorbidity with hypertension being the most common (45,6%).

235783,Healthy nutritional behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study,2021,"Besides our current health concerns due to COVID-19, cancer is a longer-lasting and even more dramatic pandemic that affects almost a third of the human population worldwide. Most of the emphasis on its causes has been posed on genetic predisposition, chance, and wrong lifestyles (mainly, obesity and smoking). Moreover, our medical weapons against cancers have not improved too much during the last century, although research is in progress. Once diagnosed with a malignant tumour, we still rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The main problem is that we have focused on fighting a difficult battle instead of preventing it by controlling its triggers. Quite the opposite, our knowledge of the links between environmental pollution and cancer has surged from the 1980s. Carcinogens in water, air, and soil have continued to accumulate disproportionally and grow in number and dose, bringing us to today's carnage. Here, a synthesis and critical review of the state of the knowledge of the links between cancer and environmental pollution in the three environmental compartments is provided, research gaps are briefly discussed, and some future directions are indicated. New evidence suggests that it is relevant to take into account not only the dose but also the time when we are exposed to carcinogens. The review ends by stressing that more dedication should be put into studying the environmental causes of cancers to prevent and avoid curing them, that the precautionary approach towards environmental pollutants must be much more reactionary, and that there is an urgent need to leave behind the outdated petrochemical-based industry and goods production.","Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,391

Existing studies mainly focused on the linear impact of the pandemic on the pollutants without considering the impact of other factors. To fill the research gap, the nonlinear relationship between pandemic and pollutants with considering the temperature factor was explored by developing panel threshold regression approach. In the proposed approach, the number of confirmed cases was set as explanatory variable, concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 were set as explained variables, temperature was used as threshold variable, and other air pollution indicators were used as control variables. The results showed that there is a threshold effect between the changes in confirmed COVID-19 cases and the concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, confirming the impact of the pandemic on pollutions was nonlinear. The results also show that the negative impact of pandemic on pollution increased when the temperature was rising. This work had theoretical and practical significance. The nonlinear research perspective of this article provided a methodological reference for exploring the relationship between epidemic and pollutant-related variables.

Herein, we report four patients with COVID-19 simultaneously diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. There were four stroke cases with simultaneously diagnosis of Covid-19 till the April 14, 2020 in the city of Sakarya, Turkey. They were aged between 45 and 77 years.

Three patients have elevated D-dimer levels, and two of them had high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. They were managed symptomatically for both the infection and the stroke. Our findings suggest that ischemic cerebrovascular diseases may simultaneously develop in the course of Covid-19 independently of the critical disease process. Increased inflammation predicted by CRP and D-dimer levels may play a role in the formation of ischemia. In particular, elder patients with prothrombotic risk factors should also be considered for the signs of cerebrovascular events in addition to infectious symptoms.","TunÇ, Abdulkadir; ÜnlÜbaS, Yonca; Alemdar, Murat; AkyÜz, Enes",J Clin Neurosci,,391

This review covers the literature until May 2020 centered on the early prediction of the viability of in vitro developed embryos using several analytical techniques, including NMR. Nowadays, the predominant non-invasive technique for selecting viable embryos is based on morphology, where variables associated with the rate of cleavage and blastocyst formation are evaluated by the embryologist following standardized criteria that are somewhat subjective. This morphological approach is therefore inadequate for the prediction of embryo quality, and several studies have focused on developing new non-invasive methods using molecular approaches based particularly on metabolomics. This review outlines the potential of NMR as one of these non-invasive in vitro methods based on the analysis of spent embryo culture media.","Salmerón, Ana M; Abreu, Ana Cristina; Vilches-Ferrón, Miguel; Fernández, Ignacio",NMR Biomed,,391

247387,An Emerging Paradigm for Psychiatric Practice in Integrated Care Amidst a Crisis,2020,"In this paper, I explore the economic activities of the food processing industry during the coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. One of the key lessons from food processing and related industries is that without being designated as an essential service and targeted stimulus packages, the food industry could have fallen victim to the COVID‐19 crisis. Although the social and economic impacts of the interventions are not clear, being designated as an essential service was likely far more important to the food industry than the targeted stimulus packages. The pandemic and shutdown orders had a considerable production reallocation effect. Some processors have seen temporary closure and reduced capacity utilization. On the upside, disruptions in the food processing sector have not been as severe as in non‐essential sectors. The food processing sector has proven to be relatively stable during the pandemic – food was still processed and delivered to consumers and food price increases were minimal in most cases given the scale of the shock. Moving forward, because COVID‐19 is a global crisis, internationally targeted and coordinated efforts to tackle the virus could place the industry on a strong trajectory towards economic recovery and growth.&lt;bold&gt;Résumé&lt;/bold&gt;Dans cet article, j'explore les activités économiques de l'industrie de la transformation des aliments pendant la pandémie COVID‐19. L'une des principales leçons tirées de la transformation des aliments et des industries connexes est que sans être désignée comme un service essentiel et visée par des plans de relance ciblés, l'industrie alimentaire aurait pu être victime de la crise du COVID‐19. Bien que les impacts sociaux et économiques des interventions ne soient pas clairs, être désigné comme un service essentiel était probablement beaucoup plus important pour l'industrie alimentaire que les plans de relance ciblés. La pandémie et les ordres d'arrêt ont eu un effet considérable de réallocation de la production. Certains transformateurs ont connu des fermetures temporaires et une utilisation réduite de leurs capacités. Les perturbations dans le secteur de la transformation des aliments n'ont pas été aussi graves que dans les secteurs non essentiels. Le secteur de la transformation des aliments s'est avéré relativement stable pendant la pandémie ‐ les aliments étaient encore transformés et livrés aux consommateurs et les augmentations des prix des denrées alimentaires ont été minimes dans la plupart des cas compte tenu de l'ampleur du choc. À l'avenir, parce que le COVID‐19 est une crise mondiale, des efforts coordonnés et ciblés au niveau international pour lutter contre le virus pourraient placer l'industrie sur une trajectoire solide vers la reprise économique et la croissance.

247848,Premature closure bias during the COVID-19 pandemic: A precautionary case report,2021,"The new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) emerged in 2019 and hence is often referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease causes hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is considered as the cause of a global pandemic. Very limited reports in addition to ex vivo model systems are available to understand the mechanism of action of this virus, which can be used for testing of any drug efficacy against virus infectivity. COVID-19 induces tissue stem cell loss, resulting inhibition of epithelial repair followed by inflammatory fibrotic consequences. Development of clinically relevant models is important to examine the impact of the COVID-19 virus in tissue stem cells among different organs. In this review, we discuss ex vivo experimental models available to study the effect of COVID-19 on tissue stem cells.","Chugh, Rishi Man; Bhanja, Payel; Norris, Andrew; Saha, Subhrajit",,,391

249056,Resource husbandry in challenging times,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infection can associate diverse neurological manifestations. Several studies have provided proof to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. Alpha-synuclein has been described as a native antiviral factor within neurons, and upregulation of this protein can be seen in animals that suffered other neuroinvasive infections. To assess if increased expression of this protein takes place in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms, we analyzed serum total alpha-synuclein levels in three groups: seven COVID-19 patients with myoclonus, Parkinsonism and/or encephalopathy; thirteen age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without neurological involvement and eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We did not find differences among them. In a subset of four patients, the change in serum alpha-synuclein before and after the onset of neurological symptoms was not significant either. Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein levels were also similar between neurological COVID-19 and healthy controls. Overall, these results cannot support the hypothesis of alpha-synuclein upregulation in humans with neurological symptoms in COVID-19. Further research taking into account a larger group of COVID-19 patients including the whole spectrum of neurological manifestations and disease severity is needed.","Blanco-Palmero, V A; Azcárate-Díaz, F J; Ruiz-Ortiz, M; Laespada-García, M I; Rábano-Suárez, P; Méndez-Guerrero, A; Aramendi-Ramos, M; Eguiburu, J L; Pérez-Rivilla, A; Marchán-López, A; Rubio-Fernández, M; Carro, E; González de la Aleja, J",J. neurol,,391

Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no successful therapeutics. The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on host cell membranes. Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2. Here we describe using humanized llama antibody VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies. From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified. Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking. Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains. Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 â¼ 36.7 nM, IC95 â¼ 12.2 nM, IC50 â¼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.","Dong, Jianbo; Huang, Betty; Jia, Zhejun; Wang, Bo; Gallolu Kankanamalage, Sachith; Titong, Allison; Liu, Yue",Emerg Microbes Infect,,391

250166,Approach to VIPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,2020,"Background: Development of successful neutralizing antibodies is dependent upon broad epitope coverage to increase the likelihood of achieving therapeutic function Recent advances in synthetic biology have allowed us to conduct an epitope binning study on a large panel of antibodies identified to bind to Ebola virus glycoprotein with only published sequences Methods and Results: A rapid, first-pass epitope binning experiment revealed seven distinct epitope families that overlapped with known structural epitopes from the literature A focused set of antibodies was selected from representative clones per bin to guide a second-pass binning that revealed previously unassigned epitopes, confirmed epitopes known to be associated with neutralizing antibodies, and demonstrated asymmetric blocking of EBOV GP from allosteric effectors reported from literature Conclusions: Critically, this workflow allows us to probe the epitope landscape of EBOV GP without any prior structural knowledge of the antigen or structural benchmark clones Incorporating epitope binning on hundreds of antibodies during early stage antibody characterization ensures access to a library's full epitope coverage, aids in the identification of high quality reagents within the library that recapitulate this diversity for use in other studies, and ultimately enables the rational development of therapeutic cocktails that take advantage of multiple mechanisms of action such as cooperative synergistic effects to enhance neutralization function and minimize the risk of mutagenic escape The use of high-throughput epitope binning during new outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic is particularly useful in accelerating timelines due to the large amount of information gained in a single experiment © The Author(s) 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Antibody Therapeutics","Yuan, T.

250916,Insights From COVID-Related Accommodation Requests (Alternate Work Assignments) by Clinical Staff at an Academic Medical Center,2020,"In 2020 the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic putting entire governments and civil societies in crisis mode. Around the globe unprecedented shortages of equipment and qualified personnel were reported in hospitals and diagnostic laboratories. When a crisis is global, supply chains are strained worldwide and external help may not be readily available. In Switzerland, as part of the efforts of the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, we developed a tailor-made web-based tool where needs and offers for critical laboratory equipment and expertise can be brought together, coordinated, prioritized, and validated. This Academic Resources for COVID-19 (ARC) Platform presents the specialized needs of diagnostic laboratories to academic research groups at universities, allowing the sourcing of said needs from unconventional supply channels, while keeping the entities tasked with coordination of the crisis response in control of each part of the process. An instance of the ARC Platform is operated in Switzerland (arc.epfl.ch) catering to the diagnostic efforts in Switzerland and sourcing from the Swiss academic sector. The underlying technology has been released as open source so that others can adopt the customizable web-platform for need/supply match-making in their own relief efforts, during the COVID-19 pandemic or any future disaster.","Courcol, Jean-Denis; Invernizzi, Cédric F; Landry, Zachary C; Minisini, Mikhaél; Baumgartner, Dieter A; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Chabriw, Barbara; Clerc, Estelle E; Daniels, Michael; Getta, Pavlo; Girod, Matthieu; Kazala, Kinga; Markram, Henry; Pasqualini, Axel; Martínez-Pérez, Clara; Peaudecerf, François J; Peaudecerf, Margit S; Pfreundt, Ulrike; Roller, Benjamin R K; Slomka, Jonasz; Vasse, Marie; Wheeler, Jeanette D; Metzger, César M J A; Stocker, Roman; Schürmann, Felix",Front Public Health,,391
251080,Post-COVID syndrome in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a longitudinal prospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undermines the benefits of cancer screening. To date, no study has identified specific infection control methods. We aimed to provide practical methods for COVID-19 risk reduction during breast cancer screening mammography (MMG) by examining an overview of potential contamination routes of aerosols and possible risks for patients and health care providers. METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for airflow and aerosol dispersion in a 3D virtual model of a mobile MMG laboratory room. This model was constructed based on the actual mobile screening MMG bus 'Cosmos' in the Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. Examiner and patient geometries were obtained by scanning an actual human using a 3D Scanner. Contamination of the room was evaluated by counting the numbers of suspended and deposited aerosols. RESULTS: We applied the CFD simulation model to the exhalation of small or large aerosols from a patient and examiner in the MMG laboratory. Only 14.5% and 54.5% of large and small aerosols, respectively, were discharged out of the room with two doors open. In contrast, the proportion of large and small aerosols discharged out of the room increased to 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively, with the addition of forced gentle wind by the blower fan. This simulation was verified by a mist aerosol experiment conducted in the mobile MMG laboratory. CONCLUSION: Adding forced ventilation to a MMG laboratory with two doors open may enable risk reduction dramatically. This could be applied to other clinical situations.","Takada, Mamoru; Tanaka, Gaku; Hashimoto, Hideyuki; Hirai, Yasuyuki; Fukushima, Taichi; Nagashima, Takeshi; Otsuka, Masayuki; Imazeki, Fumio",Breast Cancer,,391

Patients with cancer, already at risk for poor mental health outcomes, are not expected to be spared from these consequences, prompting the need for health services to improve responsiveness. This article presents the research protocol for an implementation study designed to describe the uptake of a well-studied and recognized system for the treatment of depression and anxiety (Stepped-care) during the specific context of a Pandemic in an oncological site. The system set-up will be assisted by a digital platform (MoodUP), where patients undergoing cancer treatment will be screened for anxiety and depressive symptoms, triaged by severity level and algorithm-matched to recommended interventions. Patients undergoing cancer treatment at a cancer clinic in Portugal will be invited to subscribe to the MoodUP platform where they will complete a self-reported questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to screen their anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data will be instantly collected, and an algorithm will activate severity-matched intervention suggestions, through a case manager that will coordinate care. The specific objectives of this study will be to describe the implementation and acceptability of the care system by patients and staff, the barriers to and facilitators of implementation, the proportion of patients accessing the system and their pathways through the various stepped-care interventions, and patient perceptions regarding the feasibility and appropriateness of the eHealth platform. Moreover, exploratory analyses will be conducted to describe patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms variation across all patients, as well as within sociodemographically, clinically and contextually characterized subgroups, to characterize their care needs and access, as well as to explore for whom the MoodUP care system may be more appropriate. This study is expected to improve processes for collaborative mental healthcare in oncology and accelerate the digitalization of services, towards the improvement of mental healthcare access, and management of high-risk patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Frasquilho, D.; Matias, R.; Gracio, J.; Sousa, B.; Luis-Ferreira, F.; Leal, J.; Cardoso, F.; Oliveira-Maia, A.

Current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have fueled ongoing efforts to exploit various viral target proteins for therapy, but strategies aimed at blocking the viral proteins as in drug and vaccine development have largely failed. In fact, evidence has now shown that coronaviruses undergoes rapid recombination to generate new strains of altered virulence; additionally, escaped the host antiviral defense system and target humoral immune system which further results in severe deterioration of the body such as by cytokine storm. This demands the understanding of phenotypic and genotypic classification, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 for the production of potential therapy. In lack of clear clinical evidences for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, comparative analysis of previous pandemic HCoVs associated immunological responses can provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the possible origin and transmission mode of CoVs and the current understanding on the viral genome integrity of known pandemic virus against SARS-CoV-2. We also consider the host immune response and viral evasion based on available clinical evidences which would be helpful to remodel COVID-19 pathogenesis; and hence, development of therapeutics against broad spectrum of coronaviruses.","Kirtipal, Nikhil; Bharadwaj, Shiv; Kang, Sang Gu",Infect Genet Evol,,391

264127,Trail Blazers Without Blades: Surgeons as Palliative Care Physicians in Response to COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: COVID-19 is public health concern across the world. Data on the epidemiology among patients on hemodialysis in Latin America and low and middle-income countries is limited. Methods: Using electronic medical records from the second largest dialysis network in Guatemala, we performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients on hemodialysis with the diagnosis of COVID-19 to estimate incidence of infection, and describe the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. We stratified incidence rate by region. We reviewed data from May 1 to July 31, 2020, with outcome data ascertained up to August 28, 2020. Results: Of 3201 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 325 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence rate: 102 per 1,000 patients on hemodialysis, compared with 3 per 1,000 in the general population). Incidence was higher in the Central region (207 per 1,000) and lowest in the Southeast region with 33 per 1,000, and unlike in the general population, incidence was lower in Guatemalan city. Mean age of the COVID-19 diagnosed patients was 51.1 (SD 14.8) years, and 84 (25.8%) were female. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days [IQR 10-16]. 229 (69.8%) of the patients recovered, 90 patients died (27.7%), and 6 (1.8%) patients were still in the hospital at the time of last follow-up. Conclusion: In summary, incidence of diagnosed COVID-19 in Guatemalan patients on hemodialysis was much higher than reported in the general population, with outcomes similar to those described in high income countries. Rural regions had higher incidence rates than the major metropolitan area.","Sosa, Regina; Garcia, Pablo; Cipriano, Ever O; Hernández, Agualuz; Hernández, Elmer E; Chavez, Paola I; Manchinelli, Angélica; Morales, Oscar A; Flores, Lourdes E; Romero, Hair J; Raquec, Yulany; Sapón, Byron F; Soch, Kevin E; Anand, Shuchi; Sánchez-Polo, Vicente",,,391
264618,A systematic scoping review of COVID-19 during pregnancy and childbirth,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this nationwide study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke hospitalization rates, patient characteristics and 30-day case fatality rates. METHODS: All hospitalizations for stroke from January to June of each year from 2017 to 2020 were selected using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes I60 to I64 in the national hospital discharge database. Patient characteristics and management were described according to three time periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. Weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed to compare time trends in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke as well as in-hospital and 30-day case fatality rates between the years 2017-2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, between weeks 1 and 24, 55,308 patients were hospitalized for stroke in France. IRRs decreased by up to 30% for all age groups, sex, and stroke types during the lockdown compared to the period 2017-2019. Patients hospitalized during the second and third weeks of the lockdown had higher in-hospital case fatality rates compared to 2017-2019. In-hospital case fatality rates increased by almost 60% in patients aged under 65 years.

METHODS: All hospitalizations for stroke from January to June of each year from 2017 to 2020 were selected using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes I60 to I64 in the national hospital discharge database. Patient characteristics and management were described according to three time periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. Weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed to compare time trends in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke as well as in-hospital and 30-day case fatality rates between the years 2017-2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, between weeks 1 and 24, 55,308 patients were hospitalized for stroke in France. IRRs decreased by up to 30% for all age groups, sex, and stroke types during the lockdown compared to the period 2017-2019. Patients hospitalized during the second and third weeks of the lockdown had higher in-hospital case fatality rates compared to 2017-2019. In-hospital case fatality rates increased by almost 60% in patients aged under 65 years. Out-of-hospital 30-day case fatality rates increased between weeks 11 and 15 among patients who returned home after their hospitalization.

267109,Emergency medicine residency training during COVID-19,2020,"AIMS: The risk to patients and healthcare workers of resuming elective orthopaedic surgery following the peak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been difficult to quantify. This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION: Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.

269768,Personal reflections of an emergency general surgeon on the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a life-threatening condition with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. The recent availability of treatment for ATTR-CM has stimulated increased awareness of the disease and patient identification. Stratification of patients with ATTR-CM is critical for optimal management and treatment; however, monitoring disease progression is challenging and currently lacks best-practice guidance. In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.","Garcia-Pavia, Pablo; Bengel, Frank; Brito, Dulce; Damy, Thibaud; Duca, Franz; Dorbala, Sharmila; Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Obici, Laura; Rapezzi, Claudio; Sekijima, Yoshiki; Elliott, Perry M",Eur J Heart Fail,,391

273763,COVID-19: Should sexual practices be discouraged during the pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Because of unknown features of the COVID-19 and the complexity of the population affected, standard clinical trial designs on treatments may not be optimal in such patients. We propose two independent clinical trials designs based on careful grouping of patient and outcome measures. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization ordinal scale on patient status, we classify treatable patients (Stages 3-7) into two risk groups. Patients in Stages 3, 4 and 5 are categorized as the intermediate-risk group, while patients in Stages 6 and 7 are categorized as the high-risk group. To ensure that an intervention, if deemed efficacious, is promptly made available to vulnerable patients, we propose a group sequential design incorporating four factors stratification, two interim analyses, and a toxicity monitoring rule for the intermediate-risk group. The primary response variable (binary variable) is based on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital by the 15th day. The goal is to detect a significant improvement in this response rate. For the high-risk group, we propose a group sequential design incorporating three factors stratification, and two interim analyses, with no toxicity monitoring. The primary response variable for this design is 30 day mortality, with the goal of detecting a meaningful reduction in mortality rate. RESULTS: Required sample size and toxicity boundaries are calculated for each scenario. Sample size requirements for designs with interim analyses are marginally greater than ones without. In addition, for both the intermediate-risk group and the high-risk group, the required sample size with two interim analyses is almost identical to analyses with just one interim analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend using a binary outcome with composite endpoints for patients in Stage 3, 4 or 5 with a power of 90% to detect an improvement of 20% in the response rate, and a 30 day mortality rate outcome for those in Stage 6 or 7 with a power of 90% to detect 15% (effect size) reduction in mortality rate. For the intermediate-risk group, two interim analyses for efficacy evaluation along with toxicity monitoring are encouraged. For the high-risk group, two interim analyses without toxicity monitoring is advised.","Rai, Shesh N; Qian, Chen; Pan, Jianmin; Seth, Anand; Srivastava, Deo Kumar; Bhatnagar, Aruni",BMC Med Res Methodol,,391

279260,Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Older Adults: Diagnosis and Management,2021,"In the era of social distancing to curb the spread of COVID-19, bubbling is the combining of two or more households to create an exclusive larger group. The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household have a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to an extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission; however, under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.

Thus, substantial effort has been put forth to understand the impact of COVID-19 on these patients. Patients with rheumatic diseases as a whole do not appear to be more susceptible to acquiring COVID-19. Furthermore, immunosuppression generally did not increase the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19, with the important exception of medium and high-dose glucocorticoid use. In addition, a small number of COVID-19 patients have developed new inflammatory arthritis; whether this represents an unmasking of previous subclinical disease or a bone fide virus-induced arthritis is unclear. Nevertheless, it appears that inflammatory arthritis patients currently on immunosuppression should continue their medication to prevent future flares and limit glucocorticoid usage. While this continues to be a rapidly evolving field, these data are reassuring to both patients with and providers treating inflammatory arthritides.","Conway, Richard; Konig, Maximilian F; Graef, Elizabeth R; Webb, Kate; Yazdany, Jinoos; Kim, Alfred H J",Transl. res,,391

In Brazil, the official surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) investigates influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (HAdV), and parainfluenza viruses (hPIV 1-3). In Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, many fatalities associated with SARI between 2013 and 2017 occurred among patients without underlying diseases and for whom the causative agent had not been identified using official protocols. This cross-sectional study analyzed the presence of coronaviruses (HCoV), bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus in patients who died of SARI despite not having comorbidities, and that were negative for IAV, IBV, RSV, HAdV, and hPIV. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs from patients were used for nucleic acid extraction. The presence of HCoVs OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E; HBoV; hMPV; and rhinovirus was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were also analyzed. Between 2013 and 2017, 16 225 cases of SARI were reported in RS; 9.8% of the patients died; 20% of all fatal cases were patients without comorbidities and for whom no pathogen was detected using standard protocols. Analysis of 271 of these cases identified HCoV in nine cases; HBoV, hMPV, and rhinovirus were detected in 3, 3, and 10 cases, respectively. Of note, patients infected with HCoV were adults. Results reinforce the importance of including coronaviruses in diagnostic panels used by official surveillance systems because besides their pandemic potential, endemic HCoVs are associated to severe disease in healthy adults.","Veiga, Ana B Gorini da; Martins, Letícia G; Riediger, Irina; Mazetto, Alix; Debur, Maria do Carmo; Gregianini, Tatiana S",J. med. virol,,391

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on center-based cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Justifiable concern exists that the exercise-related increase in pulmonary ventilation within the rehabilitation classes may lead to the generation of infectious respiratory particles. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is cardiopulmonary rehabilitation while wearing a procedural mask a particle-generating procedure? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively at a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation facility with all patients wearing a procedural mask. Small (0.3-4.9 µm) and large (5-10 µm) particle generation was quantified using a light-scattering particle counter. Data were analyzed by time, exertion level, and number of participants. RESULTS: A total of 24 distinct patients attended two or more of the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes tested. Most of the patients were men (n = 16 [67%]) and were in rehabilitation because of cardiac disease. During the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation class, small and large micrometer-size particles increased with increasing class size. In classes with four patients or more, a significant increase was found from ambient levels in both small (four patients, P < .01; and five patients, P < .01) and large (four patients, P < .01; and five patients, P < .01) particle count that peaked at about 35 to 40 min during each class.

The disinsertion of the PM would need increased contributions from intact shoulder musculature to generate shoulder torques. This study aimed to identify neuromuscular compensation strategies adopted by subpectoral implant breast reconstruction patients using novel muscle synergy analyses. Fourteen patients treated bilaterally with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction (>2.5 years post-reconstruction) were compared to ten healthy controls. Surface electromyography was obtained from sixteen shoulder muscles as participants generated eight three-dimensional (3D) shoulder torques in five two-dimensional arm postures bilaterally. Non-negative matrix factorization revealed the muscle synergies utilized by each experimental group on the dominant and non-dominant limbs, and the normalized similarity index assessed group differences in overall synergy structure. Bilateral subpectoral implant patients exhibited similar shoulder strength to healthy controls on the dominant and non-dominant arms. Our results suggest that 3D shoulder torque is driven by three shoulder muscle synergies in both healthy participants and subpectoral implant patients. Two out of three synergies were more similar than is expected by chance between the groups on the non-dominant arm, whereas only one synergy is more similar than is expected by chance on the dominant arm. While bilateral shoulder strength is maintained following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, a closer analysis of the muscle synergy patterns underlying 3D shoulder torque generation reveals that subpectoral implant patients adopt compensatory neuromuscular strategies only with the dominant arm.","Leonardis, Joshua M; Wolff, Whitney L; Momoh, Adeyiza O; Lipps, David B",J Biomech,,391
283337,Children and the Use of Emergency Departments During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Where Did the Pain End Up?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended behavioral measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing and wearing masks. Although many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHODS: We report preregistered analyses from a longitudinal study that investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse US adults across five waves from March to August 2020 (n = 596) and cross-sectionally in August 2020 (n = 405). RESULTS: Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits, and sociodemographic predictors (sample A, ß = 0.25; sample B, ß = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance, but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in sample A. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are less agreeable are at higher risk for noncompliance with behavioral mandates, suggesting that health messaging can be meaningfully improved with approaches that address these individuals in particular. These findings highlight the strong theoretical and practical utility of testing long-standing psychological theories during real-world crises.","Willroth, Emily C; Smith, Angela M; Shallcross, Amanda J; Graham, Eileen K; Mroczek, Daniel K; Ford, Brett Q",Psychosom Med,,391
284210,Different Hypercoagulable Profiles in Patients with COVID-19 Admitted to the Internal Medicine Ward and the Intensive Care Unit,2020,"Recommendations were made recently to limit or stop the use of oral and systemic immunotherapies for skin diseases due to potential risks to the patients during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we attempt to identify potentially safe immunotherapies that may be used in the treatment of cutaneous diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a literature review to approximate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including available data on the roles of relevant cytokines, cell subsets, and their mediators in eliciting an optimal immune response against respiratory viruses in murine gene deletion models and humans with congenital deficiencies were reviewed for viral infections risk and if possible coronaviruses specifically. Furthermore, reported risk of infections of biologic and non-biologic therapeutics for skin diseases from clinical trials and drug data registries were evaluated. Many of the immunotherapies used in dermatology have data to support their safe use during the COVID-19 pandemic including the biologics that target IgE, IL-4/13, TNF-&#945;, IL-17, IL-12, and IL-23. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that oral immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate and cyclosporine do not significantly increase the risk to patients. Most biologic and conventional immunotherapies, based on doses and indications in dermatology, do not appear to increase risk of viral susceptibility and are most likely safe for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The limitation of this study is availability of data on COVID-19.","Ghazawi, Feras M; Lim, Megan; Dutz, Jan P; Kirchhof, Mark G",Int J Dermatol,,391

290196,Protecting yourself and your patients from COVID-19 in eye care,2020,"Many socially valuable activities depend on sensitive information, such as medical research, public health policies, political coordination, and personalized digital services. This is often posed as an inherent privacy trade-off: we can benefit from data analysis or retain data privacy, but not both. Across several disciplines, a vast amount of effort has been directed toward overcoming this trade-off to enable productive uses of information without also enabling undesired misuse, a goal we term `structured transparency'. In this paper, we provide an overview of the frontier of research seeking to develop structured transparency. We offer a general theoretical framework and vocabulary, including characterizing the fundamental components -- input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance -- and fundamental problems of copying, bundling, and recursive oversight. We argue that these barriers are less fundamental than they often appear. Recent progress in developing `privacy-enhancing technologies' (PETs), such as secure computation and federated learning, may substantially reduce lingering use-misuse trade-offs in a number of domains. We conclude with several illustrations of structured transparency -- in open research, energy management, and credit scoring systems -- and a discussion of the risks of misuse of these tools.","Trask, Andrew; Bluemke, Emma; Garfinkel, Ben; Cuervas-Mons, Claudia Ghezzou; Dafoe, Allan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08347v1.pdf,391
290197,Protecting yourself and your patients from COVID-19 in eye care,2020,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals nationwide have implemented modifications to labor and delivery unit practices designed to protect delivering patients and healthcare providers from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Beginning March 2020, our hospital instituted labor and delivery unit modifications targeting visitor policy, use of personal protective equipment, designation of rooms for triage and delivery of persons suspected or infected with COVID-19, delivery management and newborn care. Little is known about the ramifications of these modifications in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether labor and delivery unit policy modifications we made during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with differences in outcomes for mothers and newborns. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries occurring in our hospital between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Patients who delivered in January and February 2020 before labor and delivery unit modifications were instituted were designated as the pre-implementation group, and those who delivered in March and April 2020 were designated as the post-implementation group. Maternal and neonatal outcomes between the pre-and post-implementation groups were compared. Differences between the two groups were then compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018 to assess whether any apparent differences were unique to the pandemic year. We hypothesized that maternal and newborn lengths of stay would be shorter in the post-implementation group. Statistical analysis methods included Student's T-tests and Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables and chi square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Results: Postpartum length of stay was significantly shorter after implementation of labor unit changes related to COVID-19. A postpartum stay of 1 night following vaginal delivery occurred in 48.5% of patients in the post-implementation group compared to 24.9% of the pre-implementation group (p<0.0001). Postoperative length of stay after cesarean delivery of &#8804;2 nights occurred in 40.9% of patients in the post-implementation group as compared to 11.8% in the pre-implementation group (p<0.0001). Similarly, after vaginal delivery, 49.0% of newborns were discharged home after one night in the post-implementation group compared to 24.9% in the pre-implementation group (p <0.0001). After cesarean delivery, 42.5% of newborns were discharged after &#8804;2 nights in the post-implementation group compared to 12.5% in the pre-implementation group (p<0.0001). Slight differences in the proportions of earlier discharge between mothers and newborns were due to multiple gestations. There were no differences in cesarean delivery rate, induction of labor, or adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: Labor and delivery unit policy modifications to protect pregnant patients and healthcare providers from COVID-19 demonstrate that maternal and newborn length of stay in the hospital were significantly shorter after delivery without increases in the rate of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. In the absence of longer-term adverse outcomes occurring after discharge that are tied to earlier release, our study results may support a review of our discharge protocols once the pandemic subsides to move toward safely shortening maternal and newborn lengths of stay.","Greene, Naomi H; Kilpatrick, Sarah J; Wong, Melissa S; Ozimek, John A; Naqvi, Mariam",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,391

With the available evidence suggesting that medical students' mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. This online, cross-sectional study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on perceived stress levels of medical students, investigate possible contributing and alleviating factors, and produce recommendations for medical schools to implement during future healthcare emergencies. The majority (54.5%) of respondents reported levels of stress ranging from moderate to extreme. Higher levels of stress were significantly associated with female gender (p=0.039) and international status (p=0.031).

Originality/value: There are no studies within the context of North Cyprus on the use of GM as a synchronous language learning tool for online distant programs. Though the use of GM is adjured effective and efficient, this contextual overview of GM is a new insight into academia. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ironsi, C.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.","Zhao, Yuxin; Cheng, Sixiang; Yu, Xiaoyan; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,,391

We show that the likelihood of a European energy company bond to be bought as part of the ECB's programme increases with the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of the bond issuing firm. We also find weaker evidence that the ECB's PEPP portfolio during the pandemic is likely to become tilted towards companies with anti-climate lobbying activities and companies with less transparent GHG emissions disclosure. Our findings imply that, at later stages of the COVID-19 recovery, an in-depth analysis may be necessary to understand if, and if yes why, the ECB fuelled the climate crisis.","Cojoianu, T F; Collins, E; Hoepner, A G F; Magill, D; O039,; Neill, T; Schneider, F I",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,391

305558,A Systematic Review on Precision Nutrition for Prevention and Management of Obesity during COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused suffering and death around the world. Careful selection of facial protection is paramount for preventing virus spread among healthcare workers and preserving mask and N95 respirator supplies. METHODS: This paper is a comprehensive review of literature written in English and available on Pubmed comparing the risk of viral respiratory infections when wearing masks and N95 respirators. Current international oral and maxillofacial surgery guidelines for mask and N95 respirator use, patient COVID-19 disease status, aerosol producing procedures were also collected and incorporated into a workflow for selecting appropriate facial protection for oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures during the current pandemic. RESULTS: Most studies suggest N95 respirators and masks are equally protective against respiratory viruses. Some evidence favors N95 respirators, which are preferred for high-risk procedures when aerosol production is likely or when the COVID-19 status of a patient is positive or unknown. N95 respirators may also be used for multiple patients or reused depending on the type of procedure and condition of the respirator after each patient encounter. CONCLUSION: N95 respirators are preferred over masks against viral respiratory pathogens, especially during aerosol-generating procedures or when a patient's COVID-19 status is positive or unknown.","Zhang, Mingzhu; Emery, Andrew Robert; Tannyhill, R John; Zheng, Hui; Wang, Jingping",J. oral maxillofac. surg,,391

Using time series on monthly electricity consumption and quarterly GDP and a multi-linear regression model, we performed an analysis of the evolution of these indicators for 2007–2020, a comparison between their behavior during the financial crisis vs. COVID-19 crisis, and empirically explore the relationships between GDP and electricity consumption or some of its components. The results of the analysis confirm that the shock of declining activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe negative impact on electric energy consumption and GDP in the first half of 2020, followed by a slight recovery. By using a linear regression model, long-term relationships between GDP and domestic and non-household electricity consumptions were found. The empirically estimated elasticity coefficients confirm the more important impact of non-household electricity consumption on GDP compared to the one of domestic electricity consumption. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of the study could be useful for optimizing energy and economic growth policies at the national and European levels.","Soava, Georgeta Mehedintu Anca Sterpu Mihaela Grecu Eugenia",Energies,,391

Further, surface tension, T, should be elevated and VILI is proportional to T. Surfactant therapy is effective in NRDS but not ARDS. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) is a potential alternative T-lowering therapeutic. In anesthetized male rats, we injure the lungs with 15 min of 42 ml/kg tidal volume, VT, and zero end-expiratory pressure ventilation. Then, over 4 hrs, we support the rats with protective ventilation - VT of 6 ml/kg with positive end-expiratory pressure. At the start of the support period, we administer intravenous non-T--altering fluorescein (targeting 27 mM in plasma) without or with therapeutic SRB (10 nM). Throughout the support period, we increase inspired oxygen fraction, as necessary, to maintain >90% arterial oxygen saturation. At the end of the support period we sacrifice the rat; sample systemic venous blood for injury marker ELISAs; excise the lungs; combine confocal microscopy and servo-nulling pressure measurement to determine T in situ in the lungs; image fluorescein in alveolar liquid to assess local permeability; and determine lavage protein content and wet-to-dry ratio (W/D), both to assess global permeability. Lungs exhibit focal injury. Surface tension is elevated 72% throughout control lungs and in uninjured regions of SRB-treated lungs, but normal in injured regions of treated lungs. Sulforhodamine B administration improves oxygenation, reduces W/D and reduces plasma injury markers.

310043,Impact of lockdown on emergency general surgery during first 2020 COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global anguish unparalleled in recent times. As cases rise, increased pressure on health services, combined with severe disruption to people's everyday lives, can adversely affect individuals living with chronic illnesses, including people with epilepsy. Stressors related to disruption to healthcare, finances, mental well-being, relationships, schooling, physical activity, and increased isolation could increase seizures and impair epilepsy self-management. We aim to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on the health and well-being of people with epilepsy focusing on exposure to increased risk of seizures, associated comorbidity, and mortality. We designed two online surveys with one addressing people with epilepsy directly and the second for caregivers to report on behalf of a person with epilepsy. The survey is ongoing and has yielded 463 UK-based responses by the end of September 2020. Forty percent of respondents reported health changes during the pandemic (nâ¯=â¯185). Respondents cited a change in seizures (19%, nâ¯=â¯88), mental health difficulties (34%, nâ¯=â¯161), and sleep disruption (26%, nâ¯=â¯121) as the main reasons. Thirteen percent found it difficult to take medication on time. A third had difficulty accessing medical services (nâ¯=â¯154), with 8% having had an appointment canceled (nâ¯=â¯39). Only a small proportion reported having had discussions about epilepsy-related risks, such as safety precautions (16%, nâ¯=â¯74); mental health (29%, nâ¯=â¯134); sleep (30%, nâ¯=â¯140); and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP; 15%, nâ¯=â¯69) in the previous 12â¯months. These findings suggest that people with epilepsy are currently experiencing health changes, coupled with inadequate access to services. Also, there seems to be a history of poor risk communication in the months preceding the pandemic. As the UK witnesses a second COVID-19 wave, those involved in healthcare delivery must ensure optimal care is provided for people with chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, to ensure that avoidable morbidity and mortality is prevented during the pandemic, and beyond.","Thorpe, Jennifer; Ashby, Samantha; Hallab, Asma; Ding, Ding; Andraus, Maria; Dugan, Patricia; Perucca, Piero; Costello, Daniel; French, Jacqueline A; O039,; Brien, Terence J; Depondt, Chantal; Andrade, Danielle M; Sengupta, Robin; Delanty, Norman; Jette, Nathalie; Newton, Charles R; Brodie, Martin J; Devinsky, Orrin; Helen Cross, J; Sander, Josemir W; Hanna, Jane; Sen, Arjune",Epilepsy Behav,,391

317376,Lockdown with a Price: The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Prenatal Care and Perinatal Outcomes in a Tertiary Care Center,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To compare the number of eye surgical procedures performed in Italy in the 2 months following the beginning of lockdown (study period) because of COVID-19 epidemic with those performed in the two earlier months of the same year (intra-year control) and in the period of 2019 corresponding to the lockdown (inter-year control). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of surgical procedures carried out at 39 Academic hospitals. A distinction was made between elective and urgent procedures. Intravitreal injections were also considered. Percentages for all surgical procedures and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) events were calculated. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 20,886 versus 55,259 and 56,640 patients underwent surgery during the lockdown versus intra-and inter-year control periods, respectively. During the lockdown, only 70% of patients for whom an operation/intravitreal injection was recommended, finally underwent surgery; the remaining patients did not attend because afraid of getting infected at the hospital (23%), taking public transportation (6.5%), or unavailable swabs (0.5%). Elective surgeries were reduced by 96.2% and 96.4%, urgent surgeries by 49.7% and 50.2%, and intravitreal injections by 48.5% and 48.6% in the lockdown period in comparison to intra-year and inter-year control periods, respectively. IRRs for RRDs during lockdown dropped significantly in comparison with intra- and inter-year control periods (CI: 0.65-0.80 and 0.61-0.75, respectively, p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: This study provides a quantitative analysis of the reduction of eye surgical procedures performed in Italy because of the COVID-19 epidemic.","dell039,; Omo, Roberto; Filippelli, Mariaelena; Virgili, Gianni; Bandello, Francesco; Querques, Giuseppe; Lanzetta, Paolo; Avitabile, Teresio; Viola, Francesco; Reibaldi, Michele; Semeraro, Francesco; Quaranta, Luciano; Rizzo, Stanislao; Midena, Edoardo; Campagna, Giuseppe; Costagliola, Ciro",Eur J Ophthalmol,,391

318180,COVID-19: A Barometer for Social Justice in New York City,2020,"Animal and plant biodiversity is decreasing. In contrast, the global direction and the pace of change in microbial, including viral, biodiversity is unknown. Important niches for microbial diversity occur in highly specific associations with plants and animals, and these niches are lost as hosts become extinct. The taxonomic diversity of human gut bacteria is reported to be decreasing. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 variation is increasing. Where microbes are concerned, Darwin’s “tangled bank” of interdependent organisms may be composed mostly of other microbes. There is the likelihood that as some classes of microbes become extinct, others evolve and diversify. A better handle on all processes that affect microbial biodiversity and their net balance is needed. Lack of insight into the dynamics of evolution of microbial biodiversity is arguably the single most profound and consequential unknown with regard to human knowledge of the biosphere. If some or all parts of microbial diversity are relentlessly increasing, then survey approaches may be too slow to ever catch up. New approaches, including single-molecule or single-cell sequencing in populations, as well as focused attention on modulators and vectors of vertical and horizontal evolution may offer more direct insights into some aspects of the pace of microbial evolution. © Copyright © 2021 Thaler.","Thaler, D.

318625,Family Communication in Long-Term Care During a Pandemic: Lessons for Enhancing Emotional Experiences,2020,"Public commentary has offered mixed opinion on the likely impact of COVID-19 restrictions on drug-related offending. On the one hand, it is argued that drug users ? and the drug markets in which they interact ? may have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed. Using crime data from the Australian state of Queensland, we use Auto-Regressive Integrated and Moving Average time series modelling techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. We find that reported drug offences significantly vary across time and location highlighting that the impact of COVID-19 is not universal across Queensland. Thus, the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented remains even in a major crisis with significant changes in policing activity and resource allocation. Our analysis has significant import for criminal justice practitioners in further understanding drug market dynamics and drug-related offending during COVID-19 restrictions.","Langfield, Cameron T.; Payne, Jason L.; Makkai, Toni",Journal of Criminology,,391

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testis tissue was collected from autopsies of COVID-19 positive (n=6) and negative men (n=3). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to immunofluorescence for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression. Fluorescent-labeled tissue slides were imaged on a quantitative pathology scope with various zoom levels allowing for qualitative and quantitative interpretation. Tissue from four COVID-19 positive autopsy cases and a live seroconverted patient was imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: H&E histomorphology showed three of the six COVID-19 biopsies had normal spermatogenesis while the remaining three had impaired spermatogenesis. TEM showed the COVID-19 virus in testis tissue of one COVID-19 positive autopsy case and the live biopsy, H&E stain on the same autopsy case demonstrated interstitial macrophage and leukocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescent stained slides from six COVID-19 positive men demonstrated a direct association between increased quantitative ACE-2 levels and impairment of spermatogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel COVID-19 has an affinity for ACE-2 receptors. Since ACE-2 receptor expression is high in the testes, we hypothesized that COVID-19 is prevalent in testes tissue of infected patients. This study suggests the male reproductive tract, specifically the testes, may be targets of COVID-19 infection. We found an inverse association between ACE-2 receptor levels and spermatogenesis, suggesting a possible mechanism of how COVID-19 can cause infertility.","Achua, Justin K; Chu, Kevin Y; Ibrahim, Emad; Khodamoradi, Kajal; Delma, Katiana S; Iakymenko, Oleksii A; Kryvenko, Oleksandr N; Arora, Himanshu; Ramasamy, Ranjith",,,391

321323,Pain Management in Home Health Care: Relationship With Dementia and Facility Admissions,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","Amanpour, S",Arch Razi Inst,,391

325191,COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers: Serological Findings Supporting Routine Testing,2020,"Bats act as a natural reservoir for many viruses, including coronaviruses, and have played a crucial epidemiological role in the emergence of many viral diseases. Coronaviruses have been known for 60 years. They are usually responsible for the induction of mild respiratory signs in humans. However, since 2002, the bat-borne virus started to induce fatal epidemics according to WHO reports. In this year, the first serious human coronavirus epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) occurred (China, 8098 cases, 774 deaths [9.5% of the cases] in 17 countries). The case fatality was higher in elderly patients above 60 years and reached 50% of the cases. SARS epidemic was followed 10 years later by the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia (in 2012, 2260 cases, 803 deaths [35.5% of the cases] in 27 countries). Finally, in December 2019, a new epidemic in Wuhan, China, (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged and could spread to 217 countries infecting more than 86,255,226 cases and killing 1,863,973 people by the end of 2020. There are many reasons why bats are ideal reservoir hosts for viral diseases such as the tolerance of their immune system to the invading viruses for several months. They can actively shed the viruses, although they develop no clinical signs (will be discussed in details later in the review). Bats were directly or indirectly involved in the three previous coronavirus epidemics. The indirect transmission takes place via intermediate hosts including civet cats for SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS. Although bats are believed to be the source of COVID-19 pandemic, direct pieces of evidence are still lacking. Therefore, coronaviruses' role in epidemics induction and the epidemiological role of bats are discussed. The current work also presents different evidence (phylogenetic data, animal experiments, bats artificial infection studies, and computerized models of SARS-CoV2 evolution) that underline the involvement of bats in the epidemiology of the pandemic.","El-Sayed, Amr; Kamel, Mohamed",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,391

Such life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heralded by virus-induced activation of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). MPs play substantial roles in aberrant immune secretory activities affecting profound systemic inflammation and end organ malfunctions. All follow an abortive viral infection. To elucidate SARS-CoV-2-MP interactions we investigated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages. While expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, paralleled monocyte-macrophage differentiation it failed to affect productive viral infection. In contrast, simple macrophage viral exposure led to robust pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression but attenuated type I interferon (IFN) activity.

RECENT FINDINGS: As in all areas of medicine, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound changes in reproductive endocrinology and infertility. However, the pandemic has encouraged providers and systems to change approaches and unmasked many opportunities that may have actually improved care. The pandemic also forced the field to provide society with fact-based information even as data was constantly emerging and evolving and to do so rapidly.Combating misinformation became an equally important effort and led to increased participation of providers using traditional and social media to provide the most reliable and up to date information.

Characterization is the estimation of infection spread parameters using daily counts of symptomatic patients. The method is designed to help guide medical resource allocation in the early epoch of the outbreak. The estimation problem is posed as one of Bayesian inference and solved using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The data used in this study was sourced before the arrival of the second wave of infection in July 2020. The proposed modeling approach, when applied at the country level, generally provides accurate forecasts at the regional, state and country level. The epidemiological model detected the flattening of the curve in California, after public health measures were instituted.

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most critical step to treat infection. The diagnostic tools are generally molecular methods, serology and viral culture. Recently CRISPR-based method has been investigated to diagnose and treat coronavirus infection. The emergence of 2019-nCoV during the influenza season, has led to the extensive use of antibiotics and neuraminidase enzyme inhibitors, taken orally and intravenously. Currently, antiviral inhibitors of SARS and MERS spike proteins, neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and EK1 peptide are the available therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In addition, Chloroquine, which was previously used for malarial and autoimmune disease, has shown efficacy in the 2019-nCoV infection treatment. In severe hypoxaemia, a combination of antibiotics, &#945;-interferon, lopinavir and mechanical ventilation can effectively mitigate the symptoms. Comprehensive knowledge on the innate and adaptive immune responses, will make it possible to propose potent antiviral drugs with their effective therapeutic measures for the prevention of viral infection. This therapeutic strategy will help patients worldwide to protect themselves against severe and fatal viral infections, that potentially can evolve and develop drug resistance, and to reduce mortality rates.","Seyed Hosseini, Elahe; Riahi Kashani, Narjes; Nikzad, Hossein; Azadbakht, Javid; Hassani Bafrani, Hassan; Haddad Kashani, Hamed",Virology,,391

Efforts to synthesize the evidence reach seemingly discrepant conclusions. METHODS: Systematic evaluations of seroprevalence studies that had no restrictions based on country and which estimated either total number of people infected and/or aggregate IFRs were identified. Information was extracted and compared on eligibility criteria, searches, amount of evidence included, corrections/adjustments of seroprevalence and death counts, quantitative syntheses and handling of heterogeneity, main estimates and global representativeness. RESULTS: Six systematic evaluations were eligible. Each combined data from 10 to 338 studies (9-50 countries), because of different eligibility criteria. Two evaluations had some overt flaws in data, violations of stated eligibility criteria and biased eligibility criteria (eg excluding studies with few deaths) that consistently inflated IFR estimates. Perusal of quantitative synthesis methods also exhibited several challenges and biases. Global representativeness was low with 78%-100% of the evidence coming from Europe or the Americas; the two most problematic evaluations considered only one study from other continents. Allowing for these caveats, four evaluations largely agreed in their main final estimates for global spread of the pandemic and the other two evaluations would also agree after correcting overt flaws and biases. CONCLUSIONS: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15% and ~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.","Ioannidis, John P A",Eur J Clin Invest,,391

Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3â), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage &#8805; 2/rectal cancer T stage &#8805; 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.","Chen, Y H; Peng, J S",Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,,391

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. OBJECTIVE: This article intends to use virtual screening and molecular docking methods to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from existing drugs. METHODS: To tack part in the current research investigation to define a potential target drug that may protect the world from emerged pandemic corona disease, we have carried out a virtual screening study by of 129 approved drugs that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating existing infections. Especially 12 drugs against chronic hepatitis B virus, 37 against chronic hepatitis C virus, 37 against human immunodeficiency virus, 14 anti-herpesvirus, 11 anti- influenza, and 18 others drugs currently on the market were considered for this study. Then these drugs were evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking studies in the active site of the (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (6lu7). Once the efficacy of the drug is determined, it can be approved for of their in vitro and in vivo activity against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that could be interesting for rapid clinical treatment of patients. These drugs were ranked for potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and those with high molecular docking scores are proposed as novel candidates for repurposing. The N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6lu7) and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor Lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Beclabuvir, Nilotinib, Tirilazad, Trametinib and Glecaprevir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its main protease. CONCLUSION: These promising drugs could inhibit the replication of the virus; hence, we suggest the repurposing of these compounds for thetreatment of COVID-19. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA. However, the assessment of these potential inhibitors as clinical drugs involves further in vivo tests for these drugs.","Chtita, Samir; Belhassan, Assia; Aouidate, Adnane; Belaidi, Salah; Bouachrine, Mohammed; Lakhlifi, Tahar",,,391
339932,Home care as a safe alternative in post-acute and long-term care during COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spatial and temporal lung infection distributions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their changes could reveal important patterns to better understand the disease and its time course. This paper presents a pipeline to analyze statistically these patterns by automatically segmenting the infection regions and registering them onto a common template. METHODS: A VB-Net is designed to automatically segment infection regions in CT images. After training and validating the model, we segmented all the CT images in the study. The segmentation results are then warped onto a pre-defined template CT image using deformable registration based on lung fields. Then, the spatial distributions of infection regions and those during the course of the disease are calculated at the voxel level. Visualization and quantitative comparison can be performed between different groups. We compared the distribution maps between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP), between severe and critical COVID-19, and across the time course of the disease. RESULTS: For the performance of infection segmentation, comparing the segmentation results with manually annotated ground-truth, the average Dice is 91.6% ± 10.0%, which is close to the inter-rater difference between two radiologists (the Dice is 96.1% ± 3.5%). The distribution map of infection regions shows that high probability regions are in the peripheral subpleural (up to 35.1% in probability). COVID-19 GGO lesions are more widely spread than consolidations, and the latter are located more peripherally. Onset images of severe COVID-19 (inpatients) show similar lesion distributions but with smaller areas of significant difference in the right lower lobe compared to critical COVID-19 (intensive care unit patients). About the disease course, critical COVID-19 patients showed four subsequent patterns (progression, absorption, enlargement, and further absorption) in our collected dataset, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: By segmenting the infection regions with a VB-Net and registering all the CT images and the segmentation results onto a template, spatial distribution patterns of infections can be computed automatically. The algorithm provides an effective tool to visualize and quantify the spatial patterns of lung infection diseases and their changes during the disease course. Our results demonstrate different patterns between COVID-19 and CAP, between severe and critical COVID-19, as well as four subsequent disease course patterns of the severe COVID-19 patients studied, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations.","Gu, Dongdong; Chen, Liyun; Shan, Fei; Xia, Liming; Liu, Jun; Mo, Zhanhao; Yan, Fuhua; Song, Bin; Gao, Yaozong; Cao, Xiaohuan; Chen, Yanbo; Shao, Ying; Han, Miaofei; Wang, Bin; Liu, Guocai; Wang, Qian; Shi, Feng; Shen, Dinggang; Xue, Zhong",BMC Med Imaging,,391

341222,Long COVID and the role of physical activity: a qualitative study,2021,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spate of studies showing a close connection between inequitable access to health care, welfare services and adverse outcomes from the pandemic. Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.","Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha; de Soysa, Indra",Scand J Public Health,,391
341592,"Pediatric Palliative Care in a Pandemic: Role Obligations, Moral Distress, and the Care You Can Give",2020,"AimsThe national lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have had a considerable effect on mental health, with reduced access to social interaction through work and leisure activities, and increased barriers to community mental health services.This study aims to evaluate how the presentation of patients with self-injury has changed during the first national U.K. lockdown, at a Plastic Surgery Tertiary Referral Centre in the East of England.MethodRetrospectively recorded data from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020, spanning the duration of the first two lockdowns in the UK, were compared to the same period in 2019. The demographics of patients, along with the nature, severity and outcomes of the self-injury were recorded and compared.ResultThe number of patients referred for self-injury reduced by 22.9% during lockdown (2020: N = 42/109, 2019: 67/109)The most common attendance route was via ambulance during lockdown (2020:40.5% 2019: 31.3%) whilst the most common attendance route being via the front door in 2019 (2019: 35.8%, 2020: 26.2%)The number of new presentations with no prior history of self-injury was higher in lockdown 38.1%) compared to 2019 26.9%.The lockdown cohort had a smaller proportion of patients presenting with complications (2020: 9.5% vs 2019: 17.9%), less readmitted (2020: 11.9% vs 2019: 23.9%). Similar re-attendance rate (2020: 40.3% vs 2019: 38.1%) and re-intervention (2020: 13.4% vs 2019: 14.3%).A greater proportion in 2020 met the threshold for inpatient psychiatry input (2020: 52.4% vs 2019: 41.8%).During the lockdown, a higher percentage of flexor tendon injuries involved multiple tendons (60.0% vs 52.2%). A higher percentage of extensor tendon injuries (14.3% vs 7.4%), and a greater proportion of these also involved multiple tendons (66.7% vs 40.0%). More self-injuries were complicated by fractures (7.1% vs 4.5%) and more required soft tissue reconstruction (11.9% vs 3.0%).ConclusionDespite fewer patients presenting with self-injury during the 2020 lockdown, the injuries were more severe. Many of which had multiple structural injuries, and some with life-changing injuries, this is in line with our clinical observations.During lockdown there was a higher proportion of first-time presentations without a history of self-injury and an increased need for inpatient psychiatry input. This may reflect the impact on mental health as a result of restricted social interactions.These findings demonstrate the impact of lockdown on mental-health and may help inform medical services of potential changes in the presentations in future national social restrictions.","Adams, Tobias Arnaout A.; Bickerton, S.; Li, L.; Reid, A.

341667,How accurate are digital symptom assessment apps for suggesting conditions and urgency advice? A clinical vignettes comparison to GPs,2020,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by progressive rise of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, which can lead to right ventricular (RV) failure. It is usually diagnosed late because of the nonspecificity of its symptoms. RV performance and adaptation to an increased afterload, reflecting the interaction of the PA and RV as a morphofunctional unit, constitute a critical determinant of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Therefore, early detection of dysfunction may prevent treatment failure. Cardiac MRI constitutes one of the most complete diagnostic modalities for diagnosing PH. It allows evaluation of the morphology and hemodynamics of the PA and RV. Several cine steady-state free-precession (SSFP)-derived parameters (indexed RV end-diastolic volume or RV systolic volume) and phase-contrast regional area change have been suggested as powerful biomarkers for prognosis and treatment. Recently, new cardiac MRI sequences have been added to clinical protocols for PH evaluation, providing brand-new information. Strain analysis with myocardial feature tracking can help detect early RV dysfunction, even with preserved ejection fraction. Four-dimensional flow cardiac MRI can enhance assessment of advanced RV and PA hemodynamics. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging may allow detection of replacement fibrosis in PH patients, which is associated with poor outcome. T1 mapping may help detect interstitial fibrosis, even with normal LGE imaging results. The authors analyze the imaging workup of PH with a focus on the role of morphologic and functional cardiac MRI in diagnosis and management of PH, including some of the newer techniques.

Due to a lack of reliable confirmatory laboratory tests, the diagnosis of KD is based on a characteristic pattern of clinical findings that appear in a typical temporal sequence. The diagnostic criteria have been periodically modified and the American Heart Association has proposed the most recent guidelines for its diagnosis. However, patients may have incomplete or atypical forms of KD and diagnosis can often be difficult. Because oropharyngeal manifestations are a common and important feature for diagnosing KD and recent studies have hypothesized a possible association between KD and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in this review we highlight the importance of dentists in the diagnosis of KD and its potential association with SARS-CoV-2.","Martelli Júnior, Hercílio; Machado, Renato Assis; Martelli, Daniella Reis Barbosa; Barbosa, Mauro Costa; Bonan, Paulo Rogério Ferreti; Coletta, Ricardo Della",Braz. oral res.

Methods: This study analysed patient admitted with hip fractures with COVID positive swabs, between March and May'2020 in three large hospitals covering a population of nearly two million. Data was collected on demographic profile, peri-operative variables, post-operative complications and mortality. The specific aim was to identify any variables, which could predict high 30-day mortality. Results: Overall, 12% of hip fractures were COVID positive with the mortality rate of 41.2%. The higher age (p = 0.036) and male gender (p = 0.025) was significantly associated with mortality and most of the deaths were between American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 3 and 4 patients. The patients having intramedullary (IM) nailing were more likely to die (p = 0.02). There was no difference in laboratory parameters but there was significant difference in findings on chest radiographs (p < 0.001), post-operative oxygen requirements (p = 0.006) and early respiratory complications (p = 0.006). Conclusion: This study suggests that the mortality following surgery for a hip fracture in COVID-positive patients is strikingly high and is associated with higher age and male gender. Higher mortality has been observed for extracapsular fracture operated with intramedullary nailing. In the immediate post-operative period, rapid deterioration of chest imaging, higher oxygen requirement and early pulmonary complications can serve as warning signs and predicting factors for higher mortality.","De, Chiranjit; Wignall, Alice; Giannoudis, Vasileios; Jimenez, Andrea; Sturdee, Simon; Aderinto, Joseph; Pandit, Hemant; Palan, Jeya; Gulati, Aashish",Indian J Orthop,,391

The claim is that COVID-19’s cultural dimensions include the phenomenon of weakened attachments to an originary homeland on the part, for example, of non-resident Danes and a concomitant strengthening of commitments to adopted homelands in Asia, such as Hong Kong. To understand these shifting allegiances, it is necessary to be attuned to the cultural virulence of COVID-19. In coining the term ‘cultural virulence’ I seek to draw attention to the ways in which the virus has been not only a source of contagion and illness, but a veritable engine of telling cultural revelations. In COVID-19’s cultural virulence we discover striking manifestations of painful national truths that we ignore at our peril. Careful scrutiny of COVID-19’s epiphanic moments brings to light Western arrogance and exceptionalism, a costly refusal to acknowledge the tried and tested efficacy of Asian practices.

Evacuation by aircraft may be an effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure. METHODS: We constructed a SETAIR (susceptible-exposed-transitional-asymptomatic-infectious-recovered) model to capture the epidemic growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the predicted number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents if evacuation had not occurred at the end of January. We used data on the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hubei Province for the period Jan 20-Feb 16, 2020, and on the number of cases of Japanese residents who were evacuated by aircraft on Jan 29, 30, and 31. RESULTS: Eleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents was estimated to reach 25 (95% CI [20,29]) on Feb 8 and 34 (95% CI [28,40]) on Feb 15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to 14 additional cases and a 2-week delay to 23 additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: Evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially to reducing the number of infected cases in the initial stage of the outbreak.","Asai, Yusuke; Tsuzuki, Shinya; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Ohmagari, Norio",J Infect Chemother,,391

Ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV), in particular, has been associated with a rare but fatal systemic disease. In recent months, it has become apparent that both minks and ferrets are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus and the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several mink farms have experienced SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and experimental models have demonstrated susceptibility of ferrets to SARS-CoV-2. The potential for pet ferrets to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, remains elusive. During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, it was also apparent that ferrets were susceptible to SARS-CoV and could be utilized in vaccine development.

By relying on systematic analysis following semi-structured interviews, the findings showed that newly acquired knowledge and skills in use of market intelligence, business plan writing and record-keeping were not only linked with entrepreneurial intentions, but it also emerged that the volatile context of the business environment influenced strategic decisions related to new business growth and survival. Research and policy implications were considered based on the findings.","Oluwatobi, Stephen Anosike Uchenna Paschal",Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,,391

Public health perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To survey perceived general and ear-nose-throat (ENT) symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to psychological impact, mental health, perception of information and demographic characteristics in quarantined subjects during a lockdown period in Italy. METHODS: Participants were 1380 respondents who completed an online survey. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between the independent variables and perceived symptoms. RESULTS: Participants reported different prevalences of perceived ENT and general symptoms. Coryza, cough, sore throat and tinnitus were the most common symptoms, and there was a low prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress compared with the psychological impact of the symptom. Comparison of the two symptom groups demonstrated a common need for updates, their relationship with the media and correct information about the route of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The health information provided during a disease outbreak must be grounded in evidence. This would help to prevent adverse psychological reactions and somatization symptoms that can engulf healthcare systems, especially in clinical areas like ENT, which frequently treat airway problems.","Micarelli, Alessandro; Granito, Ivan; Carlino, Pasquale; Micarelli, Beatrice; Alessandrini, Marco",J Int Med Res,,391
362343,Reorganising the emergency department to manage the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"The purpose of this study was to examine the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in people with no diagnosis of mental illness, as well as in people who were diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Moreover, this study aimed to investigate the interplay between PTSD symptoms and self-assessed mental health associated with well-being. The 210 participants were divided into 3 groups: mentally healthy, participants with diagnosed depression, and participants with anxiety disorders. To evaluate the subjective well-being of the participants, the Polish adaptation of the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) was applied. The Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to measure the severity of PTSD symptoms. At least a moderate worsening of PTSD symptoms was observed in participants of all groups. The results were as follows: healthy participants M = 37.35 (SD = 18.46); participants with depression M = 36.05 (SD = 18.02); participants with anxiety M = 44.52 (SD = 18.08). The participants diagnosed with depression showed the lowest level of mental well-being M = 41.58 (SD = 15.02). Conclusion: People diagnosed with depression had both the lowest level of well-being and the lowest severity of symptoms specific to PTSD. In all three groups, lower emotional well-being was linked to greater PTSD symptoms.","Golinska, Paulina Beata; Cieslak, Mariusz; Hubert, Olimpia; Bidzan, Mariola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,391
362717,A qualitative study of the views of healthcare professionals on providing vaccines information to patients,2021,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic occlusive vascular disease on anxiety with adverse outcome with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Material and methods: Three hundred and thirty-five patients who were treated for peripheral arterial occlusive disease were enrolled in this study. 187 patients who had undergone percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and 148 patients who had one or more surgical revascularizations enrolled in the study. Mean age of the patients was 62.6 ±10 years. Two hundred and eighty-nine patients were male, 46 patients were female. Physical and mental domains of quality of life were measured using the 36-item Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) self-administered questionnaire and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). At baseline 335 patients filled out the SF-36 and STAI, and 304 patients (90.7 % of the series) filled them out at 6-month follow-up. Results: There was no mortality and no significant morbidity after vascular interventions in the series. Significant improvement was found in two of eight health domains. The score of social functioning increased to 60.4 from 52.6 (p < 0.03) and general health perception increased to 75.1 from 60.5 (p < 0.04) at 6-month follow-up. The two STAI sub-scores, the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and the Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) were found high (&#8805; 40) both preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Postoperatively there was no significant decrease of the levels of anxiety. Conclusions: This study suggests that the assessment of psychosocial factors, particularly the ongoing assessment of anxiety, could help in risk stratification and prediction of functional status in patients suffering from lower extremity peripheral arterial occlusive disease.","Guzelhan, Yalcin; Oztas, Didem Melis; Conkbayir, Cenk; Rodoplu, Orhan; Erdinc, Ibrahim; Canbay, Cagla; Ugurlucan, Murat; Alpagut, Ufuk; Bozbuga, Nilgun",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,,391
363268,Critically Ill Neurologic Patients During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Short Communication,2021,"Since November 2019, SARS Coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread through more than 195 nations worldwide. Though the coronavirus infection affects all age and sex groups, the mortality is skewed towards the elderly population and the cause of death is mostly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are data suggesting the role of excessive immune activation and cytokine storm as the cause of lung injury in COVID-19. The excessive immune activation and cytokine storm usually occurs due to an imbalance in redox homeostasis of the individuals. Considering the antioxidant and free radical scavenging action of N acetyl cysteine (NAC), its use might be useful in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the cytokine storm consequently decreasing the disease severity. Therefore, we reviewed all the available resources pertaining to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine storm and the mechanism of action of NAC in preventing ROS. We also reviewed the use of NAC in COVID-19.","Mohanty, R R; Padhy, B M; Das, S; Meher, B R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,391

We then study the effectiveness of different vaccination methods (by vaccinating different susceptible compartments) within this model. Our results highlight the fact that the conditions at which a disease becomes extinct are considerably sensitive to the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination, and emphasize the need for efficiency in vaccination schemes.","Elgart, Shoshana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05605v1.pdf,391
373795,'Bleeding antibiotics': Negotiating care and trust in Turkish healthcare infrastructures,2021,"We develop online graph learning algorithms from streaming network data. Our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology, and effect memory and computational savings by processing the data on-the-fly as they are acquired. The setup entails observations modeled as stationary graph signals generated by local diffusion dynamics on the unknown network. Moreover, we may have a priori information on the presence or absence of a few edges as in the link prediction problem. The stationarity assumption implies that the observations' covariance matrix and the so-called graph shift operator (GSO -- a matrix encoding the graph topology) commute under mild requirements. This motivates formulating the topology inference task as an inverse problem, whereby one searches for a sparse GSO that is structurally admissible and approximately commutes with the observations' empirical covariance matrix. For streaming data said covariance can be updated recursively, and we show online proximal gradient iterations can be brought to bear to efficiently track the time-varying solution of the inverse problem with quantifiable guarantees.

377365,Review uncovers fatal flaws in long-term care infection control,2020,"Introduction: Training in Urology is often limited at an undergraduate level, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not uncommon that a trainee's first experience of Urology is when they encounter urological patients as a clinician and studies have revealed that graduates are lacking knowledge and confidence in managing urological pathology. Many trainees across the world are unable to access vital learning resources to address this gap in knowledge due to exorbitant prices set by publishing companies. Method: To address the need for affordable standardised education, 'Urology for Medical Students and Junior Doctors' was created. This self-published eBook was written and peer-reviewed by urologists to create a relevant learning resource that is affordable for all. Results: Over 1000 copies of the eBook were downloaded in the first 90 days after publication by trainees across the world. It has been downloaded internationally by a diverse range of allied healthcare professionals. All profits generated from sales are donated to charities investing in medical education. Conclusions: This eBook stands as an example of how we as educationalists and clinicians can produce affordable learning resources for trainees worldwide;standardising training, improving patient safety and reducing barriers to learning.","Ellis, R.",British Journal of Surgery,,391

Background: The measures initiated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have far-reaching consequences for the everyday life of people with dementia and their family carers. Both are usually among those who are the most vulnerable and thus are subject to rigorous restrictions. Their everyday life is made more difficult because care and respite services are currently suspended. In addition, people with dementia have difficulty understanding and implementing the restrictions and hygiene rules. AIMS: This study aims to describe the current life situation of family carers and people with dementia. METHODS: For this purpose, 21 telephone interviews with both family carers and people with dementia have been conducted twice during the spring of 2020 and were subsequently evaluated by a content analysis. RESULTS: The interviewees experienced the situation differently. Especially the social isolation, the higher amount of care, the uncertainty of the situation and the increase in psychological symptoms are described as being stressful. With regard to coping with the situation, discussions are taking place about the support from the social environment, alternative ways of communication, experiences with comparable crises, the stability of formal care and the handling of information. CONCLUSIONS: Family carers and people with dementia feel stressed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but many of them have coping strategies for this special situation. Informal support is a particularly important support mechanism.","Geyer, Jennifer; Böhm, Fabiola; Müller, Julia; Friedrichs, Juliane; Klatt, Thomas; Schiller, Christine; Kißlinger, Viktoria; Meyer, Gabriele; Heinrich, Stephanie",Pflege,,391

Aim of our study was to report on the prevalence of liver injury in our cohort, to evaluate the association of mild vs severe liver injury with mortality in COVID-19 patients and to scrutinize the temporal pattern of viral detection and liver injury. METHODS: We present data from a German cohort of 147 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The patients were divided into three groups according to their liver status during treatment. The first group included patients without elevated alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, the third patients meeting the biochemical criteria of acute liver failure (ALF) and the second all other patients. RESULTS: Liver injury was detected in 75 (50.7%) and 93 (63%) patients by admission and during treatment respectively. ALF was associated with the male sex, younger age and higher BMI. Mortality was associated with the presence of ALF (OR=9.423, 95%CI 2.410-36.858) in contrast to milder liver injury (OR 1.101, 95%CI 0.435-2.791). In 30% of patients with mild liver injury and in 50% of ALF patients, peak liver injury was observed at a time point, when the virus was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: Mild liver injury was not associated with worse outcome in our cohort and the pattern of liver injury did not fit well to the theory of SARS-CoV-2 directly causing liver impairment. Instead, severe liver injury in our cohort was associated multiple-organ failure and acute vascular events.","Anastasiou, Olympia E; Korth, Johannes; Herbstreit, Frank; Witzke, Oliver; Lange, Christian M",Dig. dis,,391

383234,The COVID-19 pandemic: The importance of physical activity among faculty members,2020,"Severe COVID-19 is associated with unprecedented thromboembolic complications. We found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) that recognize a complex consisting of platelet factor 4 and heparin similar to those developed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HIT), however, independent of heparin exposure. These antibodies activate platelets in the presence of TLR9 stimuli, stimuli that are prominent in COVID-19. Strikingly, 4 out of 42 antibodies cloned from IgG1 + RBD-binding B cells could activate platelets. These antibodies possessed, in the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3, an RKH or Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif that we recently described among platelet-activating antibodies cloned from HIT patients. RKH and Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motifs were prevalent among published RBD-specific antibodies, and 3 out of 6 such antibodies tested could activate platelets. Features of platelet activation by these antibodies resemble those by pathogenic HIT antibodies. B cells with an RKH or Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif were robustly expanded in COVID-19 patients. Our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives the development of a subset of RBD-specific antibodies that can activate platelets and have activation properties and structural features similar to those of the pathogenic HIT antibodies.","Zhu, W.; Zheng, Y.; Yu, M.; Wei, J.; Zhang, Y.; Topchyan, P.; Nguyen, C.; Janecke, R.; Kreuziger, L.

384381,COVID-19 in Pregnant Women: A Case Series,2020,"Despite the remarkable performance of deep learning methods on various tasks, most cutting-edge models rely heavily on large-scale annotated training examples, which are often unavailable for clinical and health care tasks. The labeling costs for medical images are very high, especially in medical image segmentation, which typically requires intensive pixel/voxel-wise labeling. Therefore, the strong capability of learning and generalizing from limited supervision, including a limited amount of annotations, sparse annotations, and inaccurate annotations, is crucial for the successful application of deep learning models in medical image segmentation. However, due to its intrinsic difficulty, segmentation with limited supervision is challenging and specific model design and/or learning strategies are needed. In this paper, we provide a systematic and up-to-date review of the solutions above, with summaries and comments about the methodologies. We also highlight several problems in this field, discussed future directions observing further investigations.","Peng, Jialin; Wang, Ye",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00429v1.pdf,391

Art is a highly engaging tool that promotes positive well-being and increases community engagement and participation. The 'Create Hope Mural' campaign emerged as an arts-based health promotion response to inspire dialogue on why hope is so important for Canadians during these challenging times. This initiative is a partnership between a health promotion network based in Vancouver and an 'open air' art museum based in Toronto. Families were invited to submit artwork online that represents the concept of hope. This paper discusses the reflections of organizers of this arts-based health promotion initiative during the early months of the pandemic in Canada. Our findings reveal the importance of decolonizing practices, centring the voices of those impacted by crisis, while being attentive to the social and political context.

385208,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilisation of healthcare services: a systematic review,2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound changes to healthcare systems as well as had deleterious repercussions on the care of cancer patients. In this comparative study, we sought to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical management of breast cancer in a breast unit in an Italian region with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection. Eighty-three patients were included, of whom 41 received surgery during the height of the pandemic (Group A, operated on between March and April 2020), and 42 during the same period of the year in 2019 (Group B). Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.62), tumour size (p = 0.25), grade (p = 0.27), histology (p = 0.43), positive lymph node status (p = 0.35), and ER positive status (0.35). Waiting time for surgery was slightly longer in Group A (49.11 vs. 46.39 days, p = 0.38). Patients receiving immediate breast reconstruction were significantly less in Group A (p < 0.001). The use of sentinel node biopsy was similar in the two groups (p = 0.84). Hospital stay was longer in patients of Group B (p = 0.008). The use of regional nerve blocks was lower in Group A (p < 0.001). Patients operated on during the height of the pandemic were less likely to receive immediate reconstruction and regional nerve blocks during surgery. These features configure a situation of reduced level of care for patients with breast cancer. Efforts should be taken by the healthcare systems to maintain standard of care, even in case of a new peak in the coronavirus outbreak.","Fancellu, Alessandro; Sanna, Valeria; Rubino, Corrado; Ariu, Maria Laura; Piredda, Claudia; Piana, Gian Quirico; Cottu, Pietrina; Spanu, Angela; Cossu, Antonio; Deiana, Giulia; Porcu, Alberto",,,391

One population that has been scarcely studied is non-neutropenic patients admitted specifically to medical ICUs. Even less is known about the broader category of medical ICU patients without active oncological disease. This group constitutes a very large share of the patients requiring critical care across the globe, especially in the era of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. PATIENTS/METHODS: We analyzed medical ICU candidemia episodes that occurred in non-oncological patients in our tertiary academic center in the United States from May 2014 to October 2020 to determine the incidence and species distribution of the associated isolates. We then separately considered non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases and compared their characteristics. RESULTS: In the non-COVID-19 group, there were 38 cases for an incidence of 1.1% and rate of 11/1000 admissions. In the COVID-19 group, there were 12 cases for an incidence of 5.1% and rate of 51/1000 admissions. In the entire sample, as well as separately in the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups, Candida albicans accounted for a minority of isolates. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients with candidemia, COVID-19 patients had lower ICU admission SOFA score but longer ICU length of stay and central venous catheter dwell time at candidemia detection. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insight into the incidence and species distribution of candidemia cases occurring in non-oncological critically ill patients and identifies informative differences between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients.","Macauley, Precious; Epelbaum, Oleg",Mycoses,,391

The questionnaire comprised a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their concerns, and the measures taken in dental clinics against COVID-19. This study included a total of 1,958 Turkish dentists. A total of 1,274 (65.1%) were general dentists, and 684 (34.9%) were specialists. Five hundred twenty-two (26.7%) dentists attended an informational meeting on COVID-19. Of these dentists, 69.8% were aware of COVID-19 according to their self-assessed knowledge scores.

For January-April 2020 period, time series of daily average inhalable gaseous pollutants ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), together climate variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation rate, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer) were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, and climate conditions have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Exhibited positive correlations of ambient ozone levels and negative correlations of NO2 with the increased rates of COVID-19 infections (Total number, Daily New positive and Total Deaths cases), can be attributed to airborne bioaerosols distribution. The results show positive correlation of daily averaged O3 with air temperature and inversely correlations with relative humidity and precipitation rates. Viral genome contains distinctive features, including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein, which allows coronavirus attachment on ambient air pollutants. At this moment it is not clear if through airborne diffusion, in the presence of outdoor and indoor aerosols, this protein ""spike"" of the new COVID-19 is involved in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host during the highest nosocomial outbreak in some agglomerated industrialized urban areas like Milan is. Also, in spite of collected data for cold season (winter-early spring) period, when usually ozone levels have lower values than in summer, the findings of this study support possibility as O3 can acts as a COVID-19 virus incubator. Being a novel pandemic coronavirus version, it might be ongoing during summer conditions associated with higher air temperatures, low relative humidity and precipitation levels.","Zoran, Maria A; Savastru, Roxana S; Savastru, Dan M; Tautan, Marina N",Sci Total Environ,,391

OBJECTIVES: We explored perceived changes in alcohol consumption, their association with sociodemographic characteristics and past year alcohol consumption, and self-reported reasons for change after CO-VID-19 restrictions in Norway. METHOD: A web-based survey was sent to Norwegians aged 18 years and older in June-July 2020. Respondents reporting any past year alcohol use (n = 1,200) were asked whether they drank less, approximately the same, or more after the COVID-19 restrictions compared to before and reasons for drinking less or more. RESULTS: Almost a third (29.9%) reported they drank less, whereas 13.3% reported they drank more. Females, younger respondents, and Oslo residents were more likely to report both less and more drinking (p values between 0.001 and 0.029). Past year alcohol use was associated with less drinking (OR = 0.93; p < 0.001) and more drinking (OR = 1.07; p < 0.001). More drinking was also associated with living with child(ren) (p = 0.023) and high educational level (p = 0.029). The most frequently reported reasons for drinking less pertained to fewer social occasions and less on-premise drinking, whereas reasons for drinking more pertained to treating oneself to something good and fewer consequences of drinking more. CONCLUSIONS: After the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented, a substantial proportion of Norwegians changed their drinking behaviour.","Bramness, Jørgen G; Bye, Elin K; Moan, Inger Synnøve; Rossow, Ingeborg",Eur Addict Res,,391

AIM: To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of HPs. METHOD: We comprehensively reviewed the studies published in MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science and Google Scholar between December 2019 and May 2020. RESULTS: Most studies report a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among HPs that can be associated with: a) COVID-19 exposure; b) epidemiological issues; c) material resources; d) human resources; and e) personal factors. The role of certain variables, before, during and after the pandemic, remains unexplored. Longitudinal studies will help elucidate which factors are associated with a higher risk of developing long-lasting negative effects. Qualitative studies may contribute to understanding the influence of individual and social narratives in HPs' distress. CONCLUSION: A deeper analysis on the individual, institutional, political and socio-cultural factors, meanings and values influencing HPs distress and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed.","Braquehais, Maria Dolores; Vargas-Cáceres, Sebastián; Gómez-Durán, Esperanza; Nieva, Gemma; Valero, Sergi; Casas, Miquel; Bruguera, Eugeni",QJM,,391

393639,Estimating the impact of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the latest pandemic of the digital age. With the internet harvesting large amounts of data from the general population in real time, public databases such as Google Trends (GT) and the Baidu Index (BI) can be an expedient tool to assist public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine the utility of providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS: An epidemiologic time series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020, to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was used for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain, and the US states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS: Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia and ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r>0.60, P<.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated real-world confirmed cases by 12 days (r=0.85, SD 0.10 and r=0.76, SD 0.09, respectively, P<.001). Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag greater than 1 week compared to new daily cases, while searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of digital epidemiology in providing helpful surveillance data of disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Although certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.","Higgins, Thomas S; Wu, Arthur W; Sharma, Dhruv; Illing, Elisa A; Rubel, Kolin; Ting, Jonathan Y",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,391

(Special section: From the FIGO Safe Motherhood & Newborn Health Committee.),2020,"Severe COVID-19 is accompanied by rampant immune dysregulation in the lung and periphery, with immune cells of both compartments contributing to systemic distress. The extent to which immune cells of the lung and blood enter similar or distinct pathological states during severe disease remains unknown. Here, we leveraged 96 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to elucidate common and compartment-specific features of severe-to-critical COVID-19 at the levels of transcript expression, biological pathways, and ligand-receptor signaling networks. Comparing severe patients to milder and healthy donors, we identified distinct differential gene expression signatures between compartments but a core set of co-directionally regulated surface markers. A majority of severity-enriched pathways were shared, while TNF and interferon responses were polarized. Severity-specific ligand-receptor networks appeared to be differentially active in both compartments. Overall, our results describe a nuanced response during severe COVID-19 where compartment plays a role in dictating the pathological state of immune cells.","Overholt, Kalon J; Krog, Jonathan R; Zanoni, Ivan; Bryson, Bryan D",iScience,,391
400649,Mitigating Inequities and Saving Lives with ICU Triage during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Extracellular RNAs participate in intercellular communication, and are being studied as promising minimally invasive diagnostic markers. Several studies in recent years showed that tRNA halves and distinct Y RNA fragments are abundant in the extracellular space, including in biofluids. While their regulatory and diagnostic potential has gained a substantial amount of attention, the biogenesis of these extracellular RNA fragments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that these fragments are produced by RNase 1, a highly active secreted nuclease. We use RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of a null mutation of RNase 1 on the levels of tRNA halves and Y RNA fragments in the extracellular environment of cultured human cells. We complement and extend our RNA sequencing results with northern blots, showing that tRNAs and Y RNAs in the non-vesicular extracellular compartment are released from cells as full-length precursors and are subsequently cleaved to distinct fragments. In support of these results, formation of tRNA halves is recapitulated by recombinant human RNase 1 in our in vitro assay. These findings assign a novel function for RNase 1, and position it as a strong candidate for generation of tRNA halves and Y RNA fragments in biofluids.","Nechooshtan, Gal; Yunusov, Dinar; Chang, Kenneth; Gingeras, Thomas R",Nucleic acids res,,391

The whole world is trying to overcome this pandemic situation. A better health care quality may help a country to tackle the pandemic. Making clusters of countries with similar types of health care quality provides an insight into the quality of health care in different countries. In the area of machine learning and data science, the K-means clustering algorithm is typically used to create clusters based on similarity. In this paper, we propose an efficient K-means clustering method that determines the initial centroids of the clusters efficiently. Based on this proposed method, we have determined health care quality clusters of countries utilizing the COVID-19 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method reduces the number of iterations and execution time to analyze COVID-19 while comparing with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm.","Zubair, Md.; Iqbal, MD.Asif; Shil, Avijeet; Haque, Enamul; Hoque, Mohammed Moshiul; Sarker, Iqbal H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03140v1.pdf,391

402233,Collateral Damage of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Nutritional Quality and Physical Activity: Perspective from South Korea,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused pneumonia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and spread all over the world. Patients with COVID-19 showed huge differences in the hospital stay, progression, and prognosis. As reported, the comorbidities may play an important role in COVID-19. Here, we aim to address the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-three confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into CVD (n = 42) and non-CVD (n = 41) group according to their medical history. Medical records including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT), and treatment measures were collected, analyzed, and compared between the two groups. COVID-19 patients with CVD showed (1) more severe pathological changes in the lungs, (2) elevated injury-related enzymes including &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HDBH), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (3) significantly increased uncontrolled inflammation related markers, such as c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum amyloid A (SAA), (4) serious hypercoagulable status reflected by increased D-dimer and serum fibrinogen (FIB), and (5) higher mortality, compared to COVID-19 patients without CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that CVD is a strong risk factor for rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive medical care should be applied to patients with CVD to prevent rapid deterioration of the disease.","Li, Mingyue; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Haijun; Guo, Weina; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Tian, Chunxia; Du, Keye; Zhu, Rui; Wang, Li; Zhao, Lei; Fan, Heng; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,391

METHODS: Point seroprevalence study of nursing homes to describe the demography and characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive residents and staff. RESULTS: Clinical information and blood samples were available for 9,332 residents (mean age 86.7 ± 8.1 years, 76.4% women) and 10,614 staff (mean age 45.6 ± 11.5, 86.2% women). Up to 84.4% of residents had frailty, 84.9% co-morbidity and 69.3% cognitive impairment; 65.2% of workers were health-aides. COVID-19 seroprevalence was 55.4% (95% CI, 54.4-56.4) for older adults and 31.5% (30.6-32.4) for staff. In multivariable analysis frailty of residents was related with seropositivity (OR: 1.19, p = 0.02). In the case of staff, age > 50 years (2.10, p < 0.001), obesity (1.19, p = 0.01), being a health-aide (1.94, p < 0.001), working in a center with high seroprevalence in residents (3.49, p < 0.001), and contact with external cases of COVID-19 (1.52, p < 0.001) were factors associated with seropositivity. Past symptoms of COVID-19 were good predictors of seropositivity for residents (5.41, p < 0.001) and staff (2.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Level of dependency influences risk of COVID-19 among residents.

404955,Caring for the carers: Advice for dealing with sleep problems of hospital staff during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"The rapid growth of information and communication technology has led to impressive growth of online higher education worldwide. Indonesia has strategically adopted online education to increase the participation rate in higher education, and to provide alternative means to develop human resources in this era of the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0. The growth has been amplified by the coronavirus disease, which requires less-contact activities. Although online education is considerably new and offers a different practice in teaching and learning in Indonesia, it is expected to deliver significant increased access to quality and comparable higher education at reduced costs. Quality becomes the key issue to online education, especially in a time of emergency remote learning from home during the pandemic. With its flexible and virtual nature, the demand for evidence of quality in online education is higher than with conventional education. In order to assure quality of online education, the Government of Indonesia has established a national quality assurance center called Indonesia Cyber Education Institute, which is designed to be a marketplace for online education in Indonesia to assure quality in its online education.

Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhesion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings. This is an overview on the expected influence of the COVID-19 on mental health from a research group that has not long ago been involved in the Zika epidemic.

In doing so, we argue that we are currently presented with a window of opportunity to better address the social determinants of health. First, through assessing the problem stream, an understanding of inequity as a problem gained wider recognition through the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19. Second, in the policy stream, we demonstrate that appropriate and unprecedented policies can be enacted even in the face of changing evidence or evidentiary uncertainty, which are needed to address upstream factors that influence health. Lastly, in the politics stream, we demonstrate that addressing a public health 'problem' can be well-received by the public, making it politically viable. However, it is important to ensure the 'problem' is clearly relayed to the public and that this information is not perceived to change, as this can undermine trust. The social, political, and behavioural lessons presented by the COVID-19 pandemic should be drawn on in this pivotal moment for global public health.","Amri, Michelle M; Logan, Dilani",Glob Public Health,,391

This study attempts to describe the social behavior of people in poverty line toward COVID-19 case in Makassar. METHOD: This research is a qualitative descriptive study based on the case. The data analysis was undertaken qualitatively. RESULTS: The results revealed that the limited understanding of people in poverty line about COVID-19 and health protocols makes their behavior indifferent and disobedient to health protocols. In addition, the government's top-down approach to deal with COVID-19 pandemic was ineffective.

We sought to assess the risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic period and compare the risks with those undergoing CABG before the pandemic in the year 2019. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the TriNetX Research Network database was performed. Patients undergoing CABG between January 20, 2019, and September 15, 2019, contributed to the 2019 cohort, and those undergoing CABG between January 20, 2020, and September 15, 2020, contributed to the 2020 cohort. Propensity-score matching was performed, and the odds of mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mechanical ventilation occurring by 30 days were evaluated. Results: The number of patients undergoing CABG in 2020 declined by 35.5% from 5534 patients in 2019 to 3569 patients in 2020. After propensity-score matching, 3569 patient pairs were identified in the 2019 and the 2020 cohorts. Compared with those undergoing CABG in 2019, the odds of mortality by 30 days were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.33; P = .80) in those undergoing CABG in 2020.

407671,"Prioritizing elective cardiovascular procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: The cardiovascular medically necessary, time-sensitive procedure scorecard",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Because of inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function in people with age-related memory complaints, we examined how self-reports of sleep quality were related to multiple domains of both objective and subjective cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study involving analysis of baseline data, collected as part of a clinical trial. MEASUREMENTS: Two hundred and three participants (mean age = 60.4 [6.5] years, 69.0% female) with mild memory complaints were asked to rate their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and their memory performance using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), which measures self-awareness of memory ability. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Trail Making Test, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, and the Brief Visuospatial Test - Revised (BVMT-R). RESULTS: Total PSQI scores were significantly associated with objective measures of sustained attention (CPT hit reaction time by block and standard error by block) and subjective memory loss (MFQ frequency and seriousness of forgetting). The PSQI components of (poorer) sleep quality and (greater) sleep disturbance were related to (worse) sustained attention scores while increased sleep latency and daytime sleepiness were associated with greater frequency and seriousness of forgetting. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality is related to both objective measures of sustained attention and self-awareness of memory decline. These findings suggest that interventions for improving sleep quality may contribute not only to improving the ability to focus on a particular task but also in reducing memory complaints in middle-aged and older adults.","Siddarth, Prabha; Thana-Udom, Kitikan; Ojha, Rashi; Merrill, David; Dzierzewski, Joseph M; Miller, Karen; Small, Gary W; Ercoli, Linda",Int Psychogeriatr,,391

We used nationally-representative data to assess dispensing of select substance use and mental health medications during the pandemic in the U.S. METHODS: IQVIA Total Patient Tracker data were used to calculate U.S. monthly numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine, extended-release (ER) intramuscular naltrexone, naloxone, selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and for comparison, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) between January 2019-May 2020. Forecasted estimates of number of unique patients dispensed medications, generated by exponential smoothing statistical forecasting, were compared to actual numbers of patients by month to examine access during mitigation measures (March 2020-May 2020). RESULTS: Between March 2020-May 2020, numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine and numbers dispensed naloxone were within forecasted estimates. Numbers dispensed ER intramuscular naltrexone were significantly below forecasted estimates in March 2020 (-1039; 95 %CI:-1528 to -550), April 2020 (-2139; 95 %CI:-2629 to -1650), and May 2020 (-2498; 95 %CI:-2987 to -2009). Numbers dispensed antidepressants and benzodiazepines were significantly above forecasted estimates in March 2020 (977,063; 95 %CI:351,384 to 1,602,743 and 450,074; 95 % CI:189,999 to 710,149 additional patients, respectively), but were within forecasted estimates in April 2020-May 2020. Dispensing patterns for statins and ARBs were similar to those for antidepressants and benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use and mental health underscore the need for innovative strategies to facilitate continued access to treatment.","Jones, Christopher M; Guy, Gery P; Board, Amy",Drug Alcohol Depend,,391

Making vaccination mandatory might contribute to increasing vaccine coverage although this measure could induce reactance. Our aim was to evaluate attitudes to mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in France. Our aim was to evaluate attitudes of toward COVID-19 mandatory vaccination in France. MethodsBetween the 10th and the 23rd of May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a representative sample of the French population aged 18 and over participants. ResultsAmong 3,056 respondents, 1,314 (43.0 %) were in favor of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination, 1,281 (41.9 %) were opposed to such a policy, and 461 (15.1 %) were undecided. Among opponents to COVID-19 mandatory vaccination for the general population, 385 (30.05 %) were in favor of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers. Younger individuals, individuals with little fear of getting infected, no intention of getting vaccinated, lack of trust in the government, and respondents who felt close to the green party or the far left were associated with opposition to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. ConclusionAttitudes toward mandatory COVID-19 vaccination are split in the French general population, and the debate might be politicized.

Consequently, it is crucial that they are properly prepared to respond to such difficult circumstances. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the basic competences of nurses in disasters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was directed to 468 nurses from all medical centres in Lublin. IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 was used for statistical analyses, frequency analysis, basic descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. The classical statistical significance level was adopted as &#945; = 0.05. RESULTS: Based on the logistic regression analysis, it was found that work experience, workplace preparedness, as well as training and experience in disaster response are important predictors of preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the nurses' core competencies for these incidents can be improved through education and training programmes which increase their preparedness for disasters. Nurses are among the most important groups of healthcare professionals facing a disaster and should be involved in all phases of disaster management, such as risk assessment and pre-disaster planning, response during crisis situations and risks' mitigation throughout the reconstruction period.","Goniewicz, Krzysztof; Goniewicz, Mariusz; Burkle, Frederick M; Khorram-Manesh, Amir",PLoS One,,391

However, it is unknown if seronegative patients develop at least a cellular response that could offer a certain grade of protection against SARS-CoV-2. To answer this question, we prospectively studied 148 recipients of either kidney (133) or kidney-pancreas (15) grafts with assessment of IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot against the nucleocapside (N) and the S protein at baseline and two weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. At baseline, 31 patients (20.9%) had either IgM/IgG or ELISpot positivity and were considered to be SARS-CoV-2-pre-immunized, while 117 (79.1%) patients had no signs of either cellular or humoral response and were considered SARS-CoV-2-naïve. After vaccination, naïve patients who developed either humoral or cellular response were finally 65.0%, of which 29.9% developed either IgG or IgM and 35.0% S-ELISpot positivity. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were diabetes and treatment with anti-thymocytes globulins during the last year. Side effects were consistent with that of the pivotal trial and no DSAs developed after vaccination. In conclusion, mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits either cellular or humoral response in almost two thirds of KTRs.","Cucchiari, David; Egri, Natalia; Bodro, Marta; Herrera, Sabina; Del Risco-Zevallos, Jimena; Casals-Urquiza, Joaquim; Cofan, Frederic; Moreno, Asunción; Rovira, Jordi; Banon-Maneus, Elisenda; Ramirez-Bajo, Maria J; Ventura-Aguiar, Pedro; Pérez-Olmos, Anna; Garcia-Pascual, Marta; Pascal, Mariona; Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni; Ríos, José; Palou, Eduard; Juan, Manel; Bayés, Beatriu; Diekmann, Fritz",Am. j. transplant,,391

METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis using data from the Vitamin D And Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes prevention (DALI) trial conducted across nine European countries (2012-2014). In women with a BMI &#8805; 29 kg/m2 ), insulin resistance and secretion were estimated from the oral glucose tolerance test values performed before 20 weeks, using homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and Stumvoll first-phase indices, respectively. Women with early gestational diabetes, defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria, were classified into three groups: GDM-R (above-median insulin resistance alone), GDM-S (below-median insulin secretion alone), and GDM-B (combination of both) and the few remaining women were excluded. RESULTS: Compared with women in the normal glucose tolerance group (n = 651), women in the GDM-R group (n = 143) had higher fasting and post-load glucose values and insulin levels, with a greater risk of having large-for-gestational age babies [adjusted odds ratio 3.30 (95% CI 1.50-7.50)] and caesarean section [adjusted odds ratio 2.30 (95% CI 1.20-4.40)].

421205,"Exhaling, Head Turning, and Moving Away: Nonpharmacological Maneuvers to Possibly Decrease Risk of Contracting COVID-19",2020,"Complex chemical reaction environments, such as those found in combustion engines, the upper atmosphere, or the interstellar medium, can contain large numbers of different reactive species participating in similarly large numbers of different chemical reactions. In such settings, identifying the most-likely multistep reaction mechanisms which lead to the production of a particular defined product species is an extremely challenging problem, requiring search and evaluation over a large number of different possible candidate mechanisms while also addressing the permutational challenges posed when considering a large number of reaction routes available to sets of identical molecular species. In this article, the problem of generating candidate reaction mechanisms which form a defined product from a diverse set of reactive molecules is cast as a discrete optimization of a permutationally invariant cost function describing similarity between the target product and the product generated by a trial reaction mechanism. This approach is demonstrated by generating 2230 candidate reaction mechanisms which form benzene from diverse sets of reactive molecules which have been experimentally identified in the interstellar medium. By screening this set of autogenerated mechanisms, using dispersion-corrected DFT to evaluate reaction energies and activation barriers, we identify several candidate barrierless reaction mechanisms (both previously proposed and new) for benzene formation which may operate in the low temperatures found in the interstellar medium and could be investigated further to supplement existing microkinetic models.","Robertson, Christopher; Hyland, Ross; Lacey, Andrew J D; Havens, Sebastian; Habershon, Scott",J. chem. theory comput.

Additional data on all patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were collected from 7 European countries encompassing 4298 patients. COVID-19-attributable mortality was calculated using propensity score-matched historic control data and after 28 days of follow-up was 20.0% (95% confidence interval 18.7%-21.4%) in 3285 patients receiving dialysis and 19.9% (17.5%-22.5%) in 1013 recipients of a transplant. We identified differences in COVID-19 mortality across countries, and an increased mortality risk in older patients receiving kidney replacement therapy and male patients receiving dialysis. In recipients of kidney transplants &#8805;75 years of age, 44.3% (35.7%-53.9%) did not survive COVID-19. Mortality risk was 1.28 (1.02-1.60) times higher in transplant recipients compared with matched dialysis patients.

The electronic databases Medline PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science were searched. Also, clinical trials registries were searched for potentially eligible studies. A total of 90 records were retrieved after duplicate removal. Eight studies were case reports of children treated with convalescent plasma therapy (14 children, age range, 9 weeks to 18 years); 5 children had a chronic disease. During the hospital stay, 5 received drugs (e.g., remdesivir) in addition to convalescent plasma therapy. No convalescent plasma therapy-related adverse events were reported in 5 studies and 3 made no mention of adverse events. Seven studies concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is or could be a useful therapeutic option; one study made no claims. Only 3 of the 13 retrieved trials underway were planned exclusively for children. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in children. We found insufficient clinical information on the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in children. Nevertheless, the positive outcomes of the few case reports published to date suggest that convalescent plasma therapy may be of potential benefit.

Out of the 2375 HIV negative respondents, 680 reported PrEP use and were included in this analysis. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 28-40), 98% cisgender men, 56% white, 74% high education, and 72% middle/high income. Willingness to use HIVST was 79% and 32% received an HIVST during social distancing period. The majority reported preference for PrEP/HIVST home delivery instead of collecting at the service. PrEP teleconsultation was experienced by 21% and most reported feeling satisfied with the procedures. High acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation was reported by 70%. In ordinal logistic model, having higher education was associated with high aceptability of PrEP teleconsultation (aOR:1.62; 95%CI: 1.07-2.45).

Method Mixed method with concomitant triangulation (January-July/2017), qualitative design (structural and procedural approaches to the Social Representations Theory) and quantitative (sectional) approaching elderly people &#8805;65 years. Results Environmental factors were identified for falling at home, fear of activities of daily living and loss of visual acuity. Feelings and behaviors mentioned in the possible central nucleus justified the modulation of behaviors. Analysis categories: 1) Representation of the (in)adaptability of the home environment; 2) Representation and overcoming limitations arising from weaknesses. Conclusion It was possible to produce conjectures based on empirical evidence in the current situation in the pandemic's dynamics.","Santos, Jéssica de Castro; Arreguy-Senna, Cristina; Pinto, Paulo Ferreira; Paiva, Elenir Pereira de; Parreira, Pedro Miguel dos Santos Dinis; Brandão, Marcos Antônio Gomes",Rev. gaúch. enferm,,391
429701,"Benefits, Challenges and Solutions for Implementing Personalised Music Playlist Programs in Residential Aged Care in Australia",2021,"COVID-19 in the UK has had a profound impact on population health and other socially important outcomes, including on education and the economy. Although a range of evidence has guided policy, epidemiological models have been central. It is less clear whether models to support decision making have sought to integrate COVID-19 epidemiology with a consideration of broader health, wellbeing and economic implications. We report on a rapid review of studies seeking to integrate epidemiological and economic modelling to assess the impacts of alternative policies. Overall, our results suggest that few studies have explored broader impacts of different COVID-19 policies in the UK. Three studies looked only at health, capturing impacts on individuals with and without COVID-19, with various methods used to model the latter. Four models considered health and wider impacts on individuals' economic outcomes, such as wages. However, these models made no attempt to consider the dynamic impacts on economic outcomes of others and the wider economy. The most complex analyses sought to link epidemiological and dynamic economic models. Studies compared a wide range of policies, although most were defined in general terms with minimal consideration of their granular specifications. There was minimal exploration of uncertainty, with no consideration in half the studies. Selecting appropriate models to inform decisions requires careful thought of factors relevant to the decision options under consideration such as the outcomes of interest, sectors likely to be impacted and causal pathways. In summary, better linking epidemiological and economic modelling would help to inform COVID-19 policy.","Duarte, Ana; Walker, Simon; Metry, Andrew; Wong, Ruth; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Sculpher, Mark",Pharmacoeconomics,,391

According to Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, in an epidemic the most severe symptoms of the clinical condition presented by the population in question should be the basis for selecting the medication that is as similar as possible to them, and which should be administered to individuals who have been exposed to the disease but have not yet developed it. This medicine is called the genus epidemicus. This study aims to demonstrate the reasoning used to propose the homeopathic medicine Antimonium tartaricum (Ant-t) as a genus epidemicus in the COVID-19 epidemic. It was decided to develop the reasoning based on the respiratory symptoms described in the epidemiological bulletins presented by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, as these symptoms are the most serious of the disease. After repertorization, it was confirmed in the Materia Medica that Ant-t has a high degree of similarity with these respiratory symptoms, including the most serious situations, of COVID-19.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenzhen to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies including, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). In the COVID-19 group, nine patients were enrolled after diagnosis. In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was 18 March 2020. In the COVID-19 group, the seven of nine patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, six of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the six individuals were all negative. Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible. Hence, social distancing measures are still inevitable until a vaccine is developed successfully.","Zhang, Cantong; Lin, Liancheng; Tang, Donge; Liu, Fuju; Li, Meng; Li, Qiongying; Deng, Zhaoxiang; Chu, Guohai; Gu, Dayong; Dai, Yong",J. med. virol,,391
433561,Locally Informed Simulation to Predict Hospital Capacity Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Modelling the small-area spatio-temporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic is of major public health importance, because it allows health agencies to better understand how and why the virus spreads. However, in Scotland during the first wave of the pandemic testing capacity was severely limited, meaning that large numbers of infected people were not formally diagnosed as having the virus. As a result, data on confirmed cases are unlikely to represent the true infection rates, and due to the small numbers of positive tests these data are not available at the small-area level for confidentiality reasons. Therefore to estimate the small-area dynamics in Covid-19 incidence this paper analyses the spatio-temporal trends in telehealth data relating to Covid-19, because during the first wave of the pandemic the public were advised to call the national telehealth provider NHS 24 if they experienced symptoms of the virus. Specifically, we propose a multivariate spatio-temporal correlation model for modelling the proportions of calls classified as either relating to Covid-19 directly or having related symptoms, and provide software for fitting the model in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model was developed in partnership with the national health agency Public Health Scotland, and here we use it to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Scotland between March and July 2020, specifically focusing on the spatial variation in the peak and the end of the first wave.","Lee, Duncan; Robertson, Chris; Marques, Diogo",Spat Stat,,391

434457,Covid-19 recommendations for assisted living: Implications for the future,2021,"Purpose: There have been nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide so far from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Cancer history appears to be a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, although the reasons for this are unclear. In this report, we assess whether extent of prior lung irradiation is a risk factor for death as a result of COVID-19 infection. Methods and Materials: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 15, 2020, at our institution and who previously received radiation therapy for cancer in our department were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics and metrics describing the extent of lung irradiation were tabulated. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death after COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic model was used to characterize the association between mean lung radiation therapy dose and 14-day mortality risk after COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: For the study, 107 patients met the inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 7 days from COVID-19 diagnosis for surviving patients, 24 deaths have been observed. The actuarial survival rate 14 days after COVID-19 testing is 66%. Increasing mean lung dose (hazard ratio [HR] per Gy = 1.1, P =.002), lung cancer diagnosis (HR = 3.0, P =.034), and receiving radiation therapy between 1 month and 1 year before COVID-19 testing (HR = 3.4, P =.013) were associated with increased risk of death. Our survival model demonstrates a near linear relationship between mortality risk after COVID-19 diagnosis and mean lung radiation therapy dose. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with a history of radiation therapy for cancer have a poor prognosis, and mortality risk appears to be associated with extent of lung irradiation. Validation of these findings will be critical as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Kabarriti, Rafi; Brodin, N.

434771,The health-related quality of life in Iranian patients with COVID-19,2021,"In the absence of a vaccine, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission has been controlled by preventing person-to-person interactions via social distancing measures. In order to re-open parts of society, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. We use age-specific social contact data, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number by turning contacts on and off based on context and age. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a background of wider social distancing measures. We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). We find that following lockdown (when R = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8), opening primary schools has a modest impact on transmission (R = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97) as long as other social interactions are not increased. Opening secondary and primary schools is predicted to have a larger impact (R = 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.53). Contact tracing and COVID security can be used to mitigate the impact of increased social mixing to some extent; however, social distancing measures are still required to control transmission. Our approach has been widely used by policy-makers to project the impact of social distancing measures and assess the trade-offs between them. Effective social distancing, contact tracing and COVID security are required if all age groups are to return to school while controlling transmission.

As a result, there has been a renewed focus on video-based telehealth consultations as a means to continue ambulatory care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the change in video visit volume at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and compare patient demographics and appointment data from January 1, 2020, and in the 11 weeks after the transition to video visits. METHODS: Patient demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and departments) were extracted from the electronic health record reporting database. Video visits were performed using a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant video conferencing platform with a pre-existing workflow. RESULTS: In 17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center, 2284 video visits were performed in the 11 weeks before COVID-19 changes were implemented (mean 208, SD 75 per week) and 12,946 video visits were performed in the 11-week post-COVID-19 period (mean 1177, SD 120 per week). The proportion of video visits increased from 7%-18% to 54%-72%, between the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods without any disparity based on race/ethnicity, primary language, or payor. CONCLUSIONS: In a remarkably brief period of time, we rapidly scaled the utilization of telehealth in response to COVID-19 and maintained access to complex oncologic care at a time of social distancing.","Lonergan, Peter E; Washington Iii, Samuel L; Branagan, Linda; Gleason, Nathaniel; Pruthi, Raj S; Carroll, Peter R; Odisho, Anobel Y",J Med Internet Res,,391

This rapid review synthesizes the literature and includes input from clinical experts to provide evidence-based guidance for surgical services. METHODS: The rapid review comprised of targeted searches in PubMed and grey literature. Pertinent findings were discussed by a working group of clinical experts, and consensus recommendations, consistent with Australian and New Zealand Government guidelines, were formulated. RESULTS: There was a paucity of high-quality primary studies specifically investigating appropriate surgical PPE for healthcare workers treating patients possibly infected with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of aerosol, droplet and fomite transmission, making it essential to augment standard infection control measures with appropriate PPE, especially during surgical emergencies and aerosol-generating procedures. All biological material should be treated a potential source of SARS-COV-2. Staff must have formal training in the use of PPE and should be supervised by a colleague during donning and doffing. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear a surgical mask during transfer to and from theatre. Potential solutions exist in the literature to extend the use of surgical P2/N95 respirators in situations of limited supply. CONCLUSION: PPE is advised for all high-risk procedures and when a patient's COVID-19 status is unknown. Surgical departments should facilitate staggered rostering, remote meeting attendance, and self-isolation of symptomatic staff. Vulnerable surgical staff should be identified and excluded from operations with a high risk of COVID-19 infection.","Tan, Lorwai; Kovoor, Joshua G; Williamson, Penny; Tivey, David R; Babidge, Wendy J; Collinson, Trevor G; Hewett, Peter J; Hugh, Thomas J; Padbury, Robert T A; Langley, Sally J; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ J Surg,,391

This pattern seems unpredictable, and the propagation appears unstoppable, resulting in over 350,000 death tolls in the U.S. by the end of 2020. Here, we create the spatiotemporal inter-county mobility network using 10 TB (Terabytes) trajectory data of 30 million smart devices in the U.S. in the first six months of 2020. We investigate its bound percolation by removing the weakly connected edges. The mobility network becomes vulnerable and prone to reach its criticality and thus experience surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable set of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United States, played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and regions during the pandemic. Beyond, our numerical results unveil that network characteristics determine the critical thresholds and the bridge locations. The findings provide new insights into managing and controlling the connectivity of mobility networks during unprecedented disruptions.

METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data of six Chinese families with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts were recorded. Targeted exome sequencing was applied to detect the underlying genetic defects for the families. Generated variants were confirmed by PCR and sanger sequencing. Afterward, bioinformatic analysis through several computational predictive programs was performed to assess impacts of mutations on protein structure and function. RESULTS: A total of 53 participants (23 affected and 30 unaffected) from six unrelated Chinese families were recruited. Cataract phenotypes covered nuclear, total, posterior polar, pulverulent, snowflake-like, and zonular. Through targeted exome sequencing, six mutations in four ß-crystallin genes were revealed which included five missense mutations CRYBB1 p.Q70P, CRYBB2 p.E23Q, CRYBB2 p.A49V, CRYBB2 R188C, CRYBA4 p.M14K and one splice mutation CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A. In silico results predicted pathogenic for all four missense variants except variant CRYBB2-p.A49V yielded results as tolerant. The CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A splice site mutation was predicted to be deleterious by leading to a broken splice site, a premature stop codon, and subsequently resulting in a short peptide of 113 amino acids, which may affect protein features. CONCLUSION: The obtained results expanded mutational and phenotype spectrum of ß-crystallin genes and offer clues for pathogenesis of congenital cataracts. The data also demonstrated that targeted exome sequencing is valuable for providing molecular diagnostic information for congenital cataract patients.","Yu, Yinhui; Qiao, Yue; Ye, Yang; Li, Jinyu; Yao, Ke",Mol Genet Genomic Med,,391

Our study focused on the factor structure, reliability and validity of the PCL-5 among Chinese Healthcare Workers during the Outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of frontline healthcare workers using the PCL-5 for PTSD. Total of 212 frontline healthcare providers were included in this study.

The convergent and discriminant validity of the PCL-5 were also well demonstrated. Our result showed a better fit with the seven-factor hybrid model compared with other models and supported that the PCL-5 Chinese version can be used as a reliable screening tool to conduct psychological screening for Chinese healthcare workers.

We didn't use the gold-standard structured interview for PTSD in our study. Besides, most of our samples were young people who had access to the internet. Not all professional levels and seniorities were presented because our sample had a lower mean income and educational level. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the Chinese PCL-5 has good validity and reliability in frontline healthcare workers during the outbreak.","Cheng, Peng; Xu, Li-Zhi; Zheng, Wan-Hong; Ng, Roger M K; Zhang, Li; Li, Ling-Jiang; Li, Wei-Hui",J Affect Disord,,391

Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with rt-PCR, between 7 to 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1 to 7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1,178,597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD=18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872,454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 per 100,000 (95%CI: 26.1-115.0 per 100,000) and 5.4 per 100,000 (95%CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100,000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 90% (95%CI:79%- 95%) and 94% (95%CI:88%-97%) against COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against infection was 71% (95%CI:37%-87%). The adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization in those infected were 0.82 (95%CI:0.36-1.88), 0.45 (95%CI:0.23-0.90), and 0.56 (95%CI:0.36-0.89) in the age groups 16-44, 45-64 and 75 and above, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine is comparable to the one reported in the phase III clinical trial.","Chodick, Gabriel; Tene, Lilac; Rotem, Ran S; Patalon, Tal; Gazit, Sivan; Ben-Tov, Amir; Weil, Clara; Goldshtein, Inbal; Twig, Gilad; Cohen, Dani; Muhsen, Khitam",Clin. infect. dis,,391

On the date this review was written, SARS-CoV-2 infected about 96 million people and killed about 2 million people. Several arguments disclosed the high mortality of COVID-19 due to acute respiratory distress syndrome or change in the amount of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expression or cytokine storm strength production. In a similar pattern, hepatic impairment patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited overexpression of ACE2 receptors and cytokine storm overwhelming, which worsens the hepatic impairment and increases the mortality rate. In this review, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic impairment conditions we overviewed. Besides, we focused on the recent studies that indicated cytokine storm as well as ACE2 as the main factors for high COVID-19 spreading and mortality while hinting at the potential therapeutic strategies.","Ali, Fares E M; Mohammedsaleh, Zuhair M; Ali, Mahmoud M; Ghogar, Osama M",World J Gastroenterol,,391

Breast Cancer (BC) patients are concerned both with BC treatment and COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the impact of anxiety among patients, caused by the spreading of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the 16th of January and the 20th of March 2020, we retrospectively enrolled 160 patients. Eighty-two patients with a suspected breast lesion (SBL) were divided into two groups: PRE-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-SBL. Seventy-eight BC patients were divided into PRE-COVID-19-BC and POST-COVID-19-BC. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, SBL/BC diameter, personal and family history of BC, clinical stage and molecular subtype were recorded. Procedure Refusal (PR) and Surgical Refusal (SR) were also recorded with their reason. RESULTS: BC and SBL analysis showed no difference in pre-treatment characteristics (p>0.05). Both POST-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-BC groups showed higher rates of PR and SR (p=0.0208, p=0.0065 respectively). Infection risk represented primary reason for refusal among POST-COVID-19 patients.

Explainability is valuable to ensure that the model's forecasts are credible to epidemiologists and to instill confidence in end-users such as policy makers and healthcare institutions. Our model can be applied at different geographic resolutions, and here we demonstrate it for states and counties in the United States. We show that our model provides more accurate forecasts, in metrics averaged across the entire US, than state-of-the-art alternatives, and that it provides qualitatively meaningful explanatory insights.

452603,Implementation of a Recuperation Unit and Hospitalization Rates Among People Experiencing Homelessness With COVID-19,2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the work environment and work practices worldwide. Long-term infection control practices may increase the psychological stress on workers, and conversely, inadequate infection control practices at the working place may increase the fear of infection. This study aimed to determine the relationship between infection control practices at the workplace and employee mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. MethodsThis study was conducted in December 2020 and February 2021. The participants had undergone a preliminary survey, which revealed that they were in good mental health. Their psychological distress was investigated via a second survey, and the factors associated with distress were studied using a logistic model. ResultsThe results of the second survey indicated that 15.1% of participants demonstrated psychological distress. This was associated with leave-of-absence instructions, instructions for shortening business hours, and requests to avoid the workplace in case of any symptoms. ConclusionThe study found that while some infection control practices reduce workers distress, others worsen it. Employers need to consider infection control practices as well as the worsening mental health of employees following a decrease in income caused by such measures. Follow-up studies may be necessary to clarify the long-term effects on workers mental health.","Kodama, Toyohiko; Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Hino, Ayako; Tsuji, Mayumi; OGami, Akira; Nagata, Tomohisa; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",,,391

Benefits include increased flexibility, enhanced student engagement and satisfaction, and more effective use of time spent during face-to-face teaching. However, the development and implementation of flipped classroom teaching are also associated with challenges, including time required to develop learning materials and getting students to engage with the preparatory work. This teaching tip describes a structured approach to designing and implementing the flipped classroom approach for clinical skills to allow a greater focus on practicing the hands-on skills and the provision of feedback during the laboratory session. First, the rationale for flipping the classroom and the expected benefits should be considered. On a practical level, decisions need to be made about what to include in the flipped component, how it will complement the face-to-face class, and how the resources will be created. In the design phase, adopting a structured template and aligning with established pedagogical principles is helpful. A well-designed flipped classroom motivates learners by including different elements such as quality educational media (e.g., videos), the opportunity to self-assess, and well-defined connections to relevant knowledge and skills. Student engagement with the flipped material can be promoted through different strategies such as clear communication to manage student expectations and adapting the delivery of the face-to-face component. Finally, gathering feedback and evaluating the initiative are important to inform future improvements.","Baillie, Sarah; Decloedt, Annelies; Londgren, Molly Frendo",J Vet Med Educ,,391

458084,Prone positioning in patients treated with non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia in an Italian emergency department,2020,"In manifold learning, the intrinsic geometry of the manifold is explored and preserved by identifying the optimal local neighborhood around each observation. It is well known that when a Riemannian manifold is unfolded correctly, the observations lying spatially near to the manifold, should remain near on the lower dimension as well. Due to the nonlinear properties of manifold around each observation, finding such optimal neighborhood on the manifold is a challenge. Thus, a sub-optimal neighborhood may lead to erroneous representation and incorrect inferences. In this paper, we propose a rotation-based affinity metric for accurate graph Laplacian approximation. It exploits the property of aligned tangent spaces of observations in an optimal neighborhood to approximate correct affinity between them. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets have been performed. It is observed that proposed method outperforms existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques in low-dimensional representation for synthetic datasets. The results on real world datasets like COVID-19 prove that our approach increases the accuracy of classification by enhancing Laplacian regularization.","Shukla, Prashant; Verma, Shekhar; Kumar, Manish",Pattern Anal Appl,,391

CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patient's condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 tracing was performed for all health care providers and relatives; all results were negative except for 1 family member. The patient was treated for 4 days in the isolation ICU but died due to complications of the infection. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before hospital admission for elective surgery and during the hospital stay, and the importance of developing rapid and accurate testing methods that can be used in countries and centers with limited health resources.","Soetisna, Tri Wisesa; Buana, Andhika Citra; Tirta, Edward Suryadi; Ardiyan, Ardiyan; Aligheri, Dicky; Herlambang, Bagus; Tjubandi, Amin; Hanafy, Dudy Arman; Sugisman, Sugisman",Am J Case Rep,,391

Both these conferences had a huge influence on the history of the churches in South Africa. Thirty years after the Rustenburg Conference, this article suggests that the current context of South Africa calls for another church conference. To motivate this, the events and the declarations of the Rustenburg Church Conference of 1990 are revisited. Firstly, the article starts with a short overview on the organising of the conference. Secondly, it revisits the important confession of Prof. W.D. Jonker on apartheid and what he said on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church and the Afrikaner people. It then recalls the lesser known but not less important declaration by the women at the conference before moving on to the main declaration, which was made after the conference. The question that is then asked is what this important historical event means for the current situation in South Africa. It is suggested that the churches in South Africa are called to take the initiative to organise a Lekgotla where churches and other civil organisations can come together to discuss and address the challenges in South Africa. Racism, poverty, education, violence against women and children and corruption are specifically named as issues that should be addressed. The article concludes that given the current situation in South Africa, the churches have arrived at another Kairos moment. Interdisciplinary implications: The research in this article challenges other disciplines in theology, sociology, education and law to join the quest for workable solutions. This should be done with specific reference to research on the current problematic events in South Africa, namely poverty, corruption, racism, violence against women and the needs of children and land issues.","van der Merwe, Johan",Verbum et Ecclesia,,391
462999,The impact of hydroxychloroquine shortages on patients with dermatological conditions during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This opinion piece highlights a lethal connection between novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and wildlife consumption in tourism. While NCP continues to make headlines in the mainstream media, little academic research has considered this illness, especially through the lens of food neophilic tourism. Yet this research stream requires attention, particularly because food is a key motivational factor behind tourists’ travel and destination choices. In the case of food neophilic tourism, visitors directly consume wildlife and other exotic cuisine. Unfortunately, this novelty-seeking behavior may pose health risks; wild and exotic animals can carry deadly viruses that have been found to trigger global health epidemics such as SARS, H1N1, bird flu, and NCP. Despite international government agencies’ legislative efforts to control wild and exotic animal consumption, demand from food neophilic tourists continues to increase. This paper initiates a dialogue urging tourism scholars to study food tourism and offers practical and theoretical insight to contextualize this perennial and pertinent phenomenon.","Ying, Tianyu; Wang, Kaiyun; Liu, Xinyi; Wen, Jun; Goh, Edmund",Tour.

463417,Pandemics and armed forces: Which roles are appropriate?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Regional monitoring of the proportion of the population who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys. We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5·7% (95% CI 5·1-6·4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14·9% (13·2-16·9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26·5% (23·4-29·8) of adult residents having been infected in Île-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5·1% (4·5-5·8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0·50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0·74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20·4%, 15·6-26·3) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9·7%, 6·9-14·1). 40·2% (34·3-46·3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49·3% (42·9-55·9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0·89). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

Peptides play important roles as signaling molecules in development and differentiation in cnidaria. For example, cnidaria use peptides for cell-to cell communication. Recent discoveries show that Hydra neuropeptides control several biological processes including muscle contraction, neuron differentiation, and metamorphosis. Here, I describe the structure and functions of neuropeptides in Hydra and other cnidarian species.

To date, the public's attitudes towards AVs were mostly estimated through traditional survey data with high labor costs and a low quantity of samples, which also might be one of the reasons why the influencing factors on the public's attitudes of AVs have not been studied from multiple aspects in a comprehensive way yet. To address the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale social media data to investigate key factors that affect the public's attitudes and acceptance of AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53 candidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the web scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public attitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm was employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according to their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the impacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the subjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of the public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like""drunk"",""blind spot"", and""mobility""had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people were more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words such as""lidar""and""Tesla""that relate to high technologies. Conversely, factors such as""COVID-19"",""pedestrian"",""sleepy"", and""highway""were found to have significantly negative effects on the public's attitudes. The findings of this study are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for AV-related policy formulation, and the public's understanding and acceptance of AVs.","Wang, Shengzhao; Li, Meitang; Yu, Bo; Bao, Shan; Chen, Yuren",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03206v1.pdf,391

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection following nonelective hip and knee surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey during this time. A retrospective cohort of 149 patients who underwent nonelective hip and knee surgery from March 27, 2020, through May 25, 2020, at 2 institutions was identified. The cohort was divided into hip fracture and non-fracture patients to compare the postoperative experience of these patient populations. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection diagnosed via severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, discharge disposition, postoperative complications, and mortality rate. A total of 149 patients underwent nonelective hip and knee surgeries, including 76 hip fracture cases and 73 nonelective hip and knee arthroplasty cases. A postoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 was made for 5 (6.6%) of 76 hip fracture patients, and 2 of the 5 died secondary to COVID-19. There were no infections in the arthroplasty cohort.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate among the non-congregate population in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. METHODS: The infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were calculated for adults residing in non-congregate settings in Connecticut prior to June 2020. Individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were estimated using the seroprevalence estimates from the recently conducted Post-Infection Prevalence study. Information on total hospitalizations and deaths was obtained from the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to June 1, 2020, nearly 113,515 (90% confidence interval [CI] 56,758-170,273) individuals were estimated to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and there were 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were estimated to be 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%-13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%-1.90%), respectively, and there was variation in these rate estimates across subgroups; older people, men, non-Hispanic Black people, and those belonging to 2 of the counties had a higher burden of adverse outcomes, although the differences between most subgroups were not statistically significant.

Case Report A 46-year-old nonsmoking man presented with a cough and fever. He deteriorated suddenly 5 days later. When the basic life support team arrived, his peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in ambient air was 56% and respiratory rate was 46 breaths/min. The man was weak with thoracoabdominal asynchrony. An emergency medical team with a physician was dispatched. As France was still under lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was suspected. In spite of 15 L/min of oxygen delivered with a nonrebreathing mask, the patient's SpO2 tended to drop below 90% at the slightest effort and during transport from home to the ambulance. It was therefore decided to start HFNO therapy. The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit, where HFNO was continued. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? As the trend in emergency medical services may move toward prehospital HFNO, this case report is an opportunity to question the feasibility of HFNO therapy in the prehospital setting.","Kedzierewicz, Romain; Derkenne, Clément; Fraudin, Adrien; Vanhaecke, Paola; Jouffroy, Romain; Jost, Daniel; Prunet, Bertrand",J. emerg. med,,391

473872,"Binges, Brains, Birthdays, and BACs",2021,"COVID-19 is the most disturbing pandemic of the past hundred years. Its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been the subject of an unprecedented investigation to characterize its molecular structure and intimate functioning. While markers for its detection have been proposed and several diagnostic methodologies developed, its propensity to evolve and evade diagnostic tools and the immune response is of great concern. The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.","Gallais, Fabrice; Pible, Olivier; Gaillard, Jean-Charles; Debroas, Stéphanie; Batina, Hélène; Ruat, Sylvie; Sandron, Florian; Delafoy, Damien; Gerber, Zuzana; Olaso, Robert; Gas, Fabienne; Bellanger, Laurent; Deleuze, Jean-François; Grenga, Lucia; Armengaud, Jean",Anal. bioanal. chem,,391
474148,"In Reply to the Letter to the Editor Regarding ""Management of Neurosurgical Cases in a Tertiary Care Referral Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons from a Middle-Income Country""",2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a massive impact on human lives worldwide. While the airborne SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs, viremia is not uncommon. As placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, they are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the human fetus is largely spared from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested whether the human placenta expresses the main SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin and showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the trophoblast rather than in other placental villous cells. While furin is expressed in the main placental villous cell types, we surveyed, trophoblasts exhibit the highest expression. In line with the expression of these entry factors, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could enter primary human trophoblasts. Mechanisms underlying placental defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection likely involve postentry processing, which may be germane for mitigating interventions against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Pregnant women worldwide have been affected by COVID-19. As the virus is commonly spread to various organs via the bloodstream and because human placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, feto-placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 seems likely. However, despite the heightened risk to pregnant women, thus far the transmission risk of COVID-19 to the feto-placental unit seems extremely low. This has been recently attributed to a negligible expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the human placenta. We therefore sought to explore the expression of the entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the different cell types of human placental villi. Using a combination of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence, we found that trophoblasts, but not the other main villous cell types, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with a broad expression of furin. Correspondingly, we also showed that primary human trophoblasts are permissive to entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles.","Ouyang, Yingshi; Bagalkot, Tarique; Fitzgerald, Wendy; Sadovsky, Elena; Chu, Tianjiao; Martínez-Marchal, Ana; Brieño-Enríquez, Miguel; Su, Emily J; Margolis, Leonid; Sorkin, Alexander; Sadovsky, Yoel",MSphere,,391

This vital resource must be effectively employed, it must be certified, it must be searched for, it must be found, and it may even be actively produced. We discuss why this needs to be done and how this can be achieved. Our arguments not only apply to the current pandemic but also to any future rapidly spreading, infectious disease epidemics. In addition, we argue for high awareness of a major secondary, nonbiological crisis arising from the side effects of societal and economic pandemic reactions to actual or imagined health risks.

No US study has identified predictors of perceived dietary healthfulness changes during the pandemic period. This study included analyses of lifestyle and dietary healthfulness changes using 958 survey responses from US primary household food purchasers. Information was collected related to demographics, COVID-19-related household changes, and health-related habits before and during the pandemic. Binary logistic regression identified predictors of perceived increase in dietary healthfulness during the pandemic period. Overall, 59.8%, 16.4%, and 23.4% of participants reported that their eating habits likely changed, may have changed, and likely did not change, respectively. Of the participants whose dietary habits likely or may have changed, 64.1%, 16.8%, and 19% reported healthier, neither healthier nor less healthy, and less healthy eating habits, respectively. COVID-19-related income loss, more meals consumed with household members in front of the television, an increase in food advertisement exposure, increased perceived stress, and better perceived current health were significant predictors of a perceived increase in dietary healthfulness. Overall, dietary habits were perceived to become healthier during the pandemic.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of SNF electronic health records. SETTING: Qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results were available from 81 SNFs in 16 states. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and sixty nine SNF residents who underwent both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following the first positive PCR test for confirmed cases, or first PCR test for non-cases. RESULTS: Among 397 residents with PCR-confirmed infection, antibodies were detected in 4 of 7 (57.1%) tested within 7-14 days of their first positive PCR test; in 44 of 47 (93.6%) tested within 15-30 days; in 182 of 219 (83.1%) tested within 31-60 days; and in 110 of 124 (88.7%) tested after 60 days. Among 272 PCR negative residents, antibodies were detected in 2 of 9 (22.2%) tested within 7-14 days of their first PCR test; in 41 of 81 (50.6%) tested within 15-30 days; in 65 of 148 (43.9%) tested within 31-60 days; and in 9 of 34 (26.5%) tested after 60 days. No significant differences in baseline resident characteristics or symptoms were observed between those with versus without antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that vulnerable older adults can mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, and that antibodies are most likely to be detected within 15-30 days of diagnosis. That antibodies were detected in a large proportion of residents with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the complexity of identifying who is infected in real time. Frequent surveillance and diagnostic testing based on low thresholds of clinical suspicion for symptoms and/or exposure will remain critical to inform strategies designed to mitigate outbreaks in SNFs while community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence remains high.","White, Elizabeth M; Saade, Elie A; Yang, Xiaofei; Canaday, David H; Blackman, Carolyn; Santostefano, Christopher M; Nanda, Aman; Feifer, Richard A; Mor, Vincent; Rudolph, James L; Gravenstein, Stefan",J. am. geriatr. soc,,391

Here, we measure the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in Parker Solar Probe's observations close to the Sun and in state-of-the-art numerical simulations of plasma turbulence. Both reveal a power-law behavior with a slope compatible with $-11/3$ at scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, steeper than what is typically observed in the solar wind and in the Earth's magnetosheath. We explain such behavior by developing a simple two-fluid model which does not require any kinetic processes nor electron-inertia effects. This is characterized by a significant contribution of the ion kinetic energy to the total turbulent energy cascade at sub-ion scales, although the dynamics is driven by the magnetic field through the current density. We expect that this regime may be relevant for a broad class of low-beta plasmas, e.g. the solar corona, non-relativistic magnetized jets and disks, and laboratory plasmas.","Franci, Luca; Sarto, Daniele Del; Papini, Emanuele; Giroul, Alice; Stawarz, Julia E.; Burgess, David; Hellinger, Petr; Landi, Simone; Bale, Stuart D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05048v1.pdf,391

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies.","Butler, Daniel; Mozsary, Christopher; Meydan, Cem; Foox, Jonathan; Rosiene, Joel; Shaiber, Alon; Danko, David; Afshinnekoo, Ebrahim; MacKay, Matthew; Sedlazeck, Fritz J; Ivanov, Nikolay A; Sierra, Maria; Pohle, Diana; Zietz, Michael; Gisladottir, Undina; Ramlall, Vijendra; Sholle, Evan T; Schenck, Edward J; Westover, Craig D; Hassan, Ciaran; Ryon, Krista; Young, Benjamin; Bhattacharya, Chandrima; Ng, Dianna L; Granados, Andrea C; Santos, Yale A; Servellita, Venice; Federman, Scot; Ruggiero, Phyllis; Fungtammasan, Arkarachai; Chin, Chen-Shan; Pearson, Nathaniel M; Langhorst, Bradley W; Tanner, Nathan A; Kim, Youngmi; Reeves, Jason W; Hether, Tyler D; Warren, Sarah E; Bailey, Michael; Gawrys, Justyna; Meleshko, Dmitry; Xu, Dong; Couto-Rodriguez, Mara; Nagy-Szakal, Dorottya; Barrows, Joseph; Wells, Heather; O039,; Hara, Niamh B; Rosenfeld, Jeffrey A; Chen, Ying; Steel, Peter A D",Nat Commun,,391
485862,"COVID-19, vaccination, and trust: An interview study",2021,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are at a high risk of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and are more likely to develop severe illness and have higher mortality once infected. In the COVID-19 pandemic, it is urgent to understand the effects of antitumor therapy on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, MedRxiv, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) until 21 June 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were evaluated using a random effects model to analyze the effects of antitumor therapies on COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: For cancer patients with COVID-19, the death events related to antitumor treatment were higher than those with no antitumor treatment (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.07-2.25; p = 0.021). Compared with patients in the survival group, the non-survival group showed no significant differences in patients who received antitumor therapy. Compared with patients in the non-severe group, the severe group was more likely to receive antitumor therapy (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.02-2.19; p = 0.037) and there was a significant difference. The incidence of severe events was higher in the subgroup of chemotherapy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.09-2.73). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 who received antitumor treatment shortly before symptom onset are more likely to experience severe symptoms and have high mortality. Receiving chemotherapy is an unfavorable factor for the prognosis of cancer patients with COVID-19.","Li, Piao; Li, Lingling; Wang, Shennan; Liu, Yu; Li, Zhou; Xia, Shu",Cancer Med,,391
486379,Planning for Epidemics and Pandemics: Assessing the Potential Impact of Extended Use and Reuse Strategies on Respirator Usage Rates to Support Supply-and-Demand Planning Efforts,2020,"Driven by flexibility, precision, repeatability and eco-friendliness, laser-based technologies have attracted great interest to engineer or to analyze materials in various fields including energy, environment, biology and medicine. A major advantage of laser processing relies on the ability to directly structure matter at different scales and to prepare novel materials with unique physical and chemical properties. It is also a contact-free approach that makes it possible to work in inert or reactive liquid or gaseous environment. This leads today to a unique opportunity for designing, fabricating and even analyzing novel complex bio-systems. To illustrate this potential, in this paper, we gather our recent research on four types of laser-based methods relevant for nano-/micro-scale applications. First, we present and discuss pulsed laser ablation in liquid, exploited today for synthetizing ultraclean ""bare"" nanoparticles attractive for medicine and tissue engineering applications. Second, we discuss robust methods for rapid surface and bulk machining (subtractive manufacturing) at different scales by laser ablation. Among them, the microsphere-assisted laser surface engineering is detailed for its appropriateness to design structured substrates with hierarchically periodic patterns at nano-/micro-scale without chemical treatments. Third, we address the laser-induced forward transfer, a technology based on direct laser printing, to transfer and assemble a multitude of materials (additive structuring), including biological moiety without alteration of functionality. Finally, the fourth method is about chemical analysis: we present the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, providing a unique tool for contact-free and space-resolved elemental analysis of organic materials. Overall, we present and discuss the prospect and complementarity of emerging reliable laser technologies, to address challenges in materials' preparation relevant for the development of innovative multi-scale and multi-material platforms for bio-applications.","Al-Kattan, Ahmed; Grojo, David; Drouet, Christophe; Mouskeftaras, Alexandros; Delaporte, Philippe; Casanova, Adrien; Robin, Jérôme D; Magdinier, Frédérique; Alloncle, Patricia; Constantinescu, Catalin; Motto-Ros, Vincent; Hermann, Jörg",,,391

489228,Early recognition of PIMS-TS: A single centre retrospective review,2021,"Objectives: This paper describes the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, including policies to reduce the health-related and economic consequences. The Netherlands started with containment yet shifted to mitigation when a 'mild' lockdown was implemented. The initial focus was to obtain herd immunity while preventing Intensive Care Units from getting overwhelmed. Methods: An in-depth analysis of available national and international COVID-19 data sources was conducted. Due to regional variation in COVID-19 hospitalization rates, this paper focuses on three distinct regions; the initial epicenter; the most northern provinces which - contrary to national policy - decided not to switch to mitigation; and the Bible Belt, as congregations of religious groups were initially excluded from the ban on group formation. Results: On August 11th, 6,159 COVID-19 deaths were reported with excess mortality rates about 70% higher. As a result of the pandemic, the economy took a severe hit and is predicted to reduce by 6.5% compared to prognosis. The hospitalization rates in the northern regions are over 70% lower as compared to the rest of the country (18 vs 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Differences between the Bible Belt and the rest of the country were hardly detectable. Conclusion: the Dutch have shown a way to effectively slow down transmission while allowing more personal and economic freedom than most other countries. Furthermore, the regional differences suggest that containment with testing and tracing reduced the virus dissemination. The results should be interpreted with caution, due to the descriptive nature of this evaluation.","Hoekman, Lieke Michaela; Smits, Marlou Marriet Vera; Koolman, Xander",Health Policy Technol,,391

494244,Impact of the 1st and 2nd Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Primary or Revision Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty-A Cross-Sectional Single Center Study,2021,"Purpose: It has been suggested that the media influence beliefs regarding ideal body appearance and drive for muscularity whilst also offering recommendations for achieving this; most commonly heavy load free weight resistance training (RT). However, evidence for media effects are inconsistent in the literature. This study investigated this ""lift big-get big"" culture and effects of imagery on males' beliefs regarding RT. Method: An online survey was conducted with male participants (N = 110) randomized to different images (hyper-muscular/lean/control) and RT information (""lift big-get big""/""evidence based RT""/control). Results: Descriptive data suggested belief in necessity of heavy loads and free weights was pervasive. There was a small significant effect of condition for multivariate analysis of beliefs regarding RT. Univariate analyses showed significant effects of condition regarding the importance of free weights and heavy loads for strength, and free weights for hypertrophy. Small to moderate effects were found comparing ""evidence-based RT"" with a hyper-muscular physique to ""lift big-get big"" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques, the latter more likely to agree free weights and heavy loads are necessary for strength. A small effect was found comparing ""lift big-get big"" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques and the control condition, the former more likely to agree free weights are necessary for hypertrophy. Conclusions: Although hyper-muscular bodies alone did not influence RT beliefs, new information, i.e., ""evidence-based RT"" combined with a hyper-muscular physique had a small effect. The ""lift big-get big"" culture is perhaps pervasive enough that most conditions merely reinforced existing beliefs.","Martino, Elio; Fisher, James P; Wink, Brian; Smith, Dave; Steele, James",Res Q Exerc Sport,,391

Its pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, but the two main theories foresee a direct role of ACE2 receptor and a hyperimmune response, which may also lead to isolated presentation of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis. The frequency and prognostic impact of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis is unknown. This review aims to summarise current evidence on this topic. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (1/12/19-30/09/20). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished studies testing therapies with potential implication for COVID-19-mediated cardiovascular complication. Eligible studies had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of myocarditis by ESC or WHO/ISFC criteria. Reports of 38 cases were included (26 male patients, 24 aged < 50 years). The first histologically proven case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; however, biopsy evidence of myocarditis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 cardiotropism has been recently demonstrated. Histological data was found in 12 cases (8 EMB and 4 autopsies) and CMR was the main imaging modality to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis (25 patients). There was a substantial variability in biventricular systolic function during the acute episode and in therapeutic regimen used. Five patients died in hospital. Cause-effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate. However, current evidence demonstrates myocardial inflammation with or without direct cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting different pathophysiology mechanisms responsible of COVID-mediated myocarditis. Established clinical approaches should be pursued until future evidence support different actions. Large multicentre registries are advisable to elucidate further.","Castiello, Teresa; Georgiopoulos, Georgios; Finocchiaro, Gherardo; Claudia, Monaco; Gianatti, Andrea; Delialis, Dimitrios; Aimo, Alberto; Prasad, Sanjay",Heart fail. rev,,391

This paper is the second in what will be an ongoing series of analyses of a longitudinal travel and activity survey. In this paper we examine data collected over a period of late May to early June in Australia, following four-to-six weeks of relatively flat new cases in COVID-19 after the initial nationwide outbreak, as many state jurisdictions have begun to slowly ease restrictions designed to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We find that during this period, travel activity has started to slowly return, in particular by private car, and in particular for the purposes of shopping and social or recreational activities. Respondents indicate comfort with the idea of meeting friends or returning to shops, so authorities need to be aware of potential erosion of social distancing and appropriate COVID-safe behaviour in this regard. There is still a concern about using public transport, though it has diminished noticeably since the first wave of data collection. We see that working from home continues to be an important strategy in reducing travel and pressure on constrained transport networks, and a policy measure that if carried over to a post-pandemic world, will be an important step towards a more sustainable transport future. We find that work from home has been a generally positive experience with a significant number of respondents liking to work from home moving forward, with varying degrees of employer support, at a level above those seen before COVID-19. Thus, any investment to capitalise on current levels of work from home should be viewed as an investment in transport.","Beck, Matthew J; Hensher, David A",,,391

503166,The psycho-emotional impact of COVID-19 on surgical staff working in emergency departments,2020,"This paper investigates economic impacts of COVID-19 on households based on differences in the socio-economic status (SES). We determine the household-level effects of the COVID-19 shock using income sources, types of industries, communities' resilience, household susceptibility, and relevant policy measures. For this purpose, we used primary data of 555 households collected through snowball sampling technique using an online survey questionnaire from different villages mostly located in Sichuan Province, China. Using step-wise binary logistic regression analysis, we estimated and validated the model. Results suggest the use of SES as a better measure for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on different households. We find that households with low SES tend to depend more on farmland income and transfer payments from the government. Contrarily, high SES households focus more on business and local employment as sources of income generation. Poor households were less resilient and more likely to fall back into poverty due to COVID-19, while the opposite stands true for non-poor households with high SES. Based on the estimations, policies encouraging employment and businesses complemented with loans on lower interest rates are recommended, which may increase the SES, thus minimizing vulnerability and enhancing the households' resilience towards poverty alleviation and economic shocks.","Ur Rahman, Imran; Jian, Deng; Junrong, Liu; Shafi, Mohsin",PLoS One,,391

OBJECTIVE: To describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.","Li, Wei; Cui, Huaqian; Li, Kunwei; Fang, Yijie; Li, Shaolin",Pediatr Radiol,,391
504084,Rapid Adoption of Telemedicine Along with Emergent Use of Continuous Glucose Monitors in the Ambulatory Care of Young Persons with New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes in the Time of COVID-19: A Case Series,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our world in a timescale much shorter than what we can understand. Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading. As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors, building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile through the Effective Reproduction Number R t, identifying different moments in which data was misleading governmental actions. In doing so, we aim to raise public awareness of the need for proper data reporting and processing protocols for epidemiological modelling and predictions.","Contreras, Sebastián; Biron-Lattes, Juan Pablo; Villavicencio, H.

507680,Awareness of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic among interns of a tertiary care hospital,2020,"Positive attributes stick to higher education internationalisation, and it is a policy paradigm with performative effects. Internationalisation draws on imagined virtuous flows of knowledge production and exchange, and is presented as an assemblage of detraditionalisation, expansiveness and epistemic and cultural opportunity for individuals, organisations and nation states. Policies target bodies, minds and affect, yet are presented as an unquestionable good in an imagined genderneutral, borderless, meritocratic and benign global knowledge economy. This paper explores the affective economy of internationalisation drawing upon interview data gathered in fifteen private, five national and eight public universities in Japan with thirty-four migrant academics and thirteen international doctoral researchers. We aim to contribute to internationalisation theory by exploring the sticky micropolitics of internationalisation in relation to affective assemblages, and how the gendered, racialised, linguistic and epistemic inequalities constituting academic mobility are frequently disqualified from discourse. Our discussion includes consideration of the Japanese policy context, the concept of affective assemblages, navigating gender regimes, precarity and linguistic imperialism. We conclude that the immaterial or affective labour that is required to unstick, install and maintain an internationalised academic identity and navigate the translations and antagonisms from everyday encounters with difference is substantially under-estimated.","Morley, Louise; Roberts, Paul; Ota, Hiroshi",High Educ (Dordr),,391

This severe phenotype seems to be associated with a cytokine storm and immune dysregulation. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia, and decreased levels of regulatory T cells are some of the immunological features that are seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2. As the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by both viral virulence and dysregulated inflammatory response, a combination therapy approach using antiviral drugs plus anti-inflammatory treatments, such as corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies against the IL-6 and IL-1ß pathways, and JAK inhibitors are under clinical trials.","Torabi-Rahvar, Monireh; Rezaei, Nima",Curr. pharm. des,,391
510154,Using Virtual Visits to Care for Primary Care Patients With COVID-19 Symptoms,2021,"OBJECTIVES: As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 ± 11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster.","Furer, Victoria; Zisman, Devy; Kibari, Adi; Rimar, Doron; Paran, Yael; Elkayam, Ori",Rheumatology (Oxford),,391

510476,The ongoing indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on a pediatric emergency department,2021,"The ancient practice of chanting typically takes place within a community as a part of a live ceremony or ritual. Research suggests that chanting leads to improved mood, reduced stress, and increased wellbeing. During the global pandemic, many chanting practices were moved online in order to adhere to social distancing recommendations. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of live chanting occur when practiced in an online format. The present study assessed the effects of a 10-min online chanting session on stress, mood, and connectedness, carried out either in a group or individually. The study employed a 2 (chanting vs. control) x 2 (group vs. individual) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 117) were pseudo-randomly allocated across the four conditions. Before and after participation, individuals completed the Spielberg's State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Social Connectedness Scale and Aron's Inclusion of Self in Other Scale. Online chanting led to a significant reduction in stress and an increase in positive affect when compared to the online control task. Participants who took part in group chanting also felt more connected to members of their chanting group than participants in the control group. However, feelings of general connectedness to all people remained similar across conditions. The investigation provides evidence that online chanting may be a useful psychosocial intervention, whether practiced individually or in a group.","Simpson, F. M.; Perry, G.; Thompson, W.

PHOSPHATE-TRANSPORTER 1 (PHT1) and its regulator PHOSPHATE-STARVATION-RESPONSE 1 (PHR1), which comprise the PHR1-PHT1 module, play important roles in maintaining Pi homeostasis in different organs. However, the PHR1-PHT1 module and its functions in nodules remain unknown. We identified one PHT1 (GmPHT1;11) and four PHR1 (GmPHR1) homologs in soybean (Glycine max) plants, which displayed specific expression patterns in different tissues in nodules, similar to previously reported GmPHT1;1 and GmPHT1;4. Through the integration of different approaches, GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules were confirmed. Combining our results and previous reports, we established multiple GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules acting in the infected or non-infected tissues in nodules. A single GmPHR had more than one GmPHT1 target, and vice versa. Therefore, overlapping and cross-talking modules monitored the wave of available Pi to maintain Pi homeostasis in nodules, which sequentially regulated nodule initiation and development. High levels of GmPHT1;11 enhanced Pi accumulation in nodules, increased nodule size, but decreased nodule number. Nitrogenase activity was also enhanced by GmPHT1;11. Our findings uncover GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules in nodules, which expand our understanding of the mechanism of maintaining Pi homeostasis in soybean plants.","Lu, Mingyang; Cheng, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Xiao-Mei; Huang, Penghui; Fan, Chengming; Yu, Guolong; Chen, Fulu; Xu, Kun; Chen, Qingshan; Miao, Yuchen; Han, Yuzhen; Feng, Xianzhong; Liu, Liangyu; Fu, Yong-Fu",Plant physiol,,391

There is anectoctal evidence that this process is potentially difficult for junior doctors and the primary purpose of learning may be lost due to the stress involved.Our aim was to evaluate junior doctors perspective of serious incident reviews. A secondary aim was to organise local and regional workshops based on the outcome of our findings to address misconceptions around serious incident investigations.MethodA survey was developed using survey monkey and distributed to all trainees across the Mersey region through the Medical Education teams.The junior doctors range from core trainees to higher trainees. The survey encouraged the use of free texting if necessary.Results from the survey were then analysedResult18 junior doctors across the 3 mental health Trusts in the Mersey region responded.12 respondents have been involved in a serious incident investigation in the past and 9 of the respondents stated that they did not recieve any support during the process. Out of the 3 that were supported, one rated the support as poor and frightening.55.56% af all respondents found the process of serious incident reviews hard to understand.66% of all respondents admitted that they are aware that the purpose of the review is for learning purposes.100% of respondents agreed that a workshop to discuss the purpose and process of serious incidents investigation to aid their understanding would be useful.ConclusionFrom the survey, we concluded that junior doctors do have some understanding of incident reviews process but they still do not feel comfortable with the idea of being under ‘investigation'.It is also important that formal support is made available during the process.We organised a workshop in one of the 3 Trusts which was well attended and junior doctors asked if they could sit on review panels for experiential learning. This is to be presented to govenance teams across the mental health trusts in the region.Further workshop across the 2 remaining Trusts could not be organised due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Popoola, Olusegun Naidoo Kuben Shetty Amrith",BJPsych Open,,391

515658,Social distancing policies in 22 African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a desk review,2020,"As of the end of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 82 million verified infections and almost 1.8 million COVID-19-related deaths worldwide,1 resulting to an unprecedented public health response around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the applied multi-level restrictive measures, has generated a unique combination of an unpredictable and stressful biomedical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., syndemic),2 introducing real-life threat, involuntary and drastic every-day life-style changes with uncertain financial and future prospects, alongside with minimized coping and stress management possibilities.3 This combination of so many different and vital stressors may lead to acute as well as long-term, direct, indirect and even transgenerational unfavourable effects on physical and mental health and functioning, which might even represent the most precarious and still unpredictable public-health-related part of the pandemic.4 Thereby, specific population groups could be at particular risk of poor health outcomes in relation to applied public health measures.4, 5 However, not every individual will experience the same level of negative impact on health and well-being during the pandemic, as several additional national, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors can moderate individual resilience and coping.6 Pandemic-related research should, thus, assess as many multidimensional risk and protective factors as possible in a longitudinal, large-scale and multi-national manner, enabling a profound and comprehensive understanding of the complex health and societal impact of the pandemic worldwide.7 Nevertheless, to date, most research findings are cross-sectional, report on small and non- representative samples from individual countries, or on specific population groups (e.g., health care workers, students, clinical populations) and usually assess only a very restricted set of outcomes and time-points. Thereby, only few studies assess coping strategies, medical history or detailed socioeconomic, demographic and environmental data. In addition, most studies leave behind linguistic differences, being available in one or at best two different languages. Such investigations of small outcome subsets within a narrow framework preclude a broader and clear understanding of the multifaceted pandemic impact on the general population and specific subgroups. Acknowledging these gaps in the existing literature, large- scale, collaborative research prospectively collecting and monitoring a broad range of real- time, multi-dimensional health-related, societal and behavioural outcome data from countries across the globe is currently explicitly needed. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH- FIT) envisions to fill this gap. Based on an easy-to-access webpage (www.coh-fit.com), COH- FIT is the currently largest-scale known international collaborative study of over 200 researchers around the globe, prospectively collecting the biggest set of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary data from 150 high, middle, and low-income countries in over 30 languages and in three different age groups (adults, adolescents, children) of the general population, focusing also on relevant at-risk subgroups. Albeit being a cross-sectional anonymous survey on an individual level, it is a longitudinal study on a population level, as data are collected continuously since April 2020 and until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic. In addition to snowball recruitment, this project also collects information from nationally representative samples. Furthermore, COH-FIT is the first study of this scale investigating pandemic effects on health and functioning measures between family members, while it also specifically assesses a large list of behavioral and coping factors (e.g., screen time, social media usage, physical activity, social interaction, religious practices, etc.) on outcomes of interest. COH-FIT also monitors changes in public health restrictive measures to enhance data harmonization across nations and time, and to better investigate their impact on physical and mental health, while it also collects information on changes in healthcare systems functioning. The COH-FIT project was worldwide first initiated in Greece after the ethics committee approval of the School of Medicine of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and is officially supported by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, World Association of Social Psychiatry, ECNP Network on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion, among many other national and international scientific associations. To date, COH-FIT has already collected >115,000 participations worldwide (>8,000 in Greece), but more participants are still needed, both during the second and third wave of the pandemic, as in the future, after the pandemic has ended. Currently, the COH-FIT survey actively collects the largest sample on multifactorial data on the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic on health and functioning not only in Greece, but around the globe. The elaborated design of COH-FIT and similar studies may allow a better identification of key parameters and population groups at increased risk during the pandemic, as well as potential targets for acute and long-term prevention or intervention strategies in the current as in possible future pandemics. A profound understanding of the health and societal impact of the pandemic could facilitate an optimized governmental, social and individual health preparedness during infection times8 and the bridging of individuals', societal and systemic needs and actions through multi-level guideline development with the aim to improve mental health outcomes globally.","Agorastos, Agorastos; Tsamakis, Konstantinos; Solmi, Marco; Correll, Christoph U; Bozikas, Vasilis P",Psychiatriki,,391

MEASURES: The effect of a systematic, fast-track transition from oncological treatment to specialised palliative care at home on patient symptom burden was studied in the Domus randomised clinical trial. Participants had incurable cancer and limited treatment options. The intervention was provided by specialised palliative home teams (SPT) based in hospice or hospital and was enriched with a psychological intervention for patient and caregiver dyad. Symptom burden was measured with Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-r) at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up and analysed with mixed models. Survival and place of death was analysed with Kaplan-Meier and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: The study included 322 patients. Tiredness was significantly improved for the Domus intervention group at 6 months while the other nine symptom outcomes were not significantly different from the control group. Exploring the efficacy of intervention provider demonstrated significant differences in favour of the hospice SPT on four symptoms and total symptom score. Patients with children responded more favourably to the intervention. The long-term follow-up demonstrated no differences between the intervention and the control groups regarding survival or home deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The Domus intervention may reduce tiredness. Moreover, the intervention provider and having children might play a role concerning intervention efficacy. The intervention did not affect survival or home deaths.

516636,Quality of life in patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic - a Danish cross-sectional study (COPICADS),2020,"Virtual Reality (VR) games that feature physical activities have been shown to increase players' motivation to do physical exercise. However, for such exercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated several times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of time, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the game's challenge according to the player's capabilities. For exercise games, this is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of objects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content Generation for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that match the player's current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific parameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease repetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation of the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept, we implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that includes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized by a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to perform physical activities. To match the player's capabilities, we use Deep Reinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which exercise rooms to include in the maze. We evaluate our prototype in an exploratory user study utilizing both biodata and subjective questionnaires.","Huber, Tobias; Mertes, Silvan; Rangelova, Stanislava; Flutura, Simon; Andr'e, Elisabeth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08762v1.pdf,391

The number of chest X-ray images has skyrocketed, but reading chest X-rays still have been manually performed by radiologists, which creates huge burnouts and delays. Traditionally, radiomics, as a subfield of radiology that can extract a large number of quantitative features from medical images, demonstrates its potential to facilitate medical imaging diagnosis before the deep learning era. With the rise of deep learning, the explainability of deep neural networks on chest X-ray diagnosis remains opaque. In this study, we proposed a novel framework that leverages radiomics features and contrastive learning to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray. Experiments on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset show that our model achieves superior results to several state-of-the-art models (>10% in F1-score) and increases the model's interpretability.","Han, Yan; Chen, Chongyan; Tewfik, Ahmed H; Ding, Ying; Peng, Yifan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04269v1.pdf,391

518948,27th Annual Conference of the International Society for Quality of Life Research,2020,"Background: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is one of the protective equipment that health workers can use to protect themselves against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);however, it is accompanied by some problems for medical staff. Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not transmitted through healthy skin, the hypothesis was examined as to whether the cotton gown could be used instead of PPE. Methods: The medical staff of the Neonatal Care Unit took care of 51 patients with 1180 shifts. During the first and a half months, the medical personnel used a special PPE package for providing care of patients, which included an airimpermeable plastic gown with a head-to-toe cover, an N95 mask, gloves, and a face shield. However, from the beginning of the epidemic, doctors used cotton surgical gowns instead of the ones in the package. Following that, the nursing team gradually replaced the air-impermeable plastic gowns with cotton surgical gowns, and finally, all the staff used the cotton gowns. Results: After three months, all medical staff was evaluated for clinical signs of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, nausea, and headache. During these three months, no symptoms or absence due to illness were observed in the staff. It should be mentioned that the antibody titer was not evaluated at the end of the study. Conclusion: A retrospective review of the staff showed that the cotton surgical gown protected the staff against COVID-19. Accordingly, the cotton surgical gown can be used in medical centers to replace PPE sets containing an air-impermeable plastic gown with a head-to-toe cover. The result of this study can improve some of the problems of the medical staff.","Farhat, A. S.; Mohamadzadeh, A.; Saeidi, R.; Khorasani, N. Y.",Iranian Journal of Neonatology,,391

519097,Trends in 30-day mortality from COVID-19 among older adults in the Veterans Affairs system,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a serious threat to human health all over the world. The development of effective vaccines has been focusing on the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates viral invasion to human cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In this work, we perform analytical characterization of N- and O-linked glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. We explore the novel use of dual-functionalized titanium (IV)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ti-IMAC) material for simultaneous enrichment and separation of neutral and sialyl glycopeptides of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein from HEK293 cells. This strategy helps eliminate signal suppression from neutral glycopeptides for the detection of sialyl glycopeptides and improves the glycoform coverage of the S protein. We profiled 19 of its 22 potential N-glycosylated sites with 398 unique glycoforms using the dual-functional Ti-IMAC approach, which exhibited improvement of coverage by 1.6-fold compared to the conventional hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) glycopeptide enrichment method. We also identified O-linked glycosylation site that was not found using the conventional HILIC approach. In addition, we reported on the identification of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) glycosylation, which substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein's glycosylation landscape and enables future investigation into the influence of M6P glycosylation of the spike protein on its cell entry.","Huang, Junfeng; Wang, Danqing; Shipman, Richard David; Zhu, Zexin; Liu, Yuan; Li, Lingjun",Anal. bioanal. chem,,391

Because many patients with COVID-19 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome have diffuse alveolar inflammatory damage associated with microvessel thrombosis, we aimed to investigate a common clinical tool, the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, to aid in the prognostication of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. We analyzed consecutive patients from the multicenter observational CORACLE registry, which contains data of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in 4 regions of Italy, according to data-driven tertiles of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. The primary outcomes were inpatient death and a composite of inpatient death or invasive ventilation. Of 1045 patients in the registry, 864 (82.7%) had data available to calculate CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score and were included in the analysis. Of these, 167 (19.3%) died, 123 (14.2%) received invasive ventilation, and 249 (28.8%) had the composite outcome. Stratification by CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc tertiles (T1: &#8804;1; T2: 2 to 3; T3: &#8805;4) revealed increases in both death (8.1%, 24.3%, 33.3%, respectively; p <0.001) and the composite end point (18.6%, 31.9%, 43.5%, respectively; p <0.001). The odds ratios for mortality and the composite end point for T2 patients versus T1 CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score were 3.62 (95% CI:2.29 to 5.73,p <0.001) and 2.04 (95% CI:1.42 to 2.93, p <0.001), respectively. Similarly, the odds ratios for mortality and the composite end point for T3 patients versus T1 were 5.65 (95% CI:3.54 to 9.01, p <0.001) and 3.36 (95% CI:2.30 to 4.90,p <0.001), respectively. In conclusion, among Italian patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc risk score for thromboembolic events enhanced the ability to achieve risk stratification for complications and death.","Ruocco, Gaetano; McCullough, Peter A; Tecson, Kristen M; Mancone, Massimo; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; De Rosa, Francesco G; Paggi, Anita; Forleo, Giovanni; Secco, Gioel G; Pistis, Gianfranco; Monticone, Silvia; Vicenzi, Marco; Rota, Irene; Blasi, Francesco; Pugliese, Francesco; Fedele, Francesco; Palazzuoli, Alberto",Am. j. cardiol,,391

METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 98 patients aged &#8805; 65 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during a regional outbreak in Daegu/Gyeongsangbuk-do province of Korea. The outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and the treatment with mechanical ventilation (MV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 72 years; 55.1% were female. Most (74.5%) had at least one underlying condition. Overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 20.4%, and median time to death after admission was 8 days. The CFR was 6.1% among patients aged 65-69 years, 22.7% among those aged 70-79 years, and 38.1% among those aged &#8805; 80 years. The CFR among patients who required MV was 43.8%, and the proportion of patients received MV/HFNC was 28.6%. Nosocomial acquisition, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, and chronic neurologic diseases were significant risk factors for both death and MV/HFNC. Hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status on admission were also associated with poor outcome. CRP > 8.0 mg/dL was strongly associated with MV/HFNC (odds ratio, 26.31; 95% confidence interval, 7.78-88.92; P < 0.001), and showed better diagnostic characteristics compared to commonly used clinical scores. CONCLUSION: Patients aged &#8805; 80 years had a high risk of requiring MV/HFNC, and mortality among those severe patients was very high. Severe initial presentation and laboratory abnormalities, especially high CRP, were identified as risk factors for mortality and severe hospital course.","Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hyun Ah; Huh, Kyungmin; Hyun, Miri; Rhee, Ji Young; Jang, Sukbin; Kim, Ji Yeon; Peck, Kyong Ran; Chang, Hyun Ha",J Korean Med Sci,,391

METHODS: The case control study retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of Chinese pediatric patients presenting with common and refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (CMPP and RMPP). Overall, there were 216 cases in the CMPP group and 88 cases in the RMPP group. Venous blood was collected, and serum ferritin (SF), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), neutrophil count/lymphocyte count (NLR), and other indexes were measured. A single factor analysis, an ROC curve analysis, and a logistic regression analysis were used to determine the independent risk factors of RMPP and find combination of initial markers for RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the RMPP group and the CMPP group in mean SF (529.82 [357.86] vs. 147.22 [122.68] ng/mL), LDH (522.08 [389.08] vs. 286.85 [101.02] U/L), D-dimer (6.65 [5.66] vs. 1.46 [2.45] μg/mL), CRP (62.80 [52.15] vs. 19.03 [24.50] mg/L), PCT (0.80 [2.61] vs. 0.16 [0.44]) ng/mL, and NLR (4.14 [2.52] vs. 2.62 [1.55]), with P < 0.05 for each comparison. ROC cut-off values of the above indexes were 329.01 ng/mL, 375.50 U/L, 2.10 μg/mL, 43.08 mg/L, 0.08 ng/mL, and 2.96, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that SF, D-dimer, and CRP are independent risk factors to predict RMPP. CONCLUSION: SF, D-dimer, and CRP are statistically significant biomarkers to predict RMPP in Chinese children patients in the settings of pediatric emergency department.","Wen, Jun; Su, Yufei; Sun, Hongli; Zhang, Huiping; Li, Hui",Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-020-01577-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752670/,391

At the genetic level, this virus was strictly related to the prototype strain CB/05, but displayed some unique features. After experimental infection with the new pantropic isolate, most inoculated dogs showed diarrhoea and acute lymphopenia. Gross lesions and histological changes were mainly evident in the gut and lymphoid tissues, although some animals showed remarkable changed also in parenchymatous organs. The viral RNA was detected in the faeces and/or internal organs of most pups. These findings seem to indicate that strain 450/07 is able to spread to internal organs (mainly lymphoid tissues), causing lymphopenia but inducing a mild disease.","Decaro, Nicola; Mari, Viviana; von Reitzenstein, Marcela; Lucente, Maria Stella; Cirone, Francesco; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; King, Vickie L.; Di Bello, Antonio; Varello, Katia; Zhang, Shucheng; Caramelli, Maria; Buonavoglia, Canio",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.03.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512002064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22542271/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512002064,391
591687,Community-wide mask-wearing: A realistic approach amidst the second wave of Covid-19 in Pakistan.,2021-07-01,"The recent outbreak of the respiratory ailment COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 is a severe and urgent global concern. In the absence of effective treatments, the main containment strategy is to reduce the contagion by the isolation of infected individuals; however, isolation of unaffected individuals is highly undesirable. To help make rapid decisions on treatment and isolation needs, it would be useful to determine which features presented by suspected infection cases are the best predictors of a positive diagnosis. This can be done by analyzing patient characteristics, case trajectory, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes. We developed a model that employed supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the presentation features predicting COVID-19 disease diagnoses with high accuracy. Features examined included details of the individuals concerned, e.g., age, gender, observation of fever, history of travel, and clinical details such as the severity of cough and incidence of lung infection. We implemented and applied several machine learning algorithms to our collected data and found that the XGBoost algorithm performed with the highest accuracy (>85%) to predict and select features that correctly indicate COVID-19 status for all age groups. Statistical analyses revealed that the most frequent and significant predictive symptoms are fever (41.1%), cough (30.3%), lung infection (13.1%) and runny nose (8.43%). While 54.4% of people examined did not develop any symptoms that could be used for diagnosis, our work indicates that for the remainder, our predictive model could significantly improve the prediction of COVID-19 status, including at early stages of infection.","Ahamad, Martuza; Aktar, Sakifa; Rashed-Al-Mahfuz; Uddin, Shahadat; Lió, Pietro; Xu, Haoming; Summers, Matthew A.; Quinn, Julian M.W.; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Expert Syst Appl,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113661; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417420304851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834556/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420304851?v=s5,391

They had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 47.0 (38.0–70.3) years, and 16 (38.1%) were men. Patients with ketosis were younger (median age 47.0 vs. 58.0 years; P = 0.003) and had a greater prevalence of fatigue (31.0% vs. 10.6%; P < 0.001), diabetes (35.7% vs. 18.5%; P = 0.007) and digestive disorders (31.0% vs. 12.0%; P < 0.001). They had a longer median (IQR) length of hospital stay (19.0 [12.8–33.3] vs. 16.0 [10.0–24.0] days; P < 0.001) and a higher mortality rate (21.4% vs. 8.9%; P = 0.017). Three (20.0%) out of the 15 patients with diabetic ketosis developed acidosis, five patients (26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died, and one of these (25.0%) presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) of the 27 non‐diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died, respectively, and one (25.0%) of these presented with acidosis. This suggests that COVID‐19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis, and induced diabetic ketoacidosis for those with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality.

Such point-of-need (PON), low-cost diagnostics are essential for ZIKV control in vulnerable areas with limited resources. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a ZIKV-specific field-deployable RT-iiPCR reagent set targeting the E gene for rapid detection of ZIKV in ZIKV-spiked human and mosquito specimens, and compared its performance to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) RT-qPCR assays targeting the E and NS2B genes, respectively. RESULTS: These assays demonstrated exclusive specificity for ZIKV (African and Asian lineages), had limits of detection ranging from 10 to 100 in vitro transcribed RNA copies/μl and detection endpoints at 10 plaque forming units/ml of infectious tissue culture fluid. Analysis of human whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, urine, and mosquito pool samples spiked with ZIKV showed an agreement of 90% (k = 0.80), 92% (k = 0.82), 95% (k = 0.86), 92% (k = 0.81), 90% (k = 0.79), and 100% (k = 1), respectively, between the RT-iiPCR assay and composite results from the reference RT-qPCR assays. Overall, the concurrence between the ZIKV RT-iiPCR and the reference RT-qPCR assays was 92% (k = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The ZIKV RT-iiPCR has a performance comparable to the reference CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays but provides much faster results (~1.5 h) with a field-deployable system that can be utilized as a PON diagnostic with the potential to significantly improve the quality of the health care system in vulnerable areas.

596410,Dissemination and implementation research in sports and exercise medicine and sports physical therapy: translating evidence to practice and policy,2020-11-13,"There are two types of feline coronaviruses that can be distinguished by serology and sequence analysis. Type I viruses, which are prevalent in the field but are difficult to isolate and propagate in cell culture, and type II viruses, which are less prevalent but replicate well in cell culture. An important determinant of coronavirus infection, in vivo and in cell culture, is the interaction of the virus surface glycoprotein with a cellular receptor. It is generally accepted that feline aminopeptidase N can act as a receptor for the attachment and entry of type II strains, and it has been proposed that the same molecule acts as a receptor for type I viruses. However, the experimental data are inconclusive. The aim of the studies reported here was to provide evidence for or against the involvement of feline aminopeptidase N as a receptor for type I feline coronaviruses. Our approach was to produce retroviral pseudotypes that bear the type I or type II feline coronavirus surface glycoprotein and to screen a range of feline cell lines for the expression of a functional receptor for attachment and entry. Our results show that type I feline coronavirus surface glycoprotein fails to recognize feline aminopeptidase N as a functional receptor on three continuous feline cell lines. This suggests that feline aminopeptidase N is not a receptor for type I feline coronaviruses. Our results also indicate that it should be possible to use retroviral pseudotypes to identify and characterize the cellular receptor for type I feline coronaviruses.","Dye, Charlotte; Temperton, Nigel; Siddell, Stuart G.",J Gen Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17485536/,391

We evaluated the clinical and laboratory parameters of 56 children who received early corticosteroid treatment for pneumonia that was caused by macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) or macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae between July 2019 and February 2020. All subjects had dual positive results from a PCR assay and serological test, and received corticosteroids within 24–36 h after admission. Point mutation of residues 2063, 2064, and 2067 was identified in domain V of 23S rRNA. The mean age was 6.8 years and the male:female ratio was 1.2:1 (31:25 patients). Most of the subjects had macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (73%), and all mutated strains had the A2063G transition. No significant differences in clinical and laboratory parameters were observed between macrolide-resistant and macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae groups that were treated with early dose-adjusted corticosteroids. Higher-dose steroid treatment may be needed for patients who have fever that persists for >48 h or increased biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase concentration at follow-up despite a usual dose of steroid therapy.","Han, Hye Young; Park, Ki Cheol; Yang, Eun-Ae; Lee, Kyung-Yil",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810090/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10061309,391

METHODS: During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Leah; Kurzweil, Arielle; Hasanaj, Lisena; Serrano, Liliana; Balcer, Laura J.; Galetta, Steven L.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20303713?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20303713,391
599510,Effect of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Pediatric Patients’ Admissions to the Emergency Department in an Italian Orthopedic Trauma Hub,2021-07-27,"COVID-19 was primarily identified as a respiratory illness, but reports of patients presenting initially with cardiovascular complaints are rapidly emerging. Many patients also develop cardiovascular complications during and after COVID-19 infection. Underlying cardiovascular disease increases the severity of COVID-19 infection; however, it is unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of or causes cardiovascular complications in patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease. The review is aimed at informing the primary care physicians of the potential cardiovascular complications, especially in patients without underlying cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive literature review was performed on cardiac and vascular complications of COVID-19. The primary cardiac and vascular complications include myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial injury, arrhythmia, heart failure, shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, venous and arterial thrombotic events, stroke, and coagulopathy. A detailed analysis of the pathogenesis revealed six possible mechanisms: direct cardiac damage, hypoxia-induced injury, inflammation, a dysfunctional endothelial response, coagulopathy, and the catecholamine stress response. Autopsy reports from studies show cardiomegaly, hypertrophy, ventricular dilation, infarction, and fibrosis. A wide range of cardiac and vascular complications should be considered when treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Elevated troponin and natriuretic peptides indicate an early cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Continuous monitoring of coagulation by measuring serum D-dimer can potentially prevent vascular complications. A long-term screening protocol to follow-up the patients in the primary care settings is needed to follow-up with the patients who recovered from COVID cardiovascular complications.","Schmid, Aaron; Petrovic, Marija; Akella, Kavya; Pareddy, Anisha; Velavan, Sumathilatha Sakthi",Int J Vasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6693895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035963/,391
601550,An investigation of women’s pregnancy experiences during the COVID‐19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2021-06-10,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, information is being rapidly shared by public health experts and researchers through social media platforms. Whilst government policies were disseminated and discussed, fake news and misinformation simultaneously created a corresponding wave of “infodemics.” This study analyzed the discourse on Twitter in several languages, investigating the reactions to government and public health agency social media accounts that share policy decisions and official messages. The study collected messages from 21 official Twitter accounts of governments and public health authorities in the UK, US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Spain, and Nigeria, from 15 March to 29 May 2020. Over 2 million tweets in various languages were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach to understand the messages both quantitatively and qualitatively. Using automatic, text-based clustering, five topics were identified for each account and then categorized into 10 emerging themes. Identified themes include political, socio-economic, and population-protection issues, encompassing global, national, and individual levels. A comparison was performed amongst the seven countries analyzed and the United Kingdom (Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England) to find similarities and differences between countries and government agencies. Despite the difference in language, country of origin, epidemiological contexts within the countries, significant similarities emerged. Our results suggest that other than general announcement and reportage messages, the most-discussed topic is evidence-based leadership and policymaking, followed by how to manage socio-economic consequences.","Li, Lan; Aldosery, Aisha; Vitiugin, Fedor; Nathan, Naomi; Novillo-Ortiz, David; Castillo, Carlos; Kostkova, Patty",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650948/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.716333,391

601656,Fisetin for COVID‐19 in skilled nursing facilities: Senolytic trials in the COVID era,2021-08-20,"With the gradual increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate, there is an urgent need for an effective drug/vaccine. Several drugs like Remdesivir, Azithromycin, Favirapir, Ritonavir, Darunavir, etc., are put under evaluation in more than 300 clinical trials to treat COVID-19. On the other hand, several vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, Sputnik V, Covishield, Covaxin, etc., also evolved from the research study. While few of them already gets approved, others show encouraging results and are still under assessment. In parallel, there are also significant developments in new drug development. But, since the approval of new molecules takes substantial time, drug repurposing studies have also gained considerable momentum. The primary agent of the disease progression of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV2/nCoV, which is believed to have ∼89% genetic resemblance with SARS-CoV, a coronavirus responsible for the massive outbreak in 2003. With this hypothesis, Human-SARS-CoV protein interactions are used to develop an in-silico Human-nCoV network by identifying potential COVID-19 human spreader proteins by applying the SIS model and fuzzy thresholding by a possible COVID-19 FDA drugs target-based validation. At first, the complete list of FDA drugs is identified for the level-1 and level-2 spreader proteins in this network, followed by applying a drug consensus scoring strategy. The same consensus strategy is involved in the second analysis but on a curated overlapping set of key genes/proteins identified from COVID-19 symptoms. Validation using subsequent docking study has also been performed on COVID-19 potential drugs with the available major COVID-19 crystal structures whose PDB IDs are: 6LU7, 6M2Q, 6W9C, 6M0J, 6M71 and 6VXX.

601913,Exacerbation of chronic myofascial pain during COVID-19,2021-03-31,"Publisher Summary Neutralizing antibodies are evolutionarily important effectors of immunity against viruses. Their evaluation has revealed a number of basic insights into specificity, rules of reactivity (tolerance), and memory—namely, (1) Specificity of neutralizing antibodies is defined by their capacity to distinguish between virus serotypes; (2) B cell reactivity is determined by antigen structure, concentration, and time of availability in secondary lymphoid organs; and (3) B cell memory is provided by elevated protective antibody titers in serum that are depending on antigen stimulation. These perhaps slightly overstated rules are simple, correlate with in vivo evidence as well as clinical observations, and appear to largely demystify many speculations about antibodies and B cell physiology. The chapter also considers successful vaccines and compares them with those infectious diseases where efficient protective vaccines are lacking, it is striking to note that all successful vaccines induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect the host from disease. Successful vaccination against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, or HIV would require induction of additional long-lasting T cell responses to control infection.","Zinkernagel, Rolf M.; Lamarre, Alain; Ciurea, Adrian; Hunziker, Lukas; Ochsenbein, Adrian F.; Mccoy, Kathy D.; Fehr, Thomas; Bachmann, Martin F.; Kalinke, Ulrich; Hengartner, Hans",Advances in Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11680006/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277601790013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277601790013,391

A survey was distributed by email and social media to members of Colorado-based equine organizations. A total of 256 survey responses were obtained from individuals representing a spectrum of ages and roles in the Colorado equine industry. Survey participants predominantly identified as female (95.3%) and their industry role as a horse owner (41%) or a competitive (25.8%) or pleasure (13.3%) rider. Younger survey participants reported greater (P < .0001) use of social media, and both participant age (P < .015) and information source (P < .0001) affected the perception of resource accuracy. In the event of an equine disease outbreak, industry role was an important factor (P = .003) in the selection of news sources, whereas age was not (P = .19). Many participants (56%) identified disease symptoms/signs to be the most important information to be sought during a disease outbreak, and most (69.9%) preferred state or veterinary resources for this information.

Based on the prompt increase of human infection rate, COVID-19 outbreak was distinguished as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). By 2020, COVID-19 becomes a major health problem all around the world. Due to the battle against COVID-19, there are some adversities that are encountered with. The most significant difficulty is the lack of equipment for the COVID-19 battle. Lately, there is not sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital workers on the front lines in this terrifying time. All around the world, hospitals are overwhelmed by the volume of patients and the lack of personal protective equipment including face masks, gloves, eye protection and clothing. In addition, the lack of nasal swabs, which are necessary components, that are used for testing is another issue that is being faced. There are a small number of respirators, which are emergency devices that help patients breathe for a short period of time. To overcome the limited number of equipment available, the foremost solution can be 3D printing that allows three-dimensional renderings to be realized as physical objects with the use of a printer and that revolutionized prototyping. Low-cost desktop 3D printers allow economical 3D models and guides but have less quality approvals. 3D printing is already well integrated into the process of COVID-19 battle by manufacturing the equipment that are convenient. The goals of this review are to explore the techniques of 3D printing for the equipment that are used for COVID-19 battle and evaluate the materials that are used for manufacturing and the manufactured equipment. Lastly, the advantages and disadvantages of 3D printing are figured out.","Aydin, Ayca; Demirtas, Zeynep; Ok, Merve; Erkus, Huseyin; Cebi, Gizem; Uysal, Ebru; Gunduz, Oguzhan; Ustundag, Cem Bulent",Emergent Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585793/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42247-021-00164-y,391

The goal of DPT is to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. However, early press reports from Switzerland suggest multiple challenges for non-technical DPT implementation. Objective: Using media articles published during the first three months after the DPT app launch to describe non-technical implementation challenges reported by different stakeholders and to map these reports to the four constructs of normalization process theory (NPT), a framework to develop and evaluate complex digital health interventions. Methods: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between 04.07.2020 and 03.10.2020. Topics were extracted manually from articles that were deemed pertinent in a structured process. Extracted topics were mapped to NPT constructs. Results: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. These challenges included unclear DPT benefits, which affected commitment and raised fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from certain health system actors. Finally, some reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. These challenges mapped well to the four constructs of NPT. Conclusions: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that non-technical implementation challenges warrant attention. The detected implementation challenges fit well into the framework of NPT, which seems well suited to guide the development and evaluation of complex DPT interventions.","von Wyl, V.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218057v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.20218057,391

PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association between application of ACEI/ARB and risk of COVID‐19, inflammation level, severity COVID‐19 infection, and death in patients with COVID‐19. Eleven studies were included with 33 483 patients. ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin‐6) and elevated immune cells counts (CD3, CD8). Meta‐analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID‐19 infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.89‐1.05) in patients receiving ACEI/ARB therapy, and ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID‐19 (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.59‐0.96) and mortality (OR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.35‐0.79). Subgroup analyses showed among the general population, ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with reduced severe COVID‐19 infection (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.60‐1.05) and all‐cause mortality (OR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.13‐0.75), and COVID‐19 infection (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66‐1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID‐19 (OR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.51‐1.03) and lower mortality (OR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.37‐0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID‐19 infection (OR: 1.00). On the basis of the available evidence, ACEI/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID‐19, either in general population or hypertension patients.

604903,COVID-19 in otolaryngologists: a cross-sectional multicenter study(),2021-07-19,"The sequence of the replicase gene of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) has been determined. This completes the sequence of the entire genome of strain CV777, which was found to be 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length (excluding the poly A-tail). A cloning strategy, which involves primers based on conserved regions in the predicted ORF1 products from other coronaviruses whose genome sequence has been determined, was used to amplify the equivalent, but as yet unknown, sequence of PEDV. Primary sequences derived from these products were used to design additional primers resulting in the amplification and sequencing of the entire ORF1 of PEDV. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed a small open reading frame (ORF) located near the 5′ end (no 99–137), and two large, slightly overlapping ORFs, ORF1a (nt 297–12650) and ORF1b (nt 12605–20641). The ORF1a and ORF1b sequences overlapped at a potential ribosomal frame shift site. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested the presence of several functional motifs within the putative ORF1 protein. By analogy to other coronavirus replicase gene products, three protease and one growth factor-like motif were seen in ORF1a, and one polymerase domain, one metal ion-binding domain, and one helicase motif could be assigned within ORF1b. Comparative amino acid sequence alignments revealed that PEDV is most closely related to human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and less related to murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These results thus confirm and extend the findings from sequence analysis of the structural genes of PEDV.","Kocherhans, Rolf; Bridgen, Anne; Ackermann, Mathias; Tobler, Kurt",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11724265/,391
605016,Trends in Venous Thromboembolism Anticoagulation in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,2021-06-11,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 μM and EC50 of 1.27 μM, respectively. The binding and specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the α-methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for Mpro inhibitor design.","Kitamura, Naoya; Sacco, Michael Dominic; Ma, Chunlong; Hu, Yanmei; Townsend, Julia Alma; Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Zhang, Xiujun; Kukuljac, Adis; Marty, Michael Thomas; Schultz, David; Cherry, Sara; Xiang, Yan; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.423537,391

To assess the association between drinking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, anxiety symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). METHOD. Data was collected through a cross-sectional online survey (non-probabilistic sample) conducted by the Pan American Health Organization between May 22 and June 30, 2020, in 33 countries and two territories of LAC. Participants were 18 years of age or older and must not have traveled outside of their country since March 15, 2020 (n= 12 328, M age= 38.1 years, 65% female). Four drinking behaviors (online socializing drinking [OSD], drinking with child present [DCP], drinking before 5 p.m. [DB5]), heavy episodic drinking [HED]) were response variables, and quarantining, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic covariables were explanatory variables. RESULTS. Quarantine was positively associated with a higher frequency of OSD and with DCP, but negatively associated with a higher frequency of HED. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a higher frequency of HED, more OSD, and DB5. Higher incomes seemed to be more associated with all the studied drinking behaviors. Women tended to report less DB5 and less HED during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS. Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to affect drinking behavior and mental health indicators like anxiety symptoms. This study is the first effort to measure the consequences of the quarantine on alcohol consumption and mental health in LAC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the associations found, screenings and brief interventions targeting alcohol consumption and mental health are recommended.","Garcia-Cerde, Rodrigo; Valente, Juliana Y.; Sohi, Ivneet; Falade, Rachael; Sanchez, Zila M.; Monteiro, Maristela G.",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025727/; https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2021.52,391

Most studies on the subject have focused on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, however, there remains a scientific gap concerning the possibility of reinfection. The purpose of this bibliographic review is to gather information from studies aimed at this possibility, and to clarify what we know so far. It was found that in many situations cured patients are being released from hospitals, however, in some cases, the discharge criteria are not effective. Patients are presenting positive RT-PCR tests. There are several factors that might interfere so that patients cured of COVID-19 continue to test positive, and this would not necessarily represent a case of recurrence, as the test cannot differentiate the viral RNA from the complete virus, which alone is capable of causing the active infection. This review demonstrates that in order to rule out the possibility of COVID-19 reinfection in cured patients, more robust methods need to be adopted as criteria for both clinical discharge and post-hospital follow-up.","Costa, Aratã Oliveira Cortez; de Carvalho Aragão Neto, Humberto; Lopes Nunes, Ana Paula; Dias de Castro, Ricardo; Nóbrega de Almeida, Reinaldo",EXCLI J,https://doi.org/10.17179/excli2021-3383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883981/,391

Due to economic considerations and care for the natural environment, improving the methods currently used in concrete design is also necessary. In this study, the author used principal component analysis as a statistical tool in the concrete mix design process. Using a combination of PCA variables and 2D and 3D factors has made it possible to refine concrete recipes. Thirty-eight concrete mixes of different aggregate grades were analyzed using this method. The applied statistical analysis showed many interesting relationships between the properties of concrete and the content of its components such as the clustering of certain properties, showing dependence between the properties and the quantities of certain ingredients in concrete, and reducing noise in the data, which most importantly simplifies interpretation. This method of analysis can be used as an aid for concrete mix design.","Kobaka, Janusz",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069711/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14102668,391

In this outbreak period, declared a pandemic by WHO and affected the whole world and humanity on a global scale, all kinds of scientific information and evidence-based sharing on the subject gained great importance. METHODS: Overall, 12,301 articles from the web of Science (WOS) Core Collection database were analyzed using SciMAT software, conducted to examine the development of coronavirus publications in the process and to reveal the scientific mapping related to the subject. To analyze the development in the process based on periods, the articles covering the 50 years were compared as five periods of 10 years. RESULTS: The most publications with the Coronavirus theme were made between 2010 and 2020 (n=1020), the total number of citations of these articles was 15,966 and the h-index value was 54. The theme “Coronavirus” was associated with the themes “infection” (w=0.04), “SARS” (w=0.03), “virus” (w=0.04), “identification” (w=0.05) and “swine” (w=0.03). Due to the recent emergence of the COVID-19 theme, it was found to be directly related to the “outbreak” theme (w=0.01). In terms of the distribution of the articles on coronavirus by country, most articles were published by the USA. This country is followed by China, Germany, England and the Netherlands.

Here, we report the clinical features, management, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Wenzhou, China, an area outside Wuhan. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department of Ruian People’s Hospital in Wenzhou, from January 21 to February 7, 2020, were recruited. Medical data on epidemiological history, demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, chest computerized tomography (CT) examination, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Blood biochemistry and routine tests were examined using standard methods and automatic machines. CT examination was performed several times during hospitalization as necessary. RESULTS: A total of 67 confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed; 64 (95.4%) were common cases and three (4.5%) were severe cases. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (86.6%), cough (77.6%), productive cough (52.2%), chest distress (17.9%), and sore throat (11.9%), followed by diarrhea (7.4%), headache (7.4%), shortness of breath (6.0%), dizziness (4.5%), muscular soreness (4.5%), and running nose (4.5%). Thirty patients (47.8%) had increased C-reactive protein levels. The CT radiographs at admission showed abnormal findings in 54 (80.6%) patients. The patients were treated mainly by oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. By March 3, 2020, all 67 patients completely recovered and had negative nucleic acid tests. The patients were discharged from the hospital and transferred to a medical observation isolation center for further observation.

Arthritogenic alphavirus infections, as the name implies, are associated with arthritic outcomes while encephalitic alphavirus infections can lead to encephalitic outcomes in the infected host. Of the non-structural proteins (nsPs) that the viruses code for, nsP3 is the least understood in terms of function. Alphavirus nsP3s are characterized by regions with significantly conserved domain structure along with regions of high variability. Interactions of nsP3 with several host proteins have been documented including, stress granule-related proteins, dead box proteins, heat shock proteins, and kinases. In some cases, in addition to the interaction, requirement of the interaction to support infection has been demonstrated. An understanding of the proteomic network of nsP3 and the mechanisms by which these interactions support the establishment of a productive infection would make alphavirus nsP3 an interesting target for design of effective medical countermeasures.","Lark, Tyler; Keck, Forrest; Narayanan, Aarthi",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375517/,391

607543,Change in urban and non-urban pattern of ED use during the COVID-19 pandemic in 28 Michigan hospitals: an observational study,2021-02-05,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tussilago farfara L. (commonly called coltsfoot), known as a vital folk medicine, have long been used to treat various respiratory disorders and consumed as a vegetable in many parts of the world since ancient times. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to provide a critical evaluation of the current knowledge on the ethnobotanical value, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and quality control of coltsfoot, thus provide a basis for further investigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A detailed literature search was obtained using various online search engines (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, Baidu Scholar, PubMed and CNKI). Additional information was sourced from ethnobotanical literature focusing on Chinese and European flora. The plant synonyms were validated by the database ‘The Plant List’ (www.theplantlist.org). RESULTS: Coltsfoot has diverse uses in local and traditional medicine, but similarities have been noticed, specifically for relieving inflammatory conditions, respiratory and infectious diseases in humans. Regarding its pharmacological activities, many traditional uses of coltsfoot are supported by modern in vitro or in vivo pharmacological studies such as anti-inflammatory activities, neuro-protective activity, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant activity. Quantitative analysis (e.g. GC-MS, UHPLC-MRM(HR)) indicated the presence of a rich (>150) pool of chemicals, including sesquiterpenes, phenolic acids, flavonoids, chromones, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and others from its leaves and buds. In addition, adverse events have resulted from a collection of the wrong plant which contains PAs that became the subject of public concern attributed to their highly toxic. CONCLUSIONS: So far, remarkable progress has been witnessed in phytochemistry and pharmacology of coltsfoot. Thus, some traditional uses have been well supported and clarified by modern pharmacological studies. Discovery of therapeutic natural products and novel structures in plants for future clinical and experimental studies are still a growing interest. Furthermore, well-designed studies in vitro particularly in vivo are required to establish links between the traditional uses and bioactivities, as well as ensure safety before clinical use. In addition, the good botanical identification of coltsfoot and content of morphologically close species is a precondition for quality supervision and control. Moreover, strict quality control measures are required in the studies investigating any aspect of the pharmacology and chemistry of coltsfoot.","Chen, Shujuan; Dong, Lin; Quan, Hongfeng; Zhou, Xirong; Ma, Jiahua; Xia, Wenxin; Zhou, Hao; Fu, Xueyan",J Ethnopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887412033364X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037887412033364X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069788/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113478,391

All three conditions induce systemic inflammation via each pathomechanism-developed production of inflammatory cytokines. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, leading to an increase in Ang II levels. Ang II-induced coagulopathy comprising platelet activation, thrombin generation, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and endothelial injury causes thrombosis via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) DNA activate FXII, resulting in plasmin generation through FXIIa- and kallikrein-mediated plasminogen conversion to plasmin and bradykinin-induced tissue-type plasminogen activator release from the endothelium via the kinin B2 receptor. NETs induce immunothrombosis at the site of infection (lungs), through histone- and DNA-mediated thrombin generation, insufficient anticoagulation control, and inhibition of fibrinolysis. However, if the infection is sufficiently severe, immunothrombosis disseminates into the systemic circulation, and DIC, which is associated with the endothelial injury, occurs. Inflammation, and serine protease networks of coagulation and fibrinolysis, militate each other through complement pathways, which exacerbates three pathologies of COVID-19 coagulopathy. COVID-19 coagulopathy causes microvascular thrombosis and bleeding, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and death in critically ill patients. Treatment targets for improving the prognosis of COVID-19 coagulopathy include thrombin, plasmin, and inflammation, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several drugs are candidates for controlling these conditions; however, further advances are required to establish robust treatments based on a clear understanding of molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 coagulopathy.","Gando, Satoshi; Wada, Takeshi",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177896/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.649122,391

This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for three key groups of cardiovascular disease patients; coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases. First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients. Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures. Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial. These outputs informed timely, data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.","Tam, Derrick Y.; Naimark, David; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Woodward, Graham; Oakes, Garth; Rahal, Mirna; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A.; Ximenes, Raphael; Mac MBiotech, Stephen; Sander, Beate; Wijeysundera, Harindra C.",Can J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.05.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20305031?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20305031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447059/,391

Community health workers (CHWs) are trusted frontline public health workers that bridge gaps between communities and healthcare services. Despite their effectiveness in delivering services and improving outcomes for different chronic conditions, there is a dearth of understanding regarding CHW management of IPV. The purpose of this study is to examine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and readiness to manage IPV among a sample of CHWs (n = 152). Participants completed an online version of the Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey (PREMIS), which was modified for CHW practice. Psychometrics of the newly adapted tool, along with empirical relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to manage IPV were examined. Most sub-scales yielded moderate to high reliability (0.70 < α’s < 0.97), some sub-scales had low reliability (0.57 < α’s < 0.64), and construct validity was established for several of the subscales. On average, many CHWs had low scores on objective knowledge of IPV (mean = 15.4 out of 26), perceived preparation to manage IPV (mean = 3.8 out of 7), and perceived knowledge of IPV (mean = 3.7 out of 7). About 56% of CHWs indicated having no previous IPV training, 34% did not screen for IPV, and 65% were in the contemplation stage of behavior change. Multiple regression models indicated that knowledge, staff capabilities and staff preparation were significant predictors of perceived preparedness to manage IPV (all p’s < 0.05).

Understanding protein rearrangement and identifying specific residues where mutations affect protein rearrangement has attracted a lot of attention for drug development. We use a mathematical method introduced in [9] to associate a local topological/geometrical free energy along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein backbone. Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy. By comparing to experimental data, we find that the high local topological free energy conformations in the spike protein are associated with mutations which have the largest experimentally observed effect to protein rearrangement.","Baldwin, Quenisha; Sumpter, Bobby G; Panagiotou, Eleni",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.06.430094,391

In this article, we present CHEMMESHNET, a newly developed PubMed-based network comprising more than 10,000,000 associations, constructed from expert-curated MeSH annotations of chemicals based on all currently available PubMed articles. By learning latent representations of concepts in the obtained network, we demonstrate in a proof of concept study that purely literature-based representations are sufficient for the reconstruction of a large part of the currently known network of physical, empirically determined protein–protein interactions. We demonstrate that simple linear embeddings of node pairs, when coupled with a neural network–based classifier, reliably reconstruct the existing collection of empirically confirmed protein–protein interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how pairs of learned representations can be used to prioritize potentially interesting novel interactions based on the common chemical context. Highly ranked interactions are qualitatively inspected in terms of potential complex formation at the structural level and represent potentially interesting new knowledge. We demonstrate that two protein–protein interactions, prioritized by structure-based approaches, also emerge as probable with regard to the trained machine-learning model.","Škrlj, Blaž; Kokalj, Enja; Lavrač, Nada",Front Res Metr Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928210/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2021.644614,391

We assessed SARS-CoV-2-S-targeted antibody and T cell responses following full vaccination in nursing home residents (NHR). Methods: We recruited 60 NHR (44 female; median age, 87.5 years), of whom 10 had previously had COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female; median age, 48.5 years). Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantitation of total antibodies binding RBD and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-{gamma}; CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Results: The seroconversion rate in presumably SARS-CoV-2 naive NHR (95.3%), either with or without comorbidities, was similar to controls (94.4%). A robust booster effect was documented in NHR with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were higher in convalescent NHR than in individuals across the other two groups. A large percentage of NHR had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-{gamma}; CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells at baseline, in contrast to healthy controls. Either CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell responses were documented in all control subjects after vaccination. Contrariwise, the percentage of NHR exhibiting detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma}; CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell responses (or both), irrespective of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection status, dropped consistently after vaccination. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma}; CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in NHR decreased in post-vaccination specimens. Conclusion: The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses in NHR. Nevertheless, the frequency and magnitude of detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma}; T-cell responses after vaccination was lower in NHR compared to controls.","Torres, I.; Albert, E.; Gimenez, E.; Alcaraz, M.

611583,Effects of forced air warming systems on the airflow and sanitation quality of operating rooms with non-laminar airflow systems,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has serious impact on health and economics worldwide. Despite the recent advent of SARS-Cov-2 vaccines, treatment options are needed, yet pharmacologic interventions remain limited. Several extracorporeal treatments are currently explored concerning their potential to improve the clinical course and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity adsorber (Exthera Medical, CA, USA) has recently been introduced for the elimination of several pathogens from the blood and an emergency authorization in patients with COVID-19 was granted by the FDA. Bacteria, viruses (including the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein), fungi and toxins have been shown to bind to the immobilized heparin on the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene beads of the device in a similar way to the interaction with heparan sulfate on the cell-surface and are thereby removed from the bloodstream. Here we report the interim analysis of the COVID-19 patients treated with the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity filter (COSA) registry. The goal of the registry is to gather data regarding the safety and efficacy of the Seraph® 100 in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHOD: Participating sites were advised to insert patient data of COVID-19 patients, treated with the Seraph® 100, during their hospital stay into the COSA registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04361500). A total of 66 items were asked in a web-based platform. RESULTS: Until January 2021, 33 patients with 39 treatment sessions form six different hospitals were reported to the register (seven female, median age 61 years, Table 1). The patients were treated between March and December 2020. Eleven patients with a hospital admission between March and August and 22 between September and December 2020. The Seraph® 100 treatment was initiated 9 days after symptom onset, without any difference between survivors and non-survivors. Overall, a mortality of 27% was reported. Serious comorbidities (as preadmission immunosuppressive therapy, lung fibrosis or CKD5T) were reported in all of the non-survivors. Invasive ventilation was needed in 67% of these patients when Seraph treatment was initiated. A non-significant trend towards higher Ferritin levels in non-survivors (2000 (1963 – 8326) vs. 989 (644 – 2000), p=0.09) was reported. All treatments were well tolerated, three clotting events were reported. CONCLUSION: Viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA is frequently (up to 78%) seen in the blood of critically ill COVID-19 patients and correlates with the severity of the disease. The Seraph® 100 can bind to viral spike protein, proinflammatory cytokines may be reduced by the device and hemodynamic stabilization has been reported during the Seraph®100 treatment of COVID-19 patients. Platelets can be hyperactivated in association with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and thus presumably trigger the hypercoagulation and thrombosis. In this context, the removal of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to prevent hyperactivated platelets appears to be a sensible approach. All reported deaths were associated with serious preexisting comorbidities, immunosuppression, dialysis dependent renal failure, or a combination of these factors. Hence, Seraph® 100 treatment may be most beneficial in COVID-19 courses of patients without multi organ failure. More clinical data is needed to describe possible benefits of the Seraph®100 in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Schmidt, Julius J; Van´t Klooster, Mariet; Borchina, Dan N; Büttner, Stefan; Bader, Birgit; Herbst, Larissa; Fuehner, Thomas; Kielstein, Jan T",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab099.0014,391

Chronic diaphragmatic herniation is usually due to white weapon injury and as consequence of low suspicious and absence of proper investigation. CASE REPORT: We report a chronic diaphragmatic herniation after three years of a stab in the left thoracoabdominal transition, managed through laparotomy. DISCUSSION: Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a rare trauma consequence, most common in the left side. The herniation occurs gradually because of negative pressure of the thoracic cavity that works as a suction of the abdominal organs. CONCLUSION: Traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures diagnosis is difficult and might go unnoticed without high suspicious and proper investigation. Chronic herniation is associated with higher morbimortality.","Dorgam Maués, Carolina Augusta; de Vasconcelos, Enny Luana Carmo; da Silva Galvão, Renato; Rios Rodriguez, Juan Eduardo; Bastos Voronaya, Alejandro Luis; de Castro, Gustavo Lopes",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.12.079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434769/,391

The lack of time to set up these strategies, hindered a proper design of online instructions and delivery of knowledge. Bioinformatics-related training and other onsite practical education, tend to rely on extensive practice, where students and instructors have a face-to-face interaction to improve the learning outcome. For these courses to maintain their high quality when adapted as online courses, different designs need to be tested and the students’ perceptions need to be heard. RESULTS: This study focuses on short bioinformatics-related courses for graduate students at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, which were originally developed for onsite training. Once adapted as online courses, several modifications in their design were tested to obtain the best fitting learning strategy for the students. To improve the online learning experience, we propose a combination of: (i) short synchronized sessions, (ii) extended time for own and group practical work, (iii) recorded live lectures and (iv) increased opportunities for feedback in several formats.

The discrete time version is as general and flexible as its continuous-time counterpart, and contains numerous compartmental models as special cases. In contrast to the continuous time version, the discrete time version of the model is very easy to implement computationally, and thus promises to become a powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases. To demonstrate the potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and initial speed of epidemic spread, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models that use a fixed duration for the latent and infectious periods.","Diekmann, O.; Othmer, H.

We aim to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Methods 37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n=19) and PPN group (n=18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N=negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n=37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison. Results Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings, including WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, albumin, AST, CRP, SAA, and IL-6. The absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Conclusion Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.

617648,Sleep in adults from the UK during the first few months of the coronavirus outbreak,2021,"This paper introduces a new approach of multifactor asset pricing model estimation. This approach assumes that the monthly returns of financial assets are fuzzy random variables and estimates the multifactor asset pricing model as a fuzzy linear model. The fuzzy random representations allows us to incorporate bias on prices induced by the market microstructure noise and to reflect the intra-period activity in the analysis. The application of fuzzy linear regression enables the uncertainty assessment in an alternative way to confidence interval or hypothesis testing, which is subjected the binding assumption of normal distribution of returns. However, it is well known that the distribution of many asset returns deviates significantly from the normal assumption. We illustrate this estimation in the particular case of the Fama and French’s (J Financ Econ 33:3–56, 1993) three factor model. Finally, empirical studies based on Fama and French’s portfolios and risk factors, historical dataset highlight the effectiveness of our estimation method and a comparative analysis with the ordinary least square estimation shows its ability to be applied for an optimal decision decision making in the financial market.","Mbairadjim Moussa, Alfred; Sadefo Kamdem, Jules",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465935/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04228-4,391

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1346 participants answered a web-based survey with questions related to the aims of the study. Descriptive statistic was performed and the responses were analyzed with chi-square test and regression analysis. RESULTS: With the use of masks, toothbrushing frequency decreased significantly, and people are significantly less concerned about oral hygiene. The number of subjects that reported to have halitosis increased significantly and this was associated with a decrease in toothbrushing frequency. The greatest complaints of subjects were teeth color and alignment. The prevalence of bruxism increased significantly. Overall, 94.1% considered that esthetics is important to seek dental care even with the use of masks, and 84.2% are maintaining usual periodic dental care. People are significantly less concerned with their smile and dental esthetics with the use of masks. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of face mask, people must be motivated regarding maintaining oral hygiene habits. Some respondents will seek dental care only when masks were no longer necessary, therefore dentists must be aware of a reduction in the volume of patients.

Since its first description in 2013, over 200 patients have been reported worldwide. Unsurprisingly, many of the newly diagnosed patients were recruited later in life from previously long-standing unclassified immunodeficiencies and the early course of the disease is, therefore, often less well-described. In this study, we report clinical and laboratory features of eight patients followed for APDS, with particular focus on early warning signs, longitudinal development of their symptoms, individual variations, and response to therapy. The main clinical features shared by our patients included recurrent bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal disease, non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and susceptibility to EBV. All patients tolerated vaccination with both attenuated live and subunit vaccines with no adverse effects, although some failed to mount adequate antibody response. Laboratory findings were characterized by dysgammaglobulinaemia, elevated serum IgM, block in B-cell maturation with high transitional B cells, and low naïve T cells with CD8 T-cell activation. All patients benefited from immunoglobulin replacement therapy, whereas immunosuppression with mTOR pathway inhibitors was only partially successful. Therapy with specific PI3K inhibitor leniolisib was beneficial in all patients in the clinical trial. These vignettes, summary data, and particular tell-tale signs should serve to facilitate early recognition, referral, and initiation of outcome-improving therapy.","Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Zachova, Radana; Milota, Tomas; Kanderova, Veronika; Sediva, Anna",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350147/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.697706,391

After the COVID-19 pandemic, individual rumination as an important cognitive process should be given more attention because of its close associations with physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that creativity as an antecedent variable can predict people’s mental health or adaptation. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between creativity and individual cognitive rumination after traumatic events, and the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. By using the Runco Ideational Behavior Scale (RIBS), the Event Related Rumination Inventory, and the Questionnaire of Adolescent Emotional Resilience, the current study explored the relationship between creativity and intrusive rumination among 1488 Chinese teenagers during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed the moderating effect of emotional resilience on the relationship. The results showed that creativity, as assessed by the RIBS, was positively related to teenagers’ intrusive rumination, which implied that a higher level of creative performance could predict more intrusive rumination. Moreover, emotional resilience acted as a moderator in the relationship between creativity and intrusive rumination; the correlation was stronger when emotional resilience was low. These findings provide more evidence of the relationship between creativity and mental health and show the effect of this traumatic event on teenagers.","Wang, Qian; Zhao, Xin; Yuan, Yuming; Shi, Baoguo",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.601104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519607/,391

Although its seroprevalence is highly variable among territories, it has been reported at around 10%, but higher in health workers. Evidence regarding cross-neutralizing response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. However, other previous coronaviruses may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they are phylogenetically related and share the same target receptor. Further, the seroconversion of IgM and IgG occurs at around 12 days post onset of symptoms and most patients have neutralizing titers on days 14-20, with great titer variability. Neutralizing antibodies correlate positively with age, male sex, and severity of the disease. Moreover, the use of convalescent plasma has shown controversial results in terms of safety and efficacy, and due to the variable immune response among individuals, measuring antibody titers before transfusion is mostly required. Similarly, cellular immunity seems to be crucial in the resolution of the infection, as SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells circulate to some extent in recovered patients. Of note, the duration of the antibody response has not been well established yet.","Chvatal-Medina, Mateo; Mendez-Cortina, Yorjagis; Patiño, Pablo J.; Velilla, Paula A.; Rugeles, Maria T.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936045/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.633184,391

Thus, we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three patients with MS and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The patients yielding the isolates from their CSF possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood, in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases studied at the same time. The virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the CNS. The agent has not yet been adequately characterized, but it deserves further attention because it seems to be a hitherto unknown virus, difficult to isolate and difficult to work with in the laboratory.

The dependent variable was COVID-19 vaccination coverage in 138 countries as of May 31, 2021. A single-mediator model based on structural equation modeling was developed to analyze mediation effects in different country income groups. Compared with high-income countries, upper-middle- (β = −1.44, 95% CI: −1.86–−1.02, p < 0.001), lower-middle- (β = −2.24, 95% CI: −2.67–−1.82, p < 0.001), and low- (β = −4.05, 95% CI: −4.59–−3.51, p < 0.001) income countries had lower vaccination coverage. Vaccination policies mediated 14.6% and 15.6% of the effect in upper-middle- (β = −0.21, 95% CI: −0.39–−0.03, p = 0.020) and lower-middle- (β = −0.35, 95% CI: −0.56–−0.13, p = 0.002) income countries, respectively, whereas the mediation effect was not significant in low-income countries (β = −0.21, 95% CI: −0.43–0.01, p = 0.062).

Using structure-guided chimeric spike designs and multiplexed immunizations, we demonstrate protection against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat CoV (BtCoV) RsSHC014 challenge in highly vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike mRNAs containing N-terminal domain (NTD), and receptor binding domains (RBD) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against three high-risk sarbecoviruses: SARS-CoV, RsSHC014, and WIV-1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a 10 to >500-fold reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous sarbecovirus strains, but SARS-CoV challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infection including measurable lung pathology. Importantly, chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized both the D614G and the South African B.1.351 variants of concern despite some reduction in neutralization activity. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes may provide a novel strategy to prevent pandemic and SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections, while revealing the limited efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccines against other sarbecoviruses.","Martinez, David R.; Schaefer, Alexandra; Leist, Sarah R.; De la Cruz, Gabriela; West, Ande; Atochina-Vasserman, Elena N.; Parks, Robert; Barr, Maggie; Li, Dapeng; Yount, Boyd; Saunders, Kevin O.; Weissman, Drew; Haynes, Barton F.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Baric, Ralph S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.434872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758837/,391

624604,The association of social frailty with intrinsic capacity in community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study,2021-09-27,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was identified as a novel member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family in China. The detailed clinical features of cases with SFTSV infection have not been well described, and the risk factors for severity among patients and fatality among severe patients remain to be determined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clinical and laboratory features of 115 hospitalized patients with SFTSV infection during the period from June 2010 to December 2011 in Northeast China were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the risk factors associated with severity in confirmed cases and fatality in severe cases by multivariate analysis. One hundred and three (89.6%) of 115 patients presented with multiple organ dysfunction, and 22 (19.1%) of 115 proceeded to the stage of life threatening multiple organ failure. Of the 115 patients, 14 fatalities (12.2%) were reported. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent predictors of risk for severity were: albumin ≤30 g/l (OR, 8.09; 95% CI, 2.58-25.32), APTT ≥ 66 seconds (OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 3.28-62.24), sodium ≤130 mmol/l (OR, 5.44; 95% CI, 1.38-21.40), and presence of neurological manifestations (OR, 7.70; 95% CI, 1.91-31.12). Among patients with severe disease, presence of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.48–14.19) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.38–13.03) were independently associated with fatality. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SFTSV infection may present with more severe symptoms and laboratory abnormalities than hitherto reported. Due to infection with a novel bunyavirus, the patients may sufferer multiple organ dysfunction and die of multiple organ failure. In the clinical assessment of any case of SFTS, independent factors relating to prognosis need to be taken into account by clinicians.","Deng, Baocheng; Zhou, Bo; Zhang, Shujun; Zhu, Ying; Han, Leqiang; Geng, Yingzhi; Jin, Zhenan; Liu, Hongbo; Wang, Donglei; Zhao, Yitong; Wen, Ying; Cui, Wei; Zhou, Ying; Gu, Qiuhong; Sun, Cuiming; Lu, Xu; Wang, Wen; Wang, Yu; Li, Chengbo; Wang, Yanli; Yao, Wenqing; Liu, Pei",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236203/,391

Furthermore, to compare clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with active COVID-19 against those without COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically analysed 348 STEMI cases presenting to the PPCI programme in London during the peak of the pandemic (1 March to 30 April 2020) and compared with 440 cases from the same period in 2019. Outcomes of interest included ambulance response times, timeliness of revascularisation, angiographic and procedural characteristics, and in-hospital clinical outcomes RESULTS: There was a 21% reduction in STEMI admissions and longer ambulance response times (87 (62–118) min in 2020 vs 75 (57–95) min in 2019, p<0.001), but that this was not associated with a delays in achieving revascularisation once in hospital (48 (34–65) min in 2020 vs 48 (35–70) min in 2019, p=0.35) or increased mortality (10.9% (38) in 2020 vs 8.6% (38) in 2019, p=0.28). 46 patients with active COVID-19 were more thrombotic and more likely to have intensive care unit admissions (32.6% (15) vs 9.3% (28), OR 5.74 (95%CI 2.24 to 9.89), p<0.001). They also had increased length of stay (4 (3–9) days vs 3 (2–4) days, p<0.001) and a higher mortality (21.7% (10) vs 9.3% (28), OR 2.72 (95% CI 1.25 to 5.82), p=0.012) compared with patients having PPCI without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PPCI pathways can be maintained during unprecedented healthcare emergencies but confirms the high mortality of STEMI in the context of concomitant COVID-19 infection characterised by a heightened state of thrombogenicity.","Little, Callum D; Kotecha, Tushar; Candilio, Luciano; Jabbour, Richard J; Collins, George B; Ahmed, Asrar; Connolly, Michelle; Kanyal, Ritesh; Demir, Ozan M; Lawson, Lucy O; Wang, Brian; Firoozi, Sam; Spratt, James C; Perera, Divaka; MacCarthy, Philip; Dalby, Miles; Jain, Ajay; Wilson, Simon J; Malik, Iqbal; Rakhit, Roby",Open Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2020-001432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106441/,391

Identifying post-COVID-19 complications is crucial for early diagnosis and subsequent initiation of therapies to ensure more favorable outcomes. Severe COVID-19-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been previously described during the acute phase of the infection. It is characterized by hyperinflammation, multi-organ involvement, and hemophagocytosis. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented, two weeks after recovery from COVID-19, with hyperosmolar state and high inflammatory markers. Bone marrow aspirate, flow cytometry, extensive viral panel and total body scan were performed. Review of bone marrow aspirate smear showed hemophagocytosis. Flow cytometry, viral panel, and total body scan were normal. The diagnosis of post COVID-19-related HLH was made. Unfortunately, the patient died despite adequate treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case establishing a high probability of COVID-19-related HLH given its occurrence two weeks following a documented biological and clinical recovery.

The novel COVID-19 is the most recent lethal virus and has been declared to be a pandemic disease on March 11th, 2020. It has spread from China to most of the countries around the world causing a great burden on individuals and communities. The socioeconomic and professional profiles have been affected seriously by this pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term effects of COVID-19 on the socioeconomic profile of spinal surgeons in Egypt. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey study to address the effect of COVID-19 global pandemic on spine surgeons in Egypt, discussing the short-term socioeconomic effect of COVID-19 global pandemic on the professional and social profiles of the Egyptian spine surgeons. A SurveyMonkey(®) questionnaire was sent to 190 spine surgeons registered in the Egyptian spine association database. Results: Ninety male surgeons responded to our four-day survey. The responders included the following: 4 residents, 16 fellows, and 70 consultants working in different Egyptian hospitals. The partial country lockdown was associated with drop in monthly income and in number of both elective and emergency operations. Most surgeons either stopped surgery or limited the number of either elective or emergency surgeries as well as outpatient clinics. Most of them were not in the COVID-19 team or did not receive any training, working under immense physical and psychological stress of being exposed to transmission of infection. Discussion: COVID-19 global pandemic negatively affected spine surgeons in Egypt socioeconomically. The Health Authority and the community have to work jointly to help the health care professionals in overcoming this crisis.","Khattab, Mohamed Fawzy; Abou-Madawi, Ali Mohamed",SICOT-J,https://doi.org/10.1051/sicotj/2020029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819456/,391
626294,Authenticity as a Resilience Factor Against CV-19 Threat Among Those With Chronic Pain and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,2021-04-28,"Billions of cells undergo turnover and die via apoptosis throughout our lifetime. A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (e.g., atherosclerosis, lung diseases) and tumor diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via the tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.","Lin, Danfeng; Kang, Xiaodiao; Shen, Lu; Tu, Sheng; Lenahan, Cameron; Chen, Yiding; Wang, Xiaochen; Shao, Anwen",Mol Ther Oncolytics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2372770520300607?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2372770520300607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346605/,391

DESCRIPTION: The Florida Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Initiative funds perinatal home visiting for pregnant women and families with infants throughout the state. Florida MIECHV has shown resilience to disasters and times of crises in the past, while generating a culture of adaptation and continuous quality improvement among local implementing agencies. Florida MIECHV responded to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis within the first few days of the first reported case in Florida by providing guidance on virtual home visits and working remotely. ASSESSMENT: Findings highlight the role of administrative leadership and communication, staff willingness/morale, logistical considerations, and the needs of enrolled families who face hardships during the pandemic such as job loss, limited supplies, food insecurity, technology limitations, and stress. Home visitors support enrolled families by connecting them with resources, providing public health education and delivering evidence-based home visiting curricula virtually. They also recognized the emotional burden surrounding COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties along with achieving work-life balance by caring for their own children. CONCLUSION: This evaluation helped in understanding the impact of the pandemic on this maternal and child health program and fundamentals of transition to virtual home visiting services. Virtual home visiting appears to be feasible and provides an essential connection to supports for families who may not otherwise have the means or knowledge to access them.","Marshall, Jennifer; Kihlström, Laura; Buro, Acadia; Chandran, Vidya; Prieto, Concha; Stein-Elger, Rafaella; Koeut-Futch, Keryden; Parish, Allison; Hood, Katie",Matern Child Health J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-02982-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691359/,391

Monitoring HCWs, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, through screening programs, are critical to avoid the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the hospital environment to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals and to allow their prompt return to work as soon as necessary. We aim to describe our healthcare surveillance experience (April 2–May 6, 2020) based on a combined screening consisting of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and rapid serologic tests (RST) for SARS-CoV-2 in all HCWs of Meyer Children's University Hospital in Florence. Among the analyzed workers, 13/1690 (0.8%), all of them without clinical manifestations, was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 by using RT-PCR on NP swab: 8/1472 (0.5%) were found positive during the screening, 1/188 (0.5%) during contact with a positive individual (p > 0.05 vs. screening group), while 4/30 (13.3%) were found positive on the day of re-admission at work after an influenza-like-illness (p < 0.05). Concerning working areas, the majority of RT-PCR positivity (12/13) and serologic positivity (34/42) was found in non-COVID-19 dedicated areas (p > 0.05 vs. COVID-19 dedicated areas). No cases were registered among non-patients-facing workers (p = 0.04 vs. patient-facing group). Nurses and residents represented, respectively, the working role with the highest and lowest percentage of RT-PCR positivity. In conclusion, accurate surveillance is essential to reduce virus spread among HCWs, patients, and the community and to limit the shortage of skilled professionals. The implementation of the surveillance system through an efficient screening program was offered to all professionals, regardless of the presence of clinical manifestations and the level of working exposure risk, maybe wise and relevant.","Guarnieri, Valentina; Moriondo, Maria; Giovannini, Mattia; Lodi, Lorenzo; Ricci, Silvia; Pisano, Laura; Barbacci, Paola; Bini, Costanza; Indolfi, Giuseppe; Zanobini, Alberto; Azzari, Chiara",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.644702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381749/,391

This paper examines air flow path and airborne pollutant distribution by computational fluid dynamics modeling and field measurement. In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the “low-level extraction” technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone. A new clean isolation room ventilation strategy has been developed that employs two exhaust air grilles on the wall behind the bed at low floor level, coupled with a fan filter unit, and is found to have the highest pollutant removal efficiency.","Cho, Jinkyun",Appl Therm Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288589/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431118341280; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.11.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359431118341280,391

Past coronavirus epidemics namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have also been severe on older people. These epidemics lasted for only a limited period, however, and have proven short lived in the memories of both the public and public health systems. No lessons were learnt to mitigate the impact of future epidemics of such nature, on older people. This complacency we feel has claimed the lives of many older people during the current COVID-19 global epidemic. The nature of risks associated with acquiring infections and associated mortality among older people in respiratory epidemic situations are varied and of serious concern. Our commentary identifies demographic, biological, behavioural, social and healthcare-related determinants, which increase the vulnerability of older people to respiratory epidemics. We acknowledge that these determinants will likely vary between older people in high- and low-middle income countries. Notwithstanding these variations, we call for urgent action to mitigate the impact of epidemics on older people and preserve their health and dignity. Intersectoral programmes that recognise the special needs of older people and in unique contexts such as care homes must be developed and implemented, with the full participation and agreement of older people.

Medical physicists (MPs) are key healthcare professionals in maintaining safe and effective RT. This study reports on MPs experience during the first pandemic peak and explores the consequences on their work. METHODS: A 39-question survey on changes in departmental and clinical practice and on the impact for the future was sent to the global MP community. A total of 433 responses were analysed by professional role and by country clustered on the daily infection numbers. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 was bigger in countries with high daily infection rate. The majority of MPs worked in alternation at home/on-site. Among practice changes, implementation and/or increased use of hypofractionation was the most common (47% of the respondents). Sixteen percent of respondents modified patient-specific quality assurance (QA), 21% reduced machine QA, and 25% moved machine QA to weekends/evenings. The perception of trust in leadership and team unity was reversed between management MPs (towards increased trust and unity) and clinical MPs (towards a decrease). Changes such as home-working and increased use of hypofractionation were welcomed. However, some MPs were concerned about pressure to keep negative changes (e.g. weekend work). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 affected MPs through changes in practice and QA procedures but also in terms of trust in leadership and team unity. Some changes were welcomed but others caused worries for the future.

630069,The psycho-emotional impact of COVID-19 on surgical staff working in emergency departments,2020-06-03,"There are currently around 200 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials throughout the world. The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical. Careful evaluation and ongoing surveillance for safety will be required to address theoretical concerns regarding immune enhancement seen in previous contexts. Herein, we review the current knowledge about the immune response to this novel virus as it pertains to the design of effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the range of novel and established approaches to vaccine development being taken.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to describe the current landscape of POCT in Wisconsin community pharmacies and identify opportunities for the advancement of testing and the key factors influencing the realization of these opportunities. METHODS: A survey was administered over the telephone to pharmacy managers of community pharmacies in Wisconsin. The sites were randomly selected from predefined geographic regions to mirror pharmacy distribution across Wisconsin. The survey items evaluated provision of POCT, future direction of POCT, barriers and motivators to offering POCT, and pharmacy demographics. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Pharmacy managers from 147 of the 938 registered community pharmacies (15.7%) participated in the survey. Only 17.1% of the pharmacies were offering POCT; however, 48.3% of managers reported that their pharmacy would likely implement or expand POCT within the next 5 years. The most commonly reported barriers to initiating or expanding POCT were the limitations on pharmacist availability to oversee testing and workflow restrictions. Continuing to advance the pharmacy profession was a top reason for offering or expanding testing services. DISCUSSION: While few pharmacies are offering POCT in Wisconsin, there is motivation for expansion in coming years. Understanding, anticipating and addressing common barriers can faciliate this process. CONCLUSION: This needs analysis offers a blueprint for researchers, educators, and clinicians to shape POCT efforts by examining the landscape of pharmacy-based testing in their own states and communities.","Gallimore, Casey E.; Porter, Andrea L.; Barnett, Susanne G.; Portillo, Edward; Zorek, Joseph A.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319120306348; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.12.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319120306348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431252/,391
633517,Association of Race/Ethnicity With Likeliness of COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among Health Workers and the General Population in the San Francisco Bay Area,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 began spreading in December 2019 and has since become a pandemic that has impacted many aspects of human society. Several issues concerning the origin, time of introduction to humans, evolutionary patterns, and underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain unclear. METHOD: Genetic variation in 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and related coronaviruses as of 2/23/2020 was analyzed. RESULT: After correcting for mutational bias, the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was revealed which is consistent with the recent outbreak of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV during its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation. The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression that occurred approximately 40 years ago. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD 11/13/2019–12/23/2019). The effective population size of the virus showed an approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1/23/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing its spread. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251 V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The former first appeared on 1/5/2020 and plateaued around 1/23/2020. The latter rapidly increased in frequency after 1/23/2020. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China is two times higher than those derived from the rest of the world. A network analysis found that haplotypes collected from Wuhan were interior and had more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being discovered. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and determine the critical steps required for effective spreading.","Chaw, Shu-Miaw; Tai, Jui-Hung; Chen, Shi-Lun; Hsieh, Chia-Hung; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Yang, Wei-Shiung; Chen, Pei-Jer; Wang, Hurng-Yi",J Biomed Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-020-00665-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507105/,391

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 8,291 outpatients aged 18–85 years, in 18 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from 14th February to May 31, 2020. We collected the data regarding participant's characteristics, UHC, HB, PB, depression, and anxiety. Results: People with UHC had higher odds of depression (OR = 2.11; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.86; p < 0.001) than those without UHC. The odds of depression and anxiety were significantly higher for those with UHC and S-COVID-19-S (p < 0.001); and were significantly lower for those had UHC and interacted with “unchanged/more” physical activity (p < 0.001), or “unchanged/more” drinking (p < 0.001 for only anxiety), or “unchanged/healthier” eating (p < 0.001), and high PB score (p < 0.001), as compared to those without UHC and without S-COVID-19-S, “never/stopped/less” physical activity, drinking, “less healthy” eating, and low PB score, respectively. Conclusion: S-COVID-19-S worsen psychological health in patients with UHC. Physical activity, drinking, healthier eating, and high PB score were protective factors.","Nguyen, Minh H.; Pham, Thu T.

METHODS: : A cross-sectional online survey of 4,342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13–23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: : The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. CONCLUSIONS: : Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.","Tang, Suqin; Xiang, Mi; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720328603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099049/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720328603?v=s5,391

Whereas A2 is overexpressed in hemorrhagic disease such as acute promyelocytic leukemia, its underexpression or impairment may result in thrombosis, as in antiphospholipid syndrome, venous thromboembolism, or atherosclerosis. Within immune response cells, A2 orchestrates membrane repair, vesicle fusion, and cytoskeletal organization, thus playing a critical role in inflammatory response and tissue injury. Dysregulation of A2 is evident in multiple human disorders, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. The fibrinolytic system, moreover, is central to wound healing through its ability to remodel the provisional matrix and promote angiogenesis. A2 dysfunction may also promote tissue fibrogenesis and end-organ fibrosis.","Lim, Hana I.; Hajjar, Katherine A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202091/,391

Baboons had prolonged viral RNA shedding and substantially more lung inflammation compared with macaques. Inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was increased in old versus young baboons. Using techniques like CT imaging, immunophenotyping, alveolar/peripheral cytokine responses and immunohistochemical analyses, we delineated cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaque and baboon lungs, including innate and adaptive immune cells and a prominent Type I-interferon response. Macaques developed T cell memory phenotype/responses and bystander cytokine production. Old macaques had lower titres of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels compared with young.

The present survey reports data collected by the Italian Association for Neuroendocrine Tumors on the management of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) during the pandemic dissemination. METHODS: A survey with 57 questions was sent to NEN-dedicated Italian centers regarding the management of patients in the period March 9, 2020, to May 9, 2020 RESULTS: The main modification in the centers’ activity consisted of decreases in newly diagnosed NEN patients (− 76.8%), decreases in performed surgical procedures (− 58%), delays to starting peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (45.5%), postponed/canceled follow-up examinations (26%), and canceled multidisciplinary teams’ activity (20.8%). A low proportion of centers (< 10%) reported having to withdraw systemic anti-tumor medical treatment due to concerns about the pandemic situation, whereas PRRT was withdrawn from no patients. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 outbreak induced the centers to reduce some important activities in the management of NEN patients, the Italian network was able to provide continuity in care without withdrawing anti-tumor treatment for the majority of patients.

How ACE2 binding activates proteolysis of S protein is unknown. Here, using amide hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations, we have mapped the S:ACE2 interaction interface and uncovered long-range allosteric propagation of ACE2 binding to sites necessary for host-mediated proteolysis of S protein, critical for viral host entry. Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 Å away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat [HR]) regions ~130 Å away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the prefusion state. Our findings provide a dynamics map of the S:ACE2 interface in solution and also offer mechanistic insights into how ACE2 binding is allosterically coupled to distal proteolytic processing sites and viral–host membrane fusion. Thus, protease docking sites flanking the S1/S2 cleavage site represent alternate allosteric hotspot targets for potential therapeutic development.","Raghuvamsi, Palur V; Tulsian, Nikhil K; Samsudin, Firdaus; Qian, Xinlei; Purushotorman, Kiren; Yue, Gu; Kozma, Mary M; Hwa, Wong Y; Lescar, Julien; Bond, Peter J; MacAry, Paul A; Anand, Ganesh S",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.63646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554856/,391

Therefore, four SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR kits have been approved by the emergency-use-authorization (EUA) without clinical validation in Korea until March 15, 2020. This study evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of these kits. Allplex 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), PowerChek 2019-nCoV (KogeneBiotech, Seoul), Real-Q 2019-nCoV Real-Time Detection (BioSewoom, Seoul), and StandardM nCoV Detection (SD BIOSENSOR, Osong, Korea) were evaluated. The limit of detection (LODs) of Allplex, PowerChek, and Real-Q was determined by testing the transcribed RNA of SARS-CoV-2 E and the RNA of SARS-CoV Frankfurt1. A total of 27 consecutive samples comprising 13 sputum, 12 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), 1 urine and 1 stool sample were collected from 2 COVID-19 patients for sensitivity analysis. Precision was assessed via daily tests of positive and negative controls in each kit for 5 d. Reproducibility was examined by repeating 21 samples and 10-fold dilutions of 14 samples in pairs using Allplex. Specificity was evaluated with 24 other respiratory virus-positive samples. LOD of Allplex, PowerChek, and Real-Q were 153.9, 84.1, and 80.6 copies/mL, respectively. The degrees of association between Cts and log viral concentrations by Allplex and PowerChek was expressed as y = −3.319 log (x) + 42.039 (R = 0.96) and y = −3.392 log(x) + 43.113 (R = 0.98), respectively. One or more of the 4 kits detected 20 out of 27 clinical samples positive. Of the 20 positive samples, the detection rates of positives for Allplex, PowerChek, Real-Q, and StandardM were 90.0, 82.3, 75.0, and 100.0%, respectively, but those of PowerChek and Real-Q would be 100% if out-of-cutoff Cts were counted as positives. Precision was 100%. Interpretation of Allplex results was reproducible when Ct of E ≤33. All 4 kits showed no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses.

Modulating eIF4F function through cellular regulation or small-molecule inhibition impacts coronavirus replication, including for SARS-CoV-2. Translation initiation involves highly coordinated dynamics of translation factors with messenger or viral RNA. However, how the eIF4F subunits coordinate on the initiation timescale to define cap-binding efficiency remains incompletely understood. Here we report that translation supported by the SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR is highly sensitive to eIF4A inhibition by rocaglamide. Through a single-molecule fluorescence approach that reports on eIF4E–cap interaction, we dissect how eIF4F subunits contribute to cap-recognition efficiency on the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR. We find that free eIF4A enhances cap accessibility for eIF4E binding, but eIF4G alone does not change the kinetics of eIF4E–RNA interaction. Conversely, formation of the full eIF4F complex significantly alters eIF4E–cap interaction, suggesting that coordinated eIF4E and eIF4A activities establish the net eIF4F–cap recognition efficiency. Moreover, the eIF4F complex formed with phosphomimetic eIF4E(S209D) binds the viral UTR more efficiently than with wild-type eIF4E. These results highlight a dynamic interplay of eIF4F subunits and mRNA that determines cap-recognition efficiency.","Hong, Hea Jin; Guevara, Matthew G.; Lin, Eric; O’Leary, Seán E.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075378/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445185,391

In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC(50) and EC(90) values of 1.08 ± 0.09 µM and 2.69 ± 0.47 µM, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC(50) value of 7.41 ± 1.09 µM in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09 ± 4.25 µM. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels. AQ was stable for at least 96 h and had minor inhibitory effect on entry, translation, and post-replication stages in the viral life cycle. DENV protease, 5’-methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ.

However, trauma admissions are not scheduled and cannot be postponed. There is a paucity of information available on continuing trauma care during the pandemic. The study purpose was to describe multicenter trauma care process changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive survey summarized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at six Level I trauma centers. The survey was completed in 05/2020. Questions were asked about personal protective equipment, ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and negative pressure rooms. Data were summarized as proportions. RESULTS: The survey took an average of 5 days. Sixty-seven percent reused N-95 respirators; 50% sanitized them with 25% using ultraviolet light. One hospital (17%) had regional resources impacted. Thirty-three percent created ventilator allocation protocols. Most hospitals (83%) designated more beds to the ICU; 50% of hospitals designated an ICU for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were isolated in negative pressure rooms at all hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Level I trauma centers created processes to provide optimal trauma patient care and still protect providers. Other centers can use the processes described to continue care of trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Harwood, Laura; Jarvis, Stephanie; Salottolo, Kristin; Redmond, Diane; Berg, Gina M.; Erickson, Wendy; Spruell, Dana; Deas, Shenequa; Sharpe, Paul; Atnip, Amy; Cornutt, David; Mains, Charles; Bar-Or, David",J Healthc Qual,https://doi.org/10.1097/jhq.0000000000000285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394838/,391

642683,Effects of lockdown on emergency room admissions for psychiatric evaluation: an observational study from 4 centres in Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare providers might have avoided droplet/aerosol-generating procedures, such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) due to the concern of themselves being infected. We hypothesized that this change of practice could have also occurred to other non-COVID-infected patients in the Emergency Department (ED). METHODS: A retrospective analytic study was conducted in the ED of Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, including adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress between 1 March and 30 April 2020 (the COVID period). A comparison group using the same inclusion criteria was retrieved from 1 March to 30 April 2019 (the pre-COVID period). The primary outcome was rate of NIV and HFNC use. The secondary outcomes were rate of intubation, failure of NIV and HFNC, complications, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 360 and 333 patients were included during the pre-COVID and COVID periods, respectively. After adjusting for baseline differences, patients in the COVID period were less likely to receive either NIV or HFNC than the pre-COVID period (adjusted OR 0.52 [95%CI 0.29–0.92]). Overall, intubation rate was similar between the two study periods. However, patients in respiratory distress with pulmonary edema had a relatively higher intubation rate in the COVID period. There were higher failure rates of NIV and HFNC, more infectious complications, and a higher rate of mortality in the pre-COVID period. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall usage of NIV and HFNC in emergency non-COVID patients decreased. Although not affecting the overall intubation rate, this change of practice could have affected some groups of patients. Therefore, treatment decisions based on a balance between the benefits to the patients and the safety of healthcare providers should be made.

643417,Variation in Strategies to Increase Critical Care Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-05,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an economically important swine pathogen. Since its discovery in the early 1990s, tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of PRRSV. Although modified live-attenuated vaccines (MLVs) and inactivated vaccines against PRRSV have been available for more than a decade, the disease remains difficult to control. The efficacies of these vaccines especially against heterologous strains remain questionable: the MLVs were generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains, and the outcomes of inactivated vaccines in the field are not very promising. With the development of PRRSV reverse genetics systems and the acquisition of new understanding on anti-PRRSV immunity, rational design of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines can now be explored. In this review, we discussed the recent advances in anti-PRRSV immunity and vaccinology, the recent progresses in PRRSV vaccine development particularly the reverse genetics system-based vaccine development, and provided a perspective on potential novel strategies and approaches that may be applicable to the development of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines.","Huang, Y.W.; Meng, X.J.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20655962/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002479; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002479; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.07.020,391

Accordingly, a cross-sectional survey of 2768 households was conducted using a postal questionnaire. The 2006 Sydney residential phone book was used as the sampling frame. Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all ≤6 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or ‘pet park enclosures’. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors. Most owners fed their cats a combination of commercial dry and canned food (38.1%), although fresh meat was popular also and either fed alone (1.6%) or in combination with dry food (14.4%), tinned food (1.6%) or canned and dry food (25.8%). A diet consisting of dry food alone was fed to cats in 13.4% of households. Ninety percent of cats had been vaccinated at least once, while 72.2% received a vaccination in the last 3 years. Older cats were less likely to have been vaccinated recently than younger cats. Only 5.8% of cats had never visited a veterinarian. For the 243 cats that had received veterinary attention, the average number of years since the last visit was 1.5.","Toribio, Jenny-Ann L.M.; Norris, Jacqueline M.; White, Joanna D.; Dhand, Nanveet K.; Hamilton, Samuel A.; Malik, Richard",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070524/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X08002052; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2008.06.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X08002052,391

AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and their associated factors as well as the effects and attitudes towards online education in Chinese high school students. METHODS: A total of 883 students were included. The first, second and third-year students of a high school in Lanzhou, Gansu province of China were invited to participate in this study. They were requested to involve their parents to complete the survey together. A detailed questionnaire of 65 questions was designed and divided into five sections. The survey was anonymously conducted via WeChat, a Chinese multipurpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app. RESULTS: Overall, 32.94% of students experienced post-traumatic stress disorder due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of students (60.82%) felt that online education was not (10.76%) or less effective (50.06%) in terms of gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. Correlation analysis revealed that the class level, residential background and whether living with parents were significantly linked with the effectiveness and satisfaction of the online education system. Of the final year students, 74.2% said that the COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected their preparation for the college entrance exam, and 68% of students felt that this outbreak increased psychological pressure for their college entrance examination preparation. In case of having COVID-19 symptoms during the exam, 50.7%, 13.3%, and 10.2% would notify the proctor, teacher and parents, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in high school students. Thus, our results call for urgent attention from both government and schools to implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects and the disturbance of education by COVID-19 on children.","Ma, Zhong-Ren; Ma, Wei-Hua; Idris, Sakinah; Pan, Qiu-Wei; Baloch, Zulqarnain",World J Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168970/; https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i6.232,391

A cross-sectional data of 7088 office workers from a web-based, self-administered survey conducted from 25 August 2020, to 30 September 2020, was used. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied. Compared to those who used a VDT for 4–9 h for work, office workers who used a VDT for ≥10 h for work had poor SRH (odds ratio (OR): 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 2.41) and severe psychological distress (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.52, 3.28).

Stratification analysis by age showed a significant association of VDT usage for work with poor SRH among 30–64-year-olds, while a U-shape association was found between VDT usage for work and psychological distress with the younger age group (15–29 years old). During the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the prolonged usage of VDT for work can deteriorate both general and psychological health, while moderate usage of VDT for work can reduce psychological distress.","Khin, Yu Par; Matsuyama, Yusuke; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Fujiwara, Takeo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501992/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179406,391

In Brazil, the fragile political situation, together with the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, could result in substantially different IFR estimates. Methods:We infer the IFR in Brazil in 2020 by combining three datasets. We compute the prevalence via the population-based seroprevalence survey EPICOVID19-BR. For the fatalities we obtain the absolute number using the public Painel Coronavírus dataset and the age-relative number using the public SIVEP-Gripe dataset. The time delay between the development of antibodies and subsequent fatality is estimated via the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We obtain the IFR for each survey stage and 27 federal states. We include the effect of fading IgG antibody levels by marginalizing over the test detectability time window. Results:We infer a country-wide average IFR (maximum posterior and 95% CI) of 1.03% (0.88–1.22%) and age-specific IFR: 0.032% (0.023–0.041%) [< 30 years], 0.22% (0.18–0.27%) [30–49 years], 1.2% (1.0–1.5%) [50–69 years], 3.0% (2.4–3.9%) [[Formula: see text] 70 years]. We find that the fatality ratio in the country increases significantly in the end of June, 2020, likely due to the increased strain in the health system. Conclusions: Our IFR estimate is based on data and does not rely on extrapolating models. This estimate sets a baseline value with which future medications and treatment protocols may be confronted.","Marra, Valerio; Quartin, Miguel",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221006482; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.08.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221006482?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34390858/,391

Applying their antipathogenic, antiproliferative, and immune stimulatory capacities, recombinant IFNs are frequently prescribed as drugs to treat different diseases. IFNs act by changing the gene expression profile of cells. Due to characteristics such as rapid gene induction and signaling, IFNs also represent prototypical model systems for various aspects of biomedical research (e.g., signal transduction). In regard to the signaling and activated promoters, IFNs can be subdivided into two groups. Here, alterations of the cellular proteome of human cells treated with IFNα and IFNγ were elucidated in a time-resolved manner by quantitative proteome analysis. The majority of protein regulations were strongly IFN type and time dependent. In addition to the expected upregulation of IFN-responsive proteins, an astonishing number of proteins became profoundly repressed especially by IFNγ. Thus, our comprehensive analysis revealed important insights into the human IFN-regulated proteome and its dynamics of protein induction and repression. Interestingly, the new class of IFN-repressed genes comprises known host factors for highly relevant pathogens such as HIV, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus.","Megger, Dominik A.; Philipp, Jos; Le-Trilling, Vu Thuy Khanh; Sitek, Barbara; Trilling, Mirko",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959263/,391

This study aimed to understand the experiences of trainees working in a large intensive care unit during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic from an educational and operational perspective in order to highlight what worked and what could be improved. DESIGN: A qualitative study using peer-to-peer semistructured interviews, developed using appreciative inquiry methodology, was conducted during July 2020. Responses were analysed using a thematic analysis technique. SETTING: A large, tertiary intensive care unit in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: All trainees in anaesthesia and intensive care working on the intensive care unit during the first surge were invited to participate. RESULTS: Forty interviews were conducted and four over-arching themes were identified. These were: feeling safe and supported; physical demands; the emotional burden of caring; and a sense of fulfilment, value and personal development. Positive aspects of the organisational response to the pandemic included communication, personal protective equipment supply, team working and well-being support. Suggestions for improvement focused on rest facilities, rota patterns and hierarchies, creating opportunities for reflection and ensuring continued educational and training opportunities despite operational demands. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees described opportunities for learning and fulfilment, as well as challenges, in working through a pandemic. Trainees described their needs and how well these were met during the pandemic. Ideas for improvement most frequently related to basic needs including safety and fatigue, but suggestions also related to supporting learning and development.

The aim of this study was to survey the current online undergraduate education status in dental medicine in mainland China during the critical stage of the COVID‐19 outbreak, as well to provide a better understanding of practicing this learning strategy for the improvement and development of dental education. METHODS: For the cross‐sectional survey, recruitment emails regarding to the implementation of online education were sent to 42 dental colleges and universities in mainland China between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Ninety‐seven percent of the respondents have opened online courses during COVID‐19 pandemic in China, 74% of which chose live broadcast as the major teaching way. As compared with theoretical courses, fewer specialized practical curriculums were set up online with a lower satisfaction from students in most dental schools. For the general evaluation of online learning from students of different dental schools, the “online learning content” received the highest support, while the “interaction between teachers and students” showed the lowest satisfaction. Most schools reported that the difficulty in assurance of students’ learning motivation was the main problem in online education.

METHODS: The COVID‐19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study in Australian EDs. This analysis presents data from eight sites across Victoria and Tasmania for July 2020 (during Australia's ‘second wave’). All adult patients who met criteria for ‘suspected COVID‐19’ and underwent testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Study outcomes included a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test result and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: In the period 1 to 31 July 2020, there were 30 378 presentations to the participating EDs and 2917 (9.6%; 95% CI: 9.3–9.9) underwent testing for SARS‐CoV‐2. Of these, 50 (2%) patients returned a positive result. Among positive cases, two (4%) received mechanical ventilation during their hospital admission compared to 45 (2%) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 negative patients (OR 1.7 [95% CI: 0.4–7.3], p = 0.47). Two (4%) SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients died in hospital compared to 46 (2%) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 negative patients (OR 1.7 [0.4–7.1] p = 0.49). Strong clinical predictors of a positive result included self‐reported fever, non‐smoking status, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and absence of a leucocytosis on first ED blood tests (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective multi‐site study from July 2020, a substantial proportion of ED patients required SARS‐CoV‐2 testing, isolation and enhanced infection prevention and control precautions.

While substantial research efforts have focused towards understand the mechanisms of viral infection and developing vaccines/ therapeutics, factors affecting the susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection and manifestation of Covid-19 remain less explored. Given that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is known to vary among ethnic populations, it is likely to affect the recognition of the virus, and in turn, the susceptibility to Covid-19. To understand this, we used bioinformatic tools to probe all SARS-CoV2 peptides which could elicit T-cell response in humans. We also tried to answer the intriguing question of whether these potential epitopes were equally immunogenic across ethnicities, by studying the distribution of HLA alleles among different populations and their share of cognate epitopes. We provide evidence that the newer mutations in SARS-CoV2 are unlikely to alter the T-cell mediated immunogenic responses among the studied ethnic populations. The work presented herein is expected to bolster our understanding of the pandemic, by providing insights into differential immunological response of ethnic populations to the virus as well as by gauging the possible effects of mutations in SARS-CoV2 on efficacy of potential epitope-based vaccines through evaluating ~40000 viral genomes.","Bose, T.; Pant, N.; Pinna, N.

654206,The Current Clinically Relevant Findings on COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-25,"The mortality of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is influenced by their state at admission. We aimed to model COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome state transitions from ICU admission to day 60 outcome and to evaluate possible prognostic factors. We analyzed a prospective French database that includes critically ill COVID-19 patients. A six-state multistate model was built and 17 transitions were analyzed either using a non-parametric approach or a Cox proportional hazard model. Corticosteroids and IL-antagonists (tocilizumab and anakinra) effects were evaluated using G-computation. We included 382 patients in the analysis: 243 patients were admitted to the ICU with non-invasive ventilation, 116 with invasive mechanical ventilation, and 23 with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The predicted 60-day mortality was 25.9% (95% CI: 21.8%–30.0%), 44.7% (95% CI: 48.8%–50.6%), and 59.2% (95% CI: 49.4%–69.0%) for a patient admitted in these three states, respectively. Corticosteroids decreased the risk of being invasively ventilated (hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39–0.90) and IL-antagonists increased the probability of being successfully extubated (HR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.02–3.17). Antiviral drugs did not impact any transition. In conclusion, we observed that the day-60 outcome in COVID-19 patients is highly dependent on the first ventilation state upon ICU admission. Moreover, we illustrated that corticosteroid and IL-antagonists may influence the intubation duration.","Ursino, Moreno; Dupuis, Claire; Buetti, Niccolò; de Montmollin, Etienne; Bouadma, Lila; Golgran-Toledano, Dany; Ruckly, Stéphane; Neuville, Mathilde; Cohen, Yves; Mourvillier, Bruno; Souweine, Bertrand; Gainnier, Marc; Laurent, Virginie; Terzi, Nicolas; Shiami, Shidasp; Reignier, Jean; Alberti, Corinne; Timsit, Jean-François",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33540733/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10030544,391

Widespread community transmission in the United States triggered a nationwide shutdown, raising major challenges for administration of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies, leading many centers to delay or cancel operations. We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations and clinical outcomes for HSCT and CAR-T cellular therapies at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute by reviewing administration and outcomes in 127 cell therapy patients treated during the initial COVID-19 surge: 62 adult allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), 38 autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT), and 27 CAR-T patients. Outcomes were compared with 66 allo-HSCT, 43 auto-HSCT, and 33 CAR-T patients treated prior to the pandemic. A second control cohort was evaluated for HSCT groups to reflect seasonal variation in infections. Although there were changes in donor selection and screening as well as cryopreservation patterns of donor products, no differences were observed across groups in 100-day overall survival, progression-free survival, rates of non–COVID-19 infections, including hospital length of stay, neutrophil engraftment, graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease in allo-HSCT patients, or cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in CAR-T patients. No HSCT patients contracted COVID-19 between days 0 and 100. One CAR-T patient contracted COVID-19 at day +51 and died of the disease. Altogether, our data indicate that cellular therapies can be safely administered throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate safeguards.","Maurer, Katie; Saucier, Anna; Kim, Haesook T.; Acharya, Utkarsh; Mo, Clifton C.; Porter, Julie; Albert, Cindy; Cutler, Corey; Antin, Joseph H.; Koreth, John; Gooptu, Mahasweta; Romee, Rizwan; Wu, Catherine J.; Soiffer, Robert J.; Nikiforow, Sarah; Jacobson, Caron; Ho, Vincent T.",Blood Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560397/; https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003883; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2473952921001129; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2473952921001129,391
654913,Sleep disturbances among medical workers during the outbreak of COVID-2019,2020-05-06,"Since the COVID‐19 pandemic, physicians concerned about the potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). To explore the relationship between ACEIs/ARBs and the risk of mortality and other clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 patients, the authors conducted a systemic review and meta‐analysis. An electronic search was performed from inception to November 12, 2020 in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials, TRIP, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and CBM database. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions tool. The primary outcome was in‐hospital all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included all‐cause mortality measured at 30‐day or longer term, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, readmission, and cardiac adverse events. A total of 28 studies with 73 465 patients was included. Twenty‐two studies with 19 871 patients reported the incidence of all‐cause mortality. Results showed no association between using ACEIs/ARBs and risk of mortality crude odds ratio （OR） of 1.02, 95% CI 0.71–1.46, p = .90, I (2 )= 88%, adjusted OR in 6260 patients of 0.96, 95% CI 0.77–1.18, p = .68, I (2 )= 0%. While six studies with 10 030 patients reported a lower risk of mortality in ACEIs/ARBs group hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53, 95% CI 0.34–0.84, p = .007, I (2 )= 68%. Similar association (for HR) was found in hypertension subgroup. There was no significant association for the secondary outcomes. Based on the available data, we concluded that ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with the risk of in‐hospital all‐cause mortality in COVID‐19 patients, but may be associated with a decreased risk of 30‐day all‐cause mortality. Patients with hypertension may benefit from using ACEIs/ARBs.","Jia, Na; Zhang, Guifang; Sun, Xuelin; Wang, Yan; Zhao, Sai; Chi, Wenjie; Dong, Sitong; Xia, Jun; Zeng, Ping; Liu, Deping",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.14329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320275/,391

METHODS: We generate indicators of the cumulative prevalence of mothers who have had an infant, under-five-year-old or any-age child ever die by using publicly available survey data in 89 countries and an indirect approach that combines formal kinship models and life-table methods in an additional 81 countries. We label these measures the maternal cumulative prevalence of infant mortality (mIM), under-five mortality (mU5M) and offspring mortality (mOM) and generate prevalence estimates for 20–44-year-old and 45–49-year-old mothers. RESULTS: In several Asian and European countries, the mIM and mU5M are below 10 per 1000 mothers yet exceed 200 per 1000 mothers in several Middle Eastern and African countries. Global inequality in mothers’ experience of child loss is enormous: mothers in high-mortality-burden African countries are more than 100 times more likely to have had a child die than mothers in low-mortality-burden Asian and European countries. In more than 20 African countries, the mOM exceeds 500 per 1000 mothers, meaning that it is typical for a surviving 45–49-year-old mother to be bereaved. DISCUSSION: The study reveals enormous global disparities in mothers’ experience of child loss and identifies a need for more research on the downstream mental and physical health risks associated with parental bereavement.","Smith-Greenaway, Emily; Alburez-Gutierrez, Diego; Trinitapoli, Jenny; Zagheni, Emilio",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824177/,391

Epitope mapping is essential to understand how an antibody works and to protect intellectual property. Given the millions of antibodies for which epitope information is lacking, there is a need for high-throughput epitope mapping. To address this, we developed a strategy, Antibody binding epitope Mapping (AbMap), by combining a phage displayed peptide library with next-generation sequencing. Using AbMap, profiles of the peptides bound by 202 antibodies were determined in a single test, and linear epitopes were identified for >50% of the antibodies. Using spike protein (S1 and S2)-enriched antibodies from the convalescent serum of one COVID-19 patient as the input, both linear and potentially conformational epitopes of spike protein specific antibodies were identified. We defined peptide-binding profile of an antibody as the binding capacity (BiC). Conceptually, the BiC could serve as a systematic and functional descriptor of any antibody. Requiring at least one order of magnitude less time and money to map linear epitopes than traditional technologies, AbMap allows for high-throughput epitope mapping and creates many possibilities.","Qi, Huan; Ma, Mingliang; Hu, Chuansheng; Xu, Zhao-wei; Wu, Fan-lin; Wang, Nan; Lai, Dan-yun; Li, Yang; Zhang, Hainan; Jiang, He-wei; Meng, Qing-feng; Guo, Shujuan; Kang, Yani; Zhao, Xiaodong; Li, Hua; Tao, Sheng-ce",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109704/; https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra120.002314,391

This is a retrospective observational study, with data from electronic medical records of inpatients, with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19, between March and September 2020, in a hospital from Juiz de Fora-MG, Brazil. Participants (n = 74) were separated into two groups by clinical evolution: those who remained in the ward and those who progressed to the ICU. Mann–Whitney U test was taken for continuous variables and the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Comparing the proposed groups, lower values of lymphocytes (p = <0.001) and increases in serum creatinine (p = 0.009), LDH (p = 0.057), troponin (p = 0.018), IL-6 (p = 0.053), complement C4 (p = 0.040), and CRP (p = 0.053) showed significant differences or statistical tendency for clinical deterioration.

657950,Paediatric Attendances and Acuity in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-08-06,"Despite the documented relationship between active-approaching leadership behaviors and workplace safety, few studies have addressed whether and when passive-avoidant leadership affects safety behavior. This study examined the relationship between two types of safety-specific passive-avoidant leadership, i.e., safety-specific leader reward omission (SLRO) and safety-specific leader punishment omission (SLPO), and safety compliance, as well as the moderating effects of an individual difference (safety moral belief) and an organizational difference (organizational size) in these relationships. These predictions were tested on a sample of 704 steel workers in China. The results showed that, although both SLRO and SLPO are negatively related to safety compliance, SLPO demonstrated a greater effect than SLRO. Moreover, we found that steel workers with high levels of safety moral belief were more resistant to the negative effects of SLRO and SLPO on safety compliance. Although steel workers in large enterprises were more resistant to the negative effects of SLPO than those in small enterprises, the SLRO-compliance relationship is not contingent upon organizational size. The current study enriched the safety leadership literature by demonstrating the detrimental and relative effects of two types of safety-specific passive-avoidant leadership on safety compliance and by identifying two boundary conditions that can buffer these relationships among steel workers.","Liu, Lin; Mei, Qiang; Jiang, Lixin; Wu, Jinnan; Liu, Suxia; Wang, Meng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33800153/,391
658290,Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and ischemic stroke is poorly defined. We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations. METHODS: Genetic association estimates for liability to Covid-19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained from large-scale consortia. Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid-19, defined as hospitalization with Covid-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical Covid-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was identified. RESULTS: There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke (r(g)=0.29, FDR p-value=4.65×10(−3)), body mass index (r(g)=0.21, FDR-p-value=6.26×10(−6)) and C-reactive protein (r(g)=0.20, FDR-p-value=1.35×10(−4)), but none of the other considered traits. In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical Covid-19 liability 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.06, p-value=0.03). Similar estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The host response predisposing to severe Covid-19 is likely to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors.","Zuber, Verena; Cameron, Alan; Myserlis, Evangelos P.; Bottolo, Leonardo; Fernandez-Cadenas, Israel; Burgess, Stephen; Anderson, Christopher D.; Dawson, Jesse; Gill, Dipender",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.21252441; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252441v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688662/,391
658687,Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19,2020-05-13,"Vulnerable adolescents may lose control over cigarette use within a day or two after smoking their first cigarette, as nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms may appear before actual daily smoking and usually occur at low levels of daily smoking. Moreover, smoking can cause illnesses and promote other types of substance abuse. Therefore, it was deemed essential to adapt the Young Adults’ Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale to develop and validate the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) in Lebanese adolescents and evaluate whether cumulative cigarette smoking is associated with nicotine dependence and symptoms of dependence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, during the partial sanitary lockdown imposed by the government to limit COVID-19, coinciding with the summer holidays for most Lebanese. The total sample consisted of 564 community-dwelling adolescents aged 13 to 18. A factor analysis was performed using a varimax rotation. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s sphericity test were appropriate. The factors retained corresponded to Eigenvalues > 1. Cronbach’s alpha value represented the internal consistency of the scale. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) was used to screen for dependence symptoms. All items of the YACD were extracted, except for items 4 (smoking to concentrate at work) and 18 (smoking as a habit), which yielded a three-factor solution (factor 1 = smoking patterns; factor 2 = positive and negative reinforcements; factor 3 = smoking cessation) with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 56.18%; KMO = 0.784; Bartlett’s sphericity test p < 0.001; α(Cronbach) = 0.875). The newly generated scale was termed Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) and consisted of 19 items. Higher ACDS scores (higher cigarette dependence) were significantly associated with higher HONC scores (higher symptoms of dependence) (rho = 0.647; p < 0.001). Having deceased (B = 8.54) or divorced (B = 4.26) parents and higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.29) were significantly associated with higher ACDS scores. Higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.05) was significantly associated with higher HONC scores due to cigarettes. This study could validate a new tool to evaluate nicotine dependence among Lebanese adolescents, the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS). This version adapted from the Young Adults’ Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale is reliable and valuable and correlates well with other scales, such as the HONC. However, further studies are necessary to improve this instrument, adding new questions useful for the diagnosis and evaluation of cigarette dependence.","Hallit, Souheil; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Khoury, Alessandro; Salameh, Pascale",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543440/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12667-6,391
658707,COVID-19 impact and response by Canadian pain clinics: A national survey of adult pain clinics,2020-09-10,"Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed phenomenon. Although its influence on cell’s response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the widest group of transmembrane proteins in animals, which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors –in full agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels– and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell interaction.","Carotenuto, Angelo R.; Lunghi, Laura; Piccolo, Valentina; Babaei, Mahnoush; Dayal, Kaushik; Pugno, Nicola; Zingales, Massimiliano; Deseri, Luca; Fraldi, Massimiliano",J Mech Phys Solids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461703/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2020.103974; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002250962030209X; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14287v1.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002250962030209X,391

Recent studies have shown that PA has various pharmacological activities, including anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects. METHODS: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining. RESULTS: The results showed that PA significantly inhibited different IAV strains multiplication in vitro, and may block IAV infection through inactivating virus particles directly and interfering with some early stages after virus adsorption. Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Intranasal administration of PA markedly improved mice survival and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, Patchouli alcohol has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-IAV agent in the future.","Yu, Yunjia; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Shuyao; Liu, Wei; Hao, Cui; Wang, Wei",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31870450/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1266-x,391

In order to avoid the loss of endangered species and ensure public health security, it is necessary to intervene in illegal wildlife trade and promote public awareness of the need for wildlife conservation. Anthropomorphism is a basic and common psychological process in humans that plays a crucial role in determining how a person interacts with other non-human agents. Previous research indicates that anthropomorphizing nature entities through metaphors could increase individual behavioral intention of wildlife conservation. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism by which anthropomorphism influences behavioral intention and whether social context affects the effect of anthropomorphism. This research investigated the impact of negative emotions associated with a pandemic situation on the effectiveness of anthropomorphic strategies for wildlife conservation across two experimental studies. Experiment 1 recruited 245 college students online and asked them to read a combination of texts and pictures as anthropomorphic materials. The results indicated that anthropomorphic materials could increase participants’ empathy and decrease their wildlife product consumption intention. Experiment 2 recruited 140 college students online and they were required to read the same materials as experiment 1 after watching a video related to epidemics. The results showed that the effect of wildlife anthropomorphization vanished if participants’ negative emotion was aroused by the video. The present research provides experimental evidence that anthropomorphic strategies would be useful for boosting public support for wildlife conservation. However, policymakers and conservation organizations must be careful about the negative effects of the pandemic context, as the negative emotions produced by it seems to weaken the effectiveness of anthropomorphic strategies.","Yue, Dan; Tong, Zepeng; Tian, Jianchi; Li, Yang; Zhang, Linxiu; Sun, Yan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808181/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073565,391

In this contribution, we have focused on their protective effect against chronic diseases rather than their antioxidant activities, which have been widely discussed in the literature. A large body of epidemiological studies has proven the bioactivities of phenolics in both standard compounds and natural extracts: namely, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities as well as reducing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease. Phenolics also display anti-analgesic, anti-allergic, and anti-Alzheimer’s properties. Thus, this review provides crucial information for better understanding the bioactivities of phenolics in foods and fills a gap in the existing collective and overall knowledge in the field.","Shahidi, Fereidoon; Yeo, JuDong",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19061573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799460/,391

Differences in immune gene expression between AGS individuals and non-allergic controls may illuminate molecular pathways and targets critical for AGS development. We performed immune expression profiling with RNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of seven controls, 15 AGS participants, and two participants sensitized but not allergic to alpha-gal using the NanoString nCounter PanCancer immune profiling panel, which includes 770 genes from 14 different cell types. The top differentially expressed genes (DEG) between AGS subjects and controls included transcription factors regulating immune gene expression, such as the NFκB pathway (NFKBIA, NFKB2, REL), antigen presentation molecules, type 2/allergic immune responses, itch, and allergic dermatitis. The differential expression of genes linked to T and B cell function was also identified, including transcription factor BCL-6, markers of antigen experience (CD44) and memory (CD27), chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CXCR6), and regulators of B-cell proliferation, cell cycle entry and immunoglobulin production (CD70). The PBMCs from AGS subjects also had increased TNF and IFN-gamma mRNA expression compared to controls. AGS is associated with a distinct gene expression profile in circulating PBMCs. DEGs related to antigen presentation, antigen-experienced T-cells, and type 2 immune responses may promote the development of alpha-gal specific IgE and the maintenance of AGS.","Iweala, Onyinye I.; Choudhary, Shailesh K.; Addison, Claire T.; Commins, Scott P.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22063185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804792/,391

Here, we study the impact of human mobility networks on the COVID-19 onset in 203 different countries. We use exponential random graph models to perform an analysis of the country-to-country global spread of COVID-19. We find that most countries had similar levels of virus spreading, with only a few acting as the main global transmitters. Our evidence suggests that migration and tourism inflows increase the probability of COVID-19 case importations while controlling for contiguity, continent co-location and sharing a language. Moreover, we find that air flights were the dominant mode of transportation while male and returning travellers were the main carriers. In conclusion, a mix of mobility and geography factors predicts the COVID-19 global transmission from one country to another.

This virus causes enteric disease in piglets that is characterized by enteritis and diarrhoea. In our present investigation, 189 diarrhoeic samples were collected between July 2016 and May 2017 from Tibetan pigs inhabiting in three different provinces surrounding the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau of China. We then applied the molecular‐based method of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT‐PCRs) to detect the presence of PDCoV in collected samples, and RT‐PCR indicated that the prevalence of PDCoV was 3.70% (7/189) in Tibetan pigs. Four of 7 PDCoV‐positive pigs were monoinfections of PDCoV, three samples were co‐infections of PDCoV with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and 52 (27.51%) samples were positive for PEDV. Four strains with different full‐length genomes were identified (CHN/GS/2016/1, CHN/GS/2016/2, CHN/GS‐/2017/1 and CHN/QH/2017/1), and their genomes were used to analyse the characteristics of PDCoV currently prevalent in Tibetan pigs. We found a 3‐nt insertion in the spike gene in four strains in Tibetan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences revealed that these strains shared ancestors with the strain CHN‐AH‐2004, which was found in pigs from the Anhui province of China mainland. However, PDCoV strains from Tibetan pigs formed different branches within the same cluster, implying continuous evolution in the field. Our present findings highlight the importance of epidemiologic surveillance to limit the spread of PDCoV in livestock at high altitudes in China.","Wang, M.; Wang, Y.; Baloch, A.

By analyzing the case scenario of school reopening across the twenty-one Italian regions, we did not find evidence that schools drove the second SARS-CoV-2 wave. Indeed, from September 12 to November 7 2020, SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was lower than that in the general population of all but two Italian regions. From August 28 to October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV-2 incidence measured across all age groups was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old individuals. Moreover, the increase in Covid19 reproduction number Rt was not associated with the different school opening dates. Reciprocally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other measures did not affect the rate of Rt decline. In schools, despite the high frequency of tests per week, secondary infections were <1%, and clusters in a representative November week infrequent. Thus, our prospective analysis does not support a role for school reopening as a driver of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Italy.","Gandini, S.; Rainisio, M.; Iannuzzo, M.

METHODOLOGY: Review of the anti‐infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP‐I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo‐pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). RESULTS: Antiseptics with broad‐spectrum anti‐infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence‐base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin‐resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large‐scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control.","Kanagalingam, J.; Feliciano, R.; Hah, J.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained. RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P < 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P < 0.001) and invasive MV (P < 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P < 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3% vs. 1.6%; P < 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51–3.90; P < 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06–5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death.

666625,Patient-Centered Care for People with Depression and Anxiety: An Integrative Review Protocol,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Psychological safety is the concept by which individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves in a work environment, without fear of embarrassment or criticism from others. Psychological safety in healthcare is associated with improved patient safety outcomes, enhanced physician engagement and fostering a creative learning environment. Therefore, it is important to establish the key levers which can act as facilitators or barriers to establishing psychological safety. Existing literature on psychological safety in healthcare teams has focused on secondary care, primarily from an individual profession perspective. In light of the increased focus on multidisciplinary work in primary care and the need for team-based studies, given that psychological safety is a team-based construct, this study sought to investigate the facilitators and barriers to psychological safety in primary care multidisciplinary teams. METHODS: A mono-method qualitative research design was chosen for this study. Healthcare professionals from four primary care teams (n = 20) were recruited using snowball sampling. Data collection was through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to generate findings. RESULTS: Three meta themes surfaced: shared beliefs, facilitators and barriers to psychological safety. The shared beliefs offered insights into the teams’ background functioning, providing important context to the facilitators and barriers of psychological safety specific to each team. Four barriers to psychological safety were identified: hierarchy, perceived lack of knowledge, personality and authoritarian leadership. Eight facilitators surfaced: leader and leader inclusiveness, open culture, vocal personality, support in silos, boundary spanner, chairing meetings, strong interpersonal relationships and small groups. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises that factors influencing psychological safety can be individualistic, team-based or organisational. Although previous literature has largely focused on the role of leaders in promoting psychological safety, safe environments can be created by all team members. Members can facilitate psychological safety in instances where positive leadership behaviours are lacking - for example, strengthening interpersonal relationships, finding support in silos or rotating the chairperson in team meetings. It is anticipated that these findings will encourage practices to reflect on their team dynamics and adopt strategies to ensure every member’s voice is heard.

667861,Supporting Patient-Clinician Interaction in Chronic HIV Care: Design and Development of a Patient-Reported Outcomes Software Application,2021-07-30,"Abstract Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells–Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose‐response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells–Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose‐response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells–Riley and the dose‐response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells–Riley model and dose‐response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.","Sze To, G. N.; Chao, C. Y.

The WHO declared it as a pandemic in March 2020. The pandemic severely affected public health and the global economy. Many studies conducted on the coronavirus have helped us to elucidate its pathogenicity and pathophysiology. However, it is important to study the behavior of the pathogen in the environment to develop effective control measures. While studying the persistence and transmission of viruses in drinking water and wastewater systems, a low concentration of coronavirus and its nucleic acids have been detected in municipal wastewaters. This could be due to their high susceptibilities to degradation in aqueous environments. Epidemiological study on coronaviruses in wastewater will serve two purposes, i.e., in early detection of outbreak and in identifying asymptomatic carriers. In such cases, the epidemiological study will help in early detection of the presence of the virus in the community. Secondly, it will help in knowing if there are asymptomatic carriers, as such people do not show any signs of symptoms but shed the viruses in feces. The present review focuses on the epidemiological surveillance of wastewater for coronaviruses, as in recent years these are increasingly causing global pandemics. In this review we have discussed, the four pertinent areas of coronavirus study: (1) occurrence of coronavirus in wastewater, (2) wastewater based epidemiological surveillance of coronaviruses, (3) epidemiological surveillance tools used for detection of coronaviruses in sewage, and (4) persistence and sustainability of coronaviruses in wastewater.

It has occurred in three huge pandemics since the 6th century with millions of deaths and numerous smaller epidemics and sporadic cases. Referring to specific clinical symptoms of pulmonary plague the disease became known as the Black Death. This pandemic probably originated in central Asia and began spreading westward along major trade routes. Upon the arrival in the eastern Mediterranean the disease quickly spread especially by sea traffic to Italy, Greece and France and later throughout Europe by land. Until the 18th century many European cities were frequently affected by other great plague epidemics. The worldwide spread of the third pandemic began when the plague reached Hong Kong and Canton in the year 1894. The gram-negative coccobacillus now designated as Yersinia pestis has been discovered as the causative agent of plague in this Hong Kong outbreak. In the following years the role of rats and fleas and their detailed role in the transmission of plague has been discovered and experimentally verified. Today the plague is still endemic in many countries of the world.","Zietz, Björn P.; Dunkelberg, Hartmut",International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463904702771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15031959/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463904702771,391

Between the onset of the pandemic and January 13, 2021, over 92 million people have tested positive for the virus and over 1.9 million people have died globally. Virtually every country in the world has been impacted by this virus. Beginning in March 2020, many U.S. state governments enforced a “quarantine” to respond to the growing health crisis. Citizens were required to remain at home; schools, restaurants, and non-essential businesses were forced to close, and large gatherings were prohibited. Americans' lives were transformed in a span of days as daily routines were interrupted and people were shuttered indoors. Mounting fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions across the globe. Most (53%) U.S. adults reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had a negative impact on their mental health, including inducing or exacerbating use of alcohol, drugs, gambling and overeating as coping mechanisms. In this paper, we will examine substance use and addictive behaviors that have been used to manage the stress and uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

673706,Concomitant allergic contact dermatitis and aquagenic urticaria caused by personal protective equipment in a healthcare worker during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a great public health challenge globally. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with ARIs attending at different hospital settings is fully undetermined. METHODS: Laboratory-based surveillance for ARIs was conducted at inpatient and outpatient settings of 11 hospitals in North China. The first 2–5 patients with ARIs were recruited in each hospital weekly from 2012 through 2015. The presence of respiratory viruses was screened by PCR assays. The prevalence of respiratory viruses was determined and compared between patients at different hospital settings. RESULTS: A total of 3487 hospitalized cases and 6437 outpatients/Emergency Department (ED) patients were enrolled. The most commonly detected viruses in the hospitalized cases were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 33.3%) in children less than two years old, adenoviruses (13.0%) in patients 15–34 years old, and influenza viruses (IFVs, 9.6%) in patients ≥65 years. IFVs were the most common virus in outpatient/ED patients across all age groups (22.7%). After controlling for the confounders caused by other viruses and covariates, adenoviruses (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.97, 99% confidence interval [99% CI]: 2.19–7.20) and RSV (aOR: 2.04, 99% CI: 1.34–3.11) were independently associated with increased hospitalization in children, as well as adenoviruses in adults (aOR: 2.14, 99% CI: 1.19–3.85). Additionally, co-infection of RSV with IFVs was associated with increased hospitalization in children (aOR: 12.20, 99% CI: 2.65–56.18). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of ARIs was associated with respiratory viruses in North China. RSV, adenoviruses, and co-infection of RSV and IFVs were more frequent in hospitalized children (or adenoviruses in adults), which might predict the severity of ARIs. Attending clinicians should be more vigilant of these infections.

673834,Integrating hospital and community care: using a community virtual ward model to deliver combined specialist and generalist care to patients with severe chronic respiratory disease in their homes,2021-05-06,"Abstract (300 words) Objectives During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. nursing homes (NHs) have been under pressure to maintain staff levels with limited access to personal protection equipment (PPE). This study examines the prevalence and factors associated with shortages of NH staff during COVID-19 pandemic. Design We obtained self-reported information on staff shortages, resident and staff exposure to COVID-19, and PPE availability from a survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in May 2020. Multivariate logistic regressions of staff shortages with state fixed-effects were conducted to examine the effect of COVID-19 factors in NHs. Setting and participants 11,920 free-standing NHs. Measures The dependent variables were self-reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other ancillary staff. We controlled for NH characteristics from the most recent Nursing Home Compare and Certification And Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, market characteristics from Area Health Resources File, and state Medicaid reimbursement calculated from Truven data. Results Of the 11,920 NHs, 15.9%, 18.4%, 2.5%, and 9.8% reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other staff, respectively. Georgia and Minnesota reported the highest rates of shortages in licensed nurse and nurse aides (both > 25%). Multivariate regressions suggest that shortages in licensed nurses and nurse aides were more likely in NHs having any resident with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.44, 1.60, respectively) and any staff with COVID-19 (AOR = 1.37, 1.34, respectively). Having one-week supply of PPE was associated with lower probability of staff shortages. NHs with a higher proportion of Medicare residents were less likely to experience shortages. Conclusions /Implications: Abundant staff shortages were reported by NHs and were mainly driven by COVID-19 factors. In the absence of appropriate staff, NHs may be unable to fulfill the requirement of infection control even under the risk of increased monetary penalties.","Xu, Huiwen; Intrator, Orna; Bowblis, John R.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981663/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020306915; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.08.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020306915?v=s5,391

675337,Is the risk of COVID-19 contraction increased in patients with epilepsy?,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke is a common clinical feature of neurosyphilis, but its accompanying cognitive decline is often overlooked. The mechanisms of cognitive impairment in neurosyphilis presenting with ischemic stroke are not fully understood. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) was recently shown to predict post‐stroke cognitive decline. Therefore, this study aims to validate the correlation between CSVD and cognitive impairment in neurosyphilis presenting with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We enrolled 179 neurosyphilis patients diagnosed as acute ischemic stroke and performed a 12‐month cognitive assessment follow‐up. CSVD burden was evaluated by neuroimaging markers, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and perivascular spaces (PVS). We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association between cognitive decline and total CSVD burden score in neurosyphilis patients. RESULTS: The neurosyphilis participants had a significantly higher total CSVD score and lower cognitive function score compared with the syphilis‐uninfected patients. Acute cognitive impairment was associated with total CSVD score, extensive microbleeds, and Grade 3 WMHs. After 12‐month follow‐up, the poor prognosis of post‐stroke cognitive impairment was associated with a higher burden of CSVD and extensive microbleeds. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral small vessel disease loads in neurosyphilis patients presenting with ischemic stroke are independently associated with acute cognitive impairment and have a prospective value for post‐stroke cognitive outcomes.","Xiang, Lei; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Biao; Zhang, Chao; Hou, Shuping; Yue, Wei",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998172/; https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2187,391

678253,CHINA'S OLDEST CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS,2020-04-08,"COVID‐19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID‐19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra‐pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS‐CoV‐2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert healthcare professionals early in the course of COVID‐19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID‐19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS‐CoV‐2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID‐19, the host‐virus interaction, possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 to invade the central nervous system (CNS), other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID‐19, and a collective call to action.

679638,Understanding myocardial infarction trends during the early COVID‐19 pandemic: an infodemiology study,2021-07-02,"Background & objectives : Infection fatality ratio (IFR) is considered a more robust and reliable indicator than case fatality ratio for severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age- and sex-stratified IFRs are crucial to guide public health response. Infections estimated through representative community-based serosurveys would gauge more accurate IFRs than through modelling studies. We describe age- and sex-stratified IFR for COVID-19 estimated through serosurveys conducted in Chennai, India. Methods : Two community-based serosurveys were conducted among individuals aged ≥10 yr during July and October 2020 in 51 of the 200 wards spread across 15 zones of Chennai. Total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections were estimated by multiplying the total population of the city aged ≥10 yr with the weighted seroprevalence and IFR was calculated by dividing the number of deaths with the estimated number of infections. Results : IFR was 17.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.1-21.6] and 16.6 (95% CI: 13.8-20.2) deaths/10,000 infections during July and October 2020, respectively. Individuals aged 10-19 years had the lowest IFR [first serosurvey (R1): 0.2/10,000, 95% CI: 0.2-0.3 and second serosurvey (R2): 0.2/10,000, 95% CI: 0.1-0.2], and it increased with age and was highest among individuals aged above 60 yr (R1: 140.0/10,000, 95% CI: 107.0-183.8 and R2: 111.2/10,000, 95% CI: 89.2-142.0). Interpretation & conclusions : Our findings suggested that the IFR increased with age and was high among the elderly. Therefore, elderly population need to be prioritized for public health interventions including vaccination, frequent testing in long-term care facilities and old age homes, close clinical monitoring of the infected and promoting strict adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley Vivian; Kumar, Muthusamy Santhosh; Velusamy, Saravanakumar; Kumar, C P Girish; Selvaraju, Sriram; Sabarinathan, R; Jagadeesan, M; Hemalatha, M S; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Murhekar, Manoj Vasant",The Indian journal of medical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528527/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_365_21,391

Little information is known on the epidemiology and outcome of the disease in a localized community within Iraq. We carried out an audit of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Kirkuk General Hospital. Data from the 20th of June to the 31st of July, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Suspected COVID-19 cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data on clinical symptoms, age, and treatment protocols were analyzed concerning the outcome. Our study included a total of 200 individual confirmed COVID-19 patients. The majority of cases 55% (n = 110) displayed severe symptoms, while 32.5% (65 cases) and 12.5% (25 cases) of patients displayed moderate to mild symptoms, respectively. The rate of death in the referred patients was 5%. Most patients admitted to the hospital for treatment recovered and were discharged from the hospital within 5 to 30 days post-diagnosis. Statistical analysis revealed that patients treated with oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin in combination with vitamins C and D have shorter hospital stay compared to patients receiving the same therapeutic protocol in combination with steroids. Moreover, a higher mortality rate (4.5%) was observed in patients treated with oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, ceftriaxone, and steroids.

The maximum cumulative clinician-reported grade ≥ 2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Scale v. 5.0) acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were 11.8% (6/51) and 2.0% (1/51), respectively, while grade ≥ 2 subacute GU and GI toxicities were 2.3% (1/43) each. Patient-reported urinary, bowel, and hormonal domain summary scores were reduced at 1 month, then gradually returned to baseline levels, with the exception of the sexual domain. The finding of low toxicity supports the accumulation of clinical evidence for 1.5T MRgSBRT in localized PC. ABSTRACT: Background: Magnetic resonance-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (MRgSBRT) offers the potential for achieving better prostate cancer (PC) treatment outcomes. This study reports the preliminary clinical results of 1.5T MRgSBRT in localized PC, based on both clinician-reported outcome measurement (CROM) and patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM). Methods: Fifty-one consecutive localized PC patients were prospectively enrolled with a median follow-up of 199 days. MRgSBRT was delivered in five fractions of 7.25–8 Gy with daily online adaptation. Clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Scale v. 5.0 were assessed. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Questionnaire was collected at baseline, 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter. Serial prostate-specific antigen measurements were longitudinally recorded. Results: The maximum cumulative clinician-reported grade ≥ 2 acute GU and GI toxicities were 11.8% (6/51) and 2.0% (1/51), respectively, while grade ≥ 2 subacute GU and GI toxicities were 2.3% (1/43) each. Patient-reported urinary, bowel, and hormonal domain summary scores were reduced at 1 month, then gradually returned to baseline levels, with the exception of the sexual domain. Domain-specific subscale scores showed similar longitudinal changes. All patients had early post-MRgSBRT biochemical responses. Conclusions: The finding of low toxicity supports the accumulation of clinical evidence for 1.5T MRgSBRT in localized PC.","Poon, Darren M.

In the review, we have focused on some examples that may provide new avenues for treatment or altering the course of infections, i.e., antibodies to fusogenic virus membrane proteins, drugs that interfere with lipid metabolism, calcium channel blockers, immunoregulatory molecules, and, and inhibitors of excitotoxic amino acids. Owing to their selectivity in attack on regions of nervous tissue, governed by viral factors and by routes of invasion, viral receptors or metabolic machineries of infected cells, certain viral infections show similarities in distribution of their resulting lesions in the nervous system to that of the common human neurodegenerative diseases (namely, motor neurons disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease). However, it should be emphasized that no infectious agent has as yet provided a complete animal model for any of these diseases, nor has any infectious agent been linked to them from observations on clinical or postomortem materials.","Kristensson, Krister",Mol Chem Neuropathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1520406/,391

It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial. Objective: Through systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We used the following search string: ""COVID-19"" [Mesh], ""remdesivir"" [Mesh], ""randomized controlled trial"" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0. Results: Our systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p= 0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir.

682528,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on conducting emergency medicine clinical research,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Research on bird-window collision mitigation is needed to prevent up to a billion bird fatalities yearly in the U.S. At the University of Utah campus (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA), past research documented collisions, especially for Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) drawn to fruiting ornamental pears in winter. Mirrored windows, which have a metallic coating that turns window exteriors into mirrors, had frequent collisions, which were mitigated when Feather Friendly®bird deterrent markers were applied. Bird-friendly windows–ORNILUX®ultraviolet (UV) and fritted windows–also reduced collisions when data were collected across fall and winter. Extending this prior research, we evaluated additional mitigation and tested the replicability of effects for pear trees, mirrored windows, and bird-friendly windows across two years. METHODS: Using published data from eight buildings monitored for collisions in year 1 (Fall and Winter, 2019–2020), we added another year of monitoring, Fall and Winter, 2020–2021. Between years, Feather Friendly®mitigation markers were added to collision-prone areas of two buildings, including both mirrored and transparent windows. RESULTS: The two buildings that received new Feather Friendly®mitigation had significantly fewer collisions post-mitigation. Control areas also had nonsignificant decline in collisions. The interaction of area (mitigation vs. control) by time (year 1 vs. 2) was significant, based on generalized estimating equations (GEE). The total yearly collisions across all eight buildings declined from 39 to 23. A second GEE analysis of all 8 buildings showed that mirrored windows, pear trees, and bird-friendly windows were each significant when analyzed separately. The best-fit model showed more collisions for mirrored windows and fewer collisions for bird-friendly windows. We found pear tree proximity to be related to more collisions in winter than fall. In addition, pear trees showed reduced collisions from year 1 to 2, consistent with new mitigation for two of three buildings near pear trees. DISCUSSION: Feather Friendly(®) markers can mitigate collisions with transparent windows, not only mirrored windows, compared to unmitigated areas over 2 years. Results also underscore the dangers of pear tree proximity and mirrored windows and the efficacy of bird-friendly windows. Thus, bird collisions can be prevented by window mitigation, permanent bird-friendly windows, and landscape designs that avoid creating ecological traps.","Brown, Barbara B.; Santos, Sabrina; Ocampo-Peñuela, Natalia",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395093/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11867,391

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The mortality rate, hospital disorders and incalculable economic and social damages, besides the unproven efficacy of the treatments evaluated against COVID-19, raised the need for immediate control of this disease. Therefore, the current study employed in silico tools to rationally identify new possible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. That is an enzyme conserved among the coronavirus species; hence, the identification of an Mpro inhibitor is to make it a broad-spectrum drug. Molecular docking studies described the binding sites and the interaction energies of 74 Mpro-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A structural similarity screening was carried out in order to identify possible Mpro ligands that show additional pharmacological properties against COVID-19. We identified 59 hit compounds and among them, melatonin stood out due to its prominent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; it can reduce oxidative stress, defence cell mobility and efficiently combat the cytokine storm and sepsis. In addition, melatonin is an inhibitor of calmodulin, an essential intracellular component to maintain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface. Interestingly, one of the most promising hits in our docking study was melatonin. It revealed better interaction energy with Mpro compared to ligands in complexes from PDB. Consequently, melatonin can have response potential in early stages for its possible effects on ACE-2 and Mpro, although it is also promising in more severe stages of the disease for its action against hyper-inflammation. These results definitely do not confirm antiviral activity, but can rather be used as a basis for further preclinical and clinical trials.","Feitosa, Eduardo L; Júnior, Francisco Tiago Dos S S; Nery Neto, José Arimatéa De O; Matos, Luis F L; Moura, Matheus H De S; Rosales, Thiele Osvaldt; De Freitas, Guilherme Barroso L",Int J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.48053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922174/,391

While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. We now report that patients with COVID-19 (n=96) have markedly elevated levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=52 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (7805 +/- 7585, n=23) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3123 +/- 2990, p=0.0059). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, strongly implicating neutrophils as active perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","Shi, H.; Zuo, Y.; Yalavarthi, S.; Gockman, K.; Zuo, M.; Madison, J.

Emergence of new serotypes and variant forms of viruses as in the case of blue tongue virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus adds additional level of complexity. The increased incidence of emerging and reemerging viral diseases could be attributed to several factors including deforestation and surge in direct contact of livestock and humans with wild animals and birds.

The upper respiratory tract is an initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, for many individuals, remains the primary site of virus replication. An ideal COVID-19 vaccine should reduce upper respiratory tract virus replication and block transmission as well as protect against severe disease. Here, we optimized a vaccine candidate, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (CVXGA1), and then demonstrated that a single-dose intranasal immunization with CVXGA1 protects against lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice, a severe disease model. CVXGA1 immunization also prevented virus infection of ferrets and blocked contact transmission. This mucosal vaccine strategy inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract, thus preventing disease progression to the lower respiratory tract. A PIV5-based mucosal vaccine provides a strategy to induce protective innate and cellular immune responses and reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in populations.","An, Dong; Li, Kun; Rowe, Dawne K; Diaz, Maria Cristina Huertas; Griffin, Emily F; Beavis, Ashley C; Johnson, Scott K; Padykula, Ian; Jones, Cheryl A; Briggs, Kelsey; Li, Geng; Lin, Yuan; Huang, Jiachen; Mousa, Jarrod; Brindley, Melinda; Sakamoto, Kaori; Meyerholz, David K; McCray, Paul B; Tompkins, S Mark; He, Biao",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abi5246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34215591/,391

Closely monitoring public engagement and perception of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs. Objective: To measure the public behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its daily life effects during the recent 5 months of the pandemic. Methods: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19 related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged, and sensitivity and specificity were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the US. Results: The final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the US. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the US beginning in October. Additionally, counter to reports from March and April, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (20%). Conclusions: There was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the US, even as COVID-19 cases in the US have increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic.

As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, so does its economic burden as a result of both direct and indirect costs. Likewise, since 2019, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic with rising infection rates carrying significant economic costs associated with treatment of the disease and the reduction in economic activity due to government regulations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on obesity, not only creating an increasingly obesogenic environment but also reducing access to bariatric care and treatment of obesity-related diseases. In this article, we form a compelling argument for the resumption of bariatric services as soon as it is safe to do so because bariatric surgery brings significant additional medical and economic benefits. Medically, obesity is a risk factor for increased severity of COVID-19 infections, and therefore, treatment of obesity should be a priority in the current pandemic. Additionally, bariatric surgery has been shown to be a cost-saving procedure in the long term and thus has significant economic benefit in reducing the costs of obesity in the future as we recover from the economic collapse following the global pandemic.","Liu, Daniel; Cheng, Qiuye; Suh, Hye Rim; Magdy, Mark; Loi, Ken",Surg Obes Relat Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2021.07.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550728921003580; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728921003580?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417118/,391

Since the pandemic started, scholars have been researching and publishing their studies on the various supply-chain-related issues raised by COVID-19. However, while the number of articles on this subject has been steadily increasing, due to the absence of any systematic literature reviews, it remains unclear what aspects of this disruption have already been studied and what aspects still need to be investigated. The present study systematically reviews existing research on the COVID-19 pandemic in supply chain disciplines. Through a rigorous and systematic search, we identify 74 relevant articles published on or before 28 September 2020. The synthesis of the findings reveals that four broad themes recur in the published work: namely, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resilience strategies for managing impacts and recovery, the role of technology in implementing resilience strategies, and supply chain sustainability in the light of the pandemic. Alongside the synthesis of the findings, this study describes the methodologies, context, and theories used in each piece of research. Our analysis reveals that there is a lack of empirically designed and theoretically grounded studies in this area; hence, the generalizability of the findings, thus far, is limited. Moreover, the analysis reveals that most studies have focused on supply chains for high-demand essential goods and healthcare products, while low-demand items and SMEs have been largely ignored. We also review the literature on prior epidemic outbreaks and other disruptions in supply chain disciplines.

Available data indicate that the oral cavity may be an active site of infection and an important reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. Considering that the oral surfaces are colonized by a diverse microbial community, it is likely that viruses have interactions with the host microbiota. Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 may have alterations in the oral and gut microbiota, while oral species have been found in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, interactions between the oral, lung, and gut microbiomes appear to occur dynamically whereby a dysbiotic oral microbial community could influence respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can alter the local homeostasis of the resident microbiota, actively cause dysbiosis, or influence cross-body sites interactions. Here, we provide a conceptual framework on the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 oral infection on the local and distant microbiomes across the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (‘oral-tract axes’), which remains largely unexplored. Studies in this area could further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and the course of infection as well as the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 across different sites in the human host.","Xiang, Zhenting; Koo, Hyun; Chen, Qianming; Zhou, Xuedong; Liu, Yuan; Simon-Soro, Aurea",Journal of oral microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/20002297.2020.1853451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312449/,391
688673,Music and dance in respiratory disease management in Uganda: a qualitative study of patient and healthcare professional perspectives,2021-09-23,"BACKGROUND: The endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in many cellular processes, which includes protein synthesis, folding and post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins. It is also the site for quality control of misfolded proteins and entry point of extracellular proteins to the secretory pathway. Hence at any given point of time, endoplasmic reticulum contains two different cohorts of proteins, (i) proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-specific function, which reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, called as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and (ii) proteins which are in process of moving to the extracellular space. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins must somehow be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins, which pass through the endoplasmic reticulum on their way out of the cell. Approximately only 50% of the proteins used in this study as training data had endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which shows that these signals are not essentially present in all endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. This also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. METHODS: This is a support vector machine based method, where we had used different forms of protein features as inputs for support vector machine to develop the prediction models. During training leave-one-out approach of cross-validation was used. Maximum performance was obtained with a combination of amino acid compositions of different part of proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we have reported a novel support vector machine based method for predicting endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, named as ERPred. During training we achieved a maximum accuracy of 81.42% with leave-one-out approach of cross-validation. When evaluated on independent dataset, ERPred did prediction with sensitivity of 72.31% and specificity of 83.69%. We have also annotated six different proteomes to predict the candidate endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins in them. A webserver, ERPred, was developed to make the method available to the scientific community, which can be accessed at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/erpred/index.html. DISCUSSION: We found that out of 124 proteins of the training dataset, only 66 proteins had endoplasmic reticulum retention signals, which shows that these signals are not an absolute necessity for endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins to remain inside the endoplasmic reticulum. This observation also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Our proposed predictor, ERPred, is a signal independent tool. It is tuned for the prediction of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, even if the query protein does not contain specific ER-retention signal.","Kumar, Ravindra; Kumari, Bandana; Kumar, Manish",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28890846/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3561,391

While the majority of those exposed have minor symptoms and recover with little morbidity, an estimated 500,000 people succumb to IAV-related complications each year worldwide. In these severe cases, an exaggerated inflammatory response, known as “cytokine storm”, occurs which results in damage to the respiratory epithelial barrier and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from retrospective human studies as well as experimental animal models of influenza virus infection highlight the fine line between an excessive and an inadequate immune response, where the host response must balance viral clearance with exuberant inflammation. Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation, including corticosteroids and statins, have not been successful in improving outcomes during influenza virus infection. We have reported that the amplitude of the inflammatory response is regulated by Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) activity and that dampening of LUBAC activity is protective during severe influenza virus infection. Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity may be crucial to improve outcomes during severe influenza virus infection, as it functions as a molecular rheostat of the host response. Here we review the evidence for modulating inflammation to ameliorate influenza virus infection-induced lung injury, data on current anti-inflammatory strategies, and potential new avenues to target viral inflammation and improve outcomes.","Brazee, Patricia L.; Sznajder, Jacob I.",Arch Bronconeumol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289620301381?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405132/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289620301381,391
