5270,Neue Grippe (H1N1): Phantom oder intensivmedizinischer Super-GAU? – Ein Blick auf die österreichische Realität,2010,"Pneumoviruses have been identified as causative agents in several respiratory disease outbreaks in habituated wild great apes. Based on phylogenetic evidence, transmission from humans is likely. However, the pathogens have never been detected in the local human population prior to or at the same time as an outbreak. Here, we report the first simultaneous detection of a human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and in the local human population at a field program in the Central African Republic. A total of 15 gorilla and 15 human fecal samples and 80 human throat swabs were tested for HRSV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory viruses. We were able to obtain identical sequences for HRSV A from four gorillas and four humans. In contrast, we did not detect HRSV or any other classic human respiratory virus in gorilla fecal samples in two other outbreaks in the same field program. Enterovirus sequences were detected but the implication of these viruses in the etiology of these outbreaks remains speculative. Our findings of HRSV in wild but human-habituated gorillas underline, once again, the risk of interspecies transmission from humans to endangered great apes.","Grützmacher, Kim S.; Köndgen, Sophie; Keil, Verena; Todd, Angelique; Feistner, Anna; Herbinger, Ilka; Petrzelkova, Klara; Fuh, Terrence; Leendertz, Siv Aina; Calvignac-Spencer, Sébastien; Leendertz, Fabian H.",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088376/,477
6951,Zur Medienberichterstattung über den in Österreich verfügbaren Impfstoff gegen pandemische Influenza A/H1N1,2009,"Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family play pleiotropic roles in cellular and metabolic homeostasis. During evolution, the ancestor FGF expands into multiple members by acquiring divergent structural elements that enable functional divergence and specification. Heparan sulfate-binding FGFs, which play critical roles in embryonic development and adult tissue remodeling homeostasis, adapt to an autocrine/paracrine mode of action to promote cell proliferation and population growth. By contrast, FGF19, 21, and 23 coevolve through losing binding affinity for extracellular matrix heparan sulfate while acquiring affinity for transmembrane α-Klotho (KL) or β-KL as a coreceptor, thereby adapting to an endocrine mode of action to drive interorgan crosstalk that regulates a broad spectrum of metabolic homeostasis. FGF19 metabolic axis from the ileum to liver negatively controls diurnal bile acid biosynthesis. FGF21 metabolic axes play multifaceted roles in controlling the homeostasis of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. FGF23 axes from the bone to kidney and parathyroid regulate metabolic homeostasis of phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone that are important for bone health and systemic mineral balance. The significant divergence in structural elements and multiple functional specifications of FGF19, 21, and 23 in cellular and organismal metabolism instead of cell proliferation and growth sufficiently necessitate a new unified and specific term for these three endocrine FGFs. Thus, the term “FGF Metabolic Axis,” which distinguishes the unique pathways and functions of endocrine FGFs from other autocrine/paracrine mitogenic FGFs, is coined.","Li, Xiaokun",Front Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102389/,477

In this paper the problem of allocating and scheduling limited multiple, identical or non-identical, resources employed in parallel, when there are several infected areas, is considered. A heuristic algorithm, based on Shih’s (1974) and Pappis and Rachaniotis’ (2010) algorithms, is proposed as the solution methodology. A numerical example implementing the proposed methodology in the context of a specific disease outbreak, namely influenza, is presented.

10827,Modern diagnostics in emergency medicine,2020-04-30,"Radioactively labeled mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) 60-70S RNA, obtained from virions grown In both murine and feline cells, was employed In molecular hybridization experiments to detect MuMTV-related sequences In the DNA’s of rats (Rattus norveglcus). With the use of relaxed conditions of hybridization and assay for RNA-DNA duplexes, all strains of laboratory rats and feral rats examined were shown to possess endogenous MuMTV-related DNA sequences In the low repetitive range. These sequences were related to approximately 20% of the MuMTV genome and exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) approximately 5° C lower than MuMTV-specific proviral sequences In murine (Mus musculus) DNA’s. Certain colonies of the F344 strain of rat (Fischer) contained animals whose DNA’s possessed additional MuMTV-related sequences. These sequences were related to the non-germ-line-transmitted, tumorassociated (TA) sequences of the highly oncogenic MuMTV (C3H). They were found In the DNA of some F344 rats and a cloned established F344 rat embryo cell line at a frequency of approximately one copy per haploid genome and exhibited a Tm 9° C lower than that of hybrid duplexes formed between radioactive MuMTV TA-sequence RNA and C3H mouse mammary tumor DNA. The DNA’s of rats, therefore, contained two sets of sequences that were related to sequences of the MuMTV genome: One set was germ-line transmitted, whereas the other set appeared to be transmitted in some rats via a non-germ line or infectious process.","Drohan, W.; Schlom, J.",J Natl Cancer Inst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204499/,477
14171,Veranstaltungstipps:,2020-11-20,"Large-area X-ray imaging is one of the most widely used imaging modalities that spans several scientific and technological fields. Currently, the direct X-ray conversion materials that are being commercially used for large-area (> 8 cm × 4 cm without tiling) flat panel applications, such as amorphous selenium (a-Se), have usable sensitivities of up to only 30 keV. Although there have been many promising candidates (such as polycrystalline HgI(2) and CdTe), none of the semiconductors were able to assuage the requirement for high energy (> 40 keV) large-area X-ray imaging applications due to inadequate cost, manufacturability, and long-term performance metrics. In this study, we successfully demonstrate the potential of the hybrid Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite-based semiconductor detectors in satisfying all the requirements for its successful commercialization in synchrotron and medical imaging. This new generation of hybrid detectors demonstrates low dark current under electric fields needed for high sensitivity X-ray imaging applications. The detectors have a linear response to X-ray energy and applied bias, no polarization effects at a moderate bias, and signal stability over long usage durations. Also, these detectors have demonstrated a stable detection response under BNL’s National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) 70 keV monochromatic synchrotron beamline.","Datta, A.; Zhong, Z.; Motakef, S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676260/,477

The present study aims to find out in which situations related to different individual characteristics do fear and hope advertisements work as tools in generating healthy eating intention and physical activity intention. This study conducted an experiment using 283 adults from Chile. The results suggest that fear versus hope appeals in health advertisements have a more positive influence on healthy eating intention. The results suggest that the effect of fear advertisements on healthy eating intention is positively moderated by the frequency of fast food consumption and is negatively moderated by self-efficacy. The results suggest that fear versus hope appeals in health advertisements have no main effect on physical activity intention. However, the results suggest that the effect of fear advertisements on physical activity intention is positively moderated by perceived body weight and past healthy eating behavior and is negatively moderated by subjective norms. The results indicate that when making health advertising, homogenous messages are not persuasive for heterogeneous audiences. The present study results suggest that fear and hope advertisements should be delivered considering the individual characteristics identified in the present study.","Farías, Pablo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730075/,477
15327,Ecological model of health behavior as a methodology for reducing anti-vaccination trends,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Comorbid chronic conditions are common among people with type 2 diabetes. We developed an artificial intelligence algorithm, based on reinforcement learning (RL), for personalized diabetes and multimorbidity management, with strong potential to improve health outcomes relative to current clinical practice. METHODS: We modeled glycemia, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as health outcomes, using a retrospective cohort of 16,665 patients with type 2 diabetes from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care electronic health records in 2009–2017. We trained an RL prescription algorithm that recommends a treatment regimen optimizing patients’ cumulative health outcomes using their individual characteristics and medical history at each encounter. The RL recommendations were evaluated on an independent subset of patients. RESULTS: The single-outcome optimization RL algorithms, RL–glycemia, RL–blood pressure, and RL–CVD, recommended consistent prescriptions as that observed by clinicians in 86.1%, 82.9%, and 98.4% of the encounters, respectively. For patient encounters in which the RL recommendations differed from the clinician prescriptions, significantly fewer encounters showed uncontrolled glycemia (A1c > 8% in 35% of encounters), uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 140 mmHg in 16% of encounters), and high CVD risk (risk > 20% in 25% of encounters) under RL algorithms compared with those observed under clinicians (43%, 27%, and 31% of encounters, respectively; all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A personalized RL prescriptive framework for type 2 diabetes yielded high concordance with clinicians’ prescriptions, and substantial improvements in glycemia, blood pressure, and CVD risk outcomes.

We retrospectively analyzed the changes of cuff pressure during thyroid surgery and examined its relationships with postoperative airway complications. CASE PRESENTATION: Cuff pressure was initially adjusted at 26 cmH(2)O and continuously measured in 61 patients. The cuff pressure-time curve dynamically fluctuated, and exceeded 30 cmH(2)O in all patients, whereas decreased to ≤ 20 cmH(2)0 in 42 (69%) patients. Ratio of the period with such an increase and decrease of cuff pressure to the total duration of surgery were 40% (28–66%) and 9% (0–21%), respectively (median, interquartile range). No patients showed symptoms of airway stenosis requiring treatment except one who developed recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. No patients had lower respiratory tract infection.

The magnitude of values was clearly associated with the severity of the infection. Rejections and viral infections did not interfere with the PCT release.¶Conclusion: PCT is a reliable predictor with discriminating power for non-viral systemic infections in patients after heart and/or lung transplantation. PCT allows an early differential diagnosis between rejection (AR) and bacterial/fungal infection (IF) and thus a rapid and focused therapeutic intervention. It avoids unnecessary antibiotic treatment which could be toxic for the graft itself in patients with rejection only. PCT provides vital information early to clinicians and allows them to improve the management of bacterial/fungal infections in immunocompromized transplant patients. PCT thus facilitates and improves the outcome of survival rate and the quality of life in the postoperative period of patients with heart and/or lung grafts.","Hammer, S.; Meisner, F.; Dirschedl, P.; Fraunberger, P.; Meiser, B.; Reichart, B.; Hammer, C.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095472/,477

We elucidated the impact of serum levels of ferritin on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in a large cohort. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 578 treatment-naïve HCC patients who underwent RFA. We divided our cohort into four groups by the quartile points of serum ferritin level: G1 (≤55 ng/mL, n = 148), G2 (56-130 ng/mL, n = 142), G3 (131-243 ng/mL, n = 144) and G4 (≥244 ng/mL, n = 144). We analyzed the recurrence and survival of patients using the Kaplan-Meier method. We also evaluated pathological iron deposition among patients with a solitary tumor smaller than 2 cm. RESULTS The cumulative rates of overall recurrence and survival at 5 years were 81.6% and 66.3%, respectively. The serum levels of ferritin were correlated with pathological iron deposition. There were no significant differences in recurrence and survival rates according to serum levels of ferritin and pathological hepatic iron deposition.

RECENT FINDINGS The majority of research on ADHD and exposure to maltreatment focuses on the high rates of comorbidity, including international studies from Asia, South America, North America, and Europe. Longitudinal studies showed that early exposure to maltreatment is a risk factor for ADHD symptoms later in development; however, this finding was not consistent. There were some preliminary studies on the neurological and genetic mechanisms underlying the link between ADHD and exposure to maltreatment. Finally, ADHD and exposure to maltreatment were found to have an additive effect on clinically salient outcomes (e.g., aggression, suicide attempts). Results from the review have direct clinical and future implications, including the need to understand the effect of comorbid ADHD and exposure to maltreatment in treatment studies.","Craig, Stephanie G; Bondi, Bianca C; O'Donnell, Katherine A; Pepler, Debra J; Weiss, Margaret D",Current psychiatry reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01193-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161561/,477
101165,[Surgical treatment strategy for digestive system malignancies during the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia].,2020-02-25,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic philosophers and governments have proposed scarce resource allocation guidelines. Their purpose is to advise healthcare professionals on how to ethically allocate scarce medical resources. One challenging feature of the pandemic has been the large numbers of patients needing mechanical ventilatory support. Guidelines have paradigmatically focused on the question of what doctors should do if they have fewer ventilators than patients who need respiratory support: which patient should get the ventilator? There is, however, an important higher level allocation problem. Namely, how are we to ethically distribute newly obtained ventilators across hospitals: which hospital should get the ventilator(s)? In this paper, we identify a set of principles for allocating newly obtained ventilators across hospitals. We focus particularly on low and middle income countries, who frequently have limited pre-existing intensive care capacity, and have needed to source additional ventilators. We first provide some background. Second, we argue that the main population healthcare aim during the COVID-19 pandemic should be to save the most lives. Next, we assess a series of potential heuristics or principles that could be used to guide allocation: allocation to the most densely populated cities, random allocation, allocation based on the ratio of patients to ICU personnel, prioritisation in terms of intrahospital mortality, prioritisation of younger populations, and prioritisation in terms of population mortality. We conclude by providing a plausible ranking of the principles, while noting a number of epistemological challenges, in terms of how they best further the aim of increasing the probability of saving the most lives.","Palacios-González, César; Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian",Developing world bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934463/,477

A rapid and simple test is needed to confirm infection in suspected cases during disease outbreaks. In this study, we developed a reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay for the detection of H7 subtype avian influenza virus. Assays were performed at a single temperature (39°C) and the results were obtained within 20 min. The assay showed no cross-detection with Newcastle disease virus or infectious bronchitis virus, which are the other main respiratory viruses affecting birds. The analytical sensitivity was 102 RNA copies per reaction at a 95% probability level according to probit regression analysis, with 100% specificity. Compared with published reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the κ value of the reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay in 342 avian clinical samples was 0.988 (p < .001). The sensitivity for avian clinical sample detection was 100% (95%CI, 90.40%-100%) and the specificity was 99.96% (95%CI, 97.83%-99.98%).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Administrative health databases were used to examine publicly funded health care expenditures among 698,113 younger (20-64 years) and older (≥65 years) adults with diabetes in Ontario from April 2004 to March 2014. Generalized linear models were constructed to examine relative and absolute differences in health care costs (total and non-drug-related costs) across neighborhood SES quintiles, by age, with adjustment for differences in age, sex, diabetes duration, and comorbidity. RESULTS Unadjusted costs per person-year in the lowest (Q1) versus highest (Q5) SES quintile were 39% higher among younger adults ($5,954 vs. $4,270 [Canadian dollars]) but only 9% higher among older adults ($10,917 vs. $9,993). Adjusted nondrug costs (primarily for hospitalizations and physician visits) were $1,569 per person-year higher among younger adults in quartile (Q)1 vs. Q5 (modeled relative cost difference: 35.7% higher) and $139.3 million per year among all individuals in Q1. Scenarios in which these excess costs per person-year were decreased by ≥10% or matched the relative difference among seniors suggested a potential for savings in the range of $26.0-$128.2 million per year among all lower-SES adults under age 65 years (Q1-Q4). CONCLUSIONS SES is a predictor of diabetes-related health care costs in our setting, more so among adults under age 65 years, a group that lacks universal drug coverage under Ontario's health care system. Non-drug-related health care costs were more than one-third higher in younger, low-SES adults, translating to >$1 billion more in health care expenditures over 10 years.","Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee; Fazli, Ghazal S; Bierman, Arlene S; Lipscombe, Lorraine L; Mitsakakis, Nicholas; Shah, Baiju R; Wu, C Fangyun; Johns, Ashley; Booth, Gillian L",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc19-1536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641377/,477

This study describes the diagnostic yield and patient experiences of MGPT in diverse populations. Patients and Methods This multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled participants from three cancer genetics clinics-University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center, and Stanford Cancer Institute-who met testing guidelines or had a 2.5% or greater probability of a pathogenic variant (N = 2,000). All patients underwent 25- or 28-gene MGPT and results were compared with differential genetic diagnoses generated by pretest expert clinical assessment. Post-test surveys on distress, uncertainty, and positive experiences were administered at 3 months (69% response rate) and 1 year (57% response rate). Results Of 2,000 participants, 81% were female, 41% were Hispanic, 26% were Spanish speaking only, and 30% completed high school or less education. A total of 242 participants (12%) carried one or more pathogenic variant (positive), 689 (34%) carried one or more variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and 1,069 (53%) carried no pathogenic variants or VUS (negative). More than one third of pathogenic variants (34%) were not included in the differential diagnosis. After testing, few patients (4%) had prophylactic surgery, most (92%) never regretted testing, and most (80%) wanted to know all results, even those of uncertain significance. Positive patients were twice as likely as negative/VUS patients (83% v 41%; P < .001) to encourage their relatives to be tested. Conclusion In a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse cohort, MGPT increased diagnostic yield. More than one third of identified pathogenic variants were not clinically anticipated.

The aim was to evaluate survival outcomes of patients with N2 disease in multimodality trials of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analyses (random and fixed effects) were performed. Searches of Medline and Embase (1980-2013) were conducted. Abstracts from thoracic scientific meetings were searched. Reference lists of all relevant studies were reviewed. All studies of patients with N2 disease who received induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and randomised to surgery or radiotherapy were included. No language restrictions were imposed. The main outcome was overall survival. RESULTS 805 publications were identified. 519 and 281 were excluded because they were not primary results from randomised trials (or did not include N2 disease) or did not compare surgery with radiotherapy, respectively. The final six trials consisted of 868 patients. In four trials, patients received induction chemotherapy and in two trials patients received induction chemoradiotherapy. The HR comparing patients randomised to surgery after chemotherapy was 1.01 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.23; p=0.954) whereas for patients randomised to surgery after chemoradiotherapy was 0.87 (0.75 to 1.01; p=0.068). The overall HR of all pooled trials was 0.92 (0.81 to 1.03; p=0.157). CONCLUSIONS Surgery should be considered as part of multimodality treatment for patients with resectable lung cancer and ipsilateral mediastinal nodal disease. In trials where patients received surgery as part of trimodality treatment, overall survival was better than chemoradiotherapy alone.","McElnay, P J; Choong, A; Jordan, E; Song, F; Lim, E",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2014-206292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25967753/,477

BACKGROUND Iatrogenic entero-atmospheric fistula is devastating and its management is extremely difficult because it is often associated with fluid and electrolyte disturbances, nutritional problems, and life-threatening sepsis. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic repair of a recurrent incisional hernia that was complicated by iatrogenic cecal injury necessitating a limited ileocecal resection and onlay prosthetic mesh repair of the hernia. Postoperatively, sloughing of the overlying skin led to mesh exposure. An attempted rotational flap coverage was complicated by small bowel injury, which was recognized and repaired. However, an entero-atmospheric fistula developed after the removal of contaminated mesh. The fistula was initially treated by vacuum-assisted closure dressing and later was converted to a 'stoma'. Six months later, the small bowel segment bearing the fistula was excised and bowel continuity was restored. CONCLUSIONS In selected cases, the conversion of entero-atmospheric fistula to a 'stoma' allows the patient to be discharged home early and maintain good nutritional status while awaiting the definitive surgical intervention.","Meshikhes, Abdul-Wahed Nasir; Al-Hariri, Abdulrazzak; Al-Zahir, Ali Ahmed; Al-Nahawi, Mamdouh",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.889638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24265846/,477

Thus, the social determinants of mental health act as both mediators and moderators of the pandemic's impacts, and like all social determinants, the effects of the pandemic are underpinned by public policies and social norms.

142177,[First case of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children in Shanghai].,2020-02-02,"Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Over the years, different therapeutic modalities have been adopted depending on tumor stage and patient characteristics, such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Recently, with the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has experienced a revolution that has resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival with an enhanced toxicity profile. Despite this paradigm shift, most patients present some kind of resistance to ICI. In this setting, current research is shifting towards the integration of multiple therapies, with RT and ICI being one of the most promising based on the potential immunostimulatory synergy of this combination. This review gives an overview of the evolution and current state of the combination of RT and ICI and provides evidence-based data that can improve patient selection. The combination in lung cancer is a safe therapeutic approach that improves local control and progression-free survival, and it has the potential to unleash abscopal responses. Additionally, this treatment strategy seems to be able to re-sensitize select patients that have reached a state of resistance to ICI, further enabling the continuation of systemic therapy.","Chicas-Sett, Rodolfo; Zafra-Martin, Juan; Morales-Orue, Ignacio; Castilla-Martinez, Juan; Berenguer-Frances, Miguel A; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Elisa; Rodriguez-Abreu, Delvys; Couñago, Felipe",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12082178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764371/,477

In many parts of the world, construction workers are at elevated risk of suicide. Here, we examine the extent to which construction workers may be differentially exposed to the economic effects of COVID-19. METHODS A narrative review and synthesis of the literature was conducted. RESULTS The economic and labour market shock resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a convergence of factors that may significantly exacerbate suicide risk among construction workers, particularly among those with lower skills. CONCLUSIONS With important insights from previous financial crises, it is vital that governments, industry and workplaces act rapidly to mitigate suicide risk among vulnerable groups such as construction workers. Mental healthcare investment is needed, and must be complemented by prevention and control in the workplace and in the general community.

DESIGN Community-based cross-sectional study. SETTING Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS The study was conducted among 633 participants living in Gurage Zone from 1 February to 28 February 2020. 618 completed the questionnaire. A multistage sampling technique was employed to obtain study participants. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted by 20 experienced and trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire. To assess knowledge, 10 questions were adopted from the WHO questionnaire, which is a standardised and structured questionnaire used internationally. Data were entered into EpiData V.3.1 and exported to SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) V.24 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed and the findings were presented in text, figures and tables. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between each independent variable and the outcome variable. All variables with p<0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model and statistical significance was declared at p<0.05. Voluntary consent was taken from all participants. RESULTS A total of 618 participants were included in the study, with a response rate of 97.6%. Of the participants, 40.7% had good knowledge (95% CI 36.3 to 44.2). Urban residence (adjusted OR=6.135, 95% CI 4.429 to 9.238) and a primary and above educational level (adjusted OR=4.294, 95% CI 1.875 to 9.831) were some independent predictors of husbands' knowledge status. CONCLUSION Knowledge of neonatal danger signs in this study was low. Urban residence, primary and above educational level, the husband's wife undergoing instrumental delivery and accompanying the wife during antenatal care visits were independent predictors of knowledge. Thus, strong multisectoral collaboration should target reducing the knowledge gap by improving husbands' attitude with regard to accompanying their wives during antenatal care and postnatal care visits, or create a strategy to increase husbands' participation in access to maternal and child health service since husbands are considered decision-makers when it comes to healthcare-seeking in the family. The government should come up with policies that will help promote formal education in the community and increase their media access.","Shitu, Solomon; Abebe, Haimanot; Adane, Daniel; Wassie, Abebaw; Mose, Ayenew; Yeshaneh, Alex",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400445/,477

METHODS We analysed clinical and radiological data of 113 consecutive patients who received postinterventional CT scans within 4.5 h after mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS PSH was present in 27 of 113 patients (24%). Extravasation of contrast agent was observed during intervention in only 6 of 27 cases (22%). There was consecutive haemorrhagic transformation in four patients with PSH (p = 0.209, Fisher's exact test). Preinterventional predictors for the occurrence of PSH in our series were a long interval between clinical onset and recanalization (p = 0.028), a long procedure time (p = 0.010), and a high number of recanalization attempts (p = 0.001). PSH had no significant impact on clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at discharge (p = 0.419) or at 3 months (p = 0.396). There were no significant correlations between PSH and thrombectomy devices (Solitaire: p = 0.433, Trevo Pro: p = 0.124). CONCLUSION PSH after endovascular mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke are likely to occur in complicated cases in which more than one revascularisation attempt is performed. PSH per se do not appear to be associated with an impaired clinical outcome or an elevated risk for consecutive haemorrhage.","Nikoubashman, Omid; Reich, Arno; Pjontek, Rastislav; Jungbluth, Michael; Wiesmann, Martin",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1424-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25228448/,477

We identified the need to seek feedback from the patients attending these clinics.MethodsWe designed a questionnaire for patients who had attended a virtual clinic in General Surgery, using both Qualitative and Quantitative questions. We contacted 100 patients who attended a range of clinics ran by over 10 different General Surgical Consultants between 25th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. A team of junior doctors and clinical assistants were recruited to contact patients. Patients were contacted via telephone to ask if they would be happy to complete the survey which would be emailed to them, if they did not have an email address a shorter survey was completed over the phone.ResultsIn total we had 73 responses to the survey. Data collected suggests that virtual clinics are well received by patients. 48% (n=35) answered that they were overall ‘very satisfied’ with the care received in the virtual clinic, and 79.6% (n=43) felt that their care did not suffer as a result of non-face to face contact. Most patients would recommend a virtual clinic to their friend or family 77% (n=56), however if given the option 60% (n=43) would prefer a face to face clinic appointment.ConclusionsAs the pandemic progresses it is important to identify ways in which good patient care can be delivered whilst not putting patients at risk of contracting the virus. Virtual clinics not only maintain patient safety but also have many other benefits to patients as identified in this study. This study suggests that perhaps the use of virtual clinics should continue and could be utilised by surgical departments to provide efficient patient centred care.","Fanning, Sinead J.; Palmer, Hannah Beattie Sturrock Hussain Ahmed Carney Clare Jaunoo Shameen",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.187,477

The paper contributes to a developing evidence base concerned with social work efforts to adapt and maintain support provision during the unprecedented circumstances, and provides insight into how such support was perceived and experienced. Funded by X and X, a qualitative, mixed method study was conducted which included a survey of Welsh Local Authority professionals (n=22) and interviews with Welsh care-experienced young people aged 17-24 (n=17). The findings of this paper show the propensity of corporate parents to provide protection against the adversities of the pandemic, or to compound difficulties. While some young people reported being both practically and emotionally supported, for others corporate parenting support was perceived as unavailable, unhelpful and / or uncaring. The Covid-19 pandemic provides a unique lens to consider the strengths, flaws and future opportunities for corporate parenting. The findings emphasise the need for parity of support for young people leaving care and consideration of national, local and individual responses is included. Yet consistent with findings pre-dating the pandemic, the findings reaffirm the enduring importance of both relationships and resources in ensuring good support for care leavers.","Roberts, Louise Rees Alyson Mannay Dawn Bayfield Hannah Corliss Cindy Diaz Clive Vaughan Rachael",Children and Youth Services Review,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2021.106155,477

Objective: this article aimed to investigate the coagulation profile of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a retrospective research design. We recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital from June 15th to July 7th, 2020. Upon patients’ entering a blood sample was drawn from each patient for assessing patient’s coagulation profile (PT, PTT, INR, Platelet count);and a chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan was performed for each patient. The study patients were divided in to sever group (CO-RADS score 5) and non-sever group (CO-RADS score <5). Results: Thirty-six patients (20 males and 16 females) with a mean age of 54.7±17.5 years were studied. Of them, 11 cases (30.56%) had severe pulmonary involvement. Also, the coagulation profiles were longer in the severe group than non-sever group. As well, the means of platelet count that were 232.440 per microliter in the non-severe group and 289.180 per microliter in the severe and non-sever groups, respectively;but still not statistically significant (p>0.05). The Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for PT and INR was 0.615 and 0.611, respectively. The AUC for platelet count was 0.680 (95% CI: 0.501 to 0.859) and had an acceptable discriminating power. Conclusions: In this study, we did not find any statistically significant relationship between the results of coagulation tests and the severity of pulmonary involvement according to HRCT scan findings in COVID-19 patients. But further analyses suggest that, except PTT, the other coagulation tests (PT, INR, and platelet count) may discriminate severe COVID-19 patients. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Ebrahimi, M.; Abiri, S.; Dost, E.

We argue that time constitutes a crucial object of and mechanism for knowledge production in such media and investigate how time comes to matter in vaccine evidence-making communication practices. In science communication on vaccine development, the vaccine object (along with the practices through which it is produced) undergoes a material-discursive shift from an imagined ?rushed? product to being many years in the making and uninhibited by unnecessarily lengthy processes. In both these enactments of vaccine development, time itself is constituted as evidence of vaccine efficacy and safety. This article traces how time (performed as both calendar time and as a series of relational events) is materialized as an affective and epistemic object of evidence within public science communication by analyzing the material-discursive techniques through which temporality is enacted within news media focused on the timeline of COVID-19 vaccine development. We contend that time (as evidence) is remade through these techniques as an ontopolitical concern within the COVID-19 vaccine assemblage. We furthermore argue that science communication itself is an important actor in the hinterland of public health practices with performative effects and vital evidence-making capacities.","Harrison, Mia Lancaster Kari Rhodes Tim",Time &amp; Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463x211032201,477

Refrigerated transport requires additional fuel for refrigeration other than for traction. Photovoltaic panels on the vehicle rooftop, a battery bank, and a power conversion system can replace the diesel engine driving the transport refrigerated unit. In long-haul deliveries, vehicles cross zones with different climate conditions, which affect both refrigeration requirements and photovoltaic energy conversion. Mandatory driver’s breaks and rest also affect delivery timing and energy consumption. A multiperiod, multizone optimization model is developed to size the onboard photovoltaic system, based on features of the delivery tour. The model is applied to a palletized chilled food delivery from North-Eastern Italy, showing a payback time of around four years, which can drop under two years for expected reduction of component costs. Economic and environmental performances can be increased by also allowing refrigerated products on-board during the return journey, leading to more fuel savings. Photovoltaic-integrated long-haul delivery for frozen products is not convenient at current market costs. Different climate conditions are tested, showing the model ability to act as a decision support tool to foster renewable energy penetration into the cold chain.","Pagnin, Chiara Simeoni Patrizia",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158506,477

Pre- COVID- 19, the AMPATH Multiple Myeloma Program had created support groups for myeloma survivors and their caregivers that regularly met for health education, emotional support, and social opportunities. With the enforcement COVID-19 prevention and control protocols physical support group meetings became impossible. The program shifted to the online platform to sustain peer to peer support for myeloma patients and caregivers. We aim to describe challenges faced with online patient support group meetings as this has not been well documented in a resource-constrained setting. Methods: Myeloma patients and caregivers at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital were contacted and a meeting date and time agreed. Participants were briefed on how to download and operate the zoom application in preparation for online meetings. A meeting link was shared with the expected attendees and a reminder sent two days before a meeting. Support group meetings were held for different groups among them myeloma survivors and caregivers. The meeting sessions were led by healthcare professionals - hematology consultants, social workers, nutritionist and psychosocial counsellors. Peer-to-peer sessions were also held. Results: Six online meeting sessions were held between June 2020 and December 2020. A total of 199 participants were expected to join the six different meetings but a low meeting turn-out of 25.6% was experienced.

COVID pandemic has added to the list of infectious agents that could result in arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre. The study included patients who presented with clinical suspicion of post-infectious arthritis between July-September 2019 and 2020. The study was extended for another 2 months to include patients who presented between October-November 2020. The patients were categorized into post-viral arthritis, post-COVID arthritis, chikungunya arthritis and AIRDs. The demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, examination findings and laboratory parameters and the response to treatment for each participant were collected and assessed. RESULTS In the year 2019 and 2020 (July-Sep), the corresponding number of patients analyzed were 20 and 33. The mean duration of presentation was 1.53 (±3.10) weeks. Chikungunya arthritis was noted in 10% of patients in 2019, while it was 15.15% in 2020. Other post-viral arthritis was identified in 65% and 66.67% of patients in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In the second part of the study, 65.68% of patients were classified as post-viral arthritis, including chikungunya arthritis, post-COVID arthritis and other post-viral arthritis. Around 27% were categorized as AIRDs. Rheumatoid factor negativity and anti-nuclear antibody negativity were found to be significant (P 0.0) in categorizing the patients into post-viral arthritis group, while presence of urinary symptoms (P 0.0) classified the patients into reactive arthritis. CONCLUSION The study revealed that the presence of chikungunya arthritis across the two years was comparable. Post-COVID arthritis needs to be considered as a potential differential in post-infectious arthritis. There are no identifiable characteristics (clinical or a simple routine laboratory parameter) that could differentiate the causes of post-infectious arthritis from AIRDs.","Jaladhar, Prakruthi; S, Chandrashekara; Salanke, Manasa; Kori, Devaraj",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472811/,477
188530,[Response plan in the neonatal intensive care unit during epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection (2nd Edition)].,2020-03-01,"To express its structural proteins, the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (EAV) produces a nested set of six subgenomic (sg) RNA species. These RNA molecules are generated by a mechanism of discontinuous transcription, during which a common leader sequence, representing the 5' end of the genomic RNA, is attached to the bodies of the sg RNAs. The connection between the leader and body parts of an mRNA is formed by a short, conserved sequence element termed the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which is present at the 3' end of the leader as well as upstream of each of the structural protein genes. With the exception of RNA3, only one body TRS was previously assumed to be used to join the leader and body of each EAV sg RNA. Here we show that for the synthesis of two other sg RNAs, RNA4 and RNA5, alternative leader-body junction sites that differ substantially in transcriptional activity are used. By site-directed mutagenesis of an EAV infectious cDNA clone, the alternative TRSs used to generate RNA3, -4, and -5 were inactivated, which strongly influenced the corresponding RNA levels and the production of infectious progeny virus. The relative amounts of RNA produced from alternative TRSs differed significantly and corresponded to the relative infectivities of the virus mutants. This strongly suggested that the structural proteins that are expressed from these RNAs are limiting factors during the viral life cycle and that the discontinuous step in sg RNA synthesis is crucial for the regulation of their expression. On the basis of a theoretical analysis of the predicted RNA structure of the 3' end of the EAV genome, we propose that the local secondary RNA structure of the body TRS regions is an important factor in the regulation of the discontinuous step in EAV sg mRNA synthesis.","Pasternak, A O; Gultyaev, A P; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090163/,477
188593,Prevalence of subclinical infection and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a residential care home for the elderly.,2006,"The reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) is anchored to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol. This molecule antagonizes the function of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to promote proMMP-2 maturation. Here, we attempt to clarify the mechanism underlying RECK functions. First, we found that RECK forms a complex with MT1-MMP and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Notably, RECK increases the amount of MT1-MMP that associates with detergent-resistant membranes during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, perturbation of membrane cholesterol significantly affected the function of RECK in suppressing MT1-MMP function. These findings indicate that RECK possibly regulates MT1-MMP function by modulating its behavior on the cell surface as well as by enzymatic action; this prompted us to find another molecule whose behavior in detergent-resistant membranes is influenced by RECK. Subsequently, we found that RECK interacts with CD13/aminopeptidase N. Further, we found that RECK inhibits the proteolytic activity of CD13 in a cholesterol perturbation-sensitive manner. Finally, we examined whether RECK influences the behavior of MT1-MMP and CD13 during their internalization from the cell surface. In the absence of RECK, MT1-MMP and CD13 were internalized along with the markers of clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis. However, interestingly, in the presence of RECK these molecules were internalized preferentially with an endocytic marker that is neither clathrinnor caveolae-dependent, indicating that RECK modulates endocytic pathways of MT1-MMP and CD13. This modulation was correlated with the accelerated internalization and decay of MT1-MMP and CD13. This study unveils the novel function and target molecules of RECK.","Miki, Takao; Takegami, Yujiro; Okawa, Katsuya; Muraguchi, Teruyuki; Noda, Makoto; Takahashi, Chiaki",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329256/,477

189668,Treating severe acute respiratory syndrome with hyperimmune globulins.,2003,"BACKGROUND In response to the coronavirus pandemic, lockdown restrictions and a ban on alcohol sales were introduced in South Africa. Objectives. To investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of patients who visited a tertiary urban trauma centre. Methods. The period of investigation was from 1 February to 30 June 2020 and was segmented into three intervals: pre-lockdown (February and March 2020), hard lockdown (April and May 2020) and immediately post lockdown (June 2020). The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period. The mean total number of patients who visited the trauma unit returned to pre-lockdown levels in June. Conclusions. There was an overall trend of reduced number of patients who visited the trauma unit during the hard lockdown period; however, these numbers returned to pre-lockdown levels during the immediate post-lockdown period. The number of road traffic injury admissions remained reduced during all three phases of lockdown, while the number of gunshot victims increased substantially during the post-lockdown period.","Navsaria, P H; Nicol, A J; Parry, C D H; Matzopoulos, R; Maqungo, S; Gaudin, R",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334392/,477

Samples from 215 lynx from six study areas were tested for antibodies to feline parvovirus (FPV), feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. A subset of samples was tested for feline immunodeficiency virus; all were negative. For all other pathogens, evidence for exposure was found in at least one location. Serologic evidence for FPV was found in all six areas but was more common in southern populations. Also, more males than females showed evidence of exposure to FPV. Overall, prevalences were low and did not exceed 8% for any of the pathogens tested. This suggests that free-ranging lynx rarely encounter common feline pathogens.","Biek, Roman; Zarnke, Randall L; Gillin, Colin; Wild, Margaret; Squires, John R; Poss, Mary",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12528455/,477

190678,Use of humanised mice to study antiviral activity of human γδ-T cells against influenza A viruses.,2014,"BACKGROUND Bariatric operations may have a restrictive and a malabsorptive component. The restrictive component is considered key for short-term weight loss. However, there are important volume discrepancies between gastric reservoirs in different bariatric surgical techniques, which questions the real meaning of the restrictive part of the operation. We have investigated the relationship between residual gastric volume after sleeve gastrectomy in duodenal switch (DS) and weight loss over the first postoperative year. METHODS 14 patients submitted to a modified DS and one patient submitted to a sleeve gastrectomy were studied. All patients had an abdominal CT performed between the third and the ninth postoperative month to measure residual gastric volume. Gastric tube volume was correlated to early postoperative weight loss. RESULTS Mean excess BMI loss was 75% at 12 months. Mean gastric tube volume was 208 cc. Gastric volume was not related to preoperative weight or BMI; instead, it was directly related to patient's height. There was no statistical relation between gastric volume and weight loss at 3, 6, 9 or 12 months after the operation. CONCLUSION After DS, gastric tube volume is not directly related to weight changes. Other factors could have influence on intake restriction, such as gastric tube compliance or different mechanisms of satiety induction, because no differences in weight loss were observed between narrow tubes and wider ones, despite important variations in volume.","Sánchez-Pernaute, Andrés; Rodríguez, Ricardo; Rubio, Miguel Angel; Pérez-Aguirre, Elia; Crespo, Sofía Cárdenas; Valderrama, Oscar Cano; Talavera, Pablo; Méndez, Ramiro; Díez-Valladares, Luis; Torres, Antonio",Obesity surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18074491/,477

The causes of most cases of infectious diarrhoea still remain unidentified, however, and there must be other viruses to be found. 'Novel' rotaviruses have recently been discovered, mainly in animals (serogroups B and C in pigs and humans, D in birds, and one or more further groups in sheep and other mammals). Except for the group B virus which has caused widespread outbreaks of quite severe diarrhoea in adults in China (still not reported from outside China) these novel rotaviruses are rarities in the human and probably represent uncommon zoonotic infections. We speculate that the Chinese virus might have arisen by reassortment of genetic segments of animal group B viruses or perhaps by mutation, and so became infectious for man. The problem of identifying and determining the importance of small round viruses is reviewed. It seems likely that the group of small, round structured viruses, including Norwalk and the viruses of plainly calicivirus morphology, are all representatives of a whole group of enteric caliciviruses. Until they can be more easily cultivated it will be difficult to make diagnostic reagents available to all. Astroviruses and genuine parvoviruses have been found by many people in many countries. Astroviruses are probably more important as pathogens in lambs than in children or calves; parvoviruses can only be established as significant in epidemics. The coronavirus-like particles, first found in Vellore and Bristol, are still enigmatic and their role in diarrhoea is uncertain. Toroviridae, recently discovered as causes of diarrhoea in ungulates, do not seem to be at all important as causes of diarrhoea in humans. Possibly fruitful approaches to future searches are outlined: firstly to make more extensive use of immuno-electron microscopy; and secondly to try to improve existing tissue culture systems to make them more sensitive to enteric viruses.","Flewett, T H; Beards, G M; Brown, D W; Sanders, R C",Ciba Foundation symposium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3036443/,477

Limited data are available describing the clinical presentation and outcomes of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Europe. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective chart review of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the North Zealand Hospital in Denmark between 1 March and 4 May 2020. Main outcomes include major therapeutic interventions during hospitalisation, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as death. RESULTS A total of 115 patients were included, including four infants. The median age of adults was 68 years and 40% were female. At admission, 55 (50%) patients had a fever, 29 (26%) had a respiratory rate exceeding 24 breaths/minute, and 78 (70%) received supplemental oxygen. The prevalence of co-infection was 13%. Twenty patients (18%) (median age: 64 years; 15% female) were treated in the intensive care unit. Twelve (10.4%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and three (2.6%) renal replacement therapy. Nine patients (8%) developed pulmonary embolism. Sixteen patients (14%) died. Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 12), seven (6.1%) were discharged alive, four (3.4%) died and one (0.9%) was still hospitalised.

Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) founded The Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at MGH. The Schwartz Center is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient and support to caregivers and encourages the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. The diagnosis of cancer is incredibly stressful, and treatments are arduous. Humor may help to ease the pain, show the human side of the health care team, and help everyone cope. Whether the patient uses humor to lighten the mood of a difficult consultation with their physician, or health care workers use it to help cheer each other through the day, humor and laughter can be valuable tools. Humor can soften the isolation experienced by both patients and staff. When used sensitively, respecting the gravity of the situation, humor can build the connection among the caregiver, patient, and family. However, insensitive joking is offensive and distressing, and experience suggests a variable acceptance of humor by patients with life-threatening illnesses, making humor a high-risk strategy, and it can be a pejorative maker of an adversive power differential. The medical literature contains little on humor, and very little research has been conducted on this common aspect of human communication.

193678,Development of interfering RNA agents to inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus infection and replication.,2009,"BACKGROUND Diagnostic injections (blocks) are a valuable tool in the management of chronic noncancer pain. By precise blockade of specific neural structures and observation of pain responses, pain mechanisms can be accurately defined. With such information, therapeutic procedures targeting neural structures are possible. Fibromyalgia is a disorder of pain processing with characteristic symptoms. The 2010 American College of Rheumatologists fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria evaluates these symptoms in a scoring system, allowing more objectivity in the diagnosis. We hypothesize that patients with fibromyalgia phenotype fulfilling the 2010 American College of Rheumatologists criteria may respond to diagnostic blocks differently when compared to patients without fibromyalgia phenotype. OBJECTIVES This study was designed to establish whether diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of fibromyalgia should influence the decision to perform diagnostic blocks for chronic non-cancer pain. STUDY DESIGN A prospective observational research study was performed at our institution. IRAS project ID: 231514. SETTING Tertiary pain clinic in the UK. METHODS Patients were selected to receive diagnostic block by usual clinical assessment after which they were asked to consent to take part in the study. All participating patients completed the 2010 American College of Rheumatologists fibromyalgia diagnostic questionnaire prior to the diagnostic block. Patients were divided into 2 groups A and B based on the outcome of block - primary outcome. Group A experienced a 70% or greater improvement in pain severity following the block for the anticipated duration of action of the local anesthetic, Group B experienced a less than 70% reduction in pain. Statistical analysis between groups A and B was conducted by comparing categorical data, described as percentages, with the chi squared test. Ordinal variables such as Widespread pain index and Symptom severity score are presented as median and analyzed with Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included in the study. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 75 remaining patients, 44 received lumbar medial branch blocks, 19 genicular nerve blocks, 3 blocks to nerves supplying the sacroiliac joint, one suprascapular nerve block, and 6 cervical and 2 thoracic medial branch blocks. Group A contained 38 patients and group B contained 37 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fibromyalgia screening questionnaire positive patients between groups A (13 out of 38 patients) and B (13 out of 37 patients), P = 0.93. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fibromyalgia screening questionnaire positive patients in subgroups undergoing the same type of diagnostic block (spinal pain and knee pain). LIMITATIONS Selection of patients prior to inclusion in the study may introduce bias. Patients were selected by individual treating clinicians using usual clinical practice; however, the exact selection criteria were not standardized. CONCLUSION We conclude that after physician selection, the presence of fibromyalgia phenotype does not influence the outcome from diagnostic block. It is likely therefore that fibromyalgia phenotype should not influence the decision to perform diagnostic blocks if indicated based on assessment by an experienced pain physician.","Bendinger, Tomasz; Perfitt, Joel Stephen",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740354/,477

RESULTS 145 of 553 (26%) patients had serologic evidence of SARS coronavirus infection. Of 910 patients who were managed without hospitalization, only 6 had serologic evidence of SARS. Five of the six patients had normal chest radiographs, and four had symptoms such as myalgia, chills, coughing, and feeling feverish. With the SARS coronavirus serologic test as the gold standard, the clinical diagnosis of probable SARS at hospitalization had a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.98) and a specificity of 0.96 (CI, 0.92 to 0.97). LIMITATIONS Follow-up serologic samples were not obtained from almost half of the patients because they declined further testing.

One deletion removes the end of the nsP1 gene and the beginning of the nsP2 gene, and the other removes the end of the nsP2 gene, the nsP3 and nsP4 genes, and all of the structural protein genes (M. Thomson and N. J. Dimmock, Virology 199:354-365, 1994). Like all DI SFV RNAs, DI-19 contains three regions that are conserved. Region a comprises the 5' terminus continuous with part of the nsP1 gene, region b comprises a central part of the nsP2 gene, and region c comprises the 3' terminus and the associated untranslated region. A deletion analysis of the 265-nucleotide b region (nucleotides 679 to 943, inclusive) was undertaken to determine its role in genome replication and packaging into DI virus particles. Deleted plasmids were constructed and transcribed, and the resulting DI RNAs were transfected into SFV-infected BHK cells. Putative progeny DI virus particles that had been released into the tissue culture fluid were then serially passaged in new monolayers together with added high-multiplicity SFV, and cells and tissue culture fluids were tested for the presence of DI RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. DI RNA that had all of the b region deleted was replicated well in BHK-21 cells, as shown by the presence of large amounts of negative-sense DI RNA and an increase in the amount of positive-sense RNA in the cytoplasm, but was packaged very inefficiently, as indicated by very low amounts of DI RNA in the tissue culture fluid. The genome of a deletion mutant that retained the 3' 224 nucleotides of region b was packaged successfully, but one that retained only the 5' 41 nucleotides was not detected in the tissue culture fluid. These and other data suggest that nucleotides 720 to 777 of region b are of particular importance in the packaging process. This finding agrees with data obtained with Ross River virus and contrasts with the well-studied Sindbis alphavirus major packaging signal that is located within the nsP1 gene.","White, C L; Thomson, M; Dimmock, N J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9557722/,477

With the use of detailed epidemiological data from other countries, this article describes the possible reason for the SARS epidemic not appearing in Japan, and simulates the impact of different control strategies that can break the transmission cycle of SARS associated coronavirus. METHOD Mathematical modelling is used for predicting the epidemiological outcome and simultaneously for evaluating the effect of interventions on SARS. The study estimates the initial attack size that would result in failed invasion. Three different interventions have been incorporated into the public health response policies; precautionary public health measures, isolation of infected people, and quarantine of exposed humans. RESULTS The maximum number of humans newly infected could be roughly estimated on the basis of the initial attack size, using simple formulas. It is seen that the introduction of only a few cases into certain communities would not lead easily to an epidemic. The possible trajectories of SARS epidemic depend on the levels of public health interventions as quarantine and precautionary public health measures greatly affected the transmissibility of the disease. It is shown that there exist threshold levels of interventions at which the SARS epidemic settles down. CONCLUSION Initial attack size is one of the determinants of whether SARS can successfully invade the community or not. Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent new infections would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace.","Nishiura, H; Patanarapelert, K; Sriprom, M; Sarakorn, W; Sriyab, S; Ming Tang, I",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14966229/,477

Transanal NOTES for colorectal surgery overcomes all of these issues; however, all of the reports to date have used hybrid laparoscopic techniques. We demonstrate herein the first case, to our knowledge, of pure transanal NOTES colorectal surgery. DESIGN Case report. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT The patient was a 56-year-old woman with a midrectal neoplasia. INTERVENTION Pure transanal NOTES total mesorectal excision with a coloanal anastomosis and without a diverting stoma. Using a transanal endoscopic operation device as a surgical platform, we created a viscerotomy distal to an endoluminal purse-string suture. We performed a total mesorectal excision using a “bottom-up” approach. The sigmoid colon was mobilized by a posterior, retroperitoneal approach and the colon was divided intraperitoneally. A hand-sewn, side-to-end, coloanal anastomosis was performed. Because the viscerotomy was incorporated into the anastomosis, the concerns of both accidental organ damage and viscerotomy closure were abrogated. RESULTS The procedure was completed entirely by a transanal fashion. We successfully mobilized the rectum, mesorectum, and sigmoid colon. The specimen length was more than 20 cm. The patient required minimal analgesia and her pain was nonabdominal. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, the first pure transanal NOTES total mesorectal excision with retroperitoneal sigmoid mobilization and coloanal, side-to-end anastomosis was successfully performed using what we called a peri-rectal oncologic gateway for retroperitoneal endoscopic single site surgery (PROGRESSS).

197768,Molecular and genetic characterisation of the SARS coronavirus auxiliary protein X1 in Drosophila.,2008,"Most biopsies of cutaneous vasculitis will exhibit a small vessel neutrophilic vasculitis [leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV)] that is associated with immune complexes on direct immunofluorescence examination or, less commonly, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) by indirect immunofluorescence testing. Is in uncommon for skin biopsy to reveal solely a neutrophilic arteritis signifying the presence of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa or, if accompanied by significant lobular panniculitis, nodular vasculitis/erythema induratum. In other cases, cutaneous vascular damage (fibrinoid necrosis, muscular vessel wall disruption, or endarteritis obliterans) will be mediated by a nonneutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate. Eosinophilic vasculitis can be a primary (idiopathic) process that overlaps with hypereosinophilic syndrome, or it can be a secondary vasculitis associated with connective tissue disease or parasite infestation. Authentic cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis (versus vasculitis with extravascular granulomas) can represent a cutaneous manifestation of giant cell arteritis, an eruption secondary to systemic disease such as Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis, or a localized disorder, often a post-herpes zoster (HZ) phenomenon. Lymphocytic vasculitis is a histologic reaction pattern that correlates with broad clinical differential diagnosis, which includes connective tissue disease - mostly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), endothelial infection by Rickettsia and viruses, idiopathic lichenoid dermatoses such as perniosis or ulcerative necrotic Mucha-Habermann disease, and angiocentric cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Skin biopsy extending into the subcutis, identifying the dominant inflammatory cell and caliber of vessels affected, extravascular histologic clues such as presence of lichenoid dermatitis or panniculitis, and correlation with clinical data allows for accurate diagnosis of these uncommon vasculitic entities.","Carlson, J Andrew; Chen, Ko-Ron",The American Journal of dermatopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17284960/,477

The cardio-protective effect of vitamin E in dexamethasone induced oxidative stress was studied. Forty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each. Control group received normal rat chow. Oxidative stress was induced using 30µg/kg body weight of dexamethasone (DEX) intraperitonealy in DEX+Vit E and DEX only groups while Vitamin E was administered orally at a dose of 300 IU/kg to Vitamin E only group and DEX+Vit E group daily for 14 days. All animals were fed ad libitum and had free access to water. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture for biochemical analyses while heart and kidney were processed for histological staining. The result shows a significant (p<0.05) decrease in serum nitric oxide, bilirubin and superoxide dismutase concentration in DEX-only group which was elevated following vitamin E treatment. The angiotensin converting enzyme and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activities were significantly (p<0.01) elevated in DEX-only group compared with control and DEX+Vit E groups. These enzyme levels were significantly (p<0.01) reduced in DEX + vitamin E group. The histology of the heart and the kidney in DEX-only group showed cardiac hypertrophy and kidney injury but were ameliorated by vitamin E treatment. The results suggest that vitamin E has cardiac and renal protective effect and ameliorates oxidative injury to the heart and kidney due to oxidative stress.","Owu, Daniel U; Okon, Idara A; Ufot, Usenobong F; Beshel, Justin A",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084616/,477

Dialysis has additional contributions on transmission risk so prompt preventive strategies were implemented for dialysis patients. We aimed to evaluate pandemic-related perceptions and concerns of dialysis patients and differences between dialysis modalities. An anonymous survey for assessing concerns, knowledge, and attitudes about the pandemic was sent online to a total of 339 patients on maintenance dialysis at four tertiary dialysis centers in Turkey. A total of 309 patients (54.9 ± 15.1 years, 51.6% females, 55.7% in-center HD, 44.3% peritoneal dialysis) enrolled. The anonymous online survey was conducted at the end of April 2020. HD patients were more concerned about transmission risk (p = 0.002) and risks associated with the dialysis treatment environment and the transport methods (p < 0.001). The total concern score was significantly higher in the HD group (2.60 ± 0.93 vs. 1.65 ± 0.54, p < 0.001). The knowledge about the pandemic and prevention methods and the attitudes of prevention were similar between the groups (p = 0.161 and 0.418, respectively). The compliance rate of personal preventive strategies was 98.1%. Considering changing the current dialysis modality due to the pandemic was higher in the HD group (p < 0.001). Although the preventive strategies were performed properly in the HD centers, HD patients were more concerned about the Covid-19 outbreak compared with PD. Our results support home dialysis treatments for modality decisions with patients' positive perspective of PD over HD during the pandemic.","Oruc, Aysegul; Aktas, Nimet; Dogan, Ibrahim; Akgur, Suat; Ocakoglu, Gokhan; Ersoy, Alparslan",Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis,,477

241695,Serum lactate dehydrogenase level may predict acute respiratory distress syndrome of patients with fever infected by SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the prevention and control of infectious diseases, previous research on the application of big data technology has mainly focused on the early warning and early monitoring of infectious diseases. Although the application of big data technology for COVID-19 warning and monitoring remain important tasks, prevention of the disease's rapid spread and reduction of its impact on society are currently the most pressing challenges for the application of big data technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, the Chinese government and nongovernmental organizations actively used big data technology to prevent, contain, and control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to discuss the application of big data technology to prevent, contain, and control COVID-19 in China; draw lessons; and make recommendations. METHODS: We discuss the data collection methods and key data information that existed in China before the outbreak of COVID-19 and how these data contributed to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Next, we discuss China's new data collection methods and new information assembled after the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the data and information collected in China, we analyzed the application of big data technology from the perspectives of data sources, data application logic, data application level, and application results. In addition, we analyzed the issues, challenges, and responses encountered by China in the application of big data technology from four perspectives: data access, data use, data sharing, and data protection. Suggestions for improvements are made for data collection, data circulation, data innovation, and data security to help understand China's response to the epidemic and to provide lessons for other countries' prevention and control of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the process of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, big data technology has played an important role in personal tracking, surveillance and early warning, tracking of the virus's sources, drug screening, medical treatment, resource allocation, and production recovery. The data used included location and travel data, medical and health data, news media data, government data, online consumption data, data collected by intelligent equipment, and epidemic prevention data. We identified a number of big data problems including low efficiency of data collection, difficulty in guaranteeing data quality, low efficiency of data use, lack of timely data sharing, and data privacy protection issues. To address these problems, we suggest unified data collection standards, innovative use of data, accelerated exchange and circulation of data, and a detailed and rigorous data protection system. CONCLUSIONS: China has used big data technology to prevent and control COVID-19 in a timely manner. To prevent and control infectious diseases, countries must collect, clean, and integrate data from a wide range of sources; use big data technology to analyze a wide range of big data; create platforms for data analyses and sharing; and address privacy issues in the collection and use of big data.","Wu, Jun; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth; Fan, Qiuyan",J Med Internet Res,,477

Untreated severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has a dismal prognosis. TAVR offers an attractive alternative to surgery as it is not reliant on intensive care resources. We set out to explore the safety and operational efficiency of restructuring a TAVR service and redeploying it to a new non-surgical site during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The institutional prospective service database was retrospectively interrogated for the first 50 consecutive elective TAVR cases prior to and after our institution's operational adaptations for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our endpoints were VARC-2 defined procedural complications, 30-day mortality or re-admission and service efficiency metrics. RESULTS: The profile of patients undergoing TAVR during the pandemic was similar to patients undergoing TAVR prior to the pandemic with the exception of a lower mean age (79 vs 82 years, p < 0.01) and median EuroScore II (3.1% vs 4.6%, p = 0.01). The service restructuring and redeployment contributed to the pandemic-mandated operational efficiency with a reduction in the distribution of pre-admission hospital visits (3 vs 3 visits, p < 0.001) and the time taken from TAVR clinic to procedure (26 vs 77 days, p < 0.0001) when compared to the pre-COVID-19 service. No statistically significant difference was noted in peri-procedural complications and 30-day outcomes, while post-operative length of stay was significantly reduced (2 vs 3 days, p < 0.0001) when compared to pre-COVID-19 practice. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR service restructuring and redeployment to align with pandemic-mandated healthcare resource rationalization is safe and feasible.","Joseph, Jubin; Kotronias, Rafail A; Estrin-Serlui, Theodore; Cahill, Thomas J; Kharbanda, Rajesh K; Newton, James D; Grebenik, Catherine; Dawkins, Sam; Banning, Adrian P",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,477

This quarantine-like intervention measure is especially feasible in countries and areas approaching malaria elimination. Motivated by mathematical models with quarantine for directly transmitted diseases, we develop a mosquito-borne disease model where imperfect quarantine is considered to mitigate the disease transmission from infected humans to susceptible mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is computed and the model equilibria and their stabilities are analyzed when the incidence rate is standard or bilinear. In particular, the model system may undergo a subcritical (backward) bifurcation at [Formula: see text] when standard incidence is adopted, whereas the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as [Formula: see text] and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable as [Formula: see text] when the infection incidence is bilinear. Numerical simulations suggest that the quarantine strategy can play an important role in decreasing malaria transmission. The success of quarantine mainly relies on the reduction of bites on quarantined individuals.","Jin, Xiulei; Jin, Shuwan; Gao, Daozhou",Bull Math Biol,,477

To aid in the legislative decision process and proper channelizing of resources, we estimated and compared the county-level change in prevalence rates of COVID-19 by rural-urban status over 3 weeks. Additionally, we identified hotspots based on estimated prevalence rates. METHODS: We used crowdsourced data on COVID-19 and linked them to county-level demographics, smoking rates, and chronic diseases. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in R-studio. We mapped the estimated prevalence rates using ArcGIS 10.8, and identified hotspots using Gettis-Ord local statistics. FINDINGS: In the rural counties, the mean prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 3.6 per 100,000 population to 43.6 per 100,000 within 3 weeks from April 3 to April 22, 2020. In the urban counties, the median prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 10.1 per 100,000 population to 107.6 per 100,000 within the same period. The COVID-19 adjusted prevalence rates in rural counties were substantially elevated in counties with higher black populations, smoking rates, and obesity rates. Counties with high rates of people aged 25-49 years had increased COVID-19 prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a rapid spread of COVID-19 across urban and rural areas in 21 days. Studies based on quality data are needed to explain further the role of social determinants of health on COVID-19 prevalence.","Paul, Rajib; Arif, Ahmed A; Adeyemi, Oluwaseun; Ghosh, Subhanwita; Han, Dan",J Rural Health,,477

279865,[Analysis of CT features of 15 Children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection],2020,"Abstract: The implementation of public health measures to control the current COVID-19 pandemic (such as wider lockdowns, overseas travel restrictions and physical distancing) is likely to have affected the spread of other notifiable diseases. This is a descriptive report of communicable disease surveillance in Central Queensland (CQ) for six months (1 April to 30 September 2020) after the introduction of physical distancing and wider lockdown measures in Queensland. The counts of notifiable communicable diseases in CQ in the six months were observed and compared with the average for the same months during the years 2015 to 2019. During the study's six months, there were notable decreases in notifications of most vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pertussis and rotavirus. Conversely, notifications increased for disease groups such as blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections and vector-borne diseases. There were no reported notifications for dengue fever and malaria which are mostly overseas acquired. The notifications of some communicable diseases in CQ were variably affected and the changes correlated with the implementation of the COVID-19 public health measures. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to some significant changes to local, regional and national public health practices including social distancing and wider lockdown. These measures have been previously reported to be associated with reductions in the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases as well as of other airborne transmitted agents.1,2 A preliminary analysis was conducted assessing the impact of these measures on nationally notifiable diseases across Australia;3 however, the impact of these measures on communicable diseases within regional Australia is not well established. Like most regional areas, Central Queensland (CQ) has a lower population density and considerable distance from major cities; it will be informative to understand how these measures impact on notifiable conditions in this regional setting. We aimed to identify the patterns of change in reported notifiable conditions to the Central Queensland Public Health Unit (CQPHU), during a six-month period (1 April to 30 September 2020) following the implementation of COVID-19 measures. Here, we compare these notifications to the surveillance data for the same six-month period for the previous five years (2015 to 2019). Methods: The study encompasses all notifiable conditions reported from CQ, which covers approximately 226,000 population and is spread over 117,588 square kilometres. Communicable diseases data were retrieved from the Queensland Notifiable Conditions System (NoCS), an online epidemiological database, from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2020. The data were collected under the Public Health Act 2005, a legislative authority that provides permission to access health information. Permission to publish was given by the Communicable Diseases Branch of Queensland. Data were extracted on selected notifiable diseases in Queensland: blood-borne viruses (BBV), gastrointestinal diseases, sexually transmissible infections (STIs), vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), vector-borne diseases, zoonotic diseases and other diseases. For each disease, the count for six months following the implementation of COVID-19 public health measures (1 April to 30 September 2020) was compared with the average for the same six-month period during the years 2015 to 2019. Results: From 1 April to 30 September 2020, after the implementation of Queensland's COVID-19 preventive measures, there was a decrease seen in several diseases notifications reported to the CQPHU, mostly VPDs, when compared with the same months for each of 2015 to 2019 and for the 5-year average (2015-2019) for those months (Table 1). However, increases in notifications for April-September 2020 were observed in a greater number of other notifiable disease groups.","Adegbija, Odewumi; Walker, Jacina; Smoll, Nicolas; Khan, Arifuzzaman; Graham, Julieanne; Khandaker, Gulam",,,477

315298,[Response plan in the neonatal intensive care unit during epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection (2nd Edition)],2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronaviruses-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged as a new zoonotic pathogen of humans at the end of 2019 and rapidly developed into a global pandemic. Over 106 million COVID-19 cases including 2.3 million deaths have been reported to the WHO as of February 9, 2021. This review examines the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, and phylogenetics of three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV). RECENT FINDINGS: Bats appear to be the common natural source of SARS-like CoV including SARS-CoV-1 but their role in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV remains unclear. Civet cats and dromedary camels are the intermediary animal sources for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection, respectively whereas that of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads peak early on days 2-4 of symptom onset and thus high transmission occurs in the community, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission occurs commonly. Nosocomial outbreaks are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections whereas these are less common in COVID-19. Several COVID-19 vaccines are now available. SUMMARY: Of the three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a devastating global pandemic with over a million deaths. The emergence of genetic variants, such as D614G, N501Y (variants 1 and 2), has led to an increase in transmissibility and raises concern about the possibility of re-infection and impaired vaccine response. Continued global surveillance is essential for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, to monitor changing epidemiology due to viral variants.","Hui, David S; Zumla, Alimuddin; Tang, Julian W",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,477

This study examines if the program was effective by studying relationship between strengthening of COs, vulnerability reduction, and sustaining of consistent condom use behavior among FSWs. METHODS: We used a longitudinal study design to assess the change in outcomes. A three-stage sampling design was used to select FSWs for the study. Panel data of 2085 FSWs selected from 38 COs across five states of India was used to examine the change in various outcomes from 2015 (Survey Round 1) to 2017 (Survey Round 2). The CO level program pillar measuring institutional development assessed performance of COs in six domains critical for any organization's functionality and sustainability: governance, project management, financial management, program monitoring, advocacy and networking, and resource mobilization. Overall, 32 indicators from all these domains were used to compute the CO strength score. A score was computed by taking mean of average dimension scores. The overall score was divided into two groups based on the median cutoff; COs which scored below the median were considered to have low CO strength, while COs which scored above or equal to median were considered to have high CO strength. Multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to examine the effect of program pillars on outcome measures. RESULTS: Analyses showed a significant improvement in the strength of the COs over time; percentage of COs having high strength improved from 50% in 2015 to 87% in Round 2. The improvement in CO's strength increased financial security (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.18, p<0.01), social welfare security (AOR: 1.71, p<0.01), and socio-legal security (AOR: 2.20, p<0.01) among FSWs. Further, improvement in financial security led to significant increase in consistent condom use with client among FSWs (AOR: 1.69, p<0.01) who were members of COs having high strength. Sustained consistent condom use was positively associated with young age (<30 years), ability to negotiate with clients for condom use, membership in self-help groups, high self-efficacy, self-confidence, and client solicitation in streets and brothels. CONCLUSIONS: Improving financial security and strengthening FSW led CO can improve sustained and consistent condom use. In addition, the program should focus on enhancing ability of FSWs to negotiate with clients for condom use, promote membership in self-help groups and target FSWs who are 30 years or older, and soliciting from homes to sustain consistent condom use across all FSWs.","Mahapatra, Bidhubhusan; Walia, Monika; Patel, Sangram Kishor; Battala, Madhusudana; Mukherjee, Saradiya; Patel, Prachi; Subramanium, Balakrishnan; Atmavilas, Yamini; Saggurti, Niranjan",PLoS One,,477

Spending more time outdoors can prevent myopia but the long-term association between this exposure and myopia has not been well characterised. We investigated the relationship between time spent outdoors in childhood, adolescence and young adulthood and risk of myopia in young adulthood. The Kidskin Young Adult Myopia Study (KYAMS) was a follow-up of the Kidskin Study, a sun exposure-intervention study of 1776 children aged 6-12 years. Myopia status was assessed in 303 (17.6%) KYAMS participants (aged 25-30 years) and several subjective and objective measures of time spent outdoors were collected in childhood (8-12 years) and adulthood. Index measures of total, childhood and recent time spent outdoors were developed using confirmatory factor analysis. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between a 0.1-unit change in the time outdoor indices and risk of myopia after adjusting for sex, education, outdoor occupation, parental myopia, parental education, ancestry and Kidskin Study intervention group. Spending more time outdoors during childhood was associated with reduced risk of myopia in young adulthood (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69, 0.98).

In this cohort study, 17,200 female Swedish hemangioma patients with 1,079 breast cancer cases between 1958-2013, exposed by ionizing radiation in infancy, were linked to their first-degree relatives. The association between FBCH and radiation-induced breast cancer risk was assessed. Further, the relevance for breast cancer radiotherapy and mammography screening was evaluated. On average, the radiation-induced excess relative (ERR) and absolute risk (EAR) at age 50 was ERR = 0.51 Gy-1 (95%CI: 0.33; 0.71), and EAR = 10.8 (104 PYR Gy)-1 (95%CI: 7.0; 14.6). Radiation risk was higher by a factor of 2.7 (95%CI: 1.0; 4.8, P = 0.05) if one first-degree relative was affected with breast cancer. For whole breast standard radiotherapy at age 40 with a contralateral breast dose of 0.72 Gy, the 20-year radiation-related excess contralateral breast cancer risk was estimated to increase from 0.6% for women without FBCH to 1.7% with FBCH. For biennial mammography screening program between 40-74 years of age, radiation risk until age 80 would increase from 0.11% for women without FBCH to 0.29% with FBCH.","Eidemüller, Markus; Holmberg, Erik; Lundell, Marie; Karlsson, Per",Am. j. epidemiol,,477

Nevertheless, few data are available regarding their force-generating capacities. The objective of this study was to provide a model of the force-length-activation relationships of the hand extensors using non-invasive methods. The extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) were studied as representative of wrist and finger extensors. Ten participants performed isometric extension force-varying contractions in different postures on an ergometer recording resultant moment. The joint angle, the myotendinous junction displacement and activation were synchronously tracked using motion capture, ultrasound and electromyography. Muscle force was estimated via a musculoskeletal model using the measured joint angle and moment. The force-length-activation relationship was then obtained by fitting a force-length model at different activation levels to the measured data. The obtained relationships agreed with previously reported data regarding muscle architecture, sarcomere length and activation-dependent shift of optimal length. Muscle forces estimated from kinematics and electromyography using the force-length-activation relationships were comparable, below 15% differences, to those estimated from moment via the musculoskeletal model. The obtained quantitative data provides a new insight into the different muscle mechanics of finger and wrist extensors. Graphical abstract By combining in vivo data (kinematics, dynamometry, electromyography, ultrasonography) during isometric force-varying contractions with musculoskeletal modelling, the force-length-activation relationships of both finger and wrist extensors were obtained.

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: A 34-bed ICU of a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: The first 44 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients were compared with a historical control group of 39 consecutive acute respiratory distress syndrome patients admitted to the ICU just before the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Obesity was the most frequent comorbidity exhibited by coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 32, 73% vs n = 11, 28% in controls; p < 0.001). Despite the same severity of illness and level of hypoxemia at admission, coronavirus disease 2019 patients failed more high flow oxygen via nasal cannula challenges (n = 16, 100% vs n = 5, 45% in controls; p = 0.002), were more often intubated (n = 44, 100% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p < 0.001) and paralyzed (n = 34, 77% vs n = 3, 14% in controls; p < 0.001), required higher level of positive end-expiratory pressure (15 vs 8 cm H2O in controls; p < 0.001), more prone positioning (n = 33, 75% vs n = 6, 27% in controls; p < 0.001), more dialysis (n = 16, 36% vs n = 3, 8% in controls; p = 0.003), more hemodynamic support by vasopressors (n = 36, 82% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p = 0.001), and had more often a prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation (n = 28, 64% vs n = 10, 26% in controls; p < 0.01) resulting in a more frequent resort to tracheostomy (n = 18, 40.9% vs n = 2, 9% in controls; p = 0.01). However, an intensive management requiring more staff per patient for positioning coronavirus disease 2019 subjects (6 [5-7] vs 5 [4-5] in controls; p < 0.001) yielded the same ICU survival rate in the two groups (n = 34, 77% vs n = 29, 74% in controls; p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: In its most severe form, coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia striked preferentially the vulnerable obese population, evolved toward a multiple organ failure, required prolonged mechanical ventilatory support, and resulted in a high workload for the caregivers.","Lemyze, Malcolm; Courageux, Nathan; Maladobry, Thomas; Arumadura, Clothilde; Pauquet, Philippe; Orfi, Annis; Komorowski, Matthieu; Mallat, Jihad; Granier, Maxime",Crit Care Med,,477

In this Review, we discuss the hepatotropism of SARS-CoV-2, including the differential expression of viral receptors on liver cell types, and we describe the liver histology features present in patients with COVID-19. We also provide an overview of the pattern and relevance of abnormal liver biochemistry during COVID-19 and present the possible underlying direct and indirect mechanisms for liver injury. Furthermore, large international cohorts have been able to characterize the disease course of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis have particularly high rates of hepatic decompensation and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection and we outline hypotheses to explain these findings, including the possible role of cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. This finding contrasts with outcome data in pharmacologically immunosuppressed patients after liver transplantation who seem to have comparatively better outcomes from COVID-19 than those with advanced liver disease. Finally, we discuss the approach to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with cirrhosis and after liver transplantation and predict how changes in social behaviours and clinical care pathways during the pandemic might lead to increased liver disease incidence and severity.This Review provides mechanistic and clinical insights into COVID-19 in the context of liver disease, discussing the potential underlying biology and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pre-existing liver conditions.

601469,SARS-CoV-2 infection in very preterm pregnancy: experiences from two cases,2020-05-15,"Abstract Cyclopentenylcytosine (Ce-Cyd) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active against DNA viruses [herpes (cytomegalo), pox (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [picorna (polio, Coxsackie, rhino), toga (Sindbis, Semliki forest), corona], (−)RNA viruses [orthomyxo (influenza), paramyxo (parainfluenza, measles), arena (Junin, Tacaribe), rhabdo (vesicular stomatitis)] and (±)RNA viruses (reo). Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases.","de Clercq, Erik; Murase, Junichi; Marquez, Victor E.",Biochemical Pharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1710119/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000629529190120T; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000629529190120T,477
602269,Caution Advised When Considering “Exceptional” Extended or Single Dose COVID-19 Vaccination Strategies,2021-02-19,"The emergence of the highly infectious novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global COVID-19 pandemic. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, worldwide healthcare systems have been severely challenged. The rapid and explosive surge of positive cases has significantly increased the demand for medical care. Herein we provide a perspective on the role dentists can play in voluntary medical assistance and future preparedness for a similar pandemic. Though dentists and physicians have different scopes of practice, their trainings share many similarities. Hence, dental professionals, with their knowledge of basic human science and sterile surgical techniques, are an invaluable resource in the COVID-19 pandemic response. Overall, it is commendable that many dentists have risen to the challenge in the fight against COVID-19. For example, in Singapore, National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) deployed dental clinicians as well as volunteers from research laboratories to screen for suspected cases, provide consultations as well as conduct swabbing operations. Dental practice will be considerably changed in the post-COVID-19 era. There is a greater need to have refresher courses for practicing dentists on new infection control strategies. Moreover, the curriculum in dental schools should be expanded to include competencies in pandemic and disaster relief. In addition, voluntary medical work should be made a part of the community dentistry curriculum. This volunteerism will leave a positive impact on developing the careers of young dentists. Hence, the contribution of dentists beyond dental practice in this pandemic situation will be appreciated by future generations.","Seneviratne, Chaminda Jayampath; Lau, Matthew Wen Jian; Goh, Bee Tin",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117825/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00566,477

METHODS: Patients were randomly selected from a COVID-19 database maintained by the Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. All patients were aged ≥60 years, had reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19, and were registered in the database during March 2020 to July 2020. Medical and sociodemographic characteristics were retrieved from the database. Additional data were collected by telephone interviews conducted by trained health professionals. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between patient characteristics and the risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 613 included patients (51.1% females), more than half (57.3%) were between 60 to 69 years of age, and 53% (324/613) had been hospitalized. The independent predictors of hospitalization included age ≥65 years (OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.66–3.33, P < 0.001), having more than one comorbidity (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.09–2.20, P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09–2.11, P = 0.01), hypertension (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.007–1.97, P = 0.04), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.87, 95% CI: 1.41–10.58, P = 0.008), and history of hospital admission within the preceding year (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.11–2.55, P = 0.013). Risk of hospitalization was lower in males (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43–0.90, P = 0.01) and in patients co-living with health care workers (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43–0.96, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with higher risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization should be used in prioritizing older adults’ admission. Future studies with more robust designs should be conducted to examine the risk of COVID-19-associated illness severity and mortality.","Alamri, Fahad; Alsofayan, Yousef; AlRuthia, Yazed; Alahmari, Ahmed; Almuzaini, Yasir; Abo Gazalah, Fouad; Alradini, Faten; Alaama, Tareef; Khan, Anas",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692640/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s294786,477
612931,Emerging issues in COVID-19 vaccination in Tropical Areas: Impact of the Immune Response against Helminths in Endemic Areas,2021-05-27,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment for COVID-19 was ambiguous in the beginning of the pandemic. At that time, the conventional medical system was grappling to cope with the rapidly spreading pandemic. The potential of Ayurveda, one of the branches of traditional Indian medicine (TIM), with a 5000 year old history, employing medicines derived from plants and other natural sources, against COVID-19 has been explored through a comparative retrospective open-label study. METHODS: Reported here are the remedial effects of Ayurvedic medicines alone or in combination with Allopathic treatment on 59 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients, across multiple COVID-19 care centers in Ahmedabad, India. The patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection through RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. With informed consents from the patients, the sourced data was divided into ‘Allopathic and Ayurvedic’ [AlloAyur] (n = 41) and ‘Ayurvedic only’[Ayur] (n = 18) groups, based on the type of treatment the patients decided to receive, that is Ayurvedic medicines with Allopathic treatment or Ayurvedic medicines alone, respectively. Ayurvedic medicines included oral doses and nasal drops; the dosage and regime were decided based on the recommendations from Ayurvedic texts. The Allopathic medicines included Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen was also administered when necessary, by the attending physician. The patients were observed for symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Primary outcome of this study was the symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Data collected over a period of two months, showed that more patients exhibited symptomatic relief in Ayur goup (83.33%) than in the AlloAyur group (48.78%) within the first 13 days of treatment. No visible adverse effects were observed. This indicated faster and safe symptomatic resolution among those treated with Ayurvedic medicines alone. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving only Ayurvedic medicines on average were symptomatically relieved faster than those receiving Allopathic and Ayurvedic medicines together.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Bhatt, Aarti Ben; Singh, Pratima; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",J Herb Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055580/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2021.100472; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221080332100052X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221080332100052X?v=s5,477
624267,"Maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of large series of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies in peripartum period: a single-center prospective comparative study",2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Domestic violence is a common health problem that often affects women’s mental health. Although domestic violence may not be reported during quarantine, it may increase due to increased restrictions. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to develop and validate the Domestic Violence during Quarantine Scale (DVQS) on a sample from Iran. METHODS: Two hundred and three Iranians participated in this study and completed online questionnaires. This cross-sectional and methodological study consisted of two phases. In the first phase, item pool generation and questionnaire design was carried out through literature review. In the second phase, psychometric properties were assessed via an exploratory factors analysis (EFA). Internal consistency was examined by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonalds’ Omega. RESULTS: In the EFA, three factors, including humiliation (seven items), threatening (six items), and restriction (four items) were extracted that together explained 64.4% of the variance of domestic violence during quarantine. Using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, the internal consistency of humiliation, threatening, and restriction was found to be 0.90, 0.896, and 0.76 respectively, and an alpha of 0.927 was found for the total scale. In addition, using McDonalds’ Omega, internal consistencies of 0.82, 0.84, and 0.78 were found for the three factors respectively. CONCLUSION: The DVQS has good validity and reliability; therefore, it can be used in future studies.","Gheshlagh, Reza Ghanei; Abdi, Kamel; Ebadi, Abbas; Moradveisi, Borhan; Hosseini, Seyedeh Esmat; Zahednezhad, Hosein",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01596-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123707/,477
