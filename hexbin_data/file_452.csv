Therefore, training epidemiologists in infectious diseases control is of crucial importance. The German Postgraduate training in Applied Epidemiology (PAE) at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) are striving to meet these challenges. Currently, 27 and 12 persons of German origin have joined PAE and EPIET, respectively. A total of 17 out of the 36 alumni started working at the RKI, regional or local German health authorities after completing their training. Since 2006, the number of yearly admitted fellows increased from 3 to 6 in PAE, and 9 to 19 in EPIET and 5 state health departments have been added as training sites. The collaboration between EPIET and PAE has been strengthened and diversified in recent years. Alumni of these programs will play a key role in the control of infectious diseases in Germany and Europe.","Bremer, Viviane; Alpers, Katharina; Krause, Gérard",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,452,1

Occasionally, the opinion was also expressed that new types of infectious diseases could no longer be expected. However, a more detailed analysis of the state of infectious diseases yields quite a different picture. A variety of new infectious diseases has clinically been defined over the last few decades. New viruses, bacteria, and parasites with pathogenic potential for humans have been detected and well-known microorganisms have spread beyond their original geographic areas. Infectious agents, in particular viruses, permanently alter their genomes and may thus gain new clinical relevance. This article demonstrates that primarily the behavior of man influenced the nature and distribution of infectious diseases in the past and will affect the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","Kurth, R.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,452,1

Here, we review important evolutionary aspects of HIV infection, highlighting the concept of selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the smallest scale, a single cell may be infected by multiple virions competing for intracellular resources. Recombination and phenotypic mixing introduce novel evolutionary dynamics. As the virus spreads between cells in an infected individual, it continually evolves to circumvent the immune system. We discuss evolutionary mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Viral spread throughout the human population can lead to changes in virulence and the transmission of immune-evading variation. HIV emerged as a human pathogen due to selection occurring between different species, adapting from related viruses of primates. HIV also evolves resistance to antiretroviral drugs within a single infected host, and we explore the possibility for the spread of these strains between hosts, leading to a drug-resistant epidemic. We investigate the role of latency, drug-protected compartments, and direct cell-to-cell transmission on viral evolution. The introduction of an HIV vaccine may select for viral variants that escape vaccine control, both within an individual and throughout the population. Due to the strong selective pressure exerted by HIV-induced morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, the human population itself may be co-evolving in response to the HIV pandemic. Throughout the paper, we focus on trade-offs between costs and benefits that constrain viral evolution and accentuate how selection pressures differ at different levels of selection.

Zimmermann",10.101736,2.5549824,2014-05-03,"Innate and acquired immunity plays a pivotal role in the host defense response. Pain, stress, necrotic tissue and invading microorganisms are known modulators of the complex immune response of patients undergoing major surgery. Anaesthesia itself or perioperative interventions of the anaesthesiologist may substantially alter the immune function with potential impact on the postoperative course. For instance, transfusion of allogenic blood and administration of dopamine or metoclopramide may interfer with immunity. Stress and pain are associated with immune tolerance, increased susceptibility to infection and tumor spreading in animal models. Thus, anaesthesia may – through modulation of the neurohumoral stress response – indirectly affect immunity of the surgical patient. In particular epidural anaesthesia and/or administration of epidural or spinal opioids seem to attenuate the stress response with beneficial effects on cellular and humoral immunity. In addition, anaesthetics, such as etomidate, propofol, or thiopentone and opioid analgesics may directly affect function of immune competent cells. However, these actions may only be apparent with high or supraclinical concentrations and/or long-term exposure. Regarding the latter, evidence suggests that long-term sedation using thiopentone in neurosurgical patients is paralleled by infectious complications in a dose-dependent manner. At present, no data are available regarding the significance of the observed alterations associated with various anaesthetic procedures of the incidence of postoperative complications associated with impaired immunity, such as infection or metastatic spreading in oncological surgery.","Bauer, M.; Rensing, H.; Ziegenfuß, T.",Anaesthesist,452,1

In order to account for such apparently self-defeating behaviour, this article adopts an open systems view of IOs and identifies trans-organisational coalitions as important agents of IO change. I argue that subunit dynamics rather than systemic conditions drive IO behaviour, in particular where member states’ material power and their formal control of organisational veto positions do not coincide. This approach will be used to retrace the changes in subunit coalitions that drove WHO's erratic HIV/AIDS programme and thus to solve this puzzle of ‘mission shrink’.

We further provide evidence on the importance of spatial spillovers in GDP affecting the burden of hunger.

Women with a higher body mass index (BMI), who comprise about 50% of the population, are at increased risk of poorer breastfeeding practices and are a population who would benefit from breastfeeding. METHODS: This protocol is for a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of perinatal breastfeeding support among primiparous women with a BMI >25 kg/m(2), using a previously-tested, multi-component intervention. The primary outcome is any breastfeeding at 3 months. The intervention will support mothers and their partners and spans from late pregnancy to six weeks postpartum. Intervention components include group antenatal breastfeeding education, individual face-to-face education in the immediate postnatal period, professional support to six weeks’ postpartum and weekly phone calls in the immediate postpartum period from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). The intervention will target attitudes towards breastfeeding, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and subjective norms around infant feeding with the aim to normalise the behaviour. RESULTS: We anticipate that the intervention will be well-accepted and feasible to carry out within four maternity units in the East of Ireland. Furthermore, essential formative qualitative work has been conducted to inform the intervention design and to ensure that it is contextually appropriate. CONCLUSION: The proposed intervention will be invaluable to policy-makers in providing insights into what specific interventions are effective in improving breastfeeding rates for women with a raised BMI.","O'Reilly, Sharleen L.; O'Brien, Eileen C.; McGuinness, Denise; Mehegan, John; Coughlan, Barbara; O'Brien, Denise; Szafranska, Marcelina; Callanan, Sophie; Hughes, Shenda; Conway, Marie C.; Brosnan, Mary; Sheehy, Lucille; Murtagh, Rosie; O'Hagan, Lorraine; Murray, Stephanie; Scallon, Charmaine; Dunn, Elizabeth; Power, Paula; Woodcock, Marie; Carroll, Amy; Corbett, Marie; Walsh, Michelle; Keogh, Regina; McAuliffe, Fionnuala M.",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,452,1

Previous vaccination efforts with whole cell inactivated bacteria or surface isolated proteins confer protection but can produce a reactogenic immune responses. Thereby a protective vaccine that does not cause aberrant immune reactions is required. The critical role of T-cell immunity in control of C. burnetii has been made clear, since either CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cells can empower clearance. The purpose of this study was to identify C. burnetii proteins bearing epitopes that interact with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) from multiple host species (human, mouse, and cattle). RESULTS: Of the annotated 1815 proteins from the Nine Mile Phase I (RSA 493) assembly, 402 proteins were removed from analysis due to a lack of inter-isolate conservation. An additional 391 proteins were eliminated from assessment to avoid potential autoimmune responses due to the presence of host homology. We analyzed the remaining 1022 proteins for their ability to produce peptides that bind MHCI or MHCII. MHCI and MHCII predicted epitopes were filtered and compared between species yielding 777 MHCI epitopes and 453 MHCII epitopes. These epitopes were further examined for presentation by both MHCI and MHCII, and for proteins that contained multiple epitopes. There were 31 epitopes that overlapped positionally between MHCI and MHCII across host species. Of these, there were 9 epitopes represented within proteins containing ≥ 5 total epitopes, where an additional 24 proteins were also epitope dense. In all, 55 proteins were found to contain high scoring T-cell epitopes. Besides the well-studied protein Com1, most identified proteins were novel when compared to previously studied vaccine candidates. CONCLUSION: These data represent the first proteome-wide evaluation of C. burnetii peptide epitopes. Furthermore, the inclusion of human, mouse, and bovine data capture a range of hosts for this zoonotic pathogen plus an important model organism. This work provides new vaccine targets for future vaccination efforts and enhances opportunities for selecting multiple T-cell epitope types to include within a vaccine.

A number of risk factors, especially infectious agents can accelerate the progression of meningitis. As viruses probably account for most cases of meningitis, the diagnosis of them can reduce antibiotic prescriptions. Among various types of infectious diseases, the relationship between two important virus families, including Picornaviridae and Herpesviridae, and meningitis has attracted attraction. METHODS: In this study, one hundred and two samples were collected from patients who experienced symptoms, such as the loss of consciousness, seizures, muscle weakness, fever, headache, rash, and severe dementia, between November 2018 and September 2019. After RNA and DNA extraction, the prevalence of Enterovirus (EV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2), and Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was evaluated using PCR, multiplex PCR, and nested PCR. RESULTS: Results indicated that there were two VZV DNA‐positive specimens, while six and five samples were infected with HSV‐1 and EBV, respectively. CONCLUSION: We reported that the prevalence of EBV, HSV‐1, and VZV in patients, suffering from meningitis cannot be ignored; however, further investigation is needed.","Tavakolian, Shaian; Goudarzi, Hossein; Eslami, Gita; Darazam, Ilad Alavi; Dehghan, Golnaz; Faghihloo, Ebrahim",J Clin Lab Anal,452,1

However, few have focused on maternal and primary health indicators and its influence on adolescent contraceptive use. This paper assesses whether maternal mortality rates, antenatal care visits, and primary healthcare coverage are associated with pill and condom use among female adolescents in Brazil. METHODS: We used data from the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA), a national, school-based cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil. A subsample of all female adolescents who had ever had sexual intercourse and were living in one of the 26 State capitals and the Federal District was selected (n = 7415). Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models were estimated to examine the effect of contextual variables on pill and condom use. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of female adolescents reported using pill while 21.9% reported using condom during the last sexual intercourse. Adolescents living in municipalities with low maternal mortality and high antenatal care coverage were significantly more likely to use pill during the last sexual intercourse compared to those from municipalities with high maternal mortality and low antenatal care coverage. Primary healthcare coverage (proportion of the population covered by primary healthcare teams) was not significantly associated with either condom or pill use during the last sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that promoting the use of pill among female adolescents may require approaches to strengthen healthcare systems rather than those focused solely on individual attributes.

Antimigraine medications such as dihydroergotamine (DHE) and triptans have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in individual studies but lack of consensus remains. We compared the risk of prematurity, low birth weight (LBW), major congenital malformations (MCM), and spontaneous abortions (SA) associated with gestational use of DHE or triptans. Three cohort and one nested-case–control analyses were conducted within the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort to assess the risk of prematurity, LBW, MCM, and SA. Exposure was defined dichotomously as use of DHE or triptan during pregnancy. Generalized estimation equations were built to quantify the associations, adjusting for potential confounders. 233,900 eligible pregnancies were included in the analyses on prematurity, LBW, and MCM; 29,104 cases of SA were identified. Seventy-eight subjects (0.03%) were exposed to DHE and 526 (0.22%) to triptans. Adjusting for potential confounders, DHE and triptans were associated with increased risks of prematurity, LBW, MCM, and SA but not all estimates were statistically significant. DHE was associated with the risk of prematurity (aRR: 4.12, 95% CI 1.21–13.99); triptans were associated with the risk of SA (aOR: 1.63, 95% CI 1.34–1.98). After considering maternal migraine, all antimigraine specific medications increased the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes, but estimates were unstable.","Bérard, Anick; Strom, Shannon; Zhao, Jin-Ping; Kori, Shashi; Albrecht, Detlef",Sci Rep,452,1

Fölsch,10.082473,2.236793,2013-05-26,"Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, accounting for up to 75% of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics. In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.","Labib, Bisant A; Minhas, Bhawanjot K; Chigbu, DeGaulle I",Clin Ophthalmol,452,1

In addition to physiological factors, women’s vulnerability to HIV transmission is primarily fuelled by gender inequality and gender-based discrimination and violence. Therefore, women’s vulnerability to HIV transmission is closely linked to issues of empowerment and gender-based power relations. Even with this realization however, women are still sometimes overlooked in many HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment campaigns, such as those in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and responses to HIV/AIDS do not always actively seek to empower women. Therefore, a deficiency in women’s human security increases their HIV/AIDS vulnerability. This chapter examines the intersection of gender inequality and HIV vulnerability as it applies to women in the PRC. The unequal status of many women in China, and the privileged position accorded to Chinese men, strongly indicates that Chinese women face a heightened vulnerability to HIV transmission. While many of these vulnerabilities are similar to women elsewhere in the world and certainly are not unique to China, by overlooking the many social, cultural, economic and political factors that contribute to HIV/AIDS vulnerability and transmission of the virus, particularly those faced by women, China has a long way to go before Chinese women are protected from HIV transmission. Given that HIV/AIDS heightens human insecurity, the stage is set for Chinese women (and men) to face an insecure future if the Chinese government does not fully implement international best practice, meaning a gendered response, into its overall HIV/AIDS response.","Hayes, Anna Marie",Human Security,452,1

The results revealed that the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon positon have widely usage in the codon of UL16 gene of DPV. The ENC-GC(3s) plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in UL16 gene of herpesviruses was constrained by G+C content at the third codon position. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that DPV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses which further clustered into Alphaherpesvirinae. Furthermore the ORF of DPV UL16 gene has sequential rare codons. There were 21 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with Escherichia coli, 19 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with yeast, and 20 between DPV and Human.

Increasing evidence also suggests that cancer-causing pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and human papilloma virus (HPV) may induce oncogenesis by disrupting cell polarity. This is mainly achieved through their ability to deregulate the function of cell polarity components and/or regulators. Hence cell polarity represents the first line of defence against infection. Interestingly, EGFR/RAS oncogenic signals also induce cancer cell invasion by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Since the loss of cell polarity is a prerequisition of EMT, cell polarity also represents the last line of defence against cancer cell invasion. As such we argue that cell polarity may be a key defence mechanism against infection and cancer cell invasion. The potential role of cell polarity as a gatekeeper against cancer through its ability to regulate asymmetric cell division and tumour suppression has been discussed in a number of recent reviews. In this review we will focus on the role of cell polarity as a potential target of infection and cancer cell invasion.","Wang, Yihua; Lu, Xin",Cell Polarity 2,452,1

Until there is more empirical evidence for specific mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to infectious disease, there would be little real understanding of the extent to which evidence deriving from present work generalizes to other disease models.

One key task in data integration is the calculation of similarities between records to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same real-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the owners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or share their data with other organisations to allow such similarity calculations. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving encoding technique that can be used to securely calculate similarities between sensitive values held in different databases. Our technique uses two-step hashing to encode values into an integer set representation that provides strong privacy guarantees and allows accurate similarity calculations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy and privacy of our encoding technique, and conduct an empirical study on large real databases containing several millions records.

Centralized and federated machine learning solutions represent the predominant way of providing smart services for users. However, moving data to central location for analysis causes not only many privacy concerns, but also communication overhead. Therefore, in certain situations machine learning models need to be trained in a collaborative and decentralized manner, similar to the way the data is originally generated without requiring any central authority for data or model aggregation. This paper presents a decentralized and adaptive k-means algorithm that clusters data from multiple sources organized in peer-to-peer networks. Our algorithm allows peers to reach an approximation of the global model without sharing any raw data. Most importantly, we address the challenge of decentralized clustering with skewed non-IID data and asynchronous computations by integrating HyperLogLog counters with k-means algorithm. Furthermore, our clustering algorithm allows nodes to individually determine the number of clusters that fits their local data. Results using synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized k-means algorithms achieving accuracy gain that is up-to 36%.","Soliman, Amira; Girdzijauskas, Sarunas; Bouguelia, Mohamed-Rafik; Pashami, Sepideh; Nowaczyk, Slawomir",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,452,28

Second, forward computation and backward propagation are performed in a supervised fashion to make the learned features more discriminative. Finally, local features containing appearance information is extracted and integrated into α-MI for achieving multi-channel registration. The proposed method has been evaluated on cardiac cine-MRI data from 100 patients.

Fracture patterns, concomitant injuries, procedures, and outcomes were compared between patients that suffered a high-energy mechanism (HEM: motor vehicle crash, bicycle crash, auto versus pedestrian, falls from height > 20 feet) and those that suffered a low-energy mechanism (LEM: assault, ground-level falls) of injury. RESULTS: FFs occurred in 123 patients, 25 from an HEM and 98 from an LEM. Rates of Le Fort (HEM 12% vs. LEM 3%, P = 0.10), mandible (HEM 20% vs. LEM 38%, P = 0.11), midface (HEM 84% vs. LEM 67%, P = 0.14), and upper face (HEM 24% vs. LEM 13%, P = 0.217) fractures did not significantly differ between the HEM and LEM groups, nor did facial operative rates (HEM 28% vs. LEM 40%, P = 0.36). FFs after an HEM event were associated with increased Injury Severity Scores (HEM 16.8 vs. LEM 7.5, P <0.001), ICU admittance (HEM 60% vs. LEM 13.3%, P <0.001), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (HEM 52% vs. LEM 15%, P <0.001), cervical spine fractures (HEM 12% vs. LEM 0%, P = 0.008), truncal/lower extremity injuries (HEM 60% vs. LEM 6%, P <0.001), neurosurgical procedures for the management of ICH (HEM 54% vs. LEM 36%, P = 0.003), and decreased Glasgow Coma Score on arrival (HEM 11.7 vs. LEM 14.2, P <0.001). CONCLUSION: FFs after HEM events were associated with severe and multifocal injuries. FFs after LEM events were associated with ICH, concussions, and cervical spine fractures. Mechanism-based screening strategies will allow for the appropriate detection and management of injuries that occur concomitant to FFs. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective cohort study.

This paper describes the phenomenon of uncertainty in the face of technological megatrends and challenges associated with them. The article focuses on the analysis of the uncertainty in one of the most important technology trends – the Internet of Things (IoT) – on the example of Healthcare. The right decisions are not always equivalent to good results. Sometimes, the decision taken in accordance with general rules brings worse results than the one who breaks them. Such a situation is possible as a result of the uncertainty accompanying the predictions of the future. In this article the concept of the IoT is treated as a big, complex, dynamic system with specific characteristics, dimensions. structures and behaviors. The aim of the article is to analyze the factors that may determine the uncertainty and ambiguity of such systems in the context of the development of Healthcare, and recommendations are made for future research directions.","Tissaoui, Anis; Saidi, Malak",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,452,1

Tetanus, gas gangrene, wound infections were common and often fatal. Abdominal wounds were especially a problem: upon entering the war the commanders of all medical services ordered to avoid surgery, based on dismal experiences of previous wars. Surgical community divided into non-operative and operative treatment supporters. The problem seemed mainly organizational, as the wounded were rescued after many hours and treated by non-specialist doctors, in inadequate frontline settings or evacuated back with further delay of treatment. During initial neutrality, Italian Academics closely followed the debate, with different positions. Many courses and publications on war surgery flourished. Among the interventionists, Baldo Rossi, to provide a setting adequate to major operations close to the frontline, with trained surgeons and adequate instruments, realized for the Milano Red Cross three fully equipped, mobile surgical hospitals mounted on trucks, with an operating cabin-tent, with warming, illumination and sterilizing devices, post-operative tents and a radiological unit. Chiefs of the army approved the project and implemented seven similar units, called army surgical ambulances, each run by a distinguished surgeon. Epic history and challenges of the mobile units at the frontline, brilliant results achieved on war wounds and epidemics are described. After the war they were considered among the most significant novelties of military medical services. Parallels with present scenarios in war and peace are outlined.","Vergani, Contardo; Venturi, Marco",Updates Surg,452,1

ReA is solely established using differential clinical diagnosis of the patient cohorts, where pathogenic triggers linked to enteric and urogenital microorganisms e.g. Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Chlamydia have been reported. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), an idiopathic enteric disorder co-evolved and attuned to present gut microbiome dysbiosis, can be correlated to the genesis of enteropathic arthropathies like ReA. Gut microbes symbolically modulate immune system homeostasis and are elementary for varied disease patterns in autoimmune disorders. The gut-microbiota axis structured on the core host-microbe interactions execute an imperative role in discerning the etiopathogenesis of ReA and IBD. This study predicts the molecular signatures for ReA with co-evolved IBD through the enveloped host-microbe interactions and microbe-microbe ‘interspecies communication’, using synonymous gene expression data for selective microbes. We have utilized a combinatorial approach that have concomitant in-silico work-pipeline and experimental validation to corroborate the findings. In-silico analysis involving text mining, metabolic network reconstruction, simulation, filtering, host-microbe interaction, docking and molecular mimicry studies results in robust drug target/s and biomarker/s for co-evolved IBD and ReA. Cross validation of the target/s or biomarker/s was done by targeted gene expression analysis following a non-probabilistic convenience sampling. Studies were performed to substantiate the host-microbe disease network consisting of protein-marker-symptom/disease-pathway-drug associations resulting in possible identification of vital drug targets, biomarkers, pathways and inhibitors for IBD and ReA. Our study identified Na((+))/H((+)) anti-porter (NHAA) and Kynureninase (KYNU) to be robust early and essential host-microbe interacting targets for IBD co-evolved ReA. Other vital host-microbe interacting genes, proteins, pathways and drugs include Adenosine Deaminase (ADA), Superoxide Dismutase 2 (SOD2), Catalase (CAT), Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme (ACE), carbon metabolism (folate biosynthesis) and methotrexate. These can serve as potential prognostic/theranostic biomarkers and signatures that can be extrapolated to stratify ReA and related autoimmunity patient cohorts for further pilot studies.","Verma, Anukriti; Sharda, Shivani; Rathi, Bhawna; Somvanshi, Pallavi; Pandey, Bimlesh Dhar",Sci Rep,452,1

Based on the structural balance theory and system dynamics, the research finds that transitive triads and cyclic triads in the five-phase system are both imbalanced. The integration of these differentiated triads comprises of a balanced intermediate form in the shape of quadrangular cycles. These cycles serve as microstructures of the five-phase system, due to the inherent balancing feedback mechanism, and support the generation of resultants. The alternation of quadrangular cycles drives the spiraling development of the whole system. By orderly and regular interweaving of signed directed links, the research provides a holistic, process-oriented demonstration for the development processes of COVID-19. It clarifies that the essence of the five-phase system is phase-transition processes with the quadrangular cycle as carrier and supporter, rather than the static aggregation of five elements. The research deepens the understanding of system nonlinearity by visualizing the circular causality and promotes the academic dialogue between the Western process theory and the Chinese inherited notion of the five-phase system.","Wang, Fengbin; Zhang, Xue",Front,452,1

Currently, vaccination is one of the main measures to control these two diseases; however, there are few combination vaccines that can prevent these two diseases. To determine the effect of combination immunization, we developed capsid-derived (Cap) virus-like particles (VLPs) of PCV2 and a new recombinant chimera composed of the P97R1, P46, and P42 antigens of Mhp. Then we investigated the immune responses induced by the immunization with this combination vaccine in mice and piglets. RESULTS: The high level antibodies against three protein antigens (P97R1, P46, and P42 of Mhp) were produced after immunization, up to or higher than 1:400,000; the antibody levels in Pro group continuously increased throughout the 42 days for all the antigens tested. The lymphocyte proliferative response in PCV2 group was stronger than that in PBS, VP, Mhp CV in mice. The antibody levels for Cap remained stable and reached the peak at 35 DAI. The IFN-γ and IL-4 in sera were significantly enhanced in the Pro group than that in the negative control-VP group on Day 14 and 28 post-the first immunization in piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Above all, the combination immunization could induce humoral and cellular immune responses against all four antigens in mice and piglets. Therefore, our approach is a simple and effective vaccination strategy to protect pigs against MPS and PCVD/PCVAD.","Tao, Yu; Yang, Rui; Shu, Jianhong; Zheng, Wenqian; Chen, Jian; Wu, Yuehong; He, Yulong",BMC Vet Res,452,1

We surveyed providers of children’s surgical care working in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to understand their perspectives on surgical management in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they were subsequently modifying their surgical care practices. METHODS: A survey of children’s surgery providers in LMICs was performed. Respondents reported how their perioperative practice had changed in response to COVID-19. They were also presented with 26 specific procedures and asked which of these procedures they were allowed to perform and which they felt they should be allowed to perform. Changes in surgical practice reported by respondents were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: A total of 132 responses were obtained from 120 unique institutions across 30 LMICs. 117/120 institutions (97.5%) had issued formal guidance on delaying or limiting elective children’s surgical procedures. Facilities in LICs were less likely to have issued guidance on elective surgery compared with middle-income facilities (82% in LICs vs 99% in lower middle-income countries and 100% in upper middle-income countries, p=0.036). Although 122 (97%) providers believed cases should be limited during a global pandemic, there was no procedure where more than 61% of providers agreed cases should be delayed or canceled. CONCLUSIONS: There is little consensus on which procedures should be limited or delayed among LMIC providers. Expansion of testing capacity and local, context-specific guidelines may be a better strategy than international consensus, given the disparities in availability of preoperative testing and the lack of consensus towards which procedures should be delayed.","Truche, Paul; Bowder, Alexis; Lalla, Amber Trujillo; Crum, Robert; Botelho, Fabio; Rice, Henry Elliot; Lopes, Bellisa Caldas; Greenberg, Sarah; Evans, Faye; Meara, John Gerard; Ameh, Emmanuel Adoyi; Mooney, David Patrick",,452,1

Moreover, general anaesthesia may contribute to serious conditions or adverse events such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium. To understand the basic mechanisms of general anaesthesia, this project aims to study and compare possible de novo neuroplastic changes induced by two commonly used types of general anaesthesia, i.e. inhalation anaesthesia by sevoflurane and intravenously administered anaesthesia by propofol. In addition, we wish to to explore possible associations between neuroplastic changes, neuropsychological adverse effects and subjective changes in fatigue and well-being. METHODS: This is a randomised, participant- and assessor-blinded, cross-over clinical trial. Thirty healthy volunteers (male:female ratio 1:1) will be randomised to general anaesthesia by either sevoflurane or propofol. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain will be performed before and after general anaesthesia and repeated after 1 and 8 days. Each magnetic resonance imaging session will be accompanied by cognitive testing and questionnaires on fatigue and well-being. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, the volunteers will receive the other type of anaesthetic (sevoflurane or propofol), followed by the same series of tests. Primary outcomes: changes in T1-weighted 3D anatomy and diffusion tensor imaging. Secondary outcomes: changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, fatigue, well-being, cognitive function, correlations between magnetic resonance imaging findings and the clinical outcomes (questionnaires and cognitive function). Exploratory outcomes: changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, lactate, and response to visual stimuli.

Through measuring the length of the liquid phase of the microfluidics in the capillary at a given time, the concentration of the ALP could be quantified with the naked eye. Since ALP is widely applied as a signal reporter for immunoassays, the AHCS could easily accommodate conventional immune sensing platforms. We justify the practicality of AHCS with hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum samples and got comparable results with commercialized immunoassay.

Carr.) and its hybrid are economically important coniferous trees widely grown in the Northern Hemisphere. Ground-level ozone (O(3)) concentrations have increased since the pre-industrial era, and research projects showed that Japanese larch is susceptible to elevated O(3) exposures. Therefore, methodologies are needed to (1) protect Japanese larch against O(3) damage and (2) conduct biomonitoring of O(3) in Japanese larch forests and, thus, monitor O(3) risks to Japanese larch. For the first time, this study evaluates whether the synthetic chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) can protect Japanese larch against O(3) damage, in two independent experiments. In the first experiment, seedling communities, simulating natural regeneration, were treated with EDU (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg L(−1)) and exposed to either ambient or elevated O(3) in a growing season. In the second experiment, individually-grown saplings were treated with EDU (0, 200 and 400 mg L(−1)) and exposed to ambient O(3) in two growing seasons and to elevated O(3) in the succeeding two growing seasons. The two experiments revealed that EDU concentrations of 200–400 mg L(−1) could protect Japanese larch seedling communities and individual saplings against O(3)-induced inhibition of growth and productivity. However, EDU concentrations ≤ 200 mg L(−1) did offer only partial protection when seedling communities were coping with higher level of O(3)-induced stress, and only 400 mg EDU L(−1) fully protected communities under higher stress. Therefore, we conclude that among the concentrations tested the concentration offering maximum protection to Japanese larch plants under high competition and O(3)-induced stress is that of 400 mg EDU L(−1). The results of this study can provide a valuable resource of information for applied forestry in an O(3)-polluted world.

The disease has taken a form of pandemic and is now present in all countries across the globe with nearly 5.4 million infections and 344,000 fatalities till date. In late March, the Indian government initiated a lockdown, which confined nearly 1.3 billion people, around one-sixth of humanity to home, in an effort to decrease the community transmission of COVID-19 disease and flatten the curve so that Indian health care is able to deal with a manageable number of cases. This lockdown, which started on March 25, 2020, has now been extended to May 17, 2020, a duration of 54 days, with further planned extension to May 31. During this lockdown, the authors noted an increase in the number of mixer grinder injuries and a change in the demography of suicidal attempts due to frustration resulting in injuries to upper limb. The authors have studied this phenomenon and compared the data with cases from previous year. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case records of all patients coming to the emergency department and department of plastic surgery in the period of March 25, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (54 days), with injuries of upper limb were analyzed and data compared with data from 2019. The demography and mode of injuries were studied. RESULTS: There was an unusual increase in hand injuries due to mixer grinder in kitchen, 32 cases in 54 days (17.78/month) compared to 28 cases in 12 months in 2019 (2.34/month) with P < 0.001. There was also an increase in number of intended self-inflicted injuries in upper limb, as a result of psychological effects of rage and frustration with spouse due to long periods of confinement at home (3.89/month during lockdown period compared to 0.58 during 2019, P < 0.005) with change in demography compared to previous year. There was a decrease in upper limb injuries due to road traffic accidents, industrial accidents, assaults, sports, school, and work-related injuries, during the lockdown period, and this was along the expected lines. CONCLUSION: The period of lockdown initiated in India, to slow the community transmission of COVID-19 caused long periods of confinement together at home for families and forced the young adults to carry out some unaccustomed work, which resulted in a spike in mixer grinder injuries of hand. It also led to some rage and frustration, especially with spouses with a spike in suicidal attempt upper limb injuries.","Gupta, Rajat; Gupta, Richie",Indian J Med Sci,452,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was an observational study, longitudinal in design. Based on the existing evidence as of April 15, 2020, we have designed a contact tracing algorithm and contact investigation form to determine the risk of infection among healthcare workers. Later, we have tested the developed contact tracing algorithm and contact investigation from among 28 suspected contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case admitted in all India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna, Bihar, India. RESULTS: Using the designed contact investigation form, all the 28 suspected contacts of the confirmed COVID-19 case were interviewed, among which only 7(25%) were found to be having high-risk exposure. All persons with high-risk exposure were home quarantined for 5 days, along with their direct contacts. Eventually, all high-risk contacts were tested negative on the 5(th) day after exposure and immediately joined their duties after that. Those who were at low risk of infection continued to work and self-monitor for COVID compatible symptoms for 14 days. Eventually, none of the low-risk exposure persons developed COVID compatible symptoms, therefore deferred testing. CONCLUSION: The contact tracing approach designed in the current study is a balanced one where we tried to balance health workers safety without compromising their availability for duty. This approach can also be implemented in other healthcare settings in the era of COVID-19.","Agarwal, Neeraj; Biswas, Bijit; Nair, Rathish",Indian J Med Sci,452,1

As a part of the healthcare management development, it is very important to monitor districts affected due to novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The main objective of this study was to identify and classify affected districts into real clusters on the basis of observations of similarities within a cluster and dissimilarities among different clusters so that government policies, decisions, medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks, treatment etc.), etc. could be improved for reducing the number of infected and deceased persons and hence cured cased could be increased. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the study, we focused on COVID-19 affected districts of the state Maharashtra of India. We applied agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, one of data mining techniques to fulfill the objective. Elbow method was used for obtaining an optimum number of clusters for further analysis. The study of variations among various clusters for each of the variables was performed using box plots. RESULTS: Results obtained from the Elbow method suggested three optimum numbers of clusters for each of the variables. For confirmed and cured cases, cluster I corresponded to the districts BI, GO, ND, PA, SI, WS, JN, CH, OS, HI, NB, JG, RT, LA, KO, AM, ST, BU, DH, AK, YTL, SN, AH, SO, AU, RG, NG, NS and PL. Cluster II corresponded to the districts TH and PU and cluster III corresponded to the district MC. For the death cases, cluster I corresponded to the districts BI, GO, ND, PA, SI, WS, JN, CH, OS, HI, NB, JG, RT, LA, KO, AM, ST, BU, DH, AK, YTL, SN, AH, SO, AU, RG, NG, NS, PL and TH. Cluster II corresponded to the district PU and cluster III corresponded to the district MC. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the district MC under cluster III was affected severely with COVID-19 which had high number of confirmed cases. A good percentage of cured cases were found in some of the districts under cluster I where six districts (GO, SI, CH, OS, SN) had 100% success rate to cure patients. It was observed that the districts TH, PU and MC under clusters II and III had severe conditions which need optimization of medical facilities and monitoring techniques like screening, closedown, curfews, lockdown, evacuations, legal actions, etc.","Kumar, Sanjay",Indian J Med Sci,452,1

To implement such programs, depression literacy (D-Lit) assessment is needed. However, little information is known about it in Bangladesh, and this gap was addressed - in the present study. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was carried out among 404 university students (62.6% male; 69.3% undergraduates, mean age = 22.35 ± 2.69 years). The survey included questions asking about socio-demographics, personal and family depression history, its' stigma and related programs, and the 20-item Bangla Depression Literacy questionnaire. RESULTS: The results showed a mean score of 9.30 (SD = 2.75; out of total 20 scores) on the Bangla D-Lit scale. Participants had very limited knowledge of the psychotic symptoms, impact, and management subscales. Moreover, nine items out of the total twenty-items were answered correctly by at least 50% of the participants. There were no significant D-Lit score differences based on gender and past-year personal history, and family depression history. Structural equation modeling indicated that having knowledge about depression and attending depression seminars were positively related to elevated depression literacy. LIMITATIONS: The study has some limitations due to its cross-sectional study nature and modest sample size. In addition, there the assessment of depression did not use a validated psychometric instrument and the D-Lit comprises multiple-choice responses so the real rate of depression literacy may be even lower than that found because participants could have guessed answers that they did not know. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that depression literacy was low in the population studied and the findings here will help to facilitate mental health literacy awareness programs in the context of Bangladeshi students as well as those outside the country.","Mamun, Mohammed A.; Naher, Shabnam; Moonajilin, Mst.

In hospitals, the absence of L. pneumophila in water systems is mandatory by law, therefore, frequent and effective monitoring of water is of fundamental importance. Molecular methods based on reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) have been proposed for the detection of L. pneumophila, however, the sensitivity and accuracy of these methods have not been validated yet. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other strategies able to overcome the limits of culture-based and RT-qPCR methods. On these bases, we compared the sensitivity and accuracy of droplet digital PC (ddPCR) and RT-qPCR in water samples with known concentrations of L. pneumophila and in an in vitro model of water heat treatments. ddPCR showed a higher sensitivity rate and accuracy compared to RT-qPCR in detecting low bacterial load. In addition, ddPCR is not affected by the presence of fragmented DNA and showed higher accuracy than RT-qPC in monitoring the efficacy of heat shock treatments. In conclusion, ddPCR represents an innovative strategy to effectively detect L. pneumophila in water samples. Thanks to its high robustness, ddPCR could be applied also for the detection of L. pneumophila in patients with suspected legionellosis.","Falzone, Luca; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Lombardo, Cinzia; Lupo, Gabriella; Grillo, Caterina Maria; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Libra, Massimo; Salmeri, Mario",Int J Mol Med,452,1

We established an a priori definition of a “brain death mimic” as an unresponsive, intubated patient missing some, but not all brainstem reflexes. We completed a review of the literature utilizing MEDLINE and EMBASE to find case reports of patients of all ages in English, French, and Spanish meeting the criteria and hand searched the references of the results. We recorded xenobiotic dose, duration of physical exam suggesting brain death, and how the cases failed to meet full brain death criteria, when available. Fifty-six cases representing 19 different substances met the a priori definition of brain death mimic. Xenobiotic toxicities included: snake envenomation (13), baclofen (11), tricyclic antidepressants (8), bupropion (7), alcohols (4), antiepileptic agents (3), barbiturates (2), antidysrhythmics (2), organophosphates (2), and one case each of magnesium, succinylcholine, tetrodotoxin, and zolpidem. All patients except one survived to discharge and the majority at their baseline physical health. The most common means by which the cases failed brain death examination prerequisites was via normal neuroimaging. The xenobiotics in this review should be considered in cases of poisoning resulting in loss of brainstem reflexes and addressed before brain death determination. Brain death diagnosis should not be pursued in the setting of normal cerebral imaging or incomplete evaluation of brain death prerequisites.","Murphy, Lauren; Wolfer, Hannah; Hendrickson, Robert G.",Neurocrit Care,452,1

In this study, Lactobacillus casei strain W56 (Lc W56) was used as antigen deliver carrier to construct a recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 constitutively expressing BVDV E2 protein fused with cholera toxin B subunit (ctxB) as an adjuvant, and its immunogenicity against BVDV infection in mice model by oral route was explored. RESULTS: Our results suggested that pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 can effectively activate dendritic cells (DCs) in the Peyer’s patches, up-regulate the expression of Bcl-6, and promote T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells differentiation, as well as enhance B lymphocyte proliferation and promote them differentiate into specific IgA-secreting plasma cells, secreting anti-E2 mucosal sIgA antibody with BVDV-neutralizing activity. Moreover, significant levels (p < 0.01) of BVDV-neutralizing antigen-specific serum antibodies were induced in the pPG-E2-ctxB/LC W56 group post-vaccination. The recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine can induce cellular immune responses, and significant levels (p < 0.01) of Th1-associated cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ), Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) and Th17-associated cytokine (IL-17) were determined in the serum of vaccinated mice. Significantly, the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine provides immune protection against BVDV infection, which can be cleared effectively by the vaccine post-challenge in orally vaccinated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The genetically engineered Lactobacillus vaccine constructed in this study is immunogenic in mice and can induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses, providing effective anti-BVDV immune protection. It thus represents a promising strategy for vaccine development against BVDV.","Jia, Shuo; Huang, Xinning; Li, Hua; Zheng, Dianzhong; Wang, Li; Qiao, Xinyuan; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Tang, Lijie; Li, Yijing; Xu, Yigang",Microb Cell Fact,452,1

There remains a need for standardized, evidence-based, continuously updated guidelines for perioperative care in these patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert group, the Perioperative Anesthesia in Thoracic Surgery (PACTS) group, was established to develop recommendations for anesthesia practice in patients undergoing elective lung resection for lung cancer. The project addressed three key areas: preoperative patient assessment and preparation, intraoperative management (surgical and anesthesiologic care), and postoperative care and discharge. A series of clinical questions was developed, and literature searches were performed to inform discussions around these areas, leading to the development of 69 recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were graded using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria. RESULTS: Recommendations for intraoperative care focus on airway management, and monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamics, blood gases, neuromuscular blockade, and depth of anesthesia. Recommendations for postoperative care focus on the provision of multimodal analgesia, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and specific measures such as chest drainage, mobilization, noninvasive ventilation, and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help clinicians to improve intraoperative and postoperative management, and thereby achieve better postoperative outcomes in thoracic surgery patients.

Among them, 4-hydroxyemodin and 5-hydroxyemodin were potent inhibitors of hMAO, and 2-hydroxyemodin and 5-hydroxyemodin were good V(1A)R antagonists. In silico molecular docking simulation revealed that the hydroxyl group at C2, C4, and C5 of the respective compounds interacted with prime residues, which corroborates the in vitro effect. Likewise, these three derivatives were predicted to have good drug-like properties. Overall, our study demonstrates that the hydroxyl derivatives of emodin are multi-target-directed ligands that may act as leads for the design and development of a therapy for central nervous system disorders.","Paudel, Pradeep; Shrestha, Srijan; Park, Se Eun; Seong, Su Hui; Fauzi, Fazlin Mohd; Jung, Hyun Ah; Choi, Jae Sue",ACS Omega,452,22

Patients with chronic inflammatory disease on biological immunosuppressive treatments may be at a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. However, it is yet to be determined whether immunomodulatory medications used in inflammatory diseases have protective capabilities against severe outcomes. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year old female with a 13-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presented to hospital with fever, exertional breathlessness, and a non-productive cough. She was diagnosed with seropositive erosive RA at the age of 38 and was on 6-monthly Rituximab infusions and Leflunomide on admission. She had relatively stable pulmonary fibrosis (diagnosed in 2010). Her chest CTs in 2010 and 2018 noted bilateral basal subpleural ground glass change with limited honeycombing and spirometry study revealed FEV1 of 2.2 (82% predicted), VC of 2.7 (87% predicted), DLCO of 7.0 (78% predicted) and kCO of 1.6 (78% predicted). On admission in March 2020, she was hypoxic (oxygen saturation of 88% in room air) and had raised inflammatory markers (CRP 341mg/dL, d-Dimer 914ng/ml, Ferritin 3141ng/ml, LDH 672U/L). Her last Rituximab infusion was 3 months prior and leflunomide was withheld on admission. SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab was positive, and she was recruited to the RECOVERY trial, being randomized to Lopinavir-Ritonavir for 10 days. Her oxygen requirements increased, and a CT pulmonary angiogram excluded pulmonary embolism but revealed ground glass changes and extensive multilobar consolidation. She was eligible for recruitment into RECOVERY-2 (tocilizumab) given the ongoing oxygen requirement and elevated CRP, but she was randomised to usual care. She was commenced on 80mg of IV methylprednisolone, a dose chosen because of its proven effectiveness in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. She clinically improved and was discharged from hospital 20 days after starting Methylprednisolone with a CRP of 17mg/dL. Two months after discharge, the patient had repeat spirometry study which noted FEV1 of 1.4 (57% predicted), VC of 1.5 (52% predicted), DLCO of 2.4 (28% predicted) and kCO of 1.0 (47% predicted). A repeat high-resolution chest CT reported significant improvement of peripheral ground glass changes and consolidation, but she is still fatigued and more breathless than previously. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: The RECOVERY trial concluded that Dexamethasone reduced mortality in intubated patients and in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with a high oxygen requirement. The results were published after this patient was discharged. A hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is seen in a subset of patients, and our own hospital data suggest that this condition affects around 5% of admitted COVID-19 patients, but that extreme hyperferritinaemia above 10,000 is extremely rare. Similar responses (known as Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) are seen with a variety of viral and bacterial infections, in malignancy and in inflammatory rheumatic diseases (Macrophage Activation Syndrome [MAS]), but typically HLH and MAS patients have ferritin > 10,000. It appears unlikely that true HLH is a significant manifestation of COVID-19 infection, but moderate hyperferritinaemia is not uncommon and the results of this study, taken together with case reports and series from China and Italy suggest that similar treatments to those used in HLH may transform the prognosis for COVID-19 patients in this subset. It is unknown whether the recent Rituximab infusion had a role in reducing the “cytokine storm” and delaying progression to severe COVID-19. However, it may be argued that the remaining T cells in B cell depleted patients are sufficient for viral clearance. The long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary function is still unclear. Our patient had a major deterioration in her lung function when compared to her baseline. There was severe reduction in gas transfer post COVID-19. However, her repeat high resolution CT chest reported substantial improvement in ground glass changes and consolidation. The long-term prognosis is still uncertain. Initial fears that patients on DMARDs and biological therapies for inflammatory rheumatic disease would be extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 have not been confirmed, but patients with extra-articular manifestations on combinations of DMARDs and biological therapies may be a subset at higher risk. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Our Intensivist colleagues, early in the COVID-19 outbreak, were understandably cautious about using heavily immunosuppressive treatments for a life-threatening viral infection. Using a multi-disciplinary approach at a time when knowledge of how to treat this condition was rudimentary, along with informed consent from an intelligent and thoughtful patient, we were able to plot a middle path to suppress hyperinflammation without using massively immunosuppressive doses of steroid, with a successful outcome. This patient illustrates one aspect of the hyper-inflammatory response seen in a subset of the most critically ill patients with COVID-19. At the time of writing, the RECOVERY 2 trial is yet to be published, but the rapid improvement in inflammatory markers including CRP and Ferritin, along with a dramatic improvement in clinical state, suggest that relatively modest doses of parenteral steroid have life-saving potential at far lower cost and greater worldwide availability than biological therapies such as Tocilizumab or Anakinra. Trials of Tocilizumab in RECOVERY2 and of Anakinra coordinated by the Hyperinflammation Histio UK Haemophagocytosis Across Specialty Collaboration (HASC), as well as international randomised controlled trials will be critical in determining the optimal treatment strategy for this subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The experience of our patient suggests that one arm of such studies should include a relatively modest dose of parenteral steroid, be that Dexamethasone or Methylprednisolone, particularly given that COVID-19 is affecting countries across the developing, as well as the developed, world.","Ong, Melissa; Gibson, Mark; Coakley, Gerald",Rheumatol Adv Pract,452,1

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness and 10-20% of infected individuals develop severe disease with interstitial pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this subgroup of patients, severe clinical manifestations are postulated to result from a hyperactive immune response. This has led to the proposal that immunomodulatory medications could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report a case of COVID-19 that was treated with the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented to A&E with a one-week history of fever, cough, headache and ageusia. Her past medical history was significant for asthma, chronic headaches, gastro-oesophageal reflux syndrome and subarachnoid haemorrhage. On presentation, she had a low-grade temperature (37.8 °C) but her observations were otherwise normal, and her oxygen saturations were 99% on room air. Examination revealed right basal chest crackles. Bloods showed a mild lymphopenia (0.9x10(9)/l) and a raised CRP (82mg/l) and a chest radiograph demonstrated bibasal shadowing. The patient was diagnosed with probable COVID-19 and discharged with a course of oral doxycycline and a plan for review in the ambulatory unit the following day. When reviewed the next day, her oxygen saturations had fallen to 90% on room air. At this point, her SARS-CoV-2 assay had been resulted as positive and a decision was made to admit her for oxygen therapy. The patient continued to deteriorate despite optimal supportive therapy and the addition of intravenous benzylpenicillin for possible superadded bacterial infection. On day 7 of admission, her respiratory rate was 32-38 breaths per minute, and she required 13l/min of oxygen. Her bloods revealed CRP 474mg/L, D dimer >6000 ng/ml, ferritin 224 μg/L, neutrophils 9.5x10(9)/l and lymphocytes 0.6 x10(9)/l. There were no signs of superadded bacterial infection despite a thorough infection screen. Given her clinical deterioration, she was reviewed by the critical care team for consideration of transfer to higher-level care. The ward team decided to administer a single dose of the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab for the treatment of a cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19 infection. Within 24 hours of tocilizumab treatment, her oxygen requirements fell to 5l/min and her work of breathing significantly improved. On day 15 of admission, she was discharged with saturations of 92% on room air. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: The patient described in this case showed significant clinical deterioration with features suggestive of cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19. IL-6 is thought to be a key cytokine responsible for initiating the acute phase response and we postulate that IL-6 levels were raised in this patient. Unfortunately, we did not have the assay available to measure this. The treating clinical team decided to prescribe a single dose of tocilizumab on a compassionate use basis. This resulted in a rapid clinical improvement and the patient was subsequently discharged without the need for intensive care. In this case, we propose that tocilizumab inhibited further cytokine activation and prevented the positive feedback loop of inflammation that can otherwise result in rapid clinical deterioration. There are several interesting points to be noted from this case. In this patient, tocilizumab resulted in a rapid reduction in CRP levels. This is thought to correspond to the inhibition of IL-6 mediated release of acute phase proteins by the liver. Therefore, it should be noted that post-tocilizumab treatment, patients should be closely monitored for superadded bacterial infection as they may not mount a full immune response. Larger trials of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently underway and are required to confirm the efficacy of IL-6 inhibition for COVID-19. The phase III COVACTA trial of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status however a trend towards shorter hospital admissions was seen. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the role of tocilizumab in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral medication. Further information is required to determine which patients should receive immunomodulatory medications and at which point in their illness. Data is also needed to understand the most efficacious dosing regimen for tocilizumab and its side-effect profile in COVID-19 patients. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and has led to an unprecedented effort from the scientific community to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to find effective treatments. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can induce a hyperactive immune response in a subgroup of patients who develop highly elevated levels of acute phase proteins. It has been proposed that the overactive immune response is responsible for some of the severe clinical manifestations seen and this has led to the suggestion that immunomodulatory medications could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Indeed, dexamethasone has been shown to be an effective treatment and other immunomodulatory medications including hydroxychloroquine, the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra and JAK-kinase inhibitors are currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19. This case highlights the clinical and biochemical features of a patient who developed features suggestive of a cytokine storm secondary to COVID-19 and who responded to treatment with the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. Further work is required to understand the role of immunomodulatory medications for the management of COVID-19 infection.","Biddle, Kathryn; Burrage, Daniel; Sofat, Nidhi",Rheumatol Adv Pract,452,1

Its multi-systemic features include pulmonary, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), renal, and neurological manifestations. Its incidence is estimated to be 10.2 cases per million population. It is challenging to diagnose when its symptoms are treated in isolation from one another. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing GPA in a patient with respiratory symptoms during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and describes the challenges of managing it in the context of a subsequent COVID-19 infection as the mainstay of treatment remains immunosuppression. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old female non-smoker with a history of leg ulcers developed a 3-month history of cough and haemoptysis and was treated in primary care for suspected sinus and chest infections. She then presented to Accident and Emergency twice for the same symptoms and was discharged after having her antibiotics changed. 2 weeks later, she presented for the third time with cough, ongoing haemoptysis, conjunctivitis in the right eye, pain over the right side of her head, and discharge from her right ear. She was admitted as she was pyrexical, tachycardic and her CRP was 60. COVID-19 swabs were negative. ENT team recommended IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected orbital cellulitis. Blood cultures remained negative. CT sinuses with contrast showed right sided thrombosis of transverse sinus and bilateral mastoid effusion of the middle ear. Following neurology review, she was anticoagulated with dalteparin. A day later, she was transferred to the Respiratory ward and dropped her Haemoglobin level to 70. Her chest radiograph showed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and CT images showed widespread bilateral peri-hilar consolidation. A rheumatology opinion was sought and vasculitic screen showed ANCA 268, and PR3 >177. Her urinary protein/creatinine ratio was elevated at 90. Rheumatology team confirmed multi-systemic GPA and recommended starting oral Prednisolone 60 mg daily. After the renal team was consulted, she was moved to a side-room and started on IV Methylprednisolone (pulsed with three doses), along with cyclophosphamide and rituximab. Dalteparin was discontinued. 2 days later, she desaturated, and became pyrexical. Repeat COVID-19 swabs were positive. Three Consultants agreed that Plasma Exchange and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) would be inappropriate. A Do Not Attempt Resuscitation form was signed, and prognosis was discussed with the patient and her 78-year-old husband who requested to visit. Patient deteriorated and unfortunately died 6 days later. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This case is interesting because it highlights the diagnostic challenge of GPA. Retrospectively, it may be noted that doctors persisted in treating suspected infection although the patient continued to deteriorate. However, a diagnosis should be re-considered if the patient does not respond to treatment and it is important to consider vasculitis as a cause of haemoptysis. Anticoagulation was started since the benefits were considered to outweigh the risks as her haemoptysis was of small volume. The patient soon developed pulmonary haemorrhage, so the risks of anticoagulation should not be underestimated in vasculitis. The Rheumatology team’s cautious approach to immunosuppression was in stark contrast to the renal team’s aggressive approach. The Renal team believed that concerns about protecting the patient from COVID-19 when she was negative from this infection should not take precedence over appropriate immunosuppression from a potentially fatal vasculitis. The patient was admitted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and was negative for COVID-19 on admission. She was nursed in a bay on the Respiratory ward where she later became COVID-19 positive. This raises questions about whether the earlier test was a false negative result or whether her infection was hospital-acquired. Infection control guidelines were changing rapidly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to avoid plasma exchange was based on the findings of the PEXIVAS trial. NIV was avoided as it required a full-face mask to minimize particle dispersion but would pose an asphyxiation risk as patient was coughing up blood. Finally, the team learnt to be flexible in these extraordinary circumstances when dealing with the end-of-life decisions of the COVID-19 positive patient. Although her husband was a vulnerable person because of his age, he was given the opportunity to visit while wearing Personal Protective Equipment and agreed to self-isolate for two weeks. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: This case helped me appreciate the complexity of deciding to immunosuppress an already severely ill patient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. I recognised that the patient had a poor prognosis with or without immunosuppression and our role as healthcare professionals was to give her the best chance of recovery. The conference will allow me to interact with other colleagues and discuss what they would do in this situation as our Rheumatology and Renal teams had different approaches. After further reading on false negative results, we found that Johns Hopkins researchers found that testing people for SARS-CoV2 too early in the course of infection is likely to result in a false negative test even though they may eventually test positive for the virus. I have also learnt about the PEXIVAS trial which found that the addition of plasma exchange to standard therapy does not reduce the risk for all-cause mortality among patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. Moreover, a reduced-dose regimen of glucocorticoids is non-inferior to a standard-dose protocol, while reducing the risk for serious infections. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is not treatable with arterial embolization or bronchoscopic methods due to the diffuse nature of the bleeding. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to support patients with DAH but the use of ECMO is controversial due to the need for anticoagulation. The conference will help me deepen my understanding of epidemic rheumatology which will be useful for my clinical practice going forward, especially if there is a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am keen to use this event to engage with other clinicians on immunosuppression in the context of infection so that I may confidently manage similarly complex cases in the future.","Rajabally, Hanaa; Morley, Catherine; Srivastava, Shalabh",Rheumatol Adv Pract,452,1

We report on the safety and clinical findings of a portable magnetic resonance imager (MRI) in a cohort of ICU patients who had Covid 19 with suspected neurologic injury. METHODS: This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational study at one institution utilizing portable MRI in patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, known as Covid-19. Patients selected for imaging had any of the following: 1) unexplained encephalopathy or coma, 2) seizures, 3) focal neurologic deficit, and 4) abnormal head CT. Imaging was performed in each patient's ICU room with a portable, self-shielding, 0.064 Tesla (T) MRI. RESULTS: Among 19 patients, a total of 20 MRI scans in seven ICUs were acquired between April 13 and April 23, 2020. No adverse events to patients or staff from MRI acquisition were reported. In 12 patients, abnormal findings were seen, which included increased fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal (n = 12), hemorrhage (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) positivity (n = 3). Imaging led to a change in clinical management in five patients, including 3 lumbar punctures, a resumption of anticoagulation therapy, and one previously unplanned move to palliative care. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first report on the use of a novel, portable, self-shielding MRI to image patients. In critically ill patients, the use of portable MRI is safe, feasible, and leads to changes in clinical management. This technique can be applied to any ICU patients whose care requires imaging of the brain.","Turpin, Justin; Unadkat, Prashin; Thomas, Justin G; Kleiner, Nick; Khazanehdari, Shahab; Wanchoo, Sheshali; Samuel, Kenia; Moclair, Betsy; Black, Karen; Dehdashti, Amir R; Narayan, Raj K; Temes, Richard; Schulder, Michael",Neurosurgery,452,1

Nonetheless, data are lacking regarding the management of EES during this pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey of skull base surgeons worldwide was conducted. Different practices by geographical regions and COVID-19 prevalence were analyzed. RESULTS: 135 unique responses were collected. Regarding the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), North America reported using more powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) and Asia/Europe using more standard precautions. North America and Europe resorted more to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for screening asymptomatic patients. High prevalence countries showed a higher use of PAPR. The medium prevalence group reported lower RT-PCR testing for symptomatic cases and the high prevalence group used it significantly more in asymptomatic cases. 19 respondents reported healthcare personnel transmission of COVID-19 from EES, with a higher rate of transmission among countries classified as having a medium prevalence of COVID-19. These specific respondents (medium prevalence) also reported a lower use of airborne PPE. In the cases of healthcare transmission, the patient was reportedly asymptomatic 32% of the time. CONCLUSION: This survey gives an overview of EES practices during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Intensified preoperative screening, even in asymptomatic patients, RT-PCR for all symptomatic cases, and an increased use of airborne PPE is associated with decreased reports of COVID-19 transmission during EES.","Champagne, Pierre-Olivier; McDowell, Michael M; Wang, Eric; Snyderman, Carl H; Zenonos, Georgios A; Gardner, Paul A",Neurosurgery,452,1

In this paper, we present and discuss a case study of an academic spinoff, Omnidermal, which has developed a new, efficient and easy‐to‐realize emergency life support machine for use in intensive and sub‐intensive care units. This case, apart from offering information on the best practices of how spinoffs may contribute socially to the fight against COVID‐19 and – more in general – against other exogenous shocks, also provides insights on their stages of development, evolution patterns and ability to define new solutions. The case shows that when the market needs are clear to a firm (as in the case of medical devices during the COVID‐19 crisis), the ‘legacy competences and practices’ of spinoffs (i.e., technical competences and work practices) can be fully exploited to compress the development time and to realize products demanded by the market. We also identify access to a network as being an essential boundary condition for this process. These results introduce an alternative scope for academic spinoffs. Given the ‘legacy competences and practices’ they are able to develop, they are ideal candidates to respond to the societal and economic challenges posed by a crisis over short periods of time.

There is confusion for efficacy of non-invasive ventilation compared to high-flow oxygen therapy regarding occurrence of severe hypoxemia during the intubation procedure. The purpose of the study was to compare the difference between noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy to prevent desaturation during laryngoscopy. METHODS: Patients underwent high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HCO cohort, n = 161) or non-invasive ventilation procedure (NIV cohort, n = 154) for oxygenation and ventilation due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Data before preoxygenation, preoxygenation, intubation, laryngoscopy, and complications of patients due to tracheal intubation were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There was no difference between both cohorts for the demographical and clinical conditions of the patients before preoxygenation (p > 0.05 for all parameters), numbers of patients with severe hypoxia during the intubation procedure (35 vs. 45, p = 0.303), the time duration of laryngoscopy (p = 0.847), number of laryngoscopies attempts (p = 0.804), and immediate and late complications during the intubation procedure. The values of pulse oximetry were reported higher for patients of NIV cohort than those of HCO cohort during preoxygenation. Fewer numbers of patients were reported with severe hypoxia among patients of the NIV cohort than those of the HCO cohort (24 vs., 40, p = 0.042) who have moderate-to-severe hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio ≤ 200 mmHg) before preoxygenation. The most common complications were hypertension, pulmonary aspiration, and increased 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: When compared, there was no difference between non-invasive ventilation technique and high-flow oxygen therapy to minimize severe hypoxia prior to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in patients with acute respiratory failure.","Zhang, Chao; Ou, Min",BMC Emerg Med,452,0

This is due to differences between the western region and other regions that relate to, inter alia, policy, technology level, standard specification, and market demand. The study of the operational efficiency of prefabricated building industry bases in the western region is therefore of great significance. This paper uses a literature review and expert correction to establish an input–output index system. It also conducts field research in different regions and uses the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) research method to analyze overall differences between prefabricated building industry bases in Western China and other regions. It also draws on macro and micro perspectives to assess problems that exist in their own operations.

For China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to succeed as a driver of institutional change in favor of globalization, it must pass the narrative “virality” test and successfully contend with competing narratives. Rival narratives will be launched by firms and organizations worldwide that expect to win or lose from deglobalization or from new forms of globalization. This study develops a useful framework for establishing the extent to which China’s BRI is a genuine narrative or just a story. In this regard, four testable propositions are put forth to ascertain whether the BRI is values-based, extends an invitation to participate, is open-ended, and is associated with economic performance for both Chinese and non-Chinese participants. The analysis of the BRI-related institutional change that leads to globalization applies a theoretical lens centered on the narrative economics perspective and on the institution-based view and political economy perspective. Implications for BRI stakeholders, international business practitioners, and international business scholarship are outlined.","Klett, Tomas Casas; Li, Jiatao",Asia Pac J Manag,452,1

As the public health situation evolves, it is important to evaluate provider satisfaction with virtual care during these unprecedented times. AIMS: To assess healthcare provider (HCP) satisfaction with virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We administered a 20-item satisfaction survey that assessed the usefulness, ease of use, interface qualities, reliability, and overall satisfaction with virtual care tools for the delivery of care to patients with gastrointestinal diseases. One hundred and twenty-five gastroenterologists in Alberta were invited to participate via email. We used a modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) which was open for response from June 19-August 30, 2020. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 19% (24/125) with 46% female respondents. Most respondents worked in an academic facility (63%) and had been in practice for a mean duration of 12.3 years. Respondents were from seven facilities within the South, Calgary, Central and Edmonton health zones. Virtual care reported was a hybrid model consisting of telephone and in-person (54%) or telephone and video consults (42%). Although 90% indicated that virtual care tools improved access to healthcare, provided location flexibility and were appropriate to meet healthcare needs, only 42% agreed that it saved time. Inconclusive virtual consultations due to the absence of physical examination and missing lab values was reported by 75% and 33% of HCPs, respectively. Ninety-five percent of HCPs who used video conferencing found it simple, easy to learn and were able to become productive quickly with it. Over 60% of HCPs reported that virtual care (irrespective of the platform used) was not the same as in-person visits. The mean overall satisfaction for HCPs who rarely or never had virtual care prior to the pandemic, was 0.57 points higher than those who often provided virtual care (4.36 vs 3.79; 95% CI: 0.26–0.88, p=0.001). Overall, 88% of providers were satisfied with virtual care and all respondents were willing to use it again (Figure 1). Identified areas of concern included patient safety, patient education on best practices, adequate remuneration, additional administrative duties, and challenges with providing care for new patients on virtual platforms. CONCLUSIONS: This survey of GI providers in Alberta showed high satisfaction and acceptance with virtual care. However, the majority reported it to be less reliable than in-person visits. Access to Alberta Netcare to view investigations was deemed valuable. Areas of concern that needs to be addressed include patient education on virtual care best practices and provider resources to assist with new consultations on virtual platforms.

Online courses offer scheduling flexibility and pacing options, so that the learners can complete their assignments at convenient times. Moreover, online courses can be adapted and individualized to match the learning progress of the users through various adaptations. There is a large target group that aims to develop certain skills with online courses. But their creation, implementation, maintenance, and support are cost-intensive, which means that high-quality tutored courses often have to be offered fee-based to operate at least cost-neutrally without gaining some profit. In this paper, we demonstrate and discuss an open, sustainable, data-driven two-sided business model for using verified online courses and making them available to every learner free of charge. The core of the business model is the use of behavioral data for deriving personality traits and interests, and their use in a commercial context. This method is already widely accepted in web search, which is now implemented in the learning context. The opportunities, challenges, but also barriers that need to be overcome for the business model to be applicable and ethical at the same time are discussed while two independent but synergistically connected business models are presented. Besides, we examined the acceptance and expectation of the target group for the presented business model to understand the necessary core assets for practice. The results of the study indicate that the business model is fundamentally accepted. 10% of the respondents prefer to learn with virtual assistants instead of tutors, and the majority of users is not aware that personality traits can be derived from user behavior.","Rüdian, Sylvio; Vladova, Gergana",HMD,452,13

The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on global children’s cancer services, which can have consequences for childhood cancer outcomes. The Global Health Research Group on Children’s Non-Communicable Diseases (Global Children’s NCDs) is currently undertaking the first international study to determine the variation in paediatric cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the short to medium term impacts on childhood cancer outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, international, cohort study that will use routinely collected hospital data in a de-identified and anonymised form. Patients will be recruited consecutively into the study, with a 12 -month follow-up period. Patients will be included if they are below the age of 18 years and undergoing anti-cancer treatment for the following cancers: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt’s Lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms Tumour, Sarcoma, Retinoblastoma, Gliomas, Medulloblastomas and Neuroblastomas. Patients must be newly presented or be undergoing active anti-cancer treatment from the 12th March 2020 to the 12th December 2020. The primary objective of the study is to determine 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality rates. This study will examine the factors that influenced these outcomes. Chi-squared analysis will be used to compare mortality between low and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Multilevel, multivariate logistic regression analysis will be undertaken to identify patient-level and hospital-level factors affecting outcomes with adjustment for confounding factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: At the host centre, this study was deemed to be exempt from ethical committee approval due to the use of anonymised registry data. At other centres, participating collaborators have gained local approvals in accordance with their institutional ethical regulations. Collaborators will be encouraged to present the results locally, nationally, and internationally.

COVID-19 has accentuated their wickedness, contributing also to global structural shifts, which pose significant challenges and opportunities for transformation policymaking. This commentary extends the second-generation wicked problem (WP) literature and proposes a third-generation WP approach focusing on morality and time, which have been often overlooked. Drawing on the WP literature, I propose three policymaking principles (i.e., time-sensitive logics, actioning a moral imperative, empathy, and reflexivity) and two types of meta-capabilities (i.e., resilience and entrepreneurial meta-capabilities). Time-sensitive logics sensitize decision-makers to cause-effect lags and help synch their approaches with governance, system and strategic policymaking logics. Actioning a moral imperative helps curb perverse managerial incentives to address only feasible WP parts. Empathy and reflexivity outline the importance of humanizing WPs and prompt decision-makers to reflect on their own mental models and biases when addressing WPs. Resilience meta-capabilities underscore anticipatory, coping, adaptive and transformative capabilities needed to address WPs in order to “bounce beyond adversity”. Entrepreneurial meta-capabilities outline five entrepreneurial policymaking elements suited for addressing WPs. These principles and meta-capabilities can guide policymakers and managers to better navigate the wickedness of COVID-19 and address WPs beyond it.","Rašković, Matevž",J Int Bus Policy,452,33

To fill the gap in the literature, we examine whether the effects of patenting on new firm survival vary according to exit routes (bankruptcy, merger, and voluntary liquidation), while considering the endogeneity of patenting. We use a large-scale sample of new firms in the Japanese manufacturing and information services sectors for the period 2003–2013. The findings indicate that new firms with a higher stock of patents are less likely to go bankrupt. Conversely, new firms with a higher stock of patents are more likely to exit via merger. These findings are consistent, regardless of whether patent stock is measured based on the patent applications or granted patents. Furthermore, we provide evidence that new firms with a higher stock of granted patents are more likely to voluntarily liquidate their businesses. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Can new firms enjoy a “patent premium” in terms of survival and exit outcomes? The findings of this study indicate that (1) patenting reduces the risk of bankruptcy, and (2) it increases the odds of exit via merger and voluntary liquidation. On the one hand, patenting ensures that new firms obtain competitive advantages, and thus, survive in the product market. On the other hand, it enables new firms to pursue successful exit strategies in the markets for ideas. This study concludes that new firms can enjoy a patent premium in terms of survival and exit outcomes. In promoting sustainable economic growth via entrepreneurship, policymakers need to shift their focus from creating more firms to creating innovative firms.","Kato, Masatoshi; Onishi, Koichiro; Honjo, Yuji",Small Bus Econ,452,16

METHODS: MMS is planned to start in Gaza in the Fall of 2021, where UNRWA antenatal services reach ∼38,000 pregnant women with IFA each year; ∼97% of whom attended ANC ≥ 4 times(2). Implementation will follow a randomized, step-wedge procedure whereby MMS will start in the 1(st) 11 clinics, and six months later, the 2(nd) group of 11 clinics, providing a design for monitoring and comparing the new MMS to existing IFA programs during an initial 6–8 month period. RESULTS: Outcomes will include indicators of adoption, acceptability, coverage, adherence, fidelity, cost-efficiencies and, as a routine clinical outcome, late pregnancy anemia.

The Government of Bangladesh has concerns about diminished coverage and quality of maternal and child health services, but little published information exists on service provision, utilization, and adaptations. We examined changes to maternal and child health and nutrition service delivery and utilization in urban Bangladesh during and after the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions and identified adaptations and potential solutions to strengthen service delivery and uptake. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys with health care providers (n = 45), pregnant women (n = 40), and mothers of children < 2 years (n = 387) in February 2020 (in-person) and September 2020 (by phone). We used Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests to compare the changes before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Most services for pregnant women remained available during COVID-19 restrictions, with the provision of antenatal care (ANC) services falling by 6.6 percentage points (pp). Services for women and children which require proximity, however, were more severely affected; weight and height measurements fell by 20–29pp for pregnant women and 37–57pp for children, and child immunizations fell by 38pp. Declines in service utilization were large, including drops in facility visitations (35pp among pregnant women and 67pp among mothers), health and nutrition counseling (up to 73pp), child weight measurements (50pp), and immunizations (61pp). The primary method of adaptation was provision of services over phone (37% for ANC services and 44–49% for counselling of pregnant women or mothers with young children). CONCLUSIONS: Despite adaptations to service provisions, continued availability of routine maternal and child health services did not translate into service utilization. Further investments are needed to provide timely and accurate information on COVID-19 to the public, improve COVID-19 training and provide incentives for health care providers, and ensure availability of personal protective equipment for both providers and beneficiaries.

Functionality was the domain with the highest rating (median 4.8, IQR 0.8), followed by aesthetics (median 4.0, IQR 0.7), information (median 3.5, IQR 0.8), and engagement (median 3.2, IQR 1.0). Subjective quality was average (median 3.0, IQR 1.0). The lowest scoring individual item was customization with a median of 2.5/5. Lower functionality scores were reported among older female rheumatic patients (P < 0.004). Older male rheumatic patients reported a higher subjective quality score (P < 0.024). Perceived disease activity and disease duration did not significantly correlate with any uMARS subdomain scores. eHealth literacy significantly correlated with functionality uMARS subdomain ratings (Rho = 0.18; P < 0.042). Preferred time of app usage significantly correlated with engagement (Rho = 0.20; P < 0.024), functionality (Rho = 0.19; P < 0.029), total uMARS score (Rho = 0.21; P < 0.017) and subjective quality score (Rho = 0.21; P < 0.017). The vast majority of rheumatic patients would consider recommending Rheuma Auszeit to other patients (117/126; 92.9%). Conclusion: Rheuma Auszeit was well-accepted by German patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondyloarthritis. Lacking customization could lead to low app compliance and should be improved. Lower functionality scores among older female rheumatic patients highlight the need for patient education. The study underlines the potential and feasibility of therapeutic complementary digital solutions in rheumatology.","Lambrecht, Antonia; Vuillerme, Nicolas; Raab, Christina; Simon, David; Messner, Eva-Maria; Hagen, Melanie; Bayat, Sara; Kleyer, Arnd; Aubourg, Timothée; Schett, Georg; Hueber, Axel; Knitza, Johannes",Front Med (Lausanne),452,1

A large number of theoretical articles and a few empirical papers back the existence of an amplification effect on market volatility caused by the use of risk management measures (e.g. value-at-risk, VaR, for market risk) for regulatory purposes. However, to the best of my knowledge, no paper has empirically investigated the direct relation between the level of tightness of VaR risk limits and market volatility. In this article, I show that market volatility is positively related to past values of the measure of the tightness of the market risk limit, with an overshooting process of adjustment toward equilibrium. The analysis is limited to Italy. The empirical results, based on a unique dataset of VaR values and on other publicly available market data, are in line with the theoretical findings and are novel empirical evidence. They open the way to additional research on how to manage the channels of transmission of the amplification and overshooting effects from the risk management measure to systemic variables, to avoid unintended consequences of the application of individual supervision measures on the whole system.","Leardi, Alessandro",J Econ Finan,452,1

Additionally, we utilized the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Pathology Milestones as a curricular guide. Six professional residency training Special Expertise Tracks were established: Education, Physician-Scientist Research, Informatics, Quality Improvement/Quality Assurance/Value-Based Care, Health Policy/Hospital Management and Global Health. After implementation in 2017, the Education track has had 4 residents complete the curriculum successfully; the Physician-Scientist Research track has had 2 residents and the Informatics and Global Health tracks have each had one resident successfully complete their respective curricula. Currently, 5 residents are pursuing the Education track, one is pursuing the Physician-Scientist Research track, one is pursuing the Informatics track, and 2 residents are pursuing the Global Health track. Five residents have completed long-term projects including developing several e-learning modules, an online free digital cytopathology atlas, peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and books.

They are the causative agents of an infectious disease called dengue, an important global public health problem with significant social-economic impact. Thus, the development of safe and effective dengue vaccines is a priority according to the World Health Organization. Only one anti-dengue vaccine has already been licensed in endemic countries and two formulations are under phase III clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to compare the main anti-dengue virus vaccines, DENGVAXIA(®), LAV-TDV, and TAK-003, regarding their antigens and potential to protect. We studied the conservation of both, B and T cell epitopes involved in immunological control of DENV infection along with vaccine viruses and viral isolates. In addition, we assessed the population coverage of epitope sets contained in each vaccine formulation with regard to different human populations. As main results, we found that all three vaccines contain the main B cell epitopes involved in viral neutralization. Similarly, LAV-TDV and TAK-003 contain most of T cell epitopes involved in immunological protection, a finding not observed in DENGVAXIA(®), which explains main limitations of the only licensed dengue vaccine. In summary, the levels of presence and absence of epitopes that are target for protective immune response in the three main anti-dengue virus vaccines are shown in this study. Our results suggest that investing in vaccines that contain the majority of epitopes involved in protective immunity (cellular and humoral arms) is an important issue to be considered.","Pinheiro, Josilene Ramos; Camilo dos Reis, Esther; Souza, Rayane da Silva Oliveira; Rocha, Ana Luíza Silva; Suesdek, Lincoln; Azevedo, Vasco; Tiwari, Sandeep; Rocha, Beatriz Gonçalves Silva; Birbrair, Alexander; Méndez, Erick Carvalho; Luiz, Wilson Barros; Amorim, Jaime Henrique",Front Immunol,452,1

DATA: A 2017 internal review into the 2017 attacks was undertaken by police and MI5, yielding 104 recommendations for improved practices. This list was later complemented by multiple reviews in 2018–2020 that led to more than 400 further recommendations for multiple counter terrorism partners. METHODS: Thematic analysis of these 500 + recommendations led to the author’s distillation, as a participant observer, of 8 key focal points for future efforts to prevent terrorist attacks. FINDINGS: Eight themes uniting the recommendations for developing future CT practice emerged from the internal reviews, raising complex issues of (1) data, (2) partnerships, (3) right-wing terrorism, (4) the 625,000 crowded public spaces in the UK, (5) online harm, (6) management of convicted terrorists, (7) domestic growth of terrorism replacing overseas direction and (8) earlier onset of terrorist commitments, from age 13. CONCLUSIONS: These thematic findings led to four conclusions: (a) the Protect Duty will provide an improved framework for countering terrorism, (b) we must adapt to the changing nature of terrorists, (c) we must increase our efforts against online harm and (d) we must renew and sustain our commitment to the Prevent pillar of the CONTEST strategy, which is now and shall be fit for purpose.","Basu, Neil",Camb J Evid Based Polic,452,1

Over time, game species tend to accumulate 137Cs by two orders of magnitude more than farm animals. This occurs especially in places heavily contaminated, thus meat products made out of local game should be treated with caution. One of such areas, known as the Opole Anomaly, is located in South-Western Poland and represents one of most 137Cs contaminated regions across Europe after the Chernobyl accident. The aim of the study was to find out the 137Cs activity in soil and local game, the value of the soil-to-game aggregated transfer factor and to assess the effective dose of the ionising radiation (Eeff) received by consumers of local game meat in years 2012-2019. We examined meat of three common game species: red deer, roe deer and wild boar for 137Cs activity. 137Cs activity in meat samples ranged from 0.14 to 592 Bq kg-1. The aggregated transfer factor (Tag) in game ranged from 0.006 to 0.01 m2 kg-1 f.w. for wild boar, 0.005-0.008 m2 kg-1 f.w. for roe deer, and 0.003-0.004 m2 kg-1 f.w. for red deer. The effective dose received by people who regularly consume local game meat ranged from less than 14.2 µSv y-1 to 134 µSv y-1, depending on the amount of differently contaminated game meat consumed annually. Even those for whom game is the only source of meat, consumption of wild boar along with local mushrooms and bilberries will, since 2012, not exceed the regulation limit of 137Cs at the level of 1 mSv y-1.

Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low. We suggest the use of appropriate markers to assess the Se status of COVID-19 patients and possible supplementation may be beneficial in limiting the severity of symptoms, especially in countries where Se status is regarded as sub-optimal.","Bermano, Giovanna; Méplan, Catherine; Mercer, Derry K; Hesketh, John E",Br J Nutr,452,16

It has affected more than 5 million patients worldwide and resulted in an alarming number of deaths globally. While clinical characteristics have been reported elsewhere, data from our region is scarce. We investigated the clinical characteristics of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Data of 401 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected from 22 April 2020 to 21 May 2020 at five tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The patients were divided into four groups according to age, Group 1: 0-<18 years, Group 2: 18-<50 years, Group 3: 50-60 years, and Group 4: >60 years; and their clinical symptoms were compared. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age in years was 10.5 (1.5-16) in group I, 34 (29-41) in group II, 53 (51-56) in group III, and 66 (61-76) in group IV. Most patients were male (80%, n = 322) and of Arabian or Asian descent. The median length of stay in the hospital was 10 (8-17) days (range 3-42 days). The most common symptoms were cough (53.6%), fever (36.2%), fatigue (26.4%), dyspnea (21.9%), and sore throat (21.9%). Hypertension was the most common underlying comorbidity (14.7%), followed by obesity (11.5%), and diabetes (10%). Hypertensive patients were less likely to present with shortness of breath, cough, sputum, diarrhea, and fever. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the symptoms among different age groups and comorbidities were mostly seen in the older age group. Interestingly, hypertensive patients were found to have milder symptoms and a shorter length of stay. Further larger collaborative national studies are required to effectively understand clinical characteristics in our part of the world to efficiently manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Al-Omari, Awad; Alhuqbani, Waad N; Zaidi, Abdul Rehman Z; Al-Subaie, Maha F; AlHindi, Alanoud M; Abogosh, Ahmed K; Alrasheed, Aljwhara K; Alsharafi, Aya A; Alhuqbani, Mohammed N; Salih, Samer; Alhedaithy, Mogbil A; Abdulqawi, Rayid; Ismail, Alaa F; Alhumaid, Saad; Hamdan, Noura; Saad, Fares; Olhaye, Fahad A; Eltahir, Tarig A; Alomari, Mohammed; Alshehery, Maied; Yassiri, Aziz; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Al Mutair, Abbas",J Infect Public Health,452,1

This study aims to understand social media's effect on the general public's fear, degree of adopting precautionary behaviors, and compliance with health authorities' regulations during the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Jordan during the early period of COVID-19 pandemic. 827 individuals completed the questionnaire. Factors that had a significant association with increased fear included female gender (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.8-3.7), married status (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.4), following medical pages on social media (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.42), and sharing of COVID-19 information on social media (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.8-7.1). The variables that were significantly associated with higher levels of precautionary behaviors were knowledge score (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.07-1.3), feeling of fear (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.71-3.), and following medical pages on social media (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.8-4.24). Regarding compliance with health officials' regulations, social media as a source of information and sharing information were significantly associated with lower odds of compliance with the Ministry of Health's regulations (OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.5 and OR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25-0.8, respectively). Social media is an essential platform for risk communication during pandemics. It plays a positive role in spreading knowledge and promotes certain preventive behaviors among the public. However, it may spread fear and encourage disruptive behaviors, which might be propagated by sharing the pandemic's news.","Yassin, Ahmed; AlOmari, Maryam; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Karasneh, Reema; Abu-Ismail, Luai; Soudah, Ola",Int J Environ Health Res,452,20

The trajectory and dosage plan are optimized taking collision and light occlusion constraints into account. We propose a two-stage scheme to approximate the solution of the induced NP-hard optimization, and, for efficiency, perform key irradiance and occlusion calculations on a GPU.

Here we extend an existing echo chambers model with activity driven agents onto a bi-layer topology. This new topological context allows us to indicate possible consequences of interacting groups. Three different cases of inter-layer couplings are presented - unidirectional coupling that can be reduced to a mono-layer facing an external bias, symmetric and non-symmetric couplings. When initial conditions for agent opinions are different for both layers the system can reach a state corresponding to a neutral consensus, a radicalisation, a polarization and even opinion oscillations. The polarized state can exist without explicit homophilic interactions provided the coupling strength between agents belonging to different layers is weak enough. When coupling constants between the layers are of different signs the system exhibits sustained or decaying oscillations. Transitions between these states in terms of bifurcation theory are identified and analysed using a mean field model.","Gajewski, Lukasz G.; Sienkiewicz, Julian; Holyst, Janusz A.",,452,9

RESULTS: Excess purchases due to confinement during 2020 were 178 g of alcohol per 100 households per day (adjusted for numbers of adults in each household) above an expected base of 438 g based on averaged 2015-2018 data, representing a 40.6% increase. However, when adjusting for expected normal purchases from on-licenced premises (i.e. bars, restaurants, etc.), there was evidence for no excess purchases of grams of alcohol (a 0.7% increase). With these adjustments, beer purchases dropped by 40%, wine purchases increased by 15% and spirits purchases by 22%. Excess purchases increased the richer the household and the lower the age of the main shopper. Confinement was associated with a shift in purchases from lower to higher strength beers. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 confinement, the evidence suggests that households did not buy more alcohol for the expected time of the year, when adjusting for what they normally would have purchased from on-licenced premises.","Anderson, P.; Llopis, E.

Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically-induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically-induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically-induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy. METHODS: We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically-induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended ex vivo studies of excitability to in vivo studies of muscle stiffness. RESULTS: As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically-induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4-null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically-induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically-induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia in vivo by approximately 80%. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically- and mechanically-induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia in vivo. Elimination of mechanically-induced myotonia by TRPV4 inhibition offers a new approach to treating myotonia. This article is protected by copyright.

We assessed confirmed COVID-19 cases at a SNF impacted by COVID-19 in the United States to identify early indications of COVID-19 infection. Methods We performed retrospective reviews of electronic health records for residents with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during February 28–March 16, 2020. Records were abstracted for co-morbidities, signs and symptoms, and illness outcomes during the two weeks before and after the date of positive specimen collection. Relative Risks (RR) of hospitalization and death were calculated. Results Of the 118 residents tested among approximately 130 residents from Facility A during February 28 – March 16, 2020, 101 (86%) were found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. At initial presentation, about two thirds of SARS-Cov-2-positive residents had an abnormal vital sign or change in oxygen status. Most (90.2%) symptomatic residents had elevated temperature, change in mental status, lethargy, change in oxygen status, or cough; nine (11.0%) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath during their clinical course. Those with change in oxygen status had an increased relative risk of 30-day mortality (51.1% vs. 29.7%, RR: 1.7 [1.0-3.0]). RR of hospitalization was higher for residents with underlying hepatic disease (1.6 [95% CI: 1.1-2.2]) or obesity (1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2.1]); RR of death was not statistically significant. Conclusions and implications Our findings reinforce the critical role that monitoring of signs and symptoms can have in identifying COVID-19 cases early. SNFs should ensure they have a systematic approach for responding to abnormal vital signs and oxygen saturation and consider ensuring common signs and symptoms identified in Facility A are among those they monitor.","Tobolowsky, Farrell A.; Bardossy, Ana C.; Currie, Dustin W.; Schwartz, Noah G.; Zacks, Rachael L.T.; Chow, Eric J.; Dyal, Jonathan W.; Ali, Hammad; Kay, Meagan; Duchin, Jeffrey S.; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Clark, Shauna; Sykes, Kaitlyn; Jernigan, John A.; Honein, Margaret A.; Clark, Thomas A.; Stone, Nimalie D.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Rao, Agam K.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,452,16

However, there is huge heterogeneity among individuals in their willingness to wear face masks during an epidemic. This research aims to investigate the individual heterogeneity to wear face masks and its associated predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing was not mandatory. Based on a survey of 708 Malaysian adults and a multivariate least-squares fitting analysis, the results reveal a significant variance among individuals in wearing masks, as 34% of the individual adults did not always wear masks in public places. Female individuals, individuals who wash their hands more frequently, and those who reported more availability of personal protective equipment were more likely to practice mask-wearing. The identification of less-compliant groups of mask wearing has critical implications by enabling more specific health communication campaigns.","Zhang, Stephen X; Looi, Kim Hoe; Li, Nicolas; Wan, Xue; Li, Jizhen",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,452,4

This is the first study that investigates the potential health risks of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) workers. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effects of different stages of the pandemic in terms of percentage of infected population on the probability of infection to WWTP workers. A dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1 (as a surrogate pathogen) is assumed in the QMRA for SARS-CoV-2 using an exponential model with k = 4.1 × 102. Literature data are incorporated to inform assumptions for calculating the viral load, develop the model, and derive a tolerable infection risk. Results reveal that estimates of viral RNA in sewage at the entrance of WWTPs ranged from 4.14 × 101 to 5.23 × 103 GC·mL−1 (viable virus concentration from 0.04 to 5.23 PFU·mL−1, respectively). In addition, estimated risks for the aggressive and extreme scenarios (2.6 × 10−3 and 1.3 × 10−2, respectively) were likely to be above the derived tolerable infection risk for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.5 × 10−4 pppy, thus reinforcing the concern of sewage systems as a possible transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2. These findings are helpful as an early health warning tool and in prioritizing upcoming risk management strategies, such as Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) for water and sanitation operators during the COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Zaneti, Rafael Newton; Girardi, Viviane; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Mena, Kristina; Westphalen, Ana Paula Campos; da Costa Colares, Evandro Ricardo; Pozzebon, Allan Guedes; Etchepare, Ramiro Gonçalves",Sci Total Environ,452,22

In Italy, all deaths of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 are defined as COVID-19-related, without considering pre-existing diseases that may either contribute to or even cause death. Our study included nine subjects from two different nursing homes (Cases 1–4, Group A; Cases 5–9, Group B). The latter included patients who presumably died from CO poisoning due to a heating system malfunction. All subjects tested positive for COVID-19 both ante- and post-mortem and were examined using post-mortem computed tomography prior to autopsy. COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing cause in the deaths of four out of nine subjects (death due to COVID-19; i.e., pneumonia and sudden cardiac death). In the other five cases, for which CO poisoning was identified as the cause of death, the infection presumably had no role in exitus (death with COVID-19). In our attempt to classify our patients as dying with or due to COVID-19, we found the use of complete assessments (both histological analyses and computed tomography examination) fundamental.","De-Giorgio, Fabio; Grassi, Vincenzo M.; Bergamin, Eva; Cina, Alessandro; Del Nonno, Franca; Colombo, Daniele; Nardacci, Roberta; Falasca, Laura; Conte, Celeste; d’Aloja, Ernesto; Damiani, Gianfranco; Vetrugno, Giuseppe",Int J Environ Res Public Health,452,1

Precise and quick analysis of 10X single-cell immunoglobulin repertoires remains a challenge owing to the high diversity of immunoglobulin repertoires and a lack of specialized software that can analyze such diverse data. FINDINGS: In this study, specialized software for 10X single-cell immunoglobulin repertoire analysis was developed. SCIGA (Single-Cell Immunoglobulin Repertoire Analysis) is an easy-to-use pipeline that performs read trimming, immunoglobulin sequence assembly and annotation, heavy and light chain pairing, statistical analysis, visualization, and multiple sample integration analysis, which is all achieved by using a 1-line command. Then SCIGA was used to profile the single-cell immunoglobulin repertoires of 9 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Four neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified from these repertoires. CONCLUSIONS: SCIGA provides a complete and quick analysis for 10X single-cell V(D)J sequencing datasets. It can help researchers to interpret B-cell immunoglobulin repertoires with paired heavy and light chain.","Ye, Haocheng; Cheng, Lin; Ju, Bin; Xu, Gang; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Shuye; Wang, Lifei; Zhang, Zheng",Gigascience,452,1

Adolescents aged 12–18 years compiled an online questionnaire designed through validated diagnostic instruments. We enrolled 1262 adolescents who declared that they had not experienced any previous traumatic events. Participants were divided into two groups: 118 adolescents with psychiatric problems (APP+) and 1144 without (APP−). In total, 79.52% reported isolated COVID‐19‐related ASD (29.48%) or PTSD symptoms (50.04%). One adolescent met the diagnosis of COVID‐19‐related ASD and two met the diagnosis of COVID‐19‐related PTSD, according to DSM‐5. Adolescents with subthreshold COVID‐19‐related ASD and PTSD symptoms referred the highest levels of personal stress and adolescents with psychiatric/psychological conditions experienced higher stress. Health measures should be urgently employed prioritizing psychosocial stressors among adolescent population.","Mensi, Martina M.; Capone, Luca; Rogantini, Chiara; Orlandi, Marika; Ballante, Elena; Borgatti, Renato",J Community Psychol,452,1
