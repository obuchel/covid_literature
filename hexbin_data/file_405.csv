3293,3293,3293,Frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in horses recently imported to the United States,20.79736,9.021199,2018-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Imported horses that have undergone recent long distance transport might represent a serious risk for spreading infectious respiratory pathogens into populations of horses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in recently imported horses. ANIMALS: All imported horses with signed owner consent (n = 167) entering a USDA quarantine for contagious equine metritis from October 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled in the study. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine. Samples were assayed for equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type‐1, −2, −4, and −5 (EHV‐1, −2, −4, −5), equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV), and B (ERBV) and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Equine herpesviruses were detected by qPCR in 52% of the study horses including EHV‐2 (28.7%), EHV‐5 (40.7%), EHV‐1 (1.2%), and EHV‐4 (3.0%). Clinical signs were not correlated with being qPCR‐positive for EHV‐4, EHV‐2, or EHV‐5. None of the samples were qPCR‐positive for EIV, ERAV, ERBV, and S. equi. The qPCR assay failed quality control for RNA viruses in 25% (46/167) of samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qPCR positive status for EHV‐2, −4, and −5. The importance of γ‐herpesviruses (EHV‐2 and 5) in respiratory disease is poorly understood. Equine herpesvirus type‐1 or 4 (EHV‐1 or EHV‐4) were detected in 4.2% of horses, which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses. Biosecurity measures are important when introducing recently imported horses into resident US populations of horses.","Smith, Fauna Leah; Watson, Johanna L.; Spier, Sharon J.; Kilcoyne, Isabelle; Mapes, Samantha; Sonder, Claudia; Pusterla, Nicola",J Vet Intern Med,405,22

Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS: Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category ‘other poultry’. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.","Hogerwerf, Lenny; Roof, Inge; de Jong, Marianne J.

The introduction of free bile acids, cholic acid (CA) at concentrations over 2 mM and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) over 1 mM inhibited colloidal carbon pinocytosis. CA and CDCA at concentrations over 0.5 mM inhibited IgG-coated sheep red blood cell phagocytosis. With the application of conjugated bile acid and endotoxin at concentrations over 50 μg/ml, endocytic function was inhibited. With bile acids, a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of β-glucuronidase occurred in the culture medium, and with endotoxin a timedependent increase in β-glucuronidase was noted. Bile acids produced alterations in cell organelles before destruction of the cell membrane. The presence of endotoxin led to the appearance of large vacuoles in the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that bile acids and endotoxin inhibit Kupffer cells by different mechanisms. We tentatively conclude that bile acids rather than endotoxin influence Kupffer cells in vivo.","Takiguchi, Satoshi; Koga, Akitoshi",Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,405,1

However, the biological role(s) of viral RNA m(6)A remains elusive. Using human metapneumovirus (hMPV) as a model, we demonstrate that m(6)A serves as a molecular marker for innate immune discrimination of self from nonself RNAs. We show that hMPV RNAs are m(6)A methylated and that viral m(6)A methylation promotes hMPV replication and gene expression. Inactivating m(6)A addition sites with synonymous mutations or demethylase resulted in m(6)A deficient recombinant hMPVs and virion RNAs that induced significantly higher expression of type I interferon (IFN) which was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I, not MDA5. Mechanistically, m(6)A-deficient virion RNA induces higher expression of RIG-I, binds more efficiently to RIG-I, and facilitates the conformational change of RIG-I, leading to enhanced IFN expression. Furthermore, m(6)A-deficient rhMPVs triggered higher IFN in vivo and were significantly attenuated in cotton rats yet retained high immunogenicity. Collectively, our results highlight that (i) virus acquires m(6)A in their RNAs as a means of mimicking cellular RNA to avoid detection by innate immunity; and (ii) viral RNA m(6)A can serve as a target to attenuate hMPV for vaccine purposes.","Lu, Mijia; Zhang, Zijie; Xue, Miaoge; Zhao, Boxuan Simen; Harder, Olivia; Li, Anzhong; Liang, Xueya; Gao, Thomas Z.; Xu, Yunsheng; Zhou, Jiyong; Feng, Zongdi; Niewiesk, Stefan; Peeples, Mark E.; He, Chuan; Li, Jianrong",Nat Microbiol,405,22
14358,14358,14358,RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS OF THE 30th ECVIM‐CA ONLINE CONGRESS: 2‐5 September 2020,20.939041,9.320684,2020-10-17,"BACKGROUND: Two-thirds of patients with early breast cancer undergo breast-conserving treatment (BCT). Aesthetic outcome is important and has long term implications for psychosocial wellbeing. The aesthetic goal of BCT is symmetry for which there is no gold-standard measure. Panel scoring is the most widely adopted assessment but has well-described limitations. This paper describes a model to objectively report aesthetic outcome using measures derived from 3-dimensional surface images (3D-SI). METHOD: Objective measures and panel assessment were undertaken independently for 3D-SI of women who underwent BCT 1–5 years previously. Univariate analysis was used to test for association between measures and panel score. A forward stepwise multiple linear regression model was fitted to identify 3D measurements that jointly predicted the mean panel score. The fitted model coefficients were used to predict mean panel scores for an independent validation set then compared to the mean observed panel score. RESULTS: Very good intra-panel reliability was observed for the training and validation sets (wκ = 0.87, wκ = 0.84). Six 3D-measures were used in the multivariate model. There was a good correlation between the predicted and mean observed panel score in the training (n = 190) and validation (n = 100) sets (r = 0.68, r = 0.65). The 3D model tended to predict scores towards the median. The model was calibrated which improved the distribution of predicted scores. CONCLUSION: A six-variable objective aesthetic outcome model for BCT has been described and validated. This can predict and could replace panel assessment, facilitating the independent and unbiased evaluation of aesthetic outcome to communicate and compare results, benchmark practice, and raise standards.","Godden, Amy R.; O’Connell, Rachel L.; Barry, Peter A.; Krupa, Katherine C.

In this study, we deployed a multifaceted community education programme to educate students, healthcare professionals and members of the public in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, India about the dangers of SBE, appropriate first aid measures and the ‘do’s and don’ts’ following a snakebite. An assessment of prior knowledge within these communities identified several misconceptions concerning snakes and SBE. Using a combination of direct engagement (estimated to reach over 200,000 people), information leaflets (200,000 distributed), posters, video documentaries, media and social media (>2.8 million engagements), over the course of one year (January to December 2019) we reached over 3 million people in rural Tamil Nadu (around 8% of population). Evaluation of community-based assemblies indicated that at least 90% of attendees were able to recall the key messages at the end of the events, and at least 85% were able to recall the key messages even after 12 months. Due to high demand, a one-day symposium was organised to provide clinical knowledge and training on SBE to 250 healthcare professionals in rural Tamil Nadu. Notably, an assessment of patient data (291 victims) collected from a snakebite referral hospital over the same 12-month period (2019) indicated that arrival time at hospital following a snakebite was significantly faster and the effective first aid measures were administered to patients who were aware of our activities compared to those that were not. Overall, our approach provides a framework on how to educate rural communities about the dangers of SBE and thereby, mitigate delayed SBE treatment leading to an overall reduction in SBE-induced mortality, morbidity, treatment costs and other socio-economic ramifications.","Samuel, Stephen Paul; Chinnaraju, Soundararaj; Williams, Harry F.; Pichamuthu, Elamaran; Subharao, Mangaiyarkkarasai; Vaiyapuri, Mohanraj; Arumugam, Sundhararajan; Vaiyapuri, Rajendran; Baksh, M.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of depressive disorders. Some people share information about their experiences with antidepressants on social media platforms such as Twitter. Analysis of the messages posted by Twitter users under SSRI treatment can yield useful information on how these antidepressants affect users’ behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the behavioral and linguistic characteristics of the tweets posted while users were likely to be under SSRI treatment, in comparison to the tweets posted by the same users when they were less likely to be taking this medication. METHODS: In the first step, the timelines of Twitter users mentioning SSRI antidepressants in their tweets were selected using a list of 128 generic and brand names of SSRIs. In the second step, two datasets of tweets were created, the in-treatment dataset (made up of the tweets posted throughout the 30 days after mentioning an SSRI) and the unknown-treatment dataset (made up of tweets posted more than 90 days before or more than 90 days after any tweet mentioning an SSRI). For each user, the changes in behavioral and linguistic features between the tweets classified in these two datasets were analyzed. 186 users and their timelines with 668,842 tweets were finally included in the study. RESULTS: The number of tweets generated per day by the users when they were in treatment was higher than it was when they were in the unknown-treatment period (P=.001). When the users were in treatment, the mean percentage of tweets posted during the daytime (from 8 AM to midnight) increased in comparison to the unknown-treatment period (P=.002). The number of characters and words per tweet was higher when the users were in treatment (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). Regarding linguistic features, the percentage of pronouns that were first-person singular was higher when users were in treatment (P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and linguistic changes have been detected when users with depression are taking antidepressant medication. These features can provide interesting insights for monitoring the evolution of this disease, as well as offering additional information related to treatment adherence. This information may be especially useful in patients who are receiving long-term treatments such as people suffering from depression.","Leis, Angela; Ronzano, Francesco; Mayer, Miguel Angel; Furlong, Laura I; Sanz, Ferran",J Med Internet Res,405,1

METHODS: This study plans to compare maternal cefuroxime concentrations (plasma and adipose tissue), at the time of skin incision and time of skin closure during a caesarean section from non-obese (body mass index BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) pregnant women. The incidence of post-surgical site infection will also be measured. At least 15 participants are required for each arm (non-obese vs obese) with a total of 30 participants. The study participants will be followed up between 30 and 40 days post-caesarean section to record details of any post-caesarean surgical infection to explore correlations between BMI, measured cefuroxime concentrations and post-caesarean infection rates. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will allow the development of a model testing the inter-patient variability in plasma and adipose tissue concentrations of cefuroxime. The results will facilitate the development of a larger study to determine whether differences in cefuroxime plasma and tissue concentration in obese and non-obese women can support the development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. This model can then be used to propose dosing adjustments that can be used in a further trial to optimise cefuroxime dosing for women undergoing caesarean section.

Dysregulated PD-1:PD-L1 binding interactions occur during the pathogenesis of glomerulopathies and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The regulation of these molecules in the kidney is important to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies that treat RCC and may induce glomerulopathies as an adverse event. METHODS: The expression and function of PD-1 molecules on immune and kidney parenchymal cells were reviewed in the healthy kidney, PD-1 immunotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, glomerulopathies and RCC. RESULTS: PD-1 and/or its ligands are expressed on kidney macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Vitamin D3, glutathione and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulate hypoxic cell signals involved in the expression and function of PD-1 molecules. These pathways are altered in kidney disease and are linked to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-23, and chemokines that bind CXCR3, CXCR4, and/or CXCR7. These factors are differentially produced in glomerulonephritis and RCC and may be important biomarkers in patients that receive PD-1 therapies and/or develop glomerulonephritis as an adverse event CONCLUSION: By comparing the functions of the PD-1 axis in glomerulopathies and RCC, we identified similar chemokines involved in the recruitment of immune cells and distinct mediators in T cell differentiation. The expression and function of PD-1 and PD-1 ligands in diseased tissue and particularly on double-negative T cells and parenchymal kidney cells needs continued exploration. The possible regulation of the PD-1 axis by vitamin D3, glutathione and/or AMPK cell signals may be important to kidney disease and the PD-1 immunotherapeutic response.","Curran, Colleen S.; Kopp, Jeffrey B.",BMC Nephrol,405,1

Since little is known about empathy and well-being before students enter medical school—during pre-medical education—the main goal of this study is to test a conceptual model of how clinical empathy is related to two indicators of well-being, depression, and burnout among pre-medical students. The theoretical model hypothesizes that three dimensions of clinical empathy—Perspective-Taking, Compassionate Care, and Standing in Patients’ Shoes— will be directly and negatively related to depression, as well as indirectly through its inverse relationship with three facets of burnout, Emotional Exhaustion, Poor Academic Efficacy, and Cynicism. METHODS: Using survey data from a sample of 132 pre-medical students at an American Midwestern university, this study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the theoretical model of the relationships between empathy, burnout, and depression among pre-medical students. We identify the direct effects of the three dimensions of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE-S) on depression (CES-D), as well as the indirect effects of clinical empathy on depression through the three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-S). RESULTS: SEM analyses show that while none of the three dimensions of the JSE-S are directly related to depression, clinical empathy does significantly affect depression indirectly through burnout. Specifically, as predicted, we find that Perspective-Taking decreases Emotional Exhaustion, but, contrary to expectations, Compassionate Care increases it. And, the positive relationship between Compassionate Care and Emotional Exhaustion is particularly strong. In turn, Perspective-Taking and Compassionate Care are associated with depression in opposite directions and to different degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical empathy as measured by the JSE-S produces both positive and negative effects on personal well-being. We conclude that further conceptual clarity of clinical empathy is needed to better discern how the different dimensions impact different indicators of well-being. Given that pre-medical education is a crucial time for emotional socialization, the challenge for medical education will be fostering the positive, cognitive aspects of clinical empathy while simultaneously mitigating the adverse effects of affective empathy on medical student well-being.","MacArthur, Kelly Rhea; Stacey, Clare L.; Harvey, Sarah; Markle, Jonathan",BMC Med Educ,405,22

Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) account for more than half of the world’s TB cases. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) remains the only vaccine available despite its variable efficacy. Promising antigen-based vaccines have been proposed as prophylactic and/or immunotherapeutic approaches to boost BCG vaccination. Relevant antigens must interact with the range of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules present in target populations; yet this information is currently not available. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for articles published during 2013-2020 to measure the allelic frequencies of HLA-DRB1 in the BRICS. RESULTS: In total, 67 articles involving 3,207,861 healthy individuals were included in the meta-analysis. HLA-DRB1 alleles *03, *04, *07, *11, *13, and *15 were consistently identified at high frequencies across the BRICS, with a combined estimated frequency varying from 52% to 80%. HLA-DRB1 alleles *01, *08, *09, *10, *12, and *14 were found to be relevant in only one or two BRICS populations. CONCLUSIONS: By combining these alleles, it is possible to ensure at least 80% coverage throughout the BRICS populations.","Sarno, Alice; Daltro, Cleidiane Borges; Mendes, Carlos Mauricio Cardeal; Barbosa, Theolis",,405,1

The findings suggest that extant literature mostly lacked sound theoretical underpinnings. More work adopting appropriate and proven theoretical approaches is needed. Most of the reviewed papers also focused mainly on issues relating to the technology itself than those relating to the enterprise or the entrepreneur. The capabilities and capacities of enterprises, as well as the strategies in implementing digital technologies and harnessing the opportunities of digitalization, are key issues that have not hitherto received much attention. The study contributes to the understanding of the conceptualization of the digital entrepreneurship phenomenon.

At the same time, coronavirus may also trigger and intensify armed conflict due to its negative economic consequences and by offering windows of opportunity to opposition movements to attack distracted and weakened incumbents. We use real-time data on the spread of Covid-19, governmental lockdown policies, and battle events to study the causal short-term effect of the pandemic on armed conflict. Our results suggest that both the spread of Covid-19 and lockdown policies exhibit a global Null effect with considerable regional heterogeneity. Most importantly, governmental lockdowns have increased armed conflict in the Middle East. In contrast, reported combat has decreased in Southeast Asia and the Caucasus as the pandemic has spread.","Mehrl, Marius; Thurner, Paul W",Political Studies Review,405,22

However, the SDG agenda is not without flaws. Even before the pandemic, progress towards achieving the SDGs has been too slow. COVID-19 presents a stress test for the SDG approach. The SDG agenda provides three ‘logics’ that could help transform towards sustainable societies: (1) a governance logic that sets goals, adopts policies, and tracks progress to steer impacts; (2) a systems (nexus) logic that manages SDG interactions; and (3) a strategic logic that enables (micro-level) companies to develop strategies that impact (macro-level) policy goals. We discuss key hurdles that each of these SDG logics face.

At our institution’s NPT program, teachers are recruited and trained in the final block of their first year, involving simultaneous learning and teaching of Immunology and Microbiology content to classmates. This year, in-person training and teaching was conducted virtually due to COVID19. This study aims to understand how NPT in a newly virtual curriculum impacted student experiences of learning infectious disease content. METHODS: We conducted one-on-one interviews with student-learners and direct-peer student-teachers at the end of their first year in June 2020. Using constructivist grounded theory, we coded, reconciled, and analyzed interview transcripts to identify themes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of interviews with students (n=5) and near-peer teachers (n=7) yielded the following themes: 1.Optimized learning environment: Direct peer teaching leads to students feeling more personally invested in their peers’ lessons and wellbeing, creating a safe community and increased engagement despite the virtual format and recordings. 2.Benefits of education technology: Teachers employed creative virtual learning modalities to promote students’ mastery of challenging memorization-based microbiology content. 3.COVID-19 relevance: Learning microbiology and immunology content synchronously with the COVID pandemic conferred more content relevance, but presented academic challenges due to social and personal stressors. 4.Educator development: Despite the difficulty of occupying a dual student-teacher role, teachers derived many benefits from teaching, including improved communication skills, which extended to the clinic, content mastery, and increased confidence. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented disruptions in medical education. However, the shift to virtual direct peer teaching presented an opportunity for creative virtual teaching strategies and increased lesson accessibility via recordings. Unexpectedly, virtual lessons were perceived as non-inferior to in-person lessons. Findings from this study support the use of virtual near-peer teaching programs in infectious diseases medical education.

Child health experts have stated that school closures may have profound psychosocial consequences for students and need further study. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To identify how COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations impacted the health of adolescent athletes. METHODS: Adolescent athletes in Wisconsin were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in May 2020 while schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PHQ-9, PFABS and PedsQL scores were compared with historical data (HD) of Wisconsin adolescent athletes (N = 5,231) collected during normal school and sport operations in the years 2016–2018. RESULTS: A total of 3,243 (58% female, Age = 16.1+1.2 yrs., grades 9 – 12) participated in the study. May 2020 participants reported higher (worse) PHQ-9 scores than the HD participants (mean: 8.0 (95%CI: 7.8, 8.2) vs 3.3 (3.1, 3.5), p < 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depression (32.9% vs 9.7%, p < 0.001). May 2020 Participants also reported lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean: 12.2 (95%CI: 11.9, 12.5) vs 24.7 (24.5, 24.9) p < 0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to athletes in the HD group (78.4 (78.0, 78.8) vs. 90.9 (90.5, 91.3) p < 0.001). Females in May 2020 reported increased moderate and severe anxiety percentages than the males in May 2020 (27.7% vs 22.3%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations in Wisconsin were associated with increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased physical activity and quality of life in adolescent athletes. The potential negative health impacts of prolonged school closures and sport cancellations should be taken into account when evaluating steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.","McGuine, Timothy; Biese, Kevin; Hetzel, Scott; Kliethermes, Stephanie; Reardon, Claudia; Bell, David; Brooks, M Alison; Watson, Andrew",Orthop J Sports Med,405,1

With this hypothesis as base, we used the online analysis tool SYFPEITHI to predict seven epitopes from this region with potential to bind H2 proteins. We performed proliferation tests and quantified reactive T lymphocytes applying a cytometry analysis, using samples from draining lymph node of lesions from L. (L.) amazonensis-infected mice. To define reactivity of T cells, we used complexes of DimerX (H2 D(b):Ig and H2 L(d):Ig) and the putative epitopes. Additionally, we applied surface plasmon resonance to verify real time interactions between the putative epitopes and DimerX proteins. Five peptides induced blastogenesis in BALB/c cells, while only two presented the same property in C57BL/6 mouse cells. In addition, our data indicate the existence of CD8+ T lymphocyte populations able to recognize each tested peptide in both murine strains. We observed an overlapping of results between the peptides that induced lymphocyte proliferation and those capable of binding to the DimerX in the surface plasmon resonance assays thus indicating that using these recombinant proteins in biosensing analyses is a promising tool to study real time molecular interactions in the context of major histocompatibility complex epitopes. The data gathered in this study reinforce the hypothesis that cyspep-derived peptides are important factors in the murine host infection by L.

In particular, we considered implantation procedure, device design, cost, and patient population. Generally cheaper and lower performing, classical disruptive innovations are first commercialized in insignificant markets, promise lower margins, and often parasitize existing usage, representing unattractive investments for established market participants. However, despite presently high unit cost, TAVI is less invasive, treats a ""new,"" generally high risk, patient population, and is generally done by a multidisciplinary integrated heart team. Moreover, at least in the short-term TAVI has not been lower-performing than open surgical aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients. We conclude that TAVI extends the paradigm of disruptive innovation and represents an attractive commercial opportunity space. Moreover, should the long-term performance and durability of TAVI approach that of conventional prostheses, TAVI will be an increasingly attractive commercial opportunity.","Berlin, David B; Davidson, Michael J; Schoen, Frederick J","Journal of biomedical materials research.

The present study aims to identify serum proteins modified in response to infection of HuN4, a HP-PRRSV strain isolated from a farm in 2006. 2-D DIGE analysis allowed for the detection of 19 differentially expressed protein spots, of which 18 were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. These 18 spots represented for a total of 9 proteins (6 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated), most of which belonged to the acute phase proteins in swine and showed a trend of regression in the late phase of the experiment. One of a series of AGP spots was identified for the first time to be decreased in acute phase of PRRSV infection in swine. But the whole level of the protein in the serum did not show significant changes by Western blot. The rising tendency of Hp was confirmed by Western blot and ELISA. These altered proteins were probably involved in the inflammatory process triggered by HuN4 and in alleviating the oxidative damage occurring in the process. In summary, these results may provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms of HP-PRRSV infection.","Yang, Yongqian; An, Tongqing; Gong, Daqing; Li, Dengyun; Peng, Jinmei; Leng, Chaoliang; Yuan, Zhonghua; Tong, Guangzhi; Tian, Zhijun; Zhang, Deli",Veterinary microbiology,405,8

To this end, we measured attributes of T. zebrina associated with plant growth and stress in the four seasons at the forest edge and in the forest interior of invaded sites in the Iguaçu National Park, Southern Brazil. The invasive plant had higher growth at the forest edge than in the forest interior and lower leaf asymmetry and herbivory in the winter than in the summer. Our findings suggest that the forest edge environment favours the growth of T. zebrina.

Host-elicited or passively-transferred monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are essential mediators of CHIKV clearance. Therefore, this study aimed to generate and characterize a panel of mAbs for their neutralization efficacy against CHIKV infection in a cell-based and murine model. To evaluate their antigenicity and neutralization profile, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a plaque reduction neutralization test were performed on mAbs of IgM isotype. CHIKV escape mutants against mAb 3E7b neutralization were generated, and reverse genetics techniques were then used to create an infectious CHIKV clone with a single mutation. 3E7b was also administered to neonate mice prior or after CHIKV infection. The survival rate, CHIKV burden in tissues and histopathology of the limb muscles were evaluated. Both IgM 3E7b and 8A2c bind strongly to native CHIKV surface and potently neutralize CHIKV replication. Further analyses of 3E7b binding and neutralization of CHIKV single-mutant clones revealed that N218 of CHIKV E2 protein is a potent neutralizing epitope. In a pre-binding neutralization assay, 3E7b blocks CHIKV attachment to permissive cells, possibly by binding to the surface-accessible E2-N218 residue. Prophylactic administration of 3E7b to neonate mice markedly reduced viremia and protected against CHIKV pathogenesis in various mice tissues. Given therapeutically at 4 h post-infection, 3E7b conferred 100% survival rate and similarly reduced CHIKV load in most mice tissues except the limb muscles. Collectively, these findings highlight the usefulness of 3E7b for future prophylactic or epitope-based vaccine design.","Lam, Shirley; Nyo, Min; Phuektes, Patchara; Yew, Chow Wenn; Tan, Yee Joo; Chu, Justin Jang Hann",mAbs,405,4

The etiology is classified in primary HLH (familiar or genetic) and secondary (infectious, oncological, and rheumatological diseases). AIM To analyze clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and follow-up rates in pediatric patients with HLH. METHODS A pediatric cohort of patients with HLH diagnosis attending in a tertiary hospital between January 2000 to February 2019 was analysed. RESULTS 23 hospitalized patients were recruited with a median of 36 months of age. The most frequent clinical and laboratory findings were fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia. The most frequent aetiologies were infectious (Epstein Barr virus and citomegalovirus) and rheumatological diseases. The global mortality was 35%, there was no significant difference between etiologies. DISCUSSION Considering the high mortality of HLH it is very important to have a high grade of suspicion that allows treating at an early stage.

This particular grouping of amino acids was suggested by Riddle and co-workers in 1997. The graphical representation is based on depicting sequentially the amino acids on five horizontal lines at equal separations. One-letter codes, B, O, U, X and Y, to which numerical values 1 to 5 have been assigned, are suggested as labels for the fictional amino acids that represent all the amino acids within each group. The approach is illustrated on ND6 proteins of eight species having from 168 to 175 amino acids. While visual inspection of the novel spectral graphical representations of proteins may reveal local similarities and dissimilarities of protein sequences, arithmetic manipulations of spectra offer an elegant route to graphic visualization of the degree of similarity for selected pairs of proteins.","Randić, M; Vracko, M; Novic, M; Plavsić, D",SAR and QSAR in environmental research,405,1

METHODS A total of 72 middle ear samples were collected from 25 children with OME (Group 1) and 47 individuals with no middle ear disease (Group 2). Multiplex real-time PCR was used to investigate the presence of 20 different respiratory viruses. Virus results were compared with bacteriome of the same populations. RESULTS At least one respiratory virus was detected in 56% of the patients in Group 1 and 12.8% of the individuals in Group 2. The viral co-infection rate for Group 1 and 2 was 8% and 2.1%, respectively. In Group 1, adenovirus was the most frequently detected virus with a rate of 24%, either alone (16%) or concurrent with other viruses (8%), followed by influenza B (12%), rhinovirus and bocavirus (8%) each. Parainfluenza 4, coronavirus OC43, and RSV A/B were detected in 4% of the sample each. In Group 2, rhinovirus was detected in 2 samples (4.3%) followed by adenovirus, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus E299, and coronavirus NL63 with a rate of 2.1% each. The detection rate of respiratory viruses was significantly higher in children aged 6 to 11 years. There was no positive association between virus and bacteria found in the middle ear cavity. CONCLUSION The current study has provided comprehensive data indicating the presence of diverse respiratory viruses in the healthy middle ear cavity. Our results also suggest that respiratory viruses might have a contribution to OME pathogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.

In response, the Canadian Association of Radiologists Resident & Fellow Section (CAR RFS) and Medical Student Network (MSN) developed and evaluated an online series for medical students to learn about Canadian radiology residency programs. METHODS Medical students from any year of training were recruited through the MSN, local radiology interest groups, and social media to attend a 2-week online series of interactive sessions via Zoom with program representatives from Canadian radiology residency programs. A survey evaluating the online series, in particular its impact on residency and career planning, was administered to program representatives and students. RESULTS Fifteen of Canada's 16 radiology residency programs participated in the online series. A total of 212 students attended at least one session and nearly half were participating in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) this year. The postsurvey revealed that 77% of students agreed that the online series helped prepare them for CaRMS and ranking programs. The online series also benefited pre-CaRMS students as significantly more students were considering radiology as a specialty on the postsurvey compared to the presurvey. Students and program representatives agreed that this series should be held in future years, regardless of whether health and travel restrictions are lifted. CONCLUSION The CAR RFS and MSN hosted an online series for medical students to learn about radiology residency programs outside their home institution. Feedback was highly positive with important implications for the future CaRMS iterations for any specialty.","Linehan, Victoria; Katlariwala, Prayash; Chahal, Baljot S; Khatchikian, Aline D; Supersad, Alanna; Dobson, Jessica L",Academic radiology,405,23

Wound dressings for today's chronic wounds come in many flavors, ranging from the classic types of moisture-retentive dressings to silver-coated varieties to biologic dressings serving as skin substitutes. Moisture-retentive dressing types include foams, films, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, and alginates. Appropriate use of these dressings can help to keep the wound bed moist, which allows for epithelial migration, angiogenesis, retention of growth factors, autolytic debridement, and maintenance of electrical gradients.","Powers, Jennifer Gloeckner; Morton, Laurel M; Phillips, Tania J",Dermatologic therapy,405,16

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..","Barua, Lingkan; Zaman, Muhammed Shahriar; Omi, Fardina Rahman; Faruque, Mithila",F1000Research,405,16

The increasing recognition of the huge impact of Raynaud's phenomenon and of digital ulceration on the everyday lives of patients with SSc has sparked enthusiasm internationally to develop better outcome measures and better treatments, and so a review is timely. RECENT FINDINGS There have been recent advances in the development of patient reported outcome instruments [e.g. the Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis-Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) instrument] and also in noninvasive imaging techniques, including thermography and laser Doppler methods. Improved outcome measures will facilitate future clinical trials, both early phase proof-of-concept and later phase trials. New insights have been gained into mechanisms of action and methods of administration of 'conventional' therapies, for example phosphodiesterase inhibitors and intravenous prostanoids. New treatment approaches are being investigated, including topical and procedural therapies. SUMMARY Clinicians can look forward to seeing these advances translating into clinical benefit over the next 5 years. To help ensure this, they should strive whenever possible to recruit patients with SSc-related digital vasculopathy into observational studies and clinical trials.","Herrick, Ariane L",Current opinion in rheumatology,405,31

The organization of health care services had to change because of this new disease, with the need to reallocate staff and materials, besides changing management protocols. A very important challenge is not to expose patients and health care workers to the risk of infection and not to waste personal protective equipment (PPE). In the field of interventional pulmonology, various aspects related to COVID-19 must be taken into great consideration. Although bronchoscopy is not a first-line test for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has a role in selected cases and it can be useful for differential diagnosis. However, bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, that's why its unjustified use could contribute to propagate the virus. For this reason, the utility of each procedure must be carefully evaluated, the patient has to be properly investigated before the procedure, which has to be performed with specific precautions, including adequate PPE. In this review, we summarize the knowledge and the principal statements about endoscopic activity in COVID-19 period, in both diagnosis of COVID-19 and management of patients. How to safely perform both bronchoscopic and pleural-related procedures (thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy and drainage of pleural effusions) is described with the aim to help the staff to decide when and how performing a procedure. We also highlight how interventional pulmonology could help in matter of complications related to COVID-19.","Piro, Roberto; Casalini, Eleonora; Livrieri, Francesco; Fontana, Matteo; Ghidoni, Giulia; Taddei, Sofia; Facciolongo, Nicola",Journal of thoracic disease,405,13

Patient Chosen Gap Payments (PCGPs) allow patients to specify a (voluntary) out-of-pocket contribution, creating an incentive for patient-centred care without the need for complex outcomes-based funding formulae. It is not yet known if widespread use of PCGP services is consistent with consumer preferences. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in a sample of the adult Australian general population (n = 1457) during April 2019 to simulate patient choice between alternative primary care services and describe preferences for PCGP services. Participants also completed a supplementary valuation task in which participants reported their intended PCGP contribution for PCGP services. Finally, we conducted policy-simulations to predict market shares when PCGP clinics operate alongside the two existing models of primary care funding in Australia. Results suggest that patients prefer shorter wait time, longer consults, lower compulsory copayments, services with higher patient satisfaction ratings, choice of doctor and $0 suggested voluntary contribution for PCGP services. Policy-simulations suggest that high-quality PCGP services could obtain market share of up to 39% and voluntary contributions of up to $25.36 per service (95%CI: $10.24, $40.47), potentially adding $1.48 billion AUD in revenues and funding for primary care at no cost to government. Low-quality PCGP services are unlikely to capture significant market share and PCGP contributions were lowest for low-quality PCGP services ($12.12, 95%CI: $2.09, $26.34). Further field testing is recommended where (i) patients make consequential choices (e.g. real payments for simulated services), and (ii) dynamic effects on quality of care and utilisation can be observed; particularly in vulnerable populations. We conclude that PCGP services aligned with patient preferences could capture significant market share and substantially increase revenue to general practice.","Epstein, D S; Barton, C; Mazza, D; Woode, M E; Mortimer, D",Social science & medicine,405,19

Our objective was to compare the outcomes of TEP inguinal hernia repair using either a single-port or conventional surgical technique, in two blind randomized groups of patients. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 100 patients undergoing surgery for unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized into two groups: One group underwent conventional laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair, while the other was selected for single-port TEP repair. Primary endpoint is postoperative pain (VAS), while secondary endpoints are recurrence, chronic pain and complications. RESULTS From 100 patients, 49 underwent single-port hernia TEP repair, 50 had conventional three-port TEP hernia repair, and one patient declined to participate after randomization. The two groups were comparable in terms of patient demographics and operative findings. Mean operative time was 49.1(±13.8) min in the conventional group and 54.1(±14.4) min in the single-port group (p = 0.08). Mean hospital stay was 19.7(±5.8) h in the conventional group and 20.5(±6.4) h in the single-port group (p = 0.489). No major complications and no recurrence reported at 11-month follow-up. No statistically significant difference noted in postoperative pain between the two groups at regular intervals.

Poor outcomes related to failure of fusion, however, have directed the interests of practitioners and scientists to spinal biologics that may impact fusion at the cellular level. These biologics are used to achieve successful arthrodesis in the treatment of symptomatic deformity or instability. Historically, autologous bone grafting, including iliac crest bong graft harvesting, had represented the gold standard in spinal arthrodesis. However, due to concerns over potential harvest site complications, supply limitations, and associated morbidity, surgeons have turned to other bone graft options known for their osteogenic, osteoinductive, and/or osteoconductive properties. Current bone graft selection includes autograft, allograft, demineralized bone matrix, ceramics, mesenchymal stem cells, and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein. Each pose their respective advantages and disadvantages and are the focus of ongoing research investigating the safety and efficacy of their use in the setting of spinal fusion. Rh-BMP2 has been plagued by issues of widespread off-label use, controversial indications, and a wide range of adverse effects. The risks associated with high concentrations of exogenous growth factors have led to investigational efforts into nanotechnology and its application in spinal arthrodesis through the binding of endogenous growth factors. Bone graft selection remains critical to successful fusion and favorable patient outcomes, and orthopaedic surgeons must be educated on the utility and limitations of various biologics in the setting of spine arthrodesis.","Kannan, Abhishek; Dodwad, Shah-Nawaz M; Hsu, Wellington K",Journal of spinal disorders & techniques,405,19

There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher in vaccinated individuals after a prior infection and in younger adults. With B.1.617.2, infections occurring after two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden as those in unvaccinated individuals.

OBJECTIVE The present work aimed to investigate the current engineering and administrative control measures, which are necessary to protect workers against COVID-19 in workplaces. METHODS The current strategies, including engineering control, administrative control, personal protective equipment, and their efficiencies, were reviewed and discussed. RESULTS Reviewing the literature indicated that a collection of control approaches should be implemented for an effective control of the virus. Control measures could be selected based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19. The results also revealed that relying solely on a specific control measure could not effectively control the outbreak.

Increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses to assess (1) the relationship between exposures or interventions in the first 1,000 days of life and CIMT in infants, children, and adolescents; and (2) the CIMT measurement methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS Systematic searches of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were performed from inception to March 2019. Observational and interventional studies evaluating factors at the individual, familial, or environmental levels, for instance, size at birth, gestational age, breastfeeding, mode of conception, gestational diabetes, or smoking, were included. Quality was evaluated based on study methodological validity (adjusted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale if observational; Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool if interventional) and CIMT measurement reliability. Estimates from bivariate or partial associations that were least adjusted for sex were used for pooling data across studies, when appropriate, using random-effects meta-analyses. The research protocol was published and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42017075169). Of 6,221 reports screened, 50 full-text articles from 36 studies (34 observational, 2 interventional) totaling 7,977 participants (0 to 18 years at CIMT assessment) were retained. Children born small for gestational age had increased CIMT (16 studies, 2,570 participants, pooled standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15 to 0.64, p: 0.001), I2: 83%). When restricted to studies of higher quality of CIMT measurement, this relationship was stronger (3 studies, 461 participants, pooled SMD: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.09 to 1.19, p: 0.024), I2: 86%). Only 1 study evaluating small size for gestational age was rated as high quality for all methodological domains. Children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) (3 studies, 323 participants, pooled SMD: 0.78 (95% CI: -0.20 to 1.75, p: 0.120), I2: 94%) or exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy (3 studies, 909 participants, pooled SMD: 0.12 (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.30, p: 0.205), I2: 0%) had increased CIMT, but the imprecision around the estimates was high. None of the studies evaluating these 2 factors was rated as high quality for all methodological domains. Two studies evaluating the effect of nutritional interventions starting at birth did not show an effect on CIMT. Only 12 (33%) studies were at higher quality across all domains of CIMT reliability. The degree of confidence in results is limited by the low number of high-quality studies, the relatively small sample sizes, and the high between-study heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS In our meta-analyses, we found several risk factors in the first 1,000 days of life that may be associated with increased CIMT during childhood. Small size for gestational age had the most consistent relationship with increased CIMT. The associations with conception through ART or with smoking during pregnancy were not statistically significant, with a high imprecision around the estimates. Due to the large uncertainty in effect sizes and the limited quality of CIMT measurements, further high-quality studies are needed to justify intervention for primordial prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).","Epure, Adina Mihaela; Rios-Leyvraz, Magali; Anker, Daniela; Di Bernardo, Stefano; da Costa, Bruno R; Chiolero, Arnaud; Sekarski, Nicole",PLoS medicine,405,1

Bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC, has been demonstrated to be involved in the susceptibility to parasite infections. However, few studies have analyzed this connection in more depth. The aim of this study was to determine if early BPA exposure in female mice affects the systemic immune response and the susceptibility to T. crassiceps infection. METHODS AND RESULTS BALB/cice were exposed to BPA at postnatal day 3. At 6 weeks of age, they were inoculated with T. crassiceps larvae, and 2 weeks later, were euthanized. The number of parasites was quantified. By flow cytometry, in the spleen, the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, the different innate and adaptive immune cell modulation was analyzed, and RT-PCR cytokine expression was also evaluated. BPA induced a reduction of 40% in parasite load. BPA treatment modulated some lineages of the innate immune response and caused slight changes in cells belonging to the adaptive immune response. Additionally, BPA enhanced the type 2 cytokine profile. CONCLUSION Neonatal BPA treatment in female mice affects not only the percentage of different immune cells but also theirex vivo cytokine gene expression., decreasing T. crassiceps cysticercosis susceptibility.","Nava-Castro, Karen Elizabeth; Togno-Peirce, Cristian; Palacios-Arreola, Margarita Isabel; Del Río-Araiza, Víctor Hugo; Hernández-Bello, Romel; Morales Montor, Jorge",Parasite immunology,405,1

The formation of NETs has been detected during infection in animal experiments, but their role in humans is unclear. The purposes of this study were to quantitatively evaluate the production of NETs during acute respiratory infection and to study the relationship between the NET length and various inflammatory mediators. We examined bronchial aspirates collected from nine intubated patients in an intensive care unit. Samples were collected at the onset of acute respiratory infection (day 0) and on days 1, 3-5, and 6-8. The NET length was visualised by immunohistochemistry and quantified using computer tracing software. The NET length was measured and compared at each time point. The length differed significantly between time points (p<0.001). NETs were significantly longer on day 1 than on day 0 (p<0.001). Neutrophils released NETs abundantly in response to respiratory infection and regression analysis showed that NET length correlated with six clinical parameters (white blood cells, platelets, lactate, CXC ligand-2, interleukin-8, and procalcitonin) as the explanatory variables. NETs in bronchial aspirates may reflect disease progression of respiratory infections. Quantification of NETs in bronchial aspirates may provide a new indicator of inflammation.","Hamaguchi, Shigeto; Hirose, Tomoya; Matsumoto, Naoya; Akeda, Yukihiro; Irisawa, Taro; Seki, Masafumi; Hosotsubo, Hideo; Yamamoto, Kouji; Tasaki, Osamu; Oishi, Kazunori; Shimazu, Takeshi; Tomono, Kazunori",The European respiratory journal,405,24

Over the last two decades, emergence of novel viral diseases such as SARS, influenza A/H1N1(09) pdm; MERS; Nipah virus disease; Ebola haemorrhagic fever and the current COVID-19 has resulted in massive outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics thereby causing profound losses of human life, health and economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 200 countries, reporting a global case load of 167,878,000 with 2 per cent mortality as on May 26, 2021. This has highlighted the importance of reducing human- animal interfaces to prevent such zoonoses. Rapid deforestation, shrinking of boundaries between human and animal, crisis for natural habitation, increasing demands for wildlife products and threat of extinction compounded by biodiversity narrowing compel to increased human-animal conflict and contact. Large quantities of animal waste generated due to animal agriculture may also allow rapid selection, amplification, dissemination of zoonotic pathogens and facilitate zoonotic pathogen adaptation and hinder host evolution for resistance. Public health system faces challenges to contain such epidemics due to inadequate understanding, poor preparedness, lack of interdisciplinary approach in surveillance and control strategy and deficient political commitments. Because the management measures are beyond the purview of health system alone, policy-level adaptation in the transdisciplinary issues are required, emphasizing the engagement of multiple stakeholders towards wildlife protection, alternative land use, community empowerment for natural resource management and regulation on business of wildlife products to ensure comprehensive one health practice.","Debnath, Falguni; Chakraborty, Debjit; Deb, Alok Kumar; Saha, Malay Kumar; Dutta, Shanta",The Indian journal of medical research,405,30

We aimed to identify mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in IPV among SGM, focusing on childhood experiences of violence, structural inequalities, and sexual minority stress. METHOD 308 SGM assigned female-at-birth (AFAB; 82 White, 133 Black, 93 Latinx; age 16-31) self-reported on minor psychological, severe psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and three proposed mechanisms: childhood violence (child abuse, witnessing interparental violence), structural inequalities (economic stress, racial discrimination), and sexual minority stressors (internalized heterosexism, anti-SGM victimization, low social support). Indirect effects of race on IPV victimization via hypothesized mechanisms were estimated using logistic regression with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS Compared to White participants, Black participants were 2.5-7.03 times more likely to report all eight IPV types; Latinx participants were 2.5-4.8 times more likely to experience four IPV types. Univariate indirect effects analyses indicated that these racial/ethnic disparities were partially explained by higher economic stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and childhood violence experiences (for Black and Latinx participants) and lower social support (Black participants). In multivariate models, the most robust indirect effects were through racial/ethnic discrimination and childhood violence. CONCLUSIONS Findings underscore the need for policy and interventions aimed at preventing IPV among SGM-POC by targeting factors that contribute to IPV disparities in this group, particularly racial/ethnic discrimination and family violence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1716 nurses across three university hospitals participated in this study. All had been employed for at least one year. Managers, part-timers, and those in the operating room and the outpatient ward were excluded from the study as it is limited to bedside preventive care. The original tool was translated into Japanese using the Brislin's translation model. A cross-sectional study was used to examine the reliability and validity of the measure within a Japanese sample. Assessment of the multiple-choice test items included analysis of the validity (item difficulty and discriminating index), construct validity, internal consistency, and stability (test-retest reliability). RESULTS The item difficulty indices ranged from 0.17 to 0.95, whereas values for item discrimination ranged from 0.15 to 0.45. Known group validity of the scale was confirmed; therefore, the higher-expertize group consisting of wound, ostomy, and continence nurses significantly outperformed nurses certified in other fields. The overall internal consistency reliability was 0.86 with a two-week test-retest intraclass correlation of 0.60. CONCLUSIONS The instrument may be applied as a reliable and valid measure to assess nurses' pressure ulcer knowledge in the fields of nursing education, research, and practice in Japan.","Yamamoto-Kon, Aya; Fukahori, Hiroki; Ogata, Yasuko; Nagano, Midori",Journal of tissue viability,405,31

The principles that assure this vital targeting are known from the D. melanogaster model: DCC-intrinsic specificity of DNA binding, cooperativity with the CLAMP protein, and noncoding roX2 RNA transcribed from the X chromosome. We found that in D. virilis, a species separated from melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution, all principles are active but contribute differently to X specificity. In melanogaster, the DCC subunit MSL2 evolved intrinsic DNA-binding selectivity for rare PionX sites, which mark the X chromosome. In virilis, PionX motifs are abundant and not X-enriched. Accordingly, MSL2 lacks specific recognition. Here, roX2 RNA plays a more instructive role, counteracting a nonproductive interaction of CLAMP and modulating DCC binding selectivity. Remarkably, roX2 triggers a stable chromatin binding mode characteristic of DCC. Evidently, X-specific regulation is achieved by divergent evolution of protein, DNA, and RNA components.","Villa, Raffaella; Jagtap, Pravin Kumar Ankush; Thomae, Andreas W; Campos Sparr, Aline; Forné, Ignasi; Hennig, Janosch; Straub, Tobias; Becker, Peter B",Genes & development,405,14

T cell development depends upon cell-cell interactions with epithelial cells in the thymus. The thymus is composed of two different types of epithelial cells: cortical and medullary epithelial cells. Both of these express and critically depend on the transcription factor Foxn1 Foxn1 is also expressed in the hair follicle, and disruption of Foxn1 function in mice results in severe thymic developmental defects and the hairless (nude) phenotype. Despite its importance, little is known about the direct regulation of Foxn1 expression. In this study, we identify a cis-regulatory element (RE) critical for expression of Foxn1 in mouse thymic epithelial cells but dispensable for expression in hair follicles. Analysis of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and sequence conservation identified regions within the first intron of Foxn1 that possessed the characteristics of REs. Systematic knockout of candidate regions lead us to identify a 1.6 kb region that, when deleted, results in a near total disruption of thymus development. Interestingly, Foxn1 expression and function in the hair follicle were unaffected. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization showed a near complete loss of Foxn1 mRNA expression in the embryonic thymic bud.

Gaps in knowledge were identified in both groups highlighting the importance of incorporating patient education into glaucoma services. PURPOSE To examine knowledge of glaucoma among patients attending virtual compared to face-to-face glaucoma clinics. MATERIALS AND METHODS A survey was conducted of 105 patients with glaucoma, including 50 attending virtual and 55 attending face-to-face clinics. Participants were asked to complete a glaucoma knowledge assessment using the National Eye Health Education Program Eye-Q test. All participants had a comprehensive eye examination and completed standard automated perimetry (SAP). Knowledge of glaucoma was compared between groups and the effect of potential confounders, including age, sex, education level and SAP mean deviation (MD) was explored using regression analyses. The relationship between test scores and self-perception of knowledge of glaucoma was also examined. RESULTS There was no significant difference between knowledge scores between patients attending virtual and face-to-face clinics with mean scores of 5.6±1.0 and 6.0±1.6 (P =0.762) respectfully. More patients attending the virtual clinic could correctly identify the type of glaucoma they had (74% vs. 52.7%, P=0.005). Regression analyses found education level and patients' correct knowledge of their type of glaucoma were significantly associated with Eye-Q scores. Patients with university qualifications scored significantly higher than those with no or basic school qualifications (P =0.003) and higher-level school qualifications (P=0.038).

Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 357 participants in Fiji, and structural equation modeling to analyze the collected data. Findings: Results indicate that expected personal outcomes is positively associated with customers' attitudes while expected community-related outcomes negatively impact customers' attitudes. Factors such as attitude, subjective norms, scarcity, time pressure and perceived competition were found to positively influence customers' panic buying intention. Furthermore, scarcity and time pressure were confirmed to positively influence perceived competitiveness while perceived social detection risk negatively influences customer's panic buying intention. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for better measures to ensure that every customer has access to goods and services and is not deprived of such necessities in times of a crisis. These results will assist store managers and policymakers in introducing better management, social policies and resource utilization mechanisms to mitigate panic buying during the pandemic. Originality/value: This study's findings contribute to the literature on customer's panic buying behavior during a global pandemic. Research in this area remain scarce, inconsistent and inconclusive. Novel insights are generated as this study is the first to combine the theory of planned behavior, privacy calculus theory and protection motivation theory. Applying these theories allows new relationships to be tested to better understand customer behavior during a global pandemic.

But from the reports of COVID-19, most cases of the fungal infections were observed to be fatal. This raises a serious concern on fungal pathogens causing co-infection in COVID-19. The fungal pathogens causing co-infections were found to be Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pneumocystis jirovecii, Histoplasma capsulatum. Cryptococcus sp..

Towards this objective, the Department of Clinical Oncology developed guidelines with some treatment modifications. Objective: To assess the health care activities of the UDAM during the period considered as the “peak” of the pandemic, since its beginning to June 30, 2020. Methods: This is an observational study that collected data from the electronic clinical record system called Oncology Electronic Health Record (HCEO) during the aforementioned period. Results: There werea total of 293 medical appointments (221 in person), through which 131 patients were attended to. The number of medical appointments decreased by 16.7% compared to the same period in 2019 (352 appointments). Of the patients who were attended to during the “peak” period, 109 (83.2%) were on systemic onco-specific treatment and 22 (16.8%) were attended to for disease control. The medical appointments were scheduled to evaluate the continuity of treatment and treatment modifications if necessary (95 patients;72.5%), for disease control (17;12.9%), for first-time consultation (12;9.1%) and to assess paraclinical studies (7;5.3%). The patients were on hormone therapy (HT) (81 patients;74%), chemotherapy (CT) (21;19%), and anti-HER2 therapies (9;8%). A total of 20 treatments were initiated, 14 with HT and 6 with CT. Of the 21 patients on CT, 14 (66.6%) were on adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy. Of these, 9 (64.3%) continued with the same regimen with the addition of prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), and 5 (35.7%), who were receiving weekly paclitaxel, continued the treatment with no changes. The remaining 7 of 21 patients (33.3%) were on palliative CT. Of these, 2 (28.5%) continued the treatment with the addition of G-CSF, 3 (42.8%) continued with weekly capecitabine or paclitaxel with no treatment changes, and 2 (28.5%) changed their treatment regimen (a less myelosuppressive regimen was selected for one of them and this decision was due to the progression of the disease in the other patient). The 90 patients who were receiving adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative criteria HT and/or anti-HER2 therapies, continued the treatment with no changes Conclusions: Although these are preliminary results, the available evidence suggests that, although medical appointments decreased by approximately 17%, the UDAM was able to maintain its healthcare activities and continued most of the treatments. The most modified treatment was CT, with the addition of prophylactic G-CSF, to avoid myelosuppression and potential complications from COVID-19 infection.","Castillo, C.; Camejo, N.; Amarillo, D.; Rodriguez, F.; Vitureira, F.; Krygier, G.

This case-control study seeks to shed light on the true risk of autoimmune AEFIs associated with the COVID-19 vaccine through a case-control analysis of VAERS reports. Reports of autoimmune aetiology were matched with reports of non-autoimmune controls. Statistical analysis reveals that the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines with regard to autoimmune AEFIs is highly favourable. In particular, neuroautoimmune AEFIs have statistically significant reporting odds ratios below unity (Guillain-Barre syndrome: 0.35, multiple sclerosis: 0.70, transverse myelitis: 0.79), indicating a reduced association of reports of these conditions with the COVID-19 vaccine versus other vaccines. Only three autoimmune aetiologies exceed a ROR of 2.0 and thus present a potential signal. Of these, myasthenia gravis (ROR = 3.90, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.63-5.80) may be the result of epidemiological confounding factors not sufficiently controlled by matching, as the population most likely to develop myasthenia gravis was strongly prioritised in the COVID-19 vaccine's initial rollout. Immune thrombocytopaenia (ROR = 26.83, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 16.93-42.54) is a clear safety signal, confirming a large number of case reports and studies that indicate a risk of immune thrombocytopaenic events following the COVID- 19 vaccine. The lone strong safety signal of immune thrombocytopaenia notwithstanding, this study attests to the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine where autoimmune conditions are concerned. Through quantifying the risk of autoimmune disorders associated with COVID-19 vaccination, this study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the safety of such vaccines.","von Csefalvay, C.",,405,9

Objective: To estimate the percentage of the general population vaccinated against the COVID-19 and to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional study in Greece during August 2021. We included individuals over 18 years of age. Independent variables included socio-demographic data of the participants and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. Our outcome variable was COVID-19 vaccination status, measured through yes/no answers. Results: Most participants had been vaccinated against the COVID-19 (87.8%), while about half had been vaccinated against influenza (52.5%). Multivariate analysis identified that increased age and a higher level of education were associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. Also, participants working in health services, participants without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and those with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, increased self-perceived severity of COVID-19, knowledge regarding COVID-19, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines and scientists were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, the likelihood of vaccination was lower for participants who were more concerned about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Understanding the factors affecting individuals decision to take a COVID-19 vaccine is essential to improve the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate. Policymakers and scientists should scale up their efforts to increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate among specific population groups such as young people, people with a low level of education, people with negative attitudes towards vaccination, etc.","Galanis, P.

DESIGN Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING Hospital Authority hospitals in Hong Kong offering an obstetric and delivery service. PARTICIPANTS Chiefs of Service of departments of anaesthesia and coordinators of obstetric anaesthesia and analgesia service. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The availability of an obstetric epidural analgesia service, specialist staff allocation to the service, existence of clinical protocols, rate of epidural analgesia, techniques of epidural administration, obstetric outcome or mode of delivery, and the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of epidural analgesia. RESULTS Between 1 January and 31 December 2001, all eight Hospital Authority hospitals with an obstetric service provided epidural analgesia for labour pain relief, but only six (75%) offered a 24-hour service. A dedicated anaesthetist provided obstetric anaesthesia and analgesia during office hours in all units, but after hours in only three. This level of service provision compared favourably with that available in 1995, when only 82% of public maternity units provided epidural analgesia and only 36% offered a 24-hour service. The median epidural analgesia rate was 15% (range, 8%-20%) compared with 10% in 1995. The incidence of adverse events and complications was very low. Formal written protocols for the conduct of epidural analgesia for labour were used in six units. All units used mixtures of local anaesthetic combined with opioid, administered as intermittent boluses, continuous epidural infusion, or patient-controlled epidural analgesia. CONCLUSIONS Although there has been progress and improvement in the provision of obstetric epidural analgesia services in our public hospitals, the rate is still relatively low and the provision of services after hours is limited. Further progress will likely be hindered by current or future cutbacks in public hospital budgets.","Lee, B B; Chen, P P; Ngan Kee, W D",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,405,1

OBJECTIVE We sought to determine whether prednisolone is effective in rhinovirus-induced early wheezing. METHODS We conducted a controlled trial comparing oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg per day in three divided doses for 3 days) with placebo in 78 hospitalized children (mean age, 1.1 year; standard deviation, 0.7) experiencing their first or second episode of wheezing induced by rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus. Mixed viral infections were excluded. Our primary end point was the time until the patient was ready for discharge; secondary end points included oxygen saturation during hospitalization, duration of symptoms, occurrence of relapses during the next 2 months and blood eosinophil counts at discharge and 2 weeks later. RESULTS In multivariate regression analysis, prednisolone did not influence the time until ready for discharge, but it decreased relapses during the subsequent 2-month period in rhinovirus-affected children (prednisolone versus placebo, 22% versus 56%; odds ratio, 19.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.52-144.03; P = 0.004) and in children with blood eosinophils > or = 0.2 x 10/L (respectively, 24% versus 71%; odds ratio, 10.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-56.22; P = 0.006). Rhinovirus-affected children had more blood eosinophils on admission (mean, 0.44 versus 0.086 x 10/L), had a higher prevalence of atopy (44% versus 8%) and were older (mean, 1.4 versus 0.9 years, P < 0.001 for all) than respiratory syncytial virus-infected children. CONCLUSION Prednisolone reduced relapses during a 2-month period after first episodes of wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection or blood eosinophils > or = 0.2 x 10/L.","Jartti, Tuomas; Lehtinen, Pasi; Vanto, Timo; Hartiala, Jaakko; Vuorinen, Tytti; Mäkelä, Mika J; Ruuskanen, Olli",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,405,24

In most cases, snoRNAs are encoded in introns and are released through the splicing reaction. Some snoRNAs are, instead, produced by an alternative pathway consisting of endonucleolytic processing of pre-mRNA. XendoU, the endoribonuclease responsible for this activity, is a U-specific, metal-dependent enzyme that releases products with 2'-3' cyclic phosphate termini. XendoU is broadly conserved among eukaryotes, and it is a genetic marker of nidoviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, where it is essential for replication and transcription. We have determined by crystallography the structure of XendoU that, by refined search methodologies, appears to display a unique fold. Based on sequence conservation, mutagenesis, and docking simulations, we have identified the active site. The conserved structural determinants of this site may provide a framework for attempting to design antiviral drugs to interfere with the infectious nidovirus life cycle.","Renzi, Fabiana; Caffarelli, Elisa; Laneve, Pietro; Bozzoni, Irene; Brunori, Maurizio; Vallone, Beatrice",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,405,31

In our study ESBL-producing isolates were assessed by screening methods. After determination of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of ESBLs and quinolone resistance genes was performed. A total of 97 ESBL-producing E. coli were determined. The bla-TEM, bla-SHV and bla-CTX-M genes were detected in 90 isolates. The bla-TEM was the most frequently detected gene (46.4%), followed by bla-SHV (31.9%) and bla-CTX-M (14.4%).

Such racial disparities, in Covid-19 testing, cases, and mortality are visible in Connecticut too. Recently, excess deaths have become an important consideration in news reports and academic research. However, data on racial differences in excess death is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study examines racial/ethnic differences in excess deaths in the state of Connecticut during the Covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study to estimate excess deaths by racial/ethnic status utilizing mortality data during the peak months of Covid-19 infections from March 1 to June 30, 2020, in Connecticut. The following assumption is applied: expected non-Covid-19 deaths from March 1 to June 30, 2020, are equal to the number of deaths occurring during the period of March 1 to June 30, 2019. Race/ethnicity are defined as Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Latinx. Descriptive statistics and rates with 95% confidence intervals are presented. Chi-square analyses are performed where applicable. SETTING: Connecticut PARTICIPANTS: All deaths in Connecticut from March 1 to June 30, 2020. EXPOSURE: Covid-19 and race/ethnicity RESULTS: From March 1 to June 30, 2020, a total of 14,226 all-cause deaths occurred including 1514 Blacks (10.6%), 1095 Latinx (7.7%), and 11,617 Whites (81.7%). This represented a 74% increase in mortality for Blacks; 63% for Latinx, and 30% for Whites. In addition, 42.70% of the deaths in Blacks were attributed to Covid-19; 38.5% for Latinx, and 23.0% for Whites (p<0.001). Covid-19 deaths accounted for over 90% of the excess deaths in Blacks and Hispanics. In contrast, in Whites, Covid-19 deaths exceeded the number of excess deaths by 353 cases (113.2%), indicating that some Whites may have died from other underlined health conditions with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, there was an increase in undetermined deaths in 2020, which accounted for 10.8% of deaths in Blacks, 13% in Latinx, and 6.2% of deaths in Whites. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Excess deaths in Blacks and Latinx were found above the numbers of deaths determined to have occurred due to Covid-19. The fact that a large number of undetermined deaths were found for Blacks and Latinx individuals, and testing rates for Blacks and Latinx individuals (as determined by positivity rates) were lacking during this period strongly suggests, these excess deaths were Covid-19-related deaths. The study findings indicate that Black and Latinx COVID-19-related deaths may be underreported in this pandemic. We advocate for targeted strategies that increase testing capacity, treatment, and vaccine availability in Black and Latinx communities.","Laurencin, Cato T; Wu, Z Helen; McClinton, Aneesah; Grady, James J; Walker, Joanne M",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,405,26

This study collected the data from 20 banners displayed in rural areas in Sleman regency, Yogyakarta, during March through April 2020. The analysis applied a sociopragmatic approach. The findings reveal the banners' strong negative tones targetted to the lower-working class which reflect an inaccurate understanding of the fundamental concept of Covid-19 preventive measures and mitigation. Stigmatization of the lower-working class is underway to hurt the cohesion of society.

Other common comorbidities were chronic kidney disease (40.1%), chronic pulmonary disease (30.3%), active cancer (13%), and immunosuppression (13%). The Confusion, BUN, Respiratory Rate, Systolic BP and age &#8805;65 (CURB-65) score at admission was >2 in 40.7% of patients. During hospitalization, 77.8% of patients received antivirals, 43.3% systemic corticosteroids, and 22.2% full anticoagulation. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 5.5%, and 105 (32.4%) patients had an increased level of troponin I. The median time from initiation of therapy to death was 5 days (IQR 3.0-8.0). In 45 patients (13.9%), the death was exclusively attributed to COVID-19, and in 254 patients (78.4%), both COVID-19 and the clinical status before admission contributed to death. Progressive respiratory failure was the most frequent cause of death (92.0%). Twenty-five patients (7.7%) had an unexpected death. Factors independently associated with unexpected death were male sex, chronic kidney disease, insulin-treated diabetes, and functional independence. Conclusions: This case series provides in-depth characterization of hospitalized non-ICU COVID-19 patients who died in Madrid. Male sex, insulin-treated diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and independency for activities of daily living are predictors of unexpected death.","Pérez-García, Carlos Nicolás; Enríquez-Vázquez, Daniel; Méndez-Bailón, Manuel; Olmos, Carmen; Gómez-Polo, Juan Carlos; Iguarán, Rosario; Ramos-López, Noemí; García-Klepzig, José Luis; Ferrández-Escarabajal, Marcos; Jerónimo, Adrián; Martínez-Gómez, Eduardo; Font-Urgelles, Judit; Fragiel-Saavedra, Marcos; Paz-Arias, Pilar; Romero-Delgado, Teresa; Gómez-Álvarez, Zaira; Playán-Escribano, Julia; Jaén, Esther; Vargas, Gianna; González, Elizabeth; Orviz, Eva; Burruezo, Irene; Calvo, Alberto; Nieto, Ángel; Molino, Ángel; Lorenzo-Villalba, Noël; Andrès, Emmanuel; Macaya, Carlos; Vilacosta, Isidre",,405,24

Devising proper condition monitoring has been a concern of many researchers, but there is still a lack of robustness and efficiency, most often hindered by the system's complexity or otherwise limited by the inherent noisy signals, a characteristic of industrial processes. The vast majority of condition monitoring approaches do not take into account the temporal sequence when modelling and hence lose an intrinsic part of the context of an actual time-dependent process, fundamental to processes such as cutting. The proposed system uses a multisensory approach to gather information from the cutting process, which is then modelled by a recurrent neural network, capturing the evolutive pattern of wear over time. The system was tested with realistic cutting conditions, and the results show great effectiveness and accuracy with just a few cutting tests. The use of recurrent neural networks demonstrates the potential of such an approach for other time-dependent industrial processes under noisy conditions.","Silva, Rui; Araújo, António",,405,22

Here, an indirect bandgap inorganic perovskite-based X-ray detector is reported. The indirect bandgap nature of perovskite materials is revealed through optical characterizations, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and theoretical simulations, demonstrating that the differences in temperature-dependent carrier lifetime related to CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) perovskite composition are due to the changes in the bandgap structure. TRPL, theoretical analyses, and X-ray radiation measurements reveal that the high response of the UV/visible-blind yellow-phase CsPbI3 under high-energy X-ray exposure is attributed to the nature of the indirect bandgap structure of CsPbX3 . The yellow-phase CsPbI3 -based X-ray detector achieves a relatively high sensitivity of 83.6 µCGyair -1 cm-2 (under 1.7 mGyair s-1 at an electron field of 0.17 V µm-1 used for medical diagnostics) although the active layer is based solely on an ultrathin (&#8776;6.6 µm) CsPbI3 nanocrystal film, exceeding the values obtained for commercial X-ray detectors, and further confirming good material quality.

However, few research has been performed on the prediction of disease progression in particular group of patients in the early stages of COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 338 patients with COVID-19 treated at two hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to March 2020. Predictors of the progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe stages were selected by the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 progression to severe and critical stages was confirmed in 78 (23.1%) patients. The average value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in patients in the disease progression group than in the improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent predictors of disease progression. The optimal cut-off value of NLR was 3.75. The values of the area under the curve, reflecting the accuracy of predicting COVID-19 progression by NLR was 0.739 (95%CI: 0.605-0.804). The risk model based on NLR, LDH and IL-10 had the highest area under the ROC curve. CONCLUSIONS: The performed analysis demonstrates that high concentrations of NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent risk factors for predicting disease progression in patients at the early stage of COVID-19. The risk model combined with NLR, LDH and IL-10 improved the accuracy of the prediction of disease progression in patients in the early stages of COVID-19.","Xu, Jianjun; Gao, Yang; Hu, Shaobo; Li, Suzhen; Wang, Weimin; Wu, Yuzhe; Su, Zhe; Zhou, Xing; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Qichang",Ann Clin Biochem,405,32

This study explores the effect of vaccine hesitancy on the spread of disease by introducing an SIRS-V$_\kappa$ model, with compartments of susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and vaccinated (V). We leverage the concept of carrying capacity to account for vaccine hesitancy by defining a vaccine confidence level $\kappa$, which is the maximum number of people that will become vaccinated during the course of a disease. The inverse of vaccine confidence is vaccine hesitance, $(\frac{1}{\kappa})$. We explore the equilibria of the SIRS-V$_\kappa$ model and their stability, and illustrate the impact of vaccine hesitance on epidemic spread analytically and via simulations.","Leung, C.

Viruses represent a growing global health concern;at the time of writing, COVID-19 has killed at least two million people around the world and devastated global economies. Lingering concern regarding the virus' prevalence yet hampers return to normalcy. While catastrophic in and of itself, COVID-19 further heralds in a new era of human-disease interaction characterized by the emergence of novel viruses from natural sources with heretofore unseen frequency. Due to deforestation, population growth, and climate change, we are encountering more viruses that can infect larger groups of people with greater ease and increasingly severe outcomes. The devastation of COVID-19 and forecasts of future human/disease interactions call for a creative reconsideration of global response to infectious disease. There is an urgent need for accessible, cost-effective antiviral (AV) drugs that can be mass-produced and widely distributed to large populations. Development of AV drugs should be informed by a thorough understanding of viral structure and function as well as human biology. To maximize efficacy, minimize cost, and reduce development of drug-resistance, these drugs would ideally operate through a varied set of mechanisms at multiple stages throughout the course of infection. Due to their abundance and diversity, natural compounds are ideal for such comprehensive therapeutic interventions. Promising sources of such drugs are found throughout nature;especially remarkable are the algae, a polyphyletic grouping of phototrophs that produce diverse bioactive compounds. While not much literature has been published on the subject, studies have shown that these compounds exert antiviral effects at different stages of viral pathogenesis. In this review, we follow the course of viral infection in the human body and evaluate the AV effects of algae-derived compounds at each stage. Specifically, we examine the AV activities of algae-derived compounds at the entry of viruses into the body, transport through the body via the lymph and blood, infection of target cells, and immune response. We discuss what is known about algae-derived compounds that may interfere with the infection pathways of SARS-CoV-2;and review which algae are promising sources for AV agents or AV precursors that, with further investigation, may yield life-saving drugs due to their diversity of mechanisms and exceptional pharmaceutical potential.","Reynolds, Daman Huesemann Michael Edmundson Scott Sims Amy Hurst Brett Cady Sherry Beirne Nathan Freeman Jacob Berger Adam Gao Song",Algal Research,405,1

In this review article, the current understanding of the influence of emission reductions on atmospheric pollutant concentrations and air quality is summarized for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), ammonia, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide (CO). In the first 7 months following the onset of the pandemic, more than 200 papers were accepted by peer-reviewed journals utilizing observations from ground-based and satellite instruments. Only about one-third of this literature incorporates a specific method for meteorological correction or normalization for comparing data from the lockdown period with prior reference observations despite the importance of doing so on the interpretation of results. We use the government stringency index (SI) as an indicator for the severity of lockdown measures and show how key air pollutants change as the SI increases.The observed decrease of NO2 with increasing SI is in general agreement with emission inventories that account for the lockdown. Other compounds such as O3, PM2.5, and CO are also broadly covered. Due to the importance of atmospheric chemistry on O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, their responses may not be linear with respect to primary pollutants. At most sites, we found O3 increased, whereas PM2.5 decreased slightly, with increasing SI. Changes of other compounds are found to be understudied. We highlight future research needs for utilizing the emerging data sets as a preview of a future state of the atmosphere in a world with targeted permanent reductions of emissions. Finally, we emphasize the need to account for the effects of meteorology, emission trends, and atmospheric chemistry when determining the lockdown effects on pollutant concentrations.

High peak pressures, driving pressures and plateau pressures as well as large tidal volumes are known risk factors for ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Reported mortality rate of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 is 60%. Therefore, target pressures are a peak pressure and plateau pressure below 30 cmH2O, tidal volumes below 6ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW) and driving pressure below 15 cmH2O. Cases We report two male COVID-19 patients, aged 64 and 65 years, who developed a pneumomediastinum while undergoing mechanical ventilation with lung protective strategies. Medical histories included obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and were unremarkable for pulmonary disease. Both were hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction test and CT-scan findings. Within three days, all patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated in prone position 16-20 hours/day with lung protective strategies and in accordance with the lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) higher FiO2 strategy. Peak pressures ranged 13-33 cmH2O, driving pressure (DP) ranged 10-15 cmH2O, PEEP 5-12 cmH2O, plateau pressure 14-24 cmH2O with tidal volumes 4-7 ml/kg (4-6 ml/kg while on pressure-controlled ventilation). After 7-10 days CT-scans were repeated because of progressive hypoxemia. In both patients CT-scan showed pneumomediastinum with pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion in one patient and pneumopericardium in one patient (figure 1). Ventilator settings were lowered while allowing permissive hypercapnia to pH 7.20. Pneumomediastinum resorbed in both patients. During follow up, one patient died of progressive lung disease one month after hospitalization and one patient died from pulmonary hemorrhage one month after ICU-admission. Discussion A recent autopsy series in COVID-19 patients showed that alveolar epithelial damage causes loss of lung compliance. Decreased lung compliance combined with high plateau and peak pressures might predispose to VILI, however our case series shows two patients with pneumomediastinum while on lung protective mechanical ventilation. We hypothesize that alveolar epithelial damage predisposes to VILI rather than mechanical ventilation itself. This was confirmed in reports of COVID-19 patients with pneumomediastinum in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, the recently described mortality rate of 60% is a sign of severe pulmonary disease rather than a result of pneumomediastinum itself. Furthermore, our case series suggests that developing pneumomediastinum while on lung protective mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients predisposes to a high mortality rate.","Graaff, H.

Understanding the airborne route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is essential for infection prevention and control. In this study, a total of 107 indoor air samples (45 SARS-CoV-2, 62 bacteria, and fungi) were collected from different wards of the Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Simultaneously, bacterial and fungal samples were also collected from the ambient air of hospital yard. Overall, 6 positive air samples were detected in the infectious 1 and infectious 2 wards, intensive care unit (ICU), computed tomography (CT) scan, respiratory patients' clinic, and personal protective equipment (PPE) room. Also, airborne bacteria and fungi were simultaneously detected in the various wards of the hospital with concentrations ranging from 14 to 106 CFU m-3 and 18 to 141 CFU m-3, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of bacteria and fungi were observed in respiratory patients' clinics and ICU wards, respectively. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between airborne bacterial concentration and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while no significant correlation was found between fungi concentration and the virus presence. This study provided an additional evidence about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air of a hospital that admitted COVID-19 patients. Moreover, it was revealed that the monitoring of microbial quality of indoor air in such hospitals is very important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, for controlling the nosocomial infections.","Hemati, Sara; Mobini, Gholam Reza; Heidari, Mohsen; Rahmani, Fereidoun; Soleymani Babadi, Akbar; Farhadkhani, Marzieh; Nourmoradi, Heshmatollah; Raeisi, Ahmad; Ahmadi, Ali; Khodabakhshi, Abbas; Sadeghi, Mehraban; Bagheri, Milad; Validi, Majid; Taghipour, Simin; Mohammadi-Moghadam, Fazel",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Structural narrative analysis provides an answer to the research question about the interplay of external circumstances (structure) and individual choices (agency) in depicting the causes of the Black Death, its course of events, and attribution of its developments and consequences. Findings demonstrate that structure prevails over agency. The textbooks offer no behavioral patterns to internalize and implicitly conceptualize behavior in an epidemic as a mass phenomenon, not as a product of many individual choices. This perception of agency blatantly contradicts the two prerequisites for an effective epidemic response elaborated during the COVID-19 pandemic: quality of governance and population’s willingness to comply with authorities’ recommendations in spite of the growing circulation of false information. The Black Death is presented in Middle Ages — the “era of calamities”. Hence, an epidemic in any other historical period appears an omen of “bad times” coming, which is likely to create expectations of new unavoidable disasters and foster catastrophic perceptions of the already existing problems. To shift this approach to history as “life’s teacher”, intrinsic to didactic pedagogy, two methods are suggested: explicit comparison with epidemics from other historical periods (not only the present) and counterfactual thinking to create alternative scenarios with regard to general patterns of human behavior and the characteristics of the Medieval Period. © 2021, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved.","Fabrykant, M.",Mir Rossii,405,10

At the time of its discovery by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), it was classified as a supernova close to the nucleus. The subsequent six years of V- and g-band ASAS-SN observations reveal that ASASSN-14ko has nuclear flares occurring at regular intervals. The seventeen observed outbursts show evidence of a decreasing period over time, with a mean period of $P_0 = 114.2 \pm 0.4$ days and a period derivative of $\dot{P} = -0.0017\pm0.0003$. The most recent outburst in May 2020, which took place as predicted, exhibited spectroscopic changes during the rise and a had a UV bright, blackbody spectral energy distribution similar to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The X-ray flux decreased by a factor of 4 at the beginning of the outburst and then returned to its quiescent flux after ~8 days. TESS observed an outburst during Sectors 4-6, revealing a rise time of $5.60 \pm 0.05$ days in the optical and a decline that is best fit with an exponential model. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain ASASSN-14ko's periodic outbursts, but currently favor a repeated partial TDE.

In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations with regular visits at ambulatory clinic of implantable devices and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during times of limited face­to­face contact. METHODS: Teleconsultations in the clinic were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control of cardiac implantable electronic devices. Prior to planned visits, physicians phoned patients and interviewed them about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available medical records. RESULTS: Teleconsultations were carried out over 3.5 weeks (March 13 to April 1, 2020). Out of 400 patients who had visits planned at the clinic, 349 were consulted by phone. A total of 299 patients confirmed stable health status, 14 reported some symptoms, and 4 were hospitalized; 2 patients changed their primary clinic and were no longer under our care, 1 was undergoing quarantine, 15 required additional intervention, and 15 had died prior to contact. In general, patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultations are a much­needed option during the SARS­CoV­2 pandemic. They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the ambulatory visit plan, which may otherwise put an overwhelming burden on the clinic.","Paskudzka, Diana; Kolodzinska, Agnieszka; Cacko, Andrzej; Stolarz, Przemyslaw; Lyzwinski, Lukasz; Opolski, Grzegorz; Grabowski, Marcin",Kardiol Pol,405,20

Lactic acid, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, is abundantly present in inflamed tissues and has been shown to regulate functions of several immune cells. Because the endogenous ligands for MRGPRX2 (substance P and LL-37) are elevated during pathologic conditions, such as cancer and asthma, and given that lactic acid levels are also enhanced in these patients, we explored the role of lactic acid in regulating mast cells response via MRGPRX2 and MrgprB2, the mouse orthologue of the human receptor. We found that lactic acid suppressed both the early (Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation) and late (chemokine/cytokine release) phases of mast cell activation; this data was confirmed in LAD2, human skin and mouse peritoneal mast cells. In LAD2 cells, the reduction in degranulation and chemokine/cytokine production mediated by lactic acid was dependent on pH. In agreement with our in vitro studies, lactic acid also reduced passive systemic anaphylaxis to compound 48/80 (a known MRGPRX2/MrgprB2 ligand) and skin inflammation in a mouse model of rosacea that is dependent on MrgprB2 expression on skin mast cells. Our data thus suggest that lactic acid may serve to inhibit mast cell-mediated inflammation during asthma and reduce immune response during cancer by affecting mast cell activation through MRGPRX2.","Syed, Meesum; Kammala, Ananth K; Callahan, Brianna; Oskeritzian, Carole A; Subramanian, Hariharan",Cell Immunol,405,24

AIM: The aim was to investigate the impact of discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment on patients living with spasticity during the COVID-19 quarantine. DESIGN: A multicentric cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatients setting. POPULATION: Patients with spasticity after stroke and traumatic brain injury treated with BoNT-A. METHODS: A phone-based survey was conducted from March to May, 2020. Based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), an ad hoc questionnaire CORTOX (CORonavirus TOXin survey) was developed to investigate patients' experiences following the discontinuation of their usual treatment for spasticity due to the lockdown and its implication on their health perception. It assessed patients' condition and explored different ICF domains related to spasticity: unpleasant sensations, mobility, self care, facilitators and psychosocial factors. The sum of those represented the CORTOX score (Max 142). The questionnaire also collected data about the impact of COVID-19 on patients' wellbeing (mood, sleep, relationships, community life, motivation). RESULTS: A total of 151 participants completed the survey. The majority of participants (72.2 %) experienced a worsening in perceived spasticity, 53% got worse in independence and 70.9% had a negative impact on quality of life. The mean CORTOX score was 52.85 ± 27.25, reflecting a perceived worsening in all ICF domains investigated. Moderate to strong correlations were found between different subscores of the questionnaire and severity of spasticity (p<0.001). COVID-19 psychosocial related factors were associated with loss of independence (p < 0.05) but only mood was associated with worsening of spasticity (p < 0.001). The lack of rehabilitation therapy was significantly associated with the worsening of independence but not with the worsening of spasticity. Finally, respondents reported that BoNT-A was useful to their condition and should not be discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment was associated with worsening of activities and participation and perceived spasticity. COVID-19 related problems and rehabilitation showed an association with loss of independence.

D-dimer may help evaluate disease severity and predict outcomes at hospital admission. However, its non-specificity and long analysis times strongly constrain its clinical value. Viscoelastic tests (VET) are widely available rapid point-of-care devices that have been shown to detect a hypercoagulable state (increased clot stiffness and fibrinolysis shutdown) as major contributors of the thrombotic complication in COVID-19. Nevertheless, based on the data obtained so far, definitive conclusions have not been drawn. ObjectivesWe aim to evaluate the association between VET parameters, standard coagulation tests and inflammation markers assessed in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission with disease severity and outcomes. Patients/MethodsA total of 69 COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization were included in the study. The pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state was analyzed by a panel of inflammation markers (IL-6, CRP, LDH, ferritin), routine coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a SEER sonorheometry VET profile (Quantra(R) System). ResultsInflammatory markers IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin were elevated in a high percentage of patients (73.6%, 89.2%, 57.1% and 52.4%), as were coagulation-related parameters such as fibrinogen (81.4%) and D-dimer levels (66.2%). Quantra(R) analysis revealed increased clot stiffness (CS) in 34.8%, particularly due to increased fibrinogen contribution (FCS) in 63.7%. Increased clot stability to lysis (CSL) was observed in 32.4%. Age > 65 years, elevated values of fibrinogen, D-dimer, LDH, increased clot stiffness and resistance to clot lysis were significantly associated with worsening disease. The Quantra(R) FCS parameter showed a particularly high prognostic value in distinguishing patients with severe symptomatology. ConclusionThe global study of hemostasis by the whole blood point-of-care Quantra(R) VET system may be a powerful tool for identifying poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. In particular, FCS measured by Quantra(R) could be established as a plausible prognostic marker to aid the clinical management of COVID-19 patients.","Lopez-Jaime, Francisco Jose; Martin-Tellez, Sandra; Doblas-Marquez, Alberto; Marquez-Gomez, Ignacio; Reguera-Iglesias, Jose Maria; Munoz-Perez, Manuel Isidro; Fernandez-Bello, Ihosvany; Montano, Adrian",,405,10

(2) Methods: We evaluated the host serologic responses, measured with semi-quantitative ELISA tests (IgA, IgG, IgM abs) in sera of 90 individuals in Hospital no. 4 in Bytom, 84 HCWs in the University Hospital in Opole and 25 in a Miasteczko Slaskie local surgery. All volunteers had negative RT-PCR test results or had not had the RT-PCR test performed within 30 days before sampling. The ELISA test was made at two different time points (July/August 2020) with a 2-weeks gap between blood collections to avoid the ""serological window"" period. (3) Results: The IgG seropositivity of asymptomatic HCWs varied between 1.2% to 10% (Opole vs. Bytom, p &lt; 0.05;all without any symptoms). IgA seropositivity in HCWs was 8.8% in Opole and 7.14% in Bytom. IgM positive levels in HCWs in Opole and Bytom was 1.11% vs. 2.38%, respectively. Individuals with IgA and IgM seropositivity results were observed only in Opole (1.19%). More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic as well as socio-demographic locations. (4) Conclusions: 100% of IgG(+) volunteers were free from any symptoms of infection in the 30 days before first or second blood collection and they had no awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic HCWs could spread SARS-CoV-2 infection to other employees and patients. Only regular HCWs RT-PCR testing can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a hospital environment. The benefit of combining the detection of specific IgA with that of combined specific IgM/IgG is still uncertain.","Buldak, R.

The increasing numbers of confirmed and deceased cases of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide are causing instability in stock indices every day. These changes resulted in the G8 suffering major losses due to the spread of the pandemic. This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 events using country lockdown announcement on the most important stock indices in G8 by using seven lockdown variables. To find the impact of the COVID-19 virus on G8, a correlation analysis and an artificial neural network model are adopted.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, a Pearson correlation is used to study the strength of lockdown variables on international indices, where neural network is used to build a prediction model that can estimate the movement of stock markets independently. The neural network used two performance metrics including R2 and mean square error (MSE).FindingsThe results of stock indices prediction showed that R2 values of all G8 are between 0.979 and 0.990, where MSE values are between 54 and 604. The results showed that the COVID-19 events had a strong negative impact on stock movement, with the lowest point on the March of all G8 indices. Besides, the US lockdown and interest rate changes are the most affected by the G8 stock trading, followed by Germany, France and the UK.Originality/valueThe study has used artificial intelligent neural network to study the impact of US lockdown, decrease the interest rate in the USA and the announce of lockdown in different G8 countries.","Al-Najjar, Hazem Al-Rousan Nadia Al-Najjar Dania Assous Hamzeh F.; Al-Najjar, Dana",Journal of Chinese Economic and Foreign Trade Studies,405,25

Establishing a causal relation between two variables can help us in answering that question of why something happens. However, using solely observational data are insufficient to get the complete causal picture. The combination of observational and experimental data may give adequate information to properly estimate causal relations. In this study, we consider the conditions where estimating causal relations might work and we show how well different algorithms, namely the Peter and Clark algorithm, the Downward Ranking of Feed-Forward Loops algorithm, the Transitive Reduction for Weighted Signed Digraphs algorithm, the Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) algorithm and the Hidden Invariant Causal Prediction (HICP) algorithm, determine causal relations in a simulation study. Results showed that the ICP and the HICP algorithms perform best in most simulation conditions. We also apply every algorithm to an empirical example to show the similarities and differences between the algorithms. We believe that the combination of the ICP and the HICP algorithm may be suitable to be used in future research.

Over 30 patient scenarios have been developed after identifying learner-specific development needs, including exploration of overt psychosis, assessment of capacity, sharing bad news, and neglect in care home residents. Actors are filmed responding to several domains of clinical questions, further categorised into three narrative-modes of being ‘Engaged, Neutral or Disengaged’, to build a bank of scenarios. During the session, the trainee is projected on to a large screen, using a camera and video special effects, which results in a life-like interaction with the Virtual Patient. Trainees can view themselves interacting with the Virtual Patient in real-time, from a unique ‘out-of-body' perspective, immersed in a custom-designed interactive virtual environment. The simulation facilitator engages with the learner and determines the appropriate choices of responses for the Virtual Patient and if needed, can prompt with explorative cues to continue the narrative-linked conversation. AVATr model pioneered in United Kingdom the use of an innovative ‘self-observational approach’ in Psychiatry training. This is different to a first-person perspective used in virtual or augmented-reality systems in several clinical specialties. The use of Facilitated-Debrief and Peer-Debrief in sessions, render another layer to the simulation experience.MethodDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we evolved the AVATr model to remote or hybrid sessions, where simulations were digitally enhanced, and have been run through Microsoft Teams. The simulation facilitator is connected to a multi-user video call, enabling the Virtual Patient to be projected as an attendee using Microsoft Teams.ResultThe hybrid model of AVATr has received tremendous feedback, as it now simulates video-consultations that a vast majority of Psychiatry trainees, especially community-based, undertake due to COVID-19 restrictions. The format of AVATr simulation sessions has remained unchanged, and the remote delivery has been particularly successful as it allows trainees to log in from different remote locations to come together for an interactive training session, without any physical restrictions.ConclusionSince 2015, our simulation platform has been utilised for Post-Graduate Medical Education, to enhance essential professional skills and stimulate professional growth. Currently the hybrid model of AVATr is being expanded to Nursing, Psychology and Allied Health Professional (AHP) clinical training streams, along with Undergraduate Medical Education, to address identified gaps in face-to-face training amidst COVID-19 pandemic.","Mannali, Vimal Strickland Paul laBuscagne Craig Clift Joy",BJPsych Open,405,21

Adequate support is important to enable them to combine paid work with caregiving, while maintaining their health and wellbeing. To date, however, knowledge about working caregivers' support needs is fragmented. This study, therefore, aimed to obtain more insight into the support needs of working caregivers of older adults. We conducted six online semi-structured focus group interviews with in total 25 working caregivers of older adults living at home. Data were complemented with information from seven working caregivers participating in the study's advisory board. Data were analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Six themes related to working caregivers' needs were identified: (1) Recognition of caregivers, including the challenges they face; (2) Attention for caregivers' health, wellbeing and ability to cope; (3) Opportunities to share care responsibilities; (4) Help with finding and arranging care and support; (5) Understanding and support from the work environment; (6) Technological support tailored to the needs and capacities of caregivers and older adults. To address these needs, working caregivers suggested several options in multiple domains of life (i.e., work, home and social life, care environment, personal health and wellbeing). To successfully support them, a multi-faceted effort, involving actors from multiple settings, is needed.","Vos, Eline E; de Bruin, Simone R; van der Beek, Allard J; Proper, Karin I",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),405,24

This might be expected to particularly affect older adults and people living with dementia (PLWD), and to reduce their well-being. AIMS: To explore how social support service use by older adults, carers and PLWD, and their mental well-being changed over the first 3 months since the pandemic outbreak. METHODS: Unpaid dementia carers, PLWD and older adults took part in a longitudinal online or telephone survey collected between April and May 2020, and at two subsequent timepoints 6 and 12 weeks after baseline. Participants were asked about their social support service usage in a typical week prior to the pandemic (at baseline), and in the past week at each of the three timepoints. They also completed measures of levels of depression, anxiety and mental well-being. RESULTS: 377 participants had complete data at all three timepoints. Social support service usage dropped shortly after lockdown measures were imposed at timepoint 1 (T1), to then increase again by T3. The access to paid care was least affected by COVID-19. Cases of anxiety dropped significantly across the study period, while cases of depression rose. Well-being increased significantly for older adults and PLWD from T1 to T3. CONCLUSIONS: Access to social support services has been significantly affected by the pandemic, which is starting to recover slowly. With mental well-being differently affected across groups, support needs to be put in place to maintain better well-being across those vulnerable groups during the ongoing pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Pulford, Daniel; Cooper, Claudia; Lord, Kathryn; Shenton, Justine; Cannon, Jacqueline; Shaw, Lisa; Tetlow, Hilary; Limbert, Stan; Callaghan, Steve; Whittington, Rosie; Rogers, Carol; Komuravelli, Aravind; Rajagopal, Manoj; Eley, Ruth; Downs, Murna; Reilly, Siobhan; Ward, Kym; Gaughan, Anna; Butchard, Sarah; Beresford, Jules; Watkins, Caroline; Bennett, Kate; Gabbay, Mark",BMJ Open,405,16

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the membrane-delimited receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Lung, intestine and kidney, major sites of viral infection, express ACE2 that harbours an intracellular, carboxy-terminal PDZ-recognition motif. These organs prominently express the PDZ protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1). Here, we report NHERF1 tethers ACE2 and augments SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. ACE2 directly binds both NHERF1 PDZ domains. Disruption of either NHERF1 PDZ core-binding motif or the ACE2 PDZ-recognition sequence eliminates interaction. Proximity ligation assays establish that ACE2 and NHERF1 interact at constitutive expression levels in human lung and intestine cells. Ablating ACE2 interaction with NHERF1 accelerated SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Conversely, elimination of the ACE2 C-terminal PDZ binding motif decreased ACE2 membrane residence and reduced pseudotyped virus entry. We conclude that the PDZ interaction of ACE2 with NHERF1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 internalization. ß-arrestin is likely indispensable, as with G protein-coupled receptors.","Zhang, Qiangmin; Gefter, Julia; Sneddon, W Bruce; Mamonova, Tatyana; Friedman, Peter A",iScience,405,16

The purpose of the current study is to investigate psychological resilience and depression in individuals during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to different variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between psychological resilience and depression. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The current study was conducted on a total of 518 people over the social media through the Google e-forms. In the study, the ""Short Psychological Resilience Scale"" and the ""Beck Depression Scale"" were used to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, t-test, One Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used. RESULTS: In the current study, psychological resilience and depression were investigated in relation to different variables. Psychological resilience was found to be higher male participants, educators,university graduates and groups with not mental health problems. Depression was found to be higher females, university students, high school and lower graduates,with mental health problems. When the relationship between psychological resilience and depression was investigated, it was found that there is a medium and negative correlation between them. Moreover, the cut-off point for the depression score was set to be 17 and the rate of the people having 17 points or higher scores was found to be 16.6%. CONCLUSION: In light of the findings of the current study, it can be suggested to offer more mental health care services to those having higher levels of depression. Studies can be conducted to improve online psychological support services. A medium and negative correlation was found between psychological resilience and depression in the current study, which shows that more importance should be attached to activities to improve psychological resilience.","Karasar, Burcu; Canli, Derya",Psychiatr Danub,405,6

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1ß and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1ß or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1ß and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1ß and IL-6 transcriptional response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Bell, Lucy Ck; Meydan, Cem; Kim, Jacob; Foox, Jonathan; Butler, Daniel; Mason, Christopher E; Shapira, Sagi D; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pollara, Gabriele",iScience,405,16

Following the discovery of the initial CRISPR/Cas-based system, the technology has been advanced to facilitate a multitude of different functions. These include development as a base editor, prime editor, epigenetic editor, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) gene regulators. It can also be used for chromatin and RNA targeting and imaging. Its applications have proved revolutionary across numerous biological fields, especially in biomedical and agricultural improvement. As a diagnostic tool, CRISPR has been developed to aid the detection and screening of both human and plant diseases, and has even been applied during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CRISPR/Cas is also being trialed as a new form of gene therapy for treating various human diseases, including cancers, and has aided drug development. In terms of agricultural breeding, precise targeting of biological pathways via CRISPR/Cas has been key to regulating molecular biosynthesis and allowing modification of proteins, starch, oil, and other functional components for crop improvement. Adding to this, CRISPR/Cas has been shown capable of significantly enhancing both plant tolerance to environmental stresses and overall crop yield via the targeting of various agronomically important gene regulators. Looking to the future, increasing the efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and limiting off-target activity are two major challenges for wider application of the technology. This review provides an in-depth overview of current CRISPR development, including the advantages and disadvantages of the technology, recent applications, and future considerations.","Li, Chao; Brant, Eleanor; Budak, Hikmet; Zhang, Baohong",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,405,1

Recombination is a well-known evolutionary strategy of coronaviruses, which may frequently result in significant genetic alterations, such as deletions throughout the genome. In this study we identified a co-infection with two genetically different SARS-CoV-2 viruses within a single patient sample via amplicon-based next generation sequencing in Hungary. The recessive strain contained an 84 base pair deletion in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein gene and was found to be gradually displaced by a dominant non-deleterious variant over-time. We have identified the region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is affected by the mutation, created homology models of the RBD&#916;84 mutant, and based on the available experimental data and calculations, we propose that the mutation has a deteriorating effect on the binding of RBD to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which results in the negative selection of this variant. Extending the sequencing capacity toward the discovery of emerging recombinant or deleterious strains may facilitate the early recognition of novel strains with altered phenotypic attributes and understanding of key elements of spike protein evolution. Such studies may greatly contribute to future therapeutic research and general understanding of genomic processes of the virus.","Kemenesi, Gábor; Tóth, Gábor Endre; Bajusz, Dávid; Keseru, György M; Terhes, Gabriella; Burián, Katalin; Zeghbib, Safia; Somogyi, Balázs A; Jakab, Ferenc",,405,16

The study aimed to explore physicians' attitudes regarding euthanasia and examine the factors that related to these attitudes. We surveyed 135 physicians working at a tertiary-care hospital in Israel. The questionnaire was comprised of demographic and background information, DNR procedure information, encounters with terminally ill patients, familiarity with the law regarding end-of-life questions, and Attitudes toward Euthanasia. About 61% agreed that a person has the right to decide whether to expedite their own death, 54% agreed that euthanasia should be allowed, while 29% thought that physicians should preserve a patients' life even when they expressed the wish to die. A negative statistically significant relationship was found between the level of religiosity and attitudes toward euthanasia. The physicians' attitudes towards euthanasia are quite positive when compared to other countries. The data shows a conflict of values: the sacredness of human life versus the desire to alleviate patients' suffering. The Coronavirus-19 outbreak reinforces the importance of supporting physicians' efforts to provide ethical and empathic communication for terminally ill patients. Future studies should aim to improve our understanding and treatment of the specific types of suffering that lead to end-of-life requests.","Dopelt, Keren; Cohen, Dganit; Amar-Krispel, Einat; Davidovitch, Nadav; Barach, Paul",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),405,29

In March 2020, Qatar started reporting numbers of COVID-19 positive cases among workers in Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC). The study estimates the burden of the aforementioned infections and examines the demographic characteristics associated with the recorded positivity rates. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among Primary healthcare workers between March 1st and October 31st, 2020. The study examined the positivity rate of the different types of Primary healthcare workers and, analyzed the demographic characteristics of the infected persons. Results: 1,048 (87.4%) of the infected Health Care Workers (HCWs) belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC Health Centers (HCs) Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID dedicated HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p = 0.26). Storekeepers, engineering & maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, support staff, and security staff (outsourced non-clinical positions) had the highest positivity rates, 100, 67.2, 47.1, 32.4, and 29.5% respectively. Conclusion: The elevated risk of infection among outsourced non-clinical healthcare workers can be explained by environmental factors such as living conditions. Furthermore, better containment within clinical healthcare workers can be attributed to strict safety training and compliance with preventative measures which is recommended to be implemented across all settings.","Al-Kuwari, Mohamed Ghaith; AbdulMalik, Mariam Ali; Al-Nuaimi, Asma Ali; Abdulmajeed, Jazeel; Al-Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Semaan, Sandy; Kandy, Mujeeb",Front Public Health,405,16

This syndrome has been classically described in the setting of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, as well as with several viral pathogens. Cases: Here, we present two cases of cold agglutinins identified in the context of Covid-19 in critically ill patients treated at our institution. Each case was characterized by little in-vivo hemolysis, but these antibodies complicated laboratory assessment and renal replacement therapy. Management included anticoagulation and warming of dialysis circuit. Conclusions: Despite minimal in-vivo hemolysis, these antibodies are of clinical significance given their implications for laboratory assessment and renal replacement therapy, particularly with the frequency of multi-organ system dysfunction associated with severe Covid-19.","Jensen, Christopher E; Wilson, Samuel; Thombare, Aparna; Weiss, Susan; Ma, Alice",Clin Infect Pract,405,16

We summarize the reported pathologic findings on biopsy and autopsy in patients with severe/fatal COVID-19 and documented the presence and/or effect of SARS-CoV-2 in all organs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, Lilacs and Epistemonikos databases from January to August 2020 for all case reports and case series that reported histopathologic findings of COVID-19 infection at autopsy or tissue biopsy was performed. 603 COVID-19 cases from 75 of 451 screened studies met inclusion criteria. The most common pathologic findings were lungs: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (92%) and superimposed acute bronchopneumonia (27%); liver: hepatitis (21%), heart: myocarditis (11.4%). Vasculitis was common only in skin biopsies (25%). Microthrombi were described in the placenta (57.9%), lung (38%), kidney (20%), Central Nervous System (CNS) (18%), and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (2%). Injury of endothelial cells was common in the lung (18%) and heart (4%). Hemodynamic changes such as necrosis due to hypoxia/hypoperfusion, edema and congestion were common in kidney (53%), liver (48%), CNS (31%) and GI tract (18%). SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were demonstrated within organ-specific cells in the trachea, lung, liver, large intestine, kidney, CNS either by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, or immunohistochemistry. Additional tissues were positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests only. The included studies were from numerous countries, some were not peer reviewed, and some studies were performed by subspecialists, resulting in variable and inconsistent reporting or over statement of the reported findings. CONCLUSIONS: The main pathologic findings of severe/fatal COVID-19 infection are DAD, changes related to coagulopathy and/or hemodynamic compromise. In addition, according to the observed organ damage myocarditis may be associated with sequelae.","Peiris, Sasha; Mesa, Hector; Aysola, Agnes; Manivel, Juan; Toledo, Joao; Borges-Sa, Marcio; Aldighieri, Sylvain; Reveiz, Ludovic",PLoS One,405,24

As the Aedes mosquito predominately lives and breeds in and around people's homes, community participation in MBD management is an important part of preventing MBD outbreaks. Historically, government-led strategies have dominated community participation efforts as opposed to strategies co-designed or led by the community. A scoping review was conducted to describe the community participation and empowering approaches used in Aedes mosquito management specifically in HICs, and to identify any reported outcomes of these methods. A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature using electronic databases Medline (OVID), Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest-Science and Technology as well as grey literature, found 19 studies that matched the review criteria. The review findings highlight a lack of empirical evidence to inform participatory and empowering approaches to mosquito management in HICs. Moreover, the rationale for using predominantly government-led approaches is not clear.

Different loss functions imply different learning algorithms and, at times, very different predictors. While widespread and appealing, a clear drawback of this approach is that the loss function may not be known at the time of learning, requiring the algorithm to use a best-guess loss function. We suggest a rigorous new paradigm for loss minimization in machine learning where the loss function can be ignored at the time of learning and only be taken into account when deciding an action. We introduce the notion of an (${\mathcal{L}},\mathcal{C}$)-omnipredictor, which could be used to optimize any loss in a family ${\mathcal{L}}$. Once the loss function is set, the outputs of the predictor can be post-processed (a simple univariate data-independent transformation of individual predictions) to do well compared with any hypothesis from the class $\mathcal{C}$. The post processing is essentially what one would perform if the outputs of the predictor were true probabilities of the uncertain events. In a sense, omnipredictors extract all the predictive power from the class $\mathcal{C}$, irrespective of the loss function in $\mathcal{L}$. We show that such""loss-oblivious'' learning is feasible through a connection to multicalibration, a notion introduced in the context of algorithmic fairness. In addition, we show how multicalibration can be viewed as a solution concept for agnostic boosting, shedding new light on past results. Finally, we transfer our insights back to the context of algorithmic fairness by providing omnipredictors for multi-group loss minimization.","Gopalan, Parikshit; Kalai, Adam Tauman; Reingold, Omer; Sharan, Vatsal; Wieder, Udi",,405,16

The present research used a self-determination theory framework to examine the role of the Big 5 personality traits in university students' adaptation to online learning, measured by their quality of motivation, subjective well-being, self-efficacy, online engagement, and online satisfaction. A longitudinal study was conducted across the 2020 fall semester and included a total of 350 university students who answered surveys in September and December. Results showed that conscientiousness and openness to experience were associated with higher self-efficacy and with different forms of autonomous motivation for online learning. Conscientiousness was related to identified motivation, whereas openness to experience was related to intrinsic motivation. In contrast, neuroticism was related to increases in controlled motivation. Only openness to experience was strongly related to engagement with online learning and higher levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that openness to experience may be an adaptive trait for students' transition to online classes during these times of uncertainty.","Audet, Élodie C.; Levine, Shelby L.; Metin, Ezelbahar Koestner Sophie Barcan Stephanie",Personality and Individual Differences,405,15

METHODS: Data collection was performed on a retrospective cohort of patients surgically treated for primary HNC between March and May 2020, using data from two tertiary hospitals: the European Institute of Oncology (Milan) and Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London). RESULTS: We included 77 patients with HNC. More patients with COVID-19 were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and had Clavien-Dindo Classification grade I compared to negative patients, respectively (60% vs 22% [p = 0.058] and 40% vs 8% [p = 0.025]).

During a public health emergency, estimating all cause excess deaths above an expected level of death can provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden. Here, we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region from 2015 to 2020. We also compiled surveillance data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic and assembled weekly series of the proportion of tweets about 'death' from Mexico to assess the correlation between people's media interaction about 'death' and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models and forecasted the total excess deaths for Mexico for the first 4 weeks of 2021 using the generalized logistic growth model. RESULTS: We estimated the all-cause excess mortality rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 at 26.10 per 10,000 population, which corresponds to 333,538 excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). Mexico City reported the highest excess death rate (63.54) and RR (2.09) compared to rest of the country (excess rate = 23.25, RR = 1.62). While COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total excess deaths in Mexico, our forecast estimate that Mexico has accumulated a total of ~ 61,610 [95% PI: 60,003, 63,216] excess deaths in the first 4 weeks of 2021. Proportion of tweets was significantly correlated with the excess mortality (&#961; = 0.508 [95% CI: 0.245, 0.701], p-value = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected Mexico. The lab-confirmed COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total all cause excess deaths (333,538) in Mexico in 2020. This reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes during the pandemic. A model-based forecast indicates that an average of 61,610 excess deaths have occurred in January 2021.","Dahal, Sushma; Banda, Juan M; Bento, Ana I; Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Infect Dis,405,10

In this study, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of vaccine passports in relaxing public health restrictions. MethodsThrough an online survey that includes a conjoint experiment of a demographically representative sample of 5,000 Japanese adults aged 20-74, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of hypothetical vaccine passports. ResultsWe found that about 30% of respondents did not intend to vaccinate or have not yet decided, with major reasons for vaccine hesitancy being related to concerns about the safety and side effects of the vaccine. In line with previous findings, younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and psychological factors such as weaker COVID-19 fear were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The easing of public health restrictions such as travel, wearing face masks, and dining out at night was associated with an increase in vaccine acceptance by 4-10%. ConclusionVaccine hesitancy can be reduced by mitigating the concerns about vaccine safety and side effects, as well as by relaxing public health restrictions. However, the feasibility of vaccine passports needs to be sufficiently assessed, taking the ethical issues of passports and the public health impacts of the relaxation of restrictions into careful consideration.

Occupational health care in factories has become a challenging task. In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to change the production environment of a factory by adopting mid-term (to long-term) occupational healthcare measures is necessary. However, most of the guidelines and checklists provided by governments and international health organizations focus on short-tern responses to the pandemic. There are very few suggestions on what a factory should do in the medium to long term. This research aims to establish a systematic procedure for selecting suitable mid-term occupational healthcare measures for a factory amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) approach is proposed. In the proposed FAHP-FTOPSIS approach, FAHP is applied to derive the fuzzy priorities of factors that are critical to the suitability of a mid-term occupational healthcare measure based on the subjective judgments of a decision maker. Subsequently, the derived fuzzy priorities are input into FTOPSIS to evaluate the overall performance of a mid-term occupational healthcare measure. After considering five criteria, the best-performing mid-term occupational healthcare measure is the most suitable measure and will be selected by the factory. Results: The FAHP-FTOPSIS approach has been applied to compare the overall performances of four mid-term occupational healthcare measures for a factory based on the subjective judgment of a decision maker. According to the experimental results, the most suitable mid-term occupational healthcare measure for the factory was “isolating machines”, followed by “further automation”. Conclusions: A suitable mid-term occupation healthcare measure needs to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and be accepted by workers, and should have low estimated total costs, low interference with existing operations, and seamless integration with other functional activities. The priorities of these critical factors depend on the subjective judgment of a decision maker. Therefore, different decision makers will come to different conclusions.","Chen, Toly",Health Policy and Technology,405,5

This study examined the socioeconomic and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 infection among hospital workers in Indonesia, the country hardest-hit by the disease in the Southeast Asia region. (2) Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study, which collected data from 1397 hospital staff from eight hospitals in the Greater Jakarta area during April-July 2020. The data was collected using an online self-administered questionnaire and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests. We employed descriptive statistics and adjusted and unadjusted logistic regressions to analyze the data of hospital workers as well as the subgroups of healthcare and non-healthcare workers. (3) Results: from a total of 1397 hospital staff in the study, 22 (1.6%) were infected. In terms of correlates, being a healthcare worker (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 8.31, 95% CI 1.27-54.54) and having a household size of more than five (AOR = 4.09, 1.02-16.43) were significantly associated with a higher risk of infection. On the other hand, those with middle- and upper-expenditure levels were shown to have a lower risk of infection (AOR = 0.06, 0.01-0.66). Behavioral factors associated with COVID-19 infection among healthcare and non-healthcare workers included knowledge of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) (AOR = 0.08, 0.01-0.54) and application of the six-step handwashing technique (AOR = 0.32, 0.12-0.83).

Here we consider a model that links the supersymmetric electroweak phenomenology (bottom up) to the string theory motivated flux compactification approach (top down). In this model, supersymmetry is broken by a combination of the racetrack K\""ahler uplift mechanism, which naturally allows an exponentially small positive $\Lambda$ in a local minimum, and the anti-D3-brane in the KKLT scenario. In the absence of the Higgs doublets in the supersymmetric standard model, one has either a small $\Lambda$ or a big enough SUSY-breaking scale, but not both. The introduction of the Higgs fields (with their soft terms) allows a small $\Lambda$ and a big enough SUSY-breaking scale simultaneously. Since an exponentially small $\Lambda$ is statistically preferred (as the properly normalized probability distribution $P(\Lambda)$ diverges at $\Lambda=0^{+}$), identifying the observed $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ to the median value $\Lambda_{50\%}$ yields $m_{\rm EW} \sim 100$ GeV. We also find that the warped anti-D3-brane tension has a SUSY-breaking scale of $100m_{\rm EW}$ in the landscape while the SUSY-breaking scale that directly correlates with the Higgs fields in the visible sector has a value of $m_{\rm EW}$.","Qiu, Yu-Cheng; Tye, S.-H.

Methods: Three methods for disinfection using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (group A), plasma circulation air sterilizer (group B), and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation plus plasma circulation air sterilizer (group C) were utilized to sanitize the air in the CT room dedicated to COVID-19 cases. Single-factor ANOVA was used to evaluate and compare the disinfection effect of the three air disinfection methods; an air microbial sampler was used to sample and measure the number of bacteria in the air of the machine room. Results: The number of bacteria in the air immediately after disinfection was significantly lower than before disinfection (p < 0.01). All three disinfection methods met the disinfection requirement. No significant differences in the number of air bacteria in the machine room immediately after disinfection were observed among the three methods (p > 0.05). In addition, the effect of disinfection after 2 h was compared, and the number of bacteria in group C after 2 h was significantly lower than that in group A and group B. Conclusions: All three disinfection methods have significant disinfection effects. In addition, using ultraviolet disinfection lamps combined with a plasma air disinfection machine to sterilize the air in CT machine room has the best disinfection effect for the longest duration. Therefore, we recommend the combined disinfection method (ultraviolet disinfection lamps plus plasma air disinfection), as well as formulating relevant disinfection management norms, which should thus be the method to use during pandemics.","Cheng, Yilian; Hu, Jing; Chen, Hui; Wu, Liu; Liao, Jianmei; Cheng, Lin",Biomed Res Int,405,16

Methods: In this retrospective study conducted at 2 hospitals, we included consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) for whom a Stroke Alert (SA) was activated during the period 3/20 to 5/20/20 (COVID) and a similar period in 2019 (pre-COVID). We compared demographics, time metrics, and discharge outcomes. Results: 264 patients were seen pre-COVID compared to 121 during COVID (p&lt;0.001). Patients seen during COVID had an equal proportion of males (55% vs 51%, p=0.444), were majority African American (57 vs 58%, p=0.74), but had a higher presenting NIHSS (median: 5 vs 2, p=0.01) and longer times since last-known-well to ED arrival (median: 9.4 vs 4.8 hours, p=0.03) compared to pre-COVID.

We use a novel dataset from one of the largest online grocery retailers to look at the impact on product stockouts and prices. We find that product availability falls by 10% for vegetables, fruits, and edible oils, but there is a minimal impact on their prices. On the farm-gate side, it is matched by a 20% fall in quantity arrivals of vegetables and fruits. We then show that supply chain disruption is the main driver behind this fall. We compute the distance to production zones from our retail centers and find that the fall in product availability and quantity arrivals is larger for items that are cultivated or manufactured farther from the final point of sale. Our results show that long-distance food supply chains have been hit the hardest during the current pandemic with welfare consequences for urban consumers and farmers.","Mahajan, Kanika; Tomar, Shekhar",American journal of agricultural economics,405,26

The loop-tree duality opens multiloop scattering amplitudes to non-disjoint tree dual amplitudes by introducing as many on-shell conditions on the internal propagators as independent loop momenta, and is realized by modifying the usual infinitesimal imaginary prescription of Feynman propagators. Remarkably, non-causal singularities of the unintegrated amplitudes are explicitly cancelled in the dual representation, while the causal and anomalous threshold, soft and collinear singular structures emerge clearly in a compact region of the loop three-momenta, enabling a simultaneous computation with the extra emission real matrix elements through suitable momentum mappings. Based on the original formulation of the loop-tree duality, we present in this letter very compact and definite dual representations of a series of multiloop topologies with arbitrary powers of the Feynman propagators. These expressions are sufficient to describe any scattering amplitude up to three-loops, and their clear recurrence structure allows to conjecture other topologies with more complex combinatorics. Causal and infrared singularities are also manifestly characterized in these expressions.","Verdugo, J. Jesus Aguilera; Driencourt-Mangin, Felix; Pinto, Roger J.

The loop-tree duality is a novel method aimed at overcoming this bottleneck by opening the loop amplitudes into trees and combining them at integrand level with the real-emission matrix elements. In this Letter, we generalize the loop-tree duality to all orders in the perturbative expansion by using the complex Lorentz-covariant prescription of the original one-loop formulation. We introduce a series of mutiloop topologies with arbitrary internal configurations and derive very compact and factorizable expressions of their open-to-trees representation in the loop-tree duality formalism. Furthermore, these expressions are entirely independent at integrand level of the initial assignments of momentum flows in the Feynman representation and remarkably free of noncausal singularities. These properties, that we conjecture to hold to other topologies at all orders, provide integrand representations of scattering amplitudes that exhibit manifest causal singular structures and better numerical stability than in other representations.","Aguilera-Verdugo, J Jesús; Driencourt-Mangin, Félix; Hernández-Pinto, Roger J; Plenter, Judith; Ramírez-Uribe, Selomit; Rentería-Olivo, Andrés E; Rodrigo, Germán; Sborlini, Germán F R; Bobadilla, William J Torres; Tracz, Szymon",Phys Rev Lett,405,6

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. METHODS: 670 adults from the Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about CO-VID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g., illness, death, the economy, one's family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale administered at baseline and weeks 1-3 (primary endpoint). Follow-up assessments were conducted 1 month after treatment completion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04341922) before inclusion of the first participant. RESULTS: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in COVID-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to the waiting list (ß = 1.14, Z = 9.27, p < 0.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58-0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia, and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: A brief digital and easily scalable self-guided psychological intervention can significantly reduce dysfunctional worry and associated behavioural symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wahlund, Tove; Mataix-Cols, David; Olofsdotter Lauri, Klara; de Schipper, Elles; Ljótsson, Brjánn; Aspvall, Kristina; Andersson, Erik",Psychother Psychosom,405,1

The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea was the largest outbreak outside the Middle Eastern countries and was characterized as a nosocomial infection and a superspreading event. To assess the characteristics of a super spreading event, we specifically analyze the behaviors and epidemiological features of superspreaders. Furthermore, we employ a branching process model to understand a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. The existing model of the branching process (Lloyd-Smith model) is used to incorporate individual heterogeneity into the model, and the key epidemiological components (the reproduction number and the dispersive parameter) are estimated through the empirical transmission tree of the MERS-CoV data. We also investigate the impact of control intervention strategies on the MERS-CoV dynamics of the Lloyd-Smith model. Our results highlight the roles of superspreaders in a high level of heterogeneity. This indicates that the conditions within hospitals as well as multiple hospital visits were the crucial factors for superspreading events of the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak.","Choe, Seoyun; Kim, Hee-Sung; Lee, Sunmi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),405,1

We aimed to compare mental health outcomes, risk and protective factors for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), probable depression, and anxiety between HCW working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards. METHODS: A self-report survey, administered in a large tertiary hospital in Israel during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak was completed by 828 HCW (42.2% physicians, 57.8% nurses. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; the Primary Care-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and PTSS, respectively. Pandemic-related stress factors, negative experiences, and potential protective factors were also assessed. RESULTS: Median PC-PTSD scores differed significantly between study teams (&#967;2 [5] = 17.24; p = .004). Prevalence of probable depression and anxiety were similar in both groups. Risk factors for mental health outcomes included mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected and infecting family. Overall, higher proportion of the COVID-19 team witnessed patient deaths as compared to the non-COVID-19 team (50.2% vs. 24.7%). Witnessing patient death at the COVID-19 wards was associated with a four-fold increased likelihood of PTSS (odds ratio [OR] = 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-9.99; p = .0007), compared with the non-COVID-19 wards (OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.51-1.61; p = .43). CONCLUSIONS: Witnessing patient death appears to be a risk factor for PTSS unique to HCW directly engaged in treating patients with COVID-19. Our findings suggest that helping HCW cope with COVID-19 related deaths might reduce their risk of posttraumatic stress.","Mosheva, Mariela; Gross, Raz; Hertz-Palmor, Nimrod; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Kaplan, Rachel; Cleper, Rony; Kreiss, Yitshak; Gothelf, Doron; Pessach, Itai M",Depress Anxiety,405,27

The patients' comorbidities were allergic asthma and obesity;he was on no regular medication. On day15 after admission to the ICU, invasive ventilation was started, and on day 19, melena, with a drop in hemoglobin levelfrom 12.9 g/dl to 8.5 g/dl, was observed. Methods In the emergency gastroscopy, three ulcerations were seen in the duodenal bulb. Two ulcerations showed visiblevessels (Forrest IIa), and were treated with a standard hemoclip as well as an “Over-the-Scope-Clip” (OTSC, Ovesco). Thethird ulceration was covered by a large clot (F IIb). After mobilization of the clot, the ulceration was seen to have perforatedinto the retroperitoneum. Results The patient underwent emergency surgery in which the perforation was sutured. Conclusions Studies have shown a high risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal ischemia and ileusin critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease. In this case, we postulate that critically ill patients with COVID-19 may havea higher risk of GI bleeding and ulcer perforation. However, it is unclear whether these complications can be specificallyattributed to the underlying COVID-19 disease or the therapeutic anticoagulation, which all critically ill patients with COVID-19 recieve as standard of care. Further studies are needed to confirm or rule out these assumptions. Nevertheless, specialattention should be paid to gastrointestinal complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Prinz, F.; Braun, G.; Ebigbo, A.; Messmann, H.",Endoscopy,405,1

Viral antigen detection can compete with gold-standard PCR-based nucleic acid diagnostics in terms of better reflection of viral infectivity and reduced risk of contamination from enzymatic amplification. Here, we report the development of a one-step thermophoretic assay using an aptamer and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for direct quantitative detection of viral particles. The assay relies on aptamer binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneous accumulation of aptamer-bound viral particles in laser-induced gradients of temperature and PEG concentration. Using a pseudotyped lentivirus model, a limit of detection of â¼170 particles µL-1 (26 fM of the spike protein) is achieved in 15 min without the need of any pretreatment. As a proof of concept, the one-step thermophoretic assay is used to detect synthetic samples by spiking viral particles into oropharyngeal swabs with an accuracy of 100%.

BACKGROUND: Commitment to a profession requires doing the best for that profession. In the case of the nursing profession, professional commitment gains greater importance in times of crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 389 nurses in the Turkish state hospital. Institutional permissions, ethical approval and written consents from the participants were obtained before carrying out the study. RESULTS: The participants' mean Perceived Organizational Obstruction Scale score was 20.07 ± 8.06 (min = 5.0, max = 35.0), and their mean Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.20 ± 11.94 (min = 30.0, max = 103.0). Socio-demographic variables and perception of organisational obstruction predicted 36.7% of the variance in the professional commitment (p < .001). CONCLUSION: A road map based on the study results was developed for hospitals and nurse managers to maintain and increase nurses' professional commitment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results of this study may help institutions and nurse managers understand the factors affecting professional commitment during the pandemic as a whole, as well as determine primary strategies based on the importance of these factors.","Duran, Secil; Celik, Isa; Ertugrul, Bekir; Ok, Serife; Albayrak, Sevil",J. nurs. manag,405,20

468663,468663,468663,Nexus of COVID-19 and diabetes pandemics: Global public health lessons,21.10506,9.106868,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social and physical distancing in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. METHODS: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: ""What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens"" was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. RESULTS: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were ""very stressed"" and 452 were ""slightly worried"" about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (&#967;23=11.76, P=.008), television (&#967;23=12.40, P=.006), YouTube (&#967;23=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (&#967;23=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health ""not good"" were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F1,637=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F1,637=14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said ""good"" than others; F1,637=13.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Amber; Khalili-Mahani, Najmeh",J Med Internet Res,405,20

The approach grew out of specific analyses conducted during the pandemic, in particular an analysis concerning the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing COVID-19 transmission in 11 European countries. The model parameterizes the time varying reproduction number $R_t$ through a regression framework in which covariates can e.g be governmental interventions or changes in mobility patterns. This allows a joint fit across regions and partial pooling to share strength. This innovation was critical to our timely estimates of the impact of lockdown and other NPIs in the European epidemics, whose validity was borne out by the subsequent course of the epidemic. Our framework provides a fully generative model for latent infections and observations deriving from them, including deaths, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and seroprevalence surveys. One issue surrounding our model's use during the COVID-19 pandemic is the confounded nature of NPIs and mobility. We use our framework to explore this issue. We have open sourced an R package epidemia implementing our approach in Stan.

While computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are mainstays in preoperative evaluation of bony invasion and soft tissue extension of the lesion, their imaging characteristics by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is less well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation and management of a PET positive sinonasal lesion. To conduct a literature review of FDG uptake in benign sinonasal papillomas. METHODS: Case report (n = 1) and literature review of similar cases (n = 32). RESULTS: We report the case of a 69-year-old man presenting with an isolated left maxillary sinus mass with avid FDG uptake, discovered on PET/CT imaging. An endoscopic left maxillary mega-antrostomy provided successful definitive treatment for final pathologic diagnosis of oncocytic papilloma. Literature review of cases of sinonasal papillomas with avid FDG uptake found that oncocytic papillomas, on average, exhibit greater uptake than inverted papillomas and both may be mistaken as malignancies on PET. CONCLUSION: While PET imaging demonstrating avid FDG uptake is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, it does not rule out the possibility of a benign sinonasal papilloma nor other benign inflammatory lesions. Particularly, oncocytic papillomas may have very high FDG uptake and mimic malignant lesions.","Shafqat, Iram; Ho, Allen S; Manzoor, Daniel; Balzer, Bonnie; Wu, Arthur W",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,405,16

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R0 from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors-population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality-as having strong relationships with R0, across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R0 but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.","Kong, Jude Dzevela; Tekwa, Edward W; Gignoux-Wolfsohn, Sarah A",PLoS One,405,16

Reading in tandem the stories woven within the novels Ravensong (1993) by Salish-Métis author Lee Maracle and its sequel Celia’s Song (2014), it brings to light a model of community-centred health policing in the earlier novel that turns into a powerful call for decolonization and Indigenous resurgence in Celia’s Song. The use of illness tropes in these novels goes beyond exposing the damaging by-products of colonialism, manifested as a transgenerational epidemic of violence amongst the Indigenous population, to create powerful images of Indigenous resurgence and Indigenous–settler engagement.

Planning of diagnostics and treatment of a dental patient with the use of modern digital technologies was proposed to be divided into stages. A complex of digital planning of dental orthopedic treatment was formed, which is illustrated by clinical case analysis. The first stage is the planning of the rehabilitation stage, which includes the diagnosis of the patient's dental status and preparation for orthopedic treatment. The second stage is 2D virtual planning of dental rows in the smile area-includes 2D visualization in the form of mandatory use of dental digital photography protocols and 2D creation of a virtual image of a smile using digital two-dimensional planning programs.

model of transmission of COVID-19, in the State of Sergipe, Brazil, to estimate the distribution of cases over time and to project the impact on the spread of the epidemic outbreak due to interventions and control measures on the local population Methods: Epidemiological mathematical modeling study, carried out to analyze the dynamics of accumulated cases of COVID-19, which used a logistic growth model that adds a term of withdrawal of individuals as a control measure Three possible scenarios of COVID-19 propagation based on three different withdrawal rates of individuals were simulated Each of the rates is adjusted with actual data on the number of infected and control measures on the population Results: The extreme measure of total isolation, or lockdown, would be the best scenario, presenting a lower incidence of infected, when compared to the other measures The number of infected would grow slowly over the months and the number of symptomatic individuals in this scenario would be 40,265 cases It was noticed that the State of Sergipe is still in the initial phase of the disease, in any of the scenarios It was possible to observe that the peak of cases and balance, in the current scenario of social isolation, will take place when the new support capacity is reached, at the end of August in approximately 1,171,353 infected individuals Conclusion: It was

An effective, feasible way is to use the pre-existing &#916;ORF6 mutant of SARS-CoV as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, since both lack the moiety responsible for interferon antagonistic effects. By analyzing temporal profiles of upregulated genes in &#916;ORF6-infected Calu-3 cells, we prioritized 55 genes and 238 ligands to reposition currently available medications for COVID-19 therapy. Eight of them are already in clinical trials. Of particular importance is the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 that have not been used in COVID-19 treatment. We also pinpointed 16 drug groups from the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, with the potential to mitigate symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus to be repositioned for COVID-19 therapy.","Wong, Henry Sung-Ching; Guo, Chin-Lin; Lin, Gan-Hong; Lee, Kang-Yun; Okada, Yukinori; Chang, Wei-Chiao",Genomics,405,26

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.","Gurwitz, David",Drug dev. res,405,1

This article aims to present the main impacts of the COVID-19 movement restrictions on the road traffic in the Czech Republic, measured during the first epidemic wave, i.e., from 12 March to 17 May 2020. The state of emergency was imposed by the Czech government as a de jure measure for coping with the perceived crisis, although the measure eventually resulted only in a quite liberal de facto form of stay-at-home instruction. Unique country-scale traffic data of the first six months of 2020 from 37,002 km of roads, constituting 66% of all roads in the Czech Republic, were collected and analyzed. For the prediction of the prepandemic traffic conditions and their comparison with the measured values in the period of the state of emergency, a long-term traffic speed prediction ensemble model consisting of case-based reasoning, linear regression, and fallback submodels was used. The authors found out that the COVID-19 movement restrictions had a significant impact on the country-wide traffic. Traffic density was reduced considerably in the first three weeks, and the weekly average traffic speed in all road types increased by up to 21%, expectedly due to less crowded roads. The exception was motorways, where a different trend in traffic was found. In sum, during the first three weeks of the state of emergency, people followed government regulations and restrictions and changed their travel behavior accordingly. However, following this period, the traffic gradually returned to the prepandemic state. This occurred three weeks before the state of emergency was terminated. From a behavioral perspective, this article briefly discusses the possible causes of such discrepancies between de jure and de facto pandemic measures, i.e., the governmental communication strategy related to loosening of movement restrictions, media reality, and certain culture-related traits.

It has been known that pulmonary function is affected by COVID-19 during infection and mid-to-long term. However, there is inadequate evidence about extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out after at least 12 weeks from the COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was defined using criteria for clinical severity of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The peripheral muscle strength was measured using the dynamometer. Physical performance was assessed with five times sit-to-stand and 4-m gait speed. Physical activity level (PAL), mood, and sleep quality were assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants with post-COVID-19 (39.2 ± 7.9 years, 54.2% women) were included in the study. Handgrip and quadriceps weakness was observed in 39.6% and 35.4% of the participants, respectively. PAL was low in 39.6%, moderate in 33.3%, and high in 27.1% of the participants. Anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality were observed in 33.3%, 29.2%, and 50% of the participants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapulmonary features are adversely affected in a substantial proportion of post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. Comprehensive assessment and appropriate intervention strategies should also be considered for non-severe post-COVID-19 patients.","Tanriverdi, Aylin; Savci, Sema; Kahraman, Buse Ozcan; Ozpelit, Ebru",Ir. j. med. sci,405,16

About a fifth of world’s population is infected by influenza virus annually, leading to high morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised. In the US alone, influenza outbreaks lead to roughly 30,000 deaths each year. Current vaccines and anti-influenza drugs are of limited use due to high mutation rate of the virus and side effects. In recent years, RNA interference, triggered by synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA), has rapidly evolved as a potent antiviral regimen. Properly designed siRNAs have been shown to function as potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication. The siRNAs outperform traditional small molecule antivirals in a number of areas, such as ease of design, modest cost, and fast turnaround.

Inhibition of viral establishment and spread at and from these mucosal sites is paramount for preventing severe disease, while concomitantly limiting putative detrimental effects of inflammation. Here, we compare the roles of type I, II, and III IFNs in regulating three archetypal viruses – norovirus, herpes simplex virus, and severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – which infect distinct mammalian mucosal tissues. Emerging paradigms include highly specific roles for IFNs in limiting local versus systemic infection, synergistic activities, and a spectrum of protective versus detrimental effects of IFNs during the infection response.","Walker, Forrest C.; Sridhar, Pratyush R.; Baldridge, Megan T.",Trends Immunol,405,26

In Austria, 92,835 fragility fractures occurred in patients aged ≥ 50 years in 2018, accruing direct costs of > 157 million €. Due to demographic aging, the number of fragility fractures and their associated costs are expected to increase even further. INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are frequently associated with long hospital stays, loss of independence, and increased need for care in the elderly, with consequences often leading to premature death. The aim of this study was to estimate the number of fragility fractures and associated healthcare costs in Austria in 2018. METHODS: The number of in-patient cases with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in all Austrian public hospitals was derived from discharge documentation of diagnoses and procedures covering all public hospitals in Austria. Fractures resulting from falls from standing height in patients aged ≥ 50 years were used as a proxy for fragility fractures, and the number of in-patient and out-patient cases was estimated. The direct costs of these cases were calculated using the average cost of the corresponding in-patient hospital stay and the average cost for the out-patient stay. RESULTS: The present study estimated the number of fragility fractures (pelvis, thoracic and lumbar vertebra, hip, humerus, rib, forearm, and tibia) for 2018 at 92,835 or just over half of all fractures in patients aged ≥ 50 years, corresponding to a prevalence of 2,600 per 100,000 inhabitants of this age group. A constant increase in the proportion of fragility fractures among all fractures was observed with increasing age in both men and women. These fractures amounted to direct costs of > 157 million €. CONCLUSION: Fragility fractures are a frequent and costly event in Austria. Due to the aging of the population, the number of fragility fractures and their associated costs is expected to increase even further.

Palsy of the third cranial nerve is very rare in patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We describe the case of a patient with an incomplete palsy of the left third cranial nerve sparing the pupils in the context of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19, which presented with acute onset of diplopia and strabismus of the left eye that occurred 3 days after the start of general symptoms. The patient had no significant medical history. Based on detailed ophthalmic and neurological examination, acute painless incomplete palsy of the third cranial nerve was suspected. Oculo-cerebral magnetic resonance angiography was unremarkable. Blood tests revealed mild normocytic regenerative anemia. According to the Moroccan recommendations, chloroquine and azithromycin were started. After what, a quick improvement of exotropia and diplopia was observed, and complete recovery was obtained by the sixth day of treatment. No adverse effects of the treatment were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause neurological complications such as cranial nerve palsy. The pathological mechanism remains unclear. Full recovery of the ocular motricity is possible, and prognosis depends on the severity of the respiratory illness.","Belghmaidi, Sarah; Nassih, Houda; Boutgayout, Saloua; Fakiri, Karima El; Qadiri, Rabiy El; Hajji, Ibtissam; Bourahouate, Aicha; Moutaouakil, Abdeljalil",Am J Case Rep,405,20

We investigated Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and anxiety levels, and the association between perceived impact on well-being, studies, and daily lives and anxiety levels, adjusted for gender, age, social class and affiliation. Early in the lock-down all students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (N = 12,429) were invited to a voluntary longitudinal health survey. Participation rate was 20% (n = 2437): 70% females, median age 25 yrs. (IQR 23–28). A total of 10% reported a deterioration of well-being compared to pre-Corona. LCA yielded three classes varying in perceived COVID-19 impact: 1 (low, n = 675), 2 (moderate, n = 1098), and 3 (strong, n = 656). Adjusted proportion of moderate to severe anxiety by class were 45% (95% CI: 28.0–62.0), 15.5% (95% CI: 13.1–17.9), and 5.1% (95% CI: 4.7–5.6), respectively.

With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we developed an alternative to contact-type fingertip photoplethysmography: a novel web camera-based contact-free MDD screening system (WCF-MSS) for non-contact measurement of autonomic transient responses induced by a mental task. METHODS: The WCF-MSS measures time-series interbeat intervals (IBI) by monitoring color tone changes in the facial region of interest induced by arterial pulsation using a web camera (1920 × 1080 pixels, 30 frames/s). Artifacts caused by body movements and head shakes are reduced. The WCF-MSS evaluates autonomic nervous activation from time-series IBI by calculating LF (0.04–0.15 Hz) components of heart rate variability (HRV) corresponding to sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity and HF (0.15–0.4 Hz) components equivalent to parasympathetic activities. The clinical test procedure comprises a pre-rest period (Pre-R; 140 s), mental task period (MT; 100 s), and post-rest period (Post-R; 120 s). The WCF-MSS uses logistic regression analysis to discriminate MDD patients from healthy volunteers via an optimal combination of four explanatory variables determined by a minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm: HF during MT (HF(MT)), the percentage change of LF from pre-rest to MT (%ΔLF((Pre–R⇒MT))), the percentage change of HF from pre-rest to MT (%ΔHF((Pre–R⇒MT))), and the percentage change of HF from MT to post-rest (%ΔHF((MT⇒Post–R))). To clinically test the WCF-MSS, 26 MDD patients (16 males and 10 females, 20–58 years) were recruited from BESLI Clinic in Tokyo, and 27 healthy volunteers (15 males and 12 females, 18–60 years) were recruited from Tokyo Metropolitan University and RICOH Company, Ltd. Electrocardiography was used to calculate HRV variables as references. RESULT: The WCF-MSS achieved 73% sensitivity and 85% specificity on 5-fold cross-validation. IBI correlated significantly with IBI from reference electrocardiography (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001). Logit scores and subjective self-rating depression scale scores correlated significantly (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The WCF-MSS seems a promising contact-free MDD screening apparatus. This method enables web camera built-in smartphones to be used as MDD screening systems.","Unursaikhan, Batbayar; Tanaka, Nobuaki; Sun, Guanghao; Watanabe, Sadao; Yoshii, Masako; Funahashi, Kazuki; Sekimoto, Fumihiro; Hayashibara, Fumiaki; Yoshizawa, Yutaka; Choimaa, Lodoiravsal; Matsui, Takemi",Front Physiol,405,29

The aim of this multi-centre study was to measure the impact of COVID-19 on IR services in the UK. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study of IR practice in six UK centres during the COVID-19 pandemic was carried out. All therapeutic IR procedures were identified using the respective hospital radiology information systems and COVID-19 status found on the hospital patient record systems. The total number of therapeutic IR procedures was recorded over two time periods, 25/03/2019–21/04/2019 (control group) and 30/03/2020–26/04/2020 (COVID-19 group). The data points collected were: procedure type, aerosol-generating nature, acute or elective case, modality used, in- or out-of-hours case and whether the procedure was done at the bedside (portable). RESULTS: A 31% decrease in overall number of IR procedures was observed during COVID-19 compared to the control group (1363 cases vs 942 cases); however, the acute work decreased by only 0.5%. An increase in out-of-hours work by 10% was observed. COVID-19 was suspected or laboratory proved in 9.9% of cases (n = 93), and 15% of total cases (n = 141) were classed as aerosol-generating procedures. A 66% rise in cholecystostomy was noted during COVID-19. Image-guided ablation, IVC filters, aortic stent grafting and visceral vascular stenting had the greatest % decreases in practice during COVID-19, with 91.7%, 83.3%, 80.8% and 80.2% decreases, respectively.

Currently, it is known that endothelial cell dysfunction is a critical event in the infection by this virus. However, in a representative percentage of patients with COVID-19, neither cardiovascular disease nor diabetes mellitus, which could be linked with endothelial dysfunction, has been reported. Previous evidence has shown the presence of early endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects but with a family history of type 2 diabetes (FH-DM2), where glucose metabolism, the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as expression of genes involved with their synthesis are impaired. Besides, in subjects with an FH-DM2, the presence of hyperinsulinemia and high glucose levels are common events that could favor the infection of endothelial cells by the coronavirus. Interestingly, both events have been reported in patients with COVID-19, in whom hyperinsulinemia increases the surface expression of ACE2 through a diminution of ADAMTS17 activity; whereas hyperglycemia induces higher expression of ACE2 in different tissues, including microvascular endothelial cells from the pancreatic islets, favoring chronic hyperglycemia and affecting the release of insulin. Therefore, we hypothesized that an FH-DM2 should be considered an important risk factor, since the individuals with this background develop an early endothelial dysfunction, which would increase the susceptibility and severity of infection and damage to the endothelium, in the patient infected with the SARS-CoV-2.","Alvarado-Vasquez, Noé",Med Hypotheses,405,1

Two studies investigated the effects of two possible restrictions affecting COVID‐19 vaccination: the limitation of non‐vaccination by mandates and the limitation of vaccination by scarce vaccine supply. In the first study, we compared reactance about mandatory and scarce vaccination scenarios and the moderating effect of vaccination intentions, employing a German quota‐representative sample (N = 973). In the preregistered second study, we replicated effects with an American sample (N = 1394) and investigated the consequences of reactance on various behavioral intentions. Results revealed that reactance was stronger when a priori vaccination intentions were low and a mandate was introduced or when vaccination intentions were high and vaccines were scarce. In both cases, reactance increased intentions to take actions against the restriction. Further, reactance due to a mandate was positively associated with intentions to avoid the COVID‐19 vaccination and an unrelated chickenpox vaccination; it was negatively associated with intentions to show protective behaviors limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Opposite intentions were observed when vaccination was scarce.

Under- or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.","Peña, José; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Allen, Jonathan E.; Hwang, Mona; Elsheikh, Maher; Mabery, Shalini; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle; Zemla, Adam T.; Bowen, Richard A.; Borucki, Monica K.",Virus Evol,405,9

The complexity of inpatient glycemic management has led to the emergence of inpatient diabetes management service (IDMS), a multidisciplinary team approach to glycemic management. OBJECTIVE: To review recent literature on the financial and clinical impact of IDMS in hospital settings. METHODS: We searched PubMed using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms to describe the concept of IDMS and combined the search terms with a comparative effectiveness filter for costs and cost analysis developed by the National Library of Medicine. FINDINGS: In addition to several improved clinical endpoints such as glycemic management outcomes, IDMS implementation is associated with hospital cost savings through decreased length of stay, preventing hospital readmissions, hypoglycemia reduction, and optimizing resource allocation. There are other downstream potential cost savings in long-term patient health outcomes and avoidance of litigation related to suboptimal glycemic management. CONCLUSION: IDMS may play an important role in helping both academic and community hospitals to improve the quality of diabetes care and reduce costs. Clinicians and policymakers can utilize existing literature to build a compelling business case for IDMS to hospital administrations and state legislatures in the era of value-based healthcare.","Haque, Waqas Zia; Demidowich, Andrew Paul; Sidhaye, Aniket; Golden, Sherita Hill; Zilbermint, Mihail",Curr Diab Rep,405,20

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival. METHODS: We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. FINDINGS: Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of three/six months would cause attributable death of 4,755/10,760 of these individuals with loss of 92,214/208,275 life-years. For cancer surgery, average life-years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of three/six months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of three/six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482,022 LYGs requiring of 1,052,949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs. INTERPRETATION: Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of three/six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of life-years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.","Sud, Amit; Jones, Michael; Broggio, John; Loveday, Chey; Torr, Bethany; Garrett, Alice; Nicol, David L.; Jhanji, Shaman; Boyce, Stephen A.; Gronthoud, Firza; Ward, Phillip; Handy, Jonathan M.; Yousaf, Nadia; Larkin, James; Suh, Yae-Eun; Scott, Stephen; Pharoah, Paul D.P.; Swanton, Charles; Abbosh, Christopher; Williams, Matthew; Lyratzopoulos, Georgios; Houlston, Richard; Turnbull, Clare",Ann Oncol,405,29

Data were entered using Epi-data 4.2.0.0 statistical software, and analysis was done by Stata version 14 statistical software. Binary logistic regression model was used for analysis. Strength of association was measured using the odds ratio with 95% CI, and the level of significance was estimated at P-value ≤0.05. RESULTS: Nurses’ intention to care for COVID-19 patient was 59.5% (95% CI; 58.7:60.3). Having better working experience (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =2.3:95% CI; 1.120, 4.910), caring experience for infectious disease (AOR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.50), good perceived behavioral control (AOR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.8), and subjective norms (AOR= 2.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.36) were significantly associated with intention of caring behavior. CONCLUSION: Nurses’ intention to care for COVID-19 patients was low. Working experience, the experience of caring for infectious disease, self-efficacy, and subjective norm were independently related with nurses’ caring intention. The government should work on improving nurse’s confidence in disaster management, design disaster management nursing education, and frequent support of nurses.","Minuye, Binyam; Alebachew, Wubet; Kebede, Melese; Asnakew, Sintayehu; Mesfin Belay, Demeke",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,405,24

We analysed all the patients who were treated as COVID-19-positive with or without a positive swab and were tested for vitamin D levels. METHODS: This was a retrospective, study involving 1226 patients swabbed for SARS-CoV-2 between the 10 February 2020 and 1 May 2020 at two hospitals of East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. Patients who were swab-positive for COVID-19 or treated as COVID-19-positive on clinical grounds even though swab results were negative were included in this study. We analysed the association of vitamin D levels and mortality, assessing linear and non-linear associations. RESULTS: A total of 1226 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA swabs in this period with age range from 1 year to 101 years. A cohort of 433 of these patients had swabs and recent vitamin D levels anytime in the previous 3 months. Mortality rates were not found to be associated with vitamin D levels (OR=1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest similar mortality risk from COVID-19 irrespective of the levels of vitamin D. Larger prospective studies will be needed to confirm these findings.","Zafar, Mansoor; Karkhanis, Mangala; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Khanna, Alisha; Barry, Lucinda; Alam, Saba; Lawrence, Kamal; Pun, Bipin; Eldebri, Reem; Makanjuola, Opeyemi; Safarova, Dana; Farooq, Mariya; Nooredinavand, Hesam; Cuison, Frderic; Subba, Karuna; Singh Randhawa, Ratan; Hegner, Johannes; Oluwamayowa, Ojofeitimi; Elyasaky, Amr; Adekunle, Bolurin; Periasamy, Manivannan; Abdelbagi, Mohamed; Maryam, Zahra; Khuu, Bao; Esteves Morete, Andreia; Ciroi, Giulio; Moran, Steve; O'Neill, William; Zafar, Maaryah J; Zafar, Nadiyah; Patel, Mirej; Golez, Raphael; Hadid, Abubakr; Muhammad, Tila; Mayhead, Philip; Whitehead, Mark; Dashora, Umesh",Postgrad Med J,405,16

Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male sexual partners of women who are pregnant. Both sexes are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established in 2003 to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin for signals of possible human teratogenicity. METHODS: This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ribavirin. Exposure is classified as direct—women taking ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conception—or indirect—women exposed through sexual contact, 6 months prior to or during pregnancy, with a man who is taking or has taken ribavirin in the past 6 months. Women are followed until delivery and infants for 1 year. When enrollment is complete, birth defect rates will be compared with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program’s published rate of 2.67. Using data collected since inception in 2003 through February 2016, preliminary rates were calculated. RESULTS: The registry has enrolled 272 pregnant women, with 180 live births: there were seven birth defect cases among 85 directly exposed women [7/85 (8.2%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4–16.2)] and four birth defect cases among 95 indirectly exposed women [4/95 (4.2%) (95% CI 1.2–10.4)]. Of the 11 infants, nine had structural defects and two had chromosomal anomalies. Patterns suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure are not seen. CONCLUSION: Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, preliminary findings do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, the current sample size is insufficient for definitive conclusions, and ribavirin exposure should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months prior to pregnancy, in accordance with prescribing information.

Pharmacists are at the front line and have long been involved in combating this public health emergency. Therefore, the study was aimed to explore pharmacy preparedness and response to prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in six pharmacies in Aksum, Ethiopia in May, 2020. We conducted six in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants. Direct observation measures were made to assess the activities made in the medicine retail outlets for the prevention and control of the pandemic. Interview data were audio-recorded, translated and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data and OpenCode version 4.02 software was used to facilitate the data analysis. RESULTS: The thematic analysis has resulted in seven major themes. Good preparedness measures were undertaken to control and prevent COVID-19. Study informants had good knowledge about the pandemic disease and reported they had used different resource materials to update themselves. Preparing of alcohol-based hand-rub, availing finished sanitizers and alcohol, and advising clients to maintain physical distancing were the major counseling information being delivered to prevent the disease. Some tendencies of irrational drug use and false claims of COVID-19 were observed at the beginning of the pandemic. Interview informants had reported they were working with relevant stakeholders and appropriate patient education and support were given to combat the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The study revealed necessary pharmacy services has been rendered to all clients. However, availability of drugs and medical supplies were scarce which negatively affected the optimal delivery of pharmacy services. The government and other responsible bodies should work together to solve such problems and contain the pandemic.","Kasahun, Gebremicheal Gebreslassie; Kahsay, Gebremichael Mulu; Asayehegn, Amha Teklu; Demoz, Gebre Teklemariam; Desta, Desilu Mahari; Gebretekle, Gebremedhin Beedemariam",BMC Health Serv Res,405,11

We identify key intercurrent events (ICEs) that may occur due to COVID-19 in oncology clinical trials with a focus on time-to-event endpoints and discuss considerations pertaining to the other estimand attributes introduced in the ICH E9 addendum. We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related ICEs, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the interpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective from a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid. The estimand framework provides a common language to discuss the impact of COVID-19 in a structured and transparent manner.

Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. METHOD: Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) during November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. RESULTS: 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate=80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94–1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27–3.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD. Those who were female, aged 45 or above, reported low family income, or reported an “average” or “poor” family environment were associated with a higher risk of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries. Female sex, age older than 45, low family income, and poor family environment appear to be independent risk factors for MDD.","Liu, Jing; Yan, Fang; Ma, Xin; Guo, Hong-Li; Tang, Yi-Lang; Rakofsky, Jeffrey J.; Wu, Xiao-Mei; Li, Xiao-Qiang; Zhu, Hong; Guo, Xiao-Bing; Yang, Yang; Li, Peng; Cao, Xin-Dong; Li, Hai-Ying; Li, Zhen-Bo; Wang, Ping; Xu, Qiu-Yue",J Affect Disord,405,16

Our primary purpose is to summarize emerging research describing the impacts of the pandemic on social isolation among older adults. A streamlined search was conducted to fit the scope of this literature review. Common research databases and mainstream resources and websites were utilized to identify research published or released in 2020 to align with the pandemic. Early research indicates that the pandemic has worsened social isolation among older adults. Social isolation has become urgent, as seniors have lost their usual connections due to social distancing. While safety measures are critical to prevent virus exposure, this approach must be balanced with maintaining social connectedness. The pandemic highlights the importance of social connections, with significant impacts on both community-living older adults and those in nursing facilities. Safety protocols have created a paradox of reduced risk along with greater harm. Consequently, adapted approaches are urgently needed to address the consequences of a long-term social recession.","MacLeod, Stephanie; Tkatch, Rifky; Kraemer, Sandra; Fellows, Annette; McGinn, Michael; Schaeffer, James; Yeh, Charlotte S.",Geriatrics (Basel),405,20

METHODS: To address gaps in local contact tracing, health professional students partnered with their academic institution to conduct contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases diagnosed on site, which included identifying and reaching their contacts, educating participants and providing social resources to support effective quarantine and isolation. RESULTS: From March 24(th) to May 28(th), 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were contacted and reported an average of 2.6 contacts. Contacts were informed of their exposure, asked to quarantine and monitored for the onset of symptoms. Callers reached 94% of cases and 84% of contacts. 74% of cases reported at least 1 contact. Household members had higher rates of reporting symptoms (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.19:2.28).

Research Methodology/Design A cross-sectional survey Setting Adult ICUs in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Main Outcome Measures Likert scale responses and free-text comments within six areas: ICU capacity and staffing, visiting policies and access to the ICU, information and conferences with relatives, written information, children as relatives and follow-up initiatives. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 53% (74/140 participating ICUs). All ICUs had planned for capacity extensions; the majority ranging between 11 and 30 extra beds. From March–June 2020, ICUs had a mean maximum of 9.4 COVID-19 patients simultaneously. Allowing restricted visiting was more common in Denmark (52%) and Norway (61%) than in Sweden where ICU visiting was mostly denied except for dying patients (68%), due to a particular increased number of COVID-19 patients. The restrictions forced nurses to compromise on their usual standards of family care. Numerous models for maintaining contact between relatives and patients were described. CONCLUSION: Visitation restrictions compromised the quality of family care and entailed dilemmas for healthcare professionals but also spurred initiatives to developing new ways of providing family care.","Irene Jensen, Hanne; Åkerman, Eva; Lind, Ranveig; Birgit Alfheim, Hanne; Frivold, Gro; Fridh, Isabell; Sophie Ågård, Anne",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,405,24

Due to these risks, patients are encouraged to avoid clinics and instead use Telemedicine for safer consultations and diagnoses. In March, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice titled Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public Health Emergency (the “Notification”). The Notification relaxes the enforcement of privacy and security safeguards established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) until further notice, in order to facilitate the transition to telehealth services for the broader purpose of promoting public health during the pandemic. Specifically, covered healthcare providers can use telehealth to provide all services that, in their professional judgment, they believe can be provided through telehealth. If providers make good faith efforts to provide the most timely and accessible care possible, they will not be subject to penalties for breaching the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. This paper examines the implications of the Notification on patients’ health information privacy. It recommends that patients should undertake a careful reading of provider privacy policies to make sure their protected health information (PHI) is not at risk before switching to telehealth consultation. Acknowledging the limitations of patient self-protection from bad privacy practices when in need for medical treatment during pandemic, the paper proposes that consumers’ data privacy should be protected through one of two alternative regulatory interventions: the FTC’s authority under §5, or HIPAA’s business associates agreements.","Bassan, Sharon",J Law Biosci,405,29

However, not only the effectiveness of HCQ has remained questionable, and mainly based on pre-clinical, and a few small clinical studies, but also HCQ is known to be potentially arrhythmogenic, especially as a result of QT prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the arrhythmic effects of HCQ as the heightened risk is especially relevant as COVID-19 patients are at a higher risk of cardiac complications and arrhythmias at baseline. METHODS: Here, we use the optical mapping technique, using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes, to illustrate the arrhythmic effects of hydroxychloroquine in ex-vivo guinea pig and rabbit hearts perfused with the upper therapeutic serum doses of HCQ (up to 1000ng/ml). RESULTS: We observe that HCQ markedly increases the action potential dispersion and results in the development of repolarization alternans and initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

In this study, a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy for COVID-19 was designed to prime with a DNA vaccine encoding wild type (WT) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by S1 protein-based vaccine in rabbits. Four vaccine-elicited rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RmAbs), including 1H1, 9H1, 7G5, and 5E1, were isolated for biophysical property, neutralization potency and sequence analysis. All RmAbs recognized RBD or S1 protein with K(D) in the low nM or sub nM range. 1H1 and 9H1, but neither 7G5 nor 5E1, can bind to all RBD protein variants derived from B.1.351. All four RmAbs were able to neutralize wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 strain in pseudovirus assay, and 1H1 and 9H1 could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 WT authentic virus with IC(50) values of 0.136 and 0.026 μg/mL, respectively. Notably, 1H1 was able to neutralize all 6 emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants tested including D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, and B.1.351 variants, and 5E1 could neutralize against the above 5 variants except P.1. Epitope binning analysis revealed that 9H1, 5E1 and 1H1 recognized distinct epitopes, while 9H1 and 7G5 may have overlapping but not identical epitope. In conclusion, DNA priming protein boost vaccination was an effective strategy to induce RmAbs with potent neutralization capability against not only SARS-CoV-2 WT strain but also emergent variants, which may provide a new avenue for effective therapeutics and point-of-care diagnostic measures.","Chen, Yuxin; Zhu, Liguo; Huang, Weijin; Tong, Xin; Wu, Hai; Tao, Yue; Tong, Bei; Huang, Haibin; Chen, Jiachen; Zhao, Xiangan; Lou, Yang; Wu, Chao",Emerging microbes & infections,405,30

Documentation of the indication at the moment of prescription might be more time-efficient. We investigated the real-life feasibility of mandatory documentation of the indication for all hospital antibiotic prescriptions for quality evaluation purposes. METHODS: A mandatory prescription-indication format was implemented in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) of three hospitals using EPIC or ChipSoft HIX software. We evaluated the retrieved data of all antibiotics (J01) prescribed as empiric therapy in adult patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) or urinary tract infections (UTI), from January through December 2017 in Hospital A, June through October 2019 in Hospital B and May 2019 through June 2020 in Hospital C. Endpoints were the accuracy of the data, defined as agreement between selected indication for the prescription and the documented indication in the EMR, as assessed by manually screening a representative sample of eligible patient records in the EMR of the three hospitals, and appropriateness of the prescriptions, defined as the prescriptions being in accordance with the national guidelines.

The selected indication was in accordance with the documented indication in 96.7% (error rate: 10/300), 78.2% (error rate: 53/243), and 86.9% (error rate: 39/298), respectively. A considerable variation in guideline adherence was seen between the hospitals for severe community acquired pneumonia (adherence rate ranged from 35.4 to 53.0%), complicated UTI (40.0–67.1%) and cystitis (5.6–45.3%). CONCLUSIONS: After local validation of the datasets to verify and optimize accuracy of the data, mandatory documentation of the indication for antibiotics enables a reliable and time-efficient method for systematic registration of the extent and appropriateness of empiric antimicrobial use, which might enable benchmarking both in-hospital and between hospitals.

Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter (March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

The optimal conditions for this chemotaxis assay were investigated for three chemoattractants: zymosan activated serum (ZAS), recombinant human interleukin-8 (rhIL-8) and N-formyl-Met-Leu- Phe (fMLF). In this study, ferret polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) reacted to ZAS and rhIL-8, but not fMLF. The optimal concentration of ZAS and rhIL-8 were 5% and 100 ng/ml, respectively. The optimal incubation time of each reagent was 60 min. Due to the lack of response shown from fMLF, the existence of formyl peptide receptors (FPR) on ferret PMNs was investigated by evaluating FPR binding using flow cytometry. The receptor was not detected, implying that ferret neutrophils may lack FPR. This study confirms the fundamental experimental conditions for ferret PMNs chemotaxis and elucidates new findings concerning FPR in ferret neutrophils.","Nakata, Makoto; Otsubo, Kouji; Kikuchi, Tomoko; Itou, Takuya; Sakai, Takeo",Res Vet Sci,405,29

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are extensively used in the diagnostic field owing to a phenomenon known as ‘surface plasmonic resonance’ in which the scattered light is absorbed by these NPs and can be detected via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Consequently, sialic acid conjugated Au NPs (SA-Au NPs) were utilized for their plasmonic effect against SARS-CoV-2, influenza B virus, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) in patients’ swab samples. The SA-Au NPs system was prepared by a one-pot synthesis method, through which the NPs solution color changed from pale yellow to dark red wine color, indicting its successful preparation. In addition, the SA-Au NPs had an average particle size of 30 ± 1 nm, negative zeta potential (−30 ± 0.3 mV), and a UV absorbance of 525 nm. These NPs have proven their ability to change the color of the NPs solutions and patients’ swabs that contain SARS-CoV-2, influenza B, and MERS viruses, suggesting a rapid and straightforward detection tool that would reduce the spread of these viral infections and accelerate the therapeutic intervention.","Alfassam, Haya A.; Nassar, Majed S.; Almusaynid, Manal M.; Khalifah, Bashayer A.; Alshahrani, Abdullah S.; Almughem, Fahad A.; Alshehri, Abdullah A.; Alawad, Majed O.; Massadeh, Salam; Alaamery, Manal; Aldeailej, Ibrahim M.; Alamri, Aref A.; Binjomah, Abdulwahab Z.; Tawfik, Essam A.",Pharmaceutics,405,1

The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre- and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. Results: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI [0.25-0.81]).

Pain is frequently considered an expected part of old age and morbidity, and may often be either under-reported by care home residents, or go unrecognized by care staff. We conducted a systematic scoping review to explore the complexity of pain recognition, assessment and treatment for residents living in care homes, and to understand the contexts that might influence its management. METHODS: Scoping review using the methodological framework of Levac and colleagues. Articles were included if they examined pain assessment and/or management, for care or nursing home residents. We searched Medline, CINAHL, ASSIA, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar; reference lists were also screened, and website searches carried out of key organisations. Conversations with 16 local care home managers were included to gain an understanding of their perspective. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 109 studies. Three overarching themes were identified: Staff factors and beliefs - in relation to pain assessment and management (e.g. experience, qualifications) and beliefs and perceptions relating to pain. Pain assessment – including use of pain assessment tools and assessment/management for residents with cognitive impairment. Interventions - including efficacy/effects (pharmaceutical/non pharmaceutical), and pain training interventions and their outcomes. Overall findings from the review indicated a lack of training and staff confidence in relation to pain assessment and management. This was particularly the case for residents with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Further training and detailed guidelines for the appropriate assessment and treatment of pain are required by care home staff. Professionals external to the care home environment need to be aware of the issues facing care homes staff and residents in order to target their input in the most appropriate way.

While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, β-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardized and validated. Apart from infectious agents, pulmonary side-effects from cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or pulmonary involvement by the underlying malignancy should be included into differential diagnosis and eventually be clarified by invasive diagnostic procedures. Pre-emptive treatment with mold-active systemic antifungal agents improves clinical outcome, while other microorganisms are preferably treated only when microbiologically documented. High-dose TMP/SMX is first choice for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia is treated primarily with ganciclovir or foscarnet in most patients. In a considerable number of patients, clinical outcome may be favorable despite respiratory failure, so that intensive care should be unrestrictedly provided in patients whose prognosis is not desperate due to other reasons.","Maschmeyer, G.; Carratalà, J.; Buchheidt, D.; Hamprecht, A.; Heussel, C.

We describe here the burden of these viruses in hospital settings over a five-year period. METHODS: All respiratory samples from adult patients (>20 years old) tested by multiplex-PCR at the request of physicians, from May 1 2011 to April 30 2016, were included retrospectively. Viral findings are reported by season, patient age group, respiratory tract region (upper or lower) and type of clinical unit (intensive care unit, pneumology unit, lung transplantation unit and other medical units). RESULTS: In total, 7196 samples (4958 patients) were included; 29.2% tested positive, with viral co-infections detected in 1.6% of samples. Overall, two viral groups accounted for 60.2% of all viruses identified: picornaviruses (rhinovirus or enterovirus, 34.3%) and influenza (26.6%). Influenza viruses constituted the group most frequently identified in winter (34.4%), in the upper respiratory tract (32%) and in patients over the age of 70 years (36.4%). Picornavirus was the second most frequently identified viral group in these populations and in all other groups, including lower respiratory tract infections (41.3%) or patients in intensive care units (37.6%). CONCLUSION: This study, the largest to date in Europe, provides a broad picture of the distribution of viruses over seasons, age groups, types of clinical unit and respiratory tract regions in the hospital setting. It highlights the burden associated with the neglected picornavirus group.

After mechanical thrombectomy (MT), the recanalization rate of posterior circulation obstruction is significantly increased, but prognosis remains poor. To best manage patients, prognostic factors are needed to inform MT triaging after posterior circulation stroke. METHODS: A systematic literature search was done for the period through April 2020. Studies included those with posterior circulation stroke cases that underwent MT. The primary outcome measure in this study was the modified Rankin Scale on day 90. RESULTS: No outcome differences were found in gender, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.28; OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.82-1.26; OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.94-1.68; and OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.58-1.22, respectively).

Lag analysis of statewide trends confirmed that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels preceded new clinical cases by 15–17 days. At the regional level, new clinical cases lagged behind wastewater viral RNA anywhere from 4–20 days. Our data illustrates the advantages of monitoring at the population-level to detect outbreaks. Additionally, by tracking infections with this unbiased approach, resources can be directed to the most impacted communities before the need outpaces the capacity of local healthcare systems.","Melvin, Richard G.; Chaudhry, Nabiha; Georgewill, Onimitein; Freese, Rebecca; Simmons, Glenn E.",medRxiv,405,1

It is unclear whether these subjects should be tested in the absence of symptoms and if those can guide diagnosis. Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, 2020, to March 31, 2020, were collected. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then applied. Findings Positive tests were 138 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (20.2%, 95%CI: 16.7-24.1) and asymptomatic (3.7%, 95%CI: 2.7-5.1) subjects (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (10.6%, 95%CI: 8.3-13.4) whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (2.9%, 95%CI: 0.8-7.3). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 29.7) and fever (OR = 7.21). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 23 days (95%CI: 19-24). Interpretation In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 the presence of symptoms, especially taste and smell alterations and fever, was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median time to clear the virus from nasopharynx was 23 days.","LOMBARDI, ANDREA; Consonni, Dario; Carugno, Michele; Bozzi, Giorgio; Mangioni, Davide; Muscatello, Antonio; Castelli, Valeria; Palomba, Emanuele; Cantu039, Anna Paola; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Tiso, Basilio; Pesatori, Angela Cecilia; Riboldi, Luciano; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea",,405,16

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients with confirmed Covid-19. METHOD: This study was retrospective, multicentric, and included all HD patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of 10 months from March 1 – December 31/2020. The outcome of patients with positive PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was evaluated. The following clinical parameters were compared in two groups of patients (the deceased and alive): age, sex, hemodialysis vintage, type of vascular access, BMI, Hemoglobin, WBC, Platelets, CRP, LDH, D-dimer, s-albumin, radiological findings, smoking abuse, therapy with ACE and ARBs, presence of symptoms and comorbidities: hypertension (HTA), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AFF), malignancy, treatment in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) with oxygen support and mechanical ventilation, and anticoagulant therapy. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS, continued variables with ANOVA and categorical variables with Pearson Chi- square test and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of total 631 hemodialysis patients during the period of 10 months 162 patients (113 M and 49 F) or 25,67% were with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, they have had mean age 62,47±13,14 years and HD vintage 71,93±68,01 months. During the observed period 38 patients with Covid-19 (25 M and 13 F) deceased, that represents mortality of 23,45%, 8 patients deceased at home and 30 patients in hospital. The mortality in patients with age range 18-49 years was 8%, with 50-59 years 18,9%, with 60-69 years 22,2%, with 70-79 years 31,2% and in patients with ≥ 80 years was 50%. Clinical parameters showed that the deceased patients compared with alive patients have had statistically significant higher age (67,7±10,57 vs 60,85±13,46 years; p=0.004), biochemical findings WBC (9,13±4,07 vs 6,45±3,0; p<0.001), LDH (394±4,07 vs 294±143; p=0.032), D-dimer (3699±4,07 vs 2025±2628; p=0.041), lower s-albumin (25,03±4,0 vs 34,57±6,89; p<0.001), and less hospital days (9,87±12,15 vs 16,24±14,31; p=0.04). Regarding comorbidities the mortality in the deceased patients was significantly higher in patients with chronic pulmonary disease (CPD) in comparison to patients without CPD (56,3% vs 19,9%; p=0.001), and in patients with malignancy in comparison to patients without malignancy (57,1% vs 21,9%; p=0.032). The mortality in hospitalized patients was significantly higher in comparison to treated patients at home (25,8% vs 10,5%; p<0.001) and was significantly higher in patients treated in ICU in comparison to patients treated at hospital (40,7% vs 25%; p<0.001). By logistic regression model it was determined that presence of chronic pulmonary disease (HR=6,178; p=0.008), ICU treatment (HR=5,311; p=0.01) and malignancy (HR=16,766; p=0.01) were the most predictive risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that mortality is high in HD patients with Covid-19 and amounts 23,45%, which is in accordance with other larger studies of ERACODA and ERA-EDTA registry regarding mortality of hemodialysis patients with Covid-19 (25% vs 20%). The mortality in HD patients with Covid-19 was associated with advanced age, high level of WBC, LDH and D-dimer, and low level of s-albumin. In contrast to general population, no association with gender, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but significant association of mortality with presence of chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, hospital and ICU treatment was found.","Tomanoski, Vasilije; Gjorgjievska, Gordana; Nakovska, Margarita; Krecova, Vasiliki; Kjamili, Gojard; Andonoski, Aleksandar; Ristoska, Katerina; Kachakova, Angela; Zvezdakovska, Jasminka; Ferati, Bejane; Vasileva, Liljana; Tomanoska, Ana; Nasufi, Albnora; Borisova, Irena",Nephrol Dial Transplant,405,21

For tackling Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), researchers from around the world are swiftly working on designing and identifying inhibitors against all possible viral key protein targets. One of the attractive drug targets is guanine-N7 methyltransferase which plays the main role in capping the 5′-ends of viral genomic RNA and sub genomic RNAs, to escape the host’s innate immunity. We performed homology modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, in order to understand the molecular architecture of Guanosine-P3-Adenosine-5’,5’-Triphosphate (G3A) binding with C-terminal N7-MTase domain of nsp14 from SARS-CoV-2. The residue Asn388 is highly conserved in present both in N7-MTase from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and displays a unique function in G3A binding. For an in-depth understanding of these substrate specificities, we tried to screen and identify inhibitors from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database. The combination of several computational approaches, including screening, MM/GBSA, MD simulations, and PCA calculations, provides the screened compounds that readily interact with the G3A binding site of homology modeled N7-MTase domain. Compounds from this screening will have strong potency towards inhibiting the substrate-binding and efficiently hinder the viral 5’-end RNA capping mechanism. We strongly believe the final compounds can become COVID-19 therapeutics, with huge international support. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To provide an indication of what these outcomes may be, we studied eyes with active lesions with unplanned treatment interval extensions before the pandemic occurred. METHODS: We compared eyes with active disease despite ≤6 weekly injections whose next injection was extended to ≥7 weeks and those whose intervals were not extended. We identified 1559 (16%) of 9602 eyes from the Fight Retinal Blindness! (FRB!) registry (2013 and 2018) that fit this criteria. Eyes were further stratified into four groups by the mean interval over the following 6 months: (1) ≤6 weeks (81%), (2) 7–9 weeks (9%), (3) 10–12 weeks (5%) and (4) >12 weeks (5%). RESULTS: There was a significant loss in VA in eyes extended to >12 weeks compared to the non-extended group (adjusted VA change, mean (95% CI): ≤6 weeks, 0.4 (−1.5 to 2.2), versus >12 weeks, −4.7 (−7.4 to −2.1), letters, p = 0.03 and a threefold increase in relative risk of losing ≥15 letters (absolute risk (14% versus 4%, p < 0.01)). CONCLUSION: Mean VA remained stable for 6 months in eyes requiring frequent treatment despite retreatment interval extension up to 10–12 weeks. There was a significant short-term risk to vision when retreatment interval was extended beyond 12 weeks, hence extensions to this level should be considered cautiously. These data may be useful for physicians who are considering reducing visits to mitigate the risk of COVID-19.","Teo, Kelvin Yi Chong; Nguyen, Vuong; Barthelmes, Daniel; Arnold, Jennifer J.; Gillies, Mark C.; Cheung, Chui Ming Gemmy",Eye (Lond),405,1

As a means to tackle the spread of the virus, the government opened a campaign for the public to exercise hygiene measures such as washing hands frequently and physical distancing. A few weeks later, a five-month State of Emergency (SOE) was declared, and several businesses, schools and theatre halls were closed. People were advised to work from home, including permitting telecommuting for many government officials. However, mainly due to fear of economic crisis, the government was forced to release the lockdown and mass wearing of face masks has become a requirement. As health professionals and the government insist that people make use of facemasks, it is also equally important to give guidance on how to dispose of them safely because face masks that are disposed improperly have the potential in spreading SARS-CoV-2. The urgency of this comes in people's violations of rules when it comes to disposing of masks they used. Providing awareness creation programs about the negative impact of contaminated face masks on the health of individuals and introducing laws that can prohibit improper disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPEs) are among the solutions discussed in this manuscript that could help reduce the problem.","Shiferie, Fisseha",Pan Afr Med J,405,10

Lifestyle information including diet, activity, and sleep behaviors were collected at baseline and three weeks into the national lockdown during which home confinement was mandatory. Changes in outcomes over the two study time points were evaluated for significance using paired t‐tests. RESULTS: There were no changes in reported vegetable intake; fruit intake increased (p=0.055) during the lockdown.

This study examined whether monitoring both official and unofficial online news articles can improve influenza activity forecasting accuracy during influenza outbreaks. Data were retrieved from a Chinese commercial online platform and the website of the Chinese National Influenza Center. We modeled weekly fractions of influenza-related online news articles and compared them against weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) rates using autoregression analyses. We retrieved 153,958,695 and 149,822,871 online news articles focusing on the south and north of mainland China separately from 6 October 2019 to 17 May 2020. Our model based on online news articles could significantly improve the forecasting accuracy, compared to other influenza surveillance models based on historical ILI rates (p = 0.002 in the south; p = 0.000 in the north) or adding microblog data as an exogenous input (p = 0.029 in the south; p = 0.000 in the north). Our finding also showed that influenza forecasting based on online news articles could be 1–2 weeks ahead of official ILI surveillance reports. The results revealed that monitoring online news articles could supplement traditional influenza surveillance systems, improve resource allocation, and offer models for surveillance of other emerging diseases.","Li, Jingwei; Sia, Choon-Ling; Chen, Zhuo; Huang, Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,405,21

METHODS: The COVID-19 African Rheumatology Study Group created an online survey consisting of 40 questions relating to the current practices and experiences of rheumatologists across Africa. The CHERRIES checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys was adhered to. RESULTS: A total of 554 completed responses were received from 20 countries, which include six in Northern Africa, six in West Africa, four in Southern Africa, three in East Africa and one in Central Africa. Consultant grade rheumatologists constituted 436 (78.7%) of respondents with a mean of 14.5 ± 10.3 years of experience. A total of 77 (13.9%) rheumatologists avoided starting a new biologic. Face-to-face clinics with the use of some personal protective equipment continued to be held in only 293 (52.9%) rheumatologists’ practices. Teleconsultation modalities found usage as follows: telephone in 335 (60.5%), WhatsApp in 241 (43.5%), emails in 90 (16.3%) and video calls in 53 (9.6%). Physical examinations were mostly reduced in 295 (53.3%) or done with personal protective equipment in 128 (23.1%) practices. Only 316 (57.0%) reported that the national rheumatology society in their country had produced any recommendation around COVID-19 while only 73 (13.2%) confirmed the availability of a national rheumatology COVID-19 registry in their country.

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the only diagnostic test available currently in acutely or recently infected individuals. In contrast, serological testing is typically performed once viral RNA has been cleared and symptoms have resolved. This leads to some confusion amongst clinicians of which test to order and when each is appropriate. While SARS-CoV-2 assays can suffer from poor sensitivity, all FDA authorized assays to date are intended to be qualitative. Serological tests have multiple assay formats, detect various classes of immunoglobulins, and have a distinct role in seroprevalence studies; however, the association with long-term protection remains unclear.

Data from the elite team sports’ rules (e.g., absolute and relative court dimensions; the number of players, substitutions allowed, total game time, time-outs) were collected, including the changes due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in soccer substitutions, and comparisons were performed. The data showed that soccer has higher rule-induced physical demands: e.g., substantially lower substitution rate, higher dimensions in absolute (eight to fifteen times), and relative (four to eight times) values. Simulations also showed that soccer has extremely large differences, even considering COVID-19 substitution changes (from three to up to five). We conclude that elite soccer has remarkably higher overall rule-induced physical demands than elite futsal, basketball and handball, and increasing soccer substitutions permanently (e.g., unlimited) might mitigate overall soccer demands.","Mota, Gustavo R.; dos Santos, Izabela Aparecida; Arriel, Rhaí André; Marocolo, Moacir",Int J Environ Res Public Health,405,20

Plant health authorities can however make use of observations from individuals and stakeholder groups who are monitoring for signs of ill health. Volunteered data is most often discussed in relation to citizen science groups, however these groups are only part of a wider network of professional agents, land-users and owners who can all contribute to significantly increase surveillance efforts through “passive surveillance”. These ad-hoc reports represent chance observations by individuals who may not necessarily be looking for signs of pests and diseases when they are discovered. Passive surveillance contributes vital observations in support of national and international surveillance programs, detecting potentially unknown issues in the wider landscape, beyond points of entry and the plant trade. This review sets out to describe various forms of passive surveillance, identify analytical methods that can be applied to these “messy” unstructured data, and indicate how new programs can be established and maintained. Case studies discuss two tree health projects from Great Britain (TreeAlert and Observatree) to illustrate the challenges and successes of existing passive surveillance programmes. When analysing passive surveillance reports it is important to understand the observers’ probability to detect and report each plant health issue, which will vary depending on how distinctive the symptoms are and the experience of the observer. It is also vital to assess how representative the reports are and whether they occur more frequently in certain locations. Methods are increasingly available to predict species distributions from large datasets, but more work is needed to understand how these apply to rare events such as new introductions. One solution for general surveillance is to develop and maintain a network of tree health volunteers, but this requires a large investment in training, feedback and engagement to maintain motivation. There are already many working examples of passive surveillance programmes and the suite of options to interpret the resulting datasets is growing rapidly.","Brown, Nathan; Pérez-Sierra, Ana; Crow, Peter; Parnell, Stephen",CABI Agric Biosci,405,1

This study was aimed to investigate the roles of host differentially expressed genes on metabolic pathways in PDCoV infections. RESULTS: Twenty thousand six hundred seventy-four differentially expressed mRNAs were identified in 5-day-old piglets responded to PDCoV experimental infections. Many of these genes were correlated to the basic metabolism, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway which plays a critical role in digestion. At the same time, in the PPAR pathway genes of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family members were observed with remarkably differential expressions. The differential expressed genes were associated with appetite decrease and weight loss of PDCoV- affected piglets. DISCUSSION: Fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) were found to be regulated by PDCoV. These two genes not only mediate fatty acid transportation to different cell organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, but also modulate fatty acid metabolism and storage as a signaling molecule outside the cell. Therefore, it can be preliminarily concluded that PPAR differential expression caused by PDCoV was mostly associated with weight loss and death from emaciation. CONCLUSIONS: The host differentially expressed genes were associated with infection response, metabolism signaling and organismal systems signaling pathways. The genes of FABP family members in the PPAR signaling pathway were the most highly altered and played important roles in metabolism. Alteration of these genes were most likely the reason of weight loss and other clinical symptoms. Our results provided new insights into the metabolic mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.

Macroeconomic coordination among monetary and fiscal policy is necessary to fend off such large crises. Insufficient wage increases that lead to deflation need to be avoided. Last, but not least, a mechanism is needed to stabilise the financial system and quickly deal with non-performing loans. Except in the field of monetary policy, the EMU lacks institutions that support quick and sufficient economic policies. There is the danger that policy mistakes will lead to long-term stagnation in the EMU or possibly even a great recession.","Heine, Michael; Herr, Hansjörg",Wirtschaftsdienst,405,16

METHODS: This interventional study was conducted with year II students undergoing Endocrine Reproduction Module at the Aga Khan University during April 13 to May 22, 2020. Pre reading material and pretest was shared with the students via Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) one week before the class. Microsoft Teams was used to conduct online session by two facilitators, where student discussion on case studies was encouraged. A WhatsApp group was created with the facilitators to respond to any student queries. The session was recorded and later uploaded on VLE. Posttest and a student satisfaction survey was conducted at the end of the session. RESULTS: The average score for the pretest and posttest was 19.67 ± 1.37 and 24.60 ± 1.34 respectively (p value <0.05). The learner curve showed an increase in the knowledge learned by 4.93 points (p value <0.05). Fifty-five percent students felt that placement of session was appropriate and were satisfied with the instructions and expected outcomes, received constructive feedback for improvement and generated positive attitude towards learning. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative model of FCR through facilitation of synchronous and asynchronous learning empowered student’s engagement and interactive learning. Students perceived this as a great learning experience which they enjoyed with positive reinforcement from feedback given by the facilitators. They suggested continuation of this model for further learning sessions in other modules of undergraduate medical education at Aga Khan University.","Rehman, Rehana; Fatima, Syeda Sadia",Pak J Med Sci,405,19

We show the convergence of the system when the number of nodes grows and characterize the scaling limits. Then, we prove the existence of optimal controls for the limiting equations formulated in the framework of game theory, both in the centralized and decentralized setting. We show how the characteristics of the graph (degree distribution) influence the vaccination efficiency for optimal strategies, and we compute the limiting final size of the epidemic depending on the degree distribution of the graph and the parameters of infection, recovery and vaccination. We also present several simulations for two types of vaccination, showing how the optimal controls allow to decrease the number of infections and underlining the crucial role of the network characteristics in the propagation of the disease and the vaccination program.","Ferreyra, Emanuel Javier; Jonckheere, Matthieu; Pinasco, Juan Pablo",Appl Math Optim,405,8

In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be “super-spreaders”. Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.","Chin, Wei Chien Benny; Bouffanais, Roland",Sci Rep,405,26
