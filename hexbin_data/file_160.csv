353,"HIV-related restrictions on entry, residence and stay in the WHO European Region: a survey",2010-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Back in 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that the screening of international travellers was an ineffective way to prevent the spread of HIV. However, some countries still restrict the entrance and/or residency of foreigners with an HIV infection. HIV-related travel restrictions have serious implications for individual and public health, and violate internationally recognized human rights. In this study, we reviewed the current situation regarding HIV-related travel restrictions in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region. METHODS: We retrieved the country-specific information chiefly from the Global Database on HIV Related Travel Restrictions at hivtravel.org. We simplified and standardized the database information to enable us to create an overview and compare countries. Where data was outdated, unclear or contradictory, we contacted WHO HIV focal points in the countries or appropriate non-governmental organizations. The United States Bureau of Consular Affairs website was also used to confirm and complement these data. RESULTS: Our review revealed that there are no entry restrictions for people living with HIV in 51 countries in the WHO European Region. In 11 countries, foreigners living with HIV applying for long-term stays will not be granted a visa. These countries are: Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus (denies access for non-European Union citizens), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, an HIV-positive foreigner cannot even enter the country, and in Georgia, we were not able to determine whether there were any HIV-related travel restrictions due to a lack of information. CONCLUSIONS: In 32% of the countries in the European Region, either there are some kind of HIV-related travel restrictions or we were unable to determine if such restrictions are in force. Most of these countries defend restrictions as being justified by public health concerns. However, there is no evidence that denying HIV-positive foreigners access to a country is effective in protecting public health. Governments should revise legislation on HIV-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, a joint effort is needed to draw attention to the continuing discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV that takes place in those European Region countries where such laws and policies are still in force.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Curth, Nadja; Weait, Matthew; Matic, Srdan",J Int AIDS Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823611/,160
6177,Twitter sentiment classification for measuring public health concerns,2015-05-12,"In 2017, an autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy indicated for children and young adults with relapsed and/or refractory CD19(+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia became the first gene therapy to be approved in the USA. This innovative form of cellular immunotherapy has been associated with remarkable response rates but is also associated with unique and often severe toxicities, which can lead to rapid cardiorespiratory and/or neurological deterioration. Multidisciplinary medical vigilance and the requisite health-care infrastructure are imperative to ensuring optimal patient outcomes, especially as these therapies transition from research protocols to standard care. Herein, authors representing the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Subgroup and the MD Anderson Cancer Center CAR T Cell Therapy-Associated Toxicity (CARTOX) Program have collaborated to provide comprehensive consensus guidelines on the care of children receiving CAR T cell therapy.","Mahadeo, Kris M.; Khazal, Sajad J.; Abdel-Azim, Hisham; Fitzgerald, Julie C.; Taraseviciute, Agne; Bollard, Catherine M.; Tewari, Priti; Duncan, Christine; Traube, Chani; McCall, David; Steiner, Marie E.; Cheifetz, Ira M.; Lehmann, Leslie E.; Mejia, Rodrigo; Slopis, John M.; Bajwa, Rajinder; Kebriaei, Partow; Martin, Paul L.; Moffet, Jerelyn; McArthur, Jennifer; Petropoulos, Demetrios; O’Hanlon Curry, Joan; Featherston, Sarah; Foglesong, Jessica; Shoberu, Basirat; Gulbis, Alison; Mireles, Maria E.; Hafemeister, Lisa; Nguyen, Cathy; Kapoor, Neena; Rezvani, Katayoun; Neelapu, Sattva S.; Shpall, Elizabeth J.",Nat Rev Clin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096894/,160
12012,Strands of injustice,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Terrorism-related incidents that are associated with mass casualties (mass-casualty terrorist incidents) are a medical and organisational challenge for every hospital because of the special injury patterns involved, the time of the incident, the development of the situation, the initial lack of information, the number of injured, and the number of uninjured survivors who self-refer to a hospital. METHODS: The Terror and Disaster Surgical Care (TDSC®) - Course was developed in order to address mass-casualty terrorist incidents and to provide surgeons with the specialist medical and surgical knowledge and skills required for these special situations. The focus of the TDSC® course is on how to provide surgical care and how to deploy scarce resources in a particular tactical situation in such a way that the number of survivors is maximised. RESULTS: The effective management of such a tactical situation must be based on priorities and first and foremost requires the standardised sorting and categorisation of the injured at the hospital. The aim of triage, or the sorting of the injured, is to immediately identify patients with life-threatening injuries in environments with strained resources. The medical management of mass-casualty terrorist incidents requires tactical abbreviated surgical care (TASC) teams that have the skills needed to perform a primary survey and to provide care for casualties who need immediate surgery (triage category 1—T1). Initial fluid therapy should be restrictive (permissive hypotension) unless contraindicated. Clotting products are replaced in a standardised manner on the basis of patient requirements, which are calculated using rapidly available surrogates (blood gas analysis). Blood products can be administered or kept available depending on risks and triage categories. The highest priority should be given to the identification and management of haemodynamically unstable patients who require immediate surgery for injuries associated with bleeding into body cavities (T1 + +). CONCLUSION: The recommendations and approaches described here should be considered as proposals for hospitals to develop standards or modify well-established standards that enable them to prepare themselves successfully for situations (e.g. mass-casualty terrorist or shooter incidents) in which their resources are temporarily overwhelmed.","Franke, Axel; Bieler, Dan; Friemert, Benedikt; Hoth, Patrick; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Achatz, Gerhard",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364295/,160
19198,AFibNet: an implementation of atrial fibrillation detection with convolutional neural network,2021-07-14,"Type II alveolar cells (AT2s) are critical for basic respiratory homeostasis and tissue repair after lung injury. Prior studies indicate that AT2s also express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, but how MHCII expression by AT2s is regulated and how it contributes to host defense remain unclear. Here we show that AT2s express high levels of MHCII independent of conventional inflammatory stimuli, and that selective loss of MHCII from AT2s in mice results in modest worsening of respiratory virus disease following influenza and Sendai virus infections. We also find that AT2s exhibit MHCII presentation capacity that is substantially limited compared to professional antigen presenting cells. The combination of constitutive MHCII expression and restrained antigen presentation may position AT2s to contribute to lung adaptive immune responses in a measured fashion, without over-amplifying damaging inflammation.","Toulmin, Sushila A.; Bhadiadra, Chaitali; Paris, Andrew J.; Lin, Jeffrey H.; Katzen, Jeremy; Basil, Maria C.; Morrisey, Edward E.; Worthen, G.

20039,Chest X-ray sensitivity and lung cancer outcomes: a retrospective observational study,2021-04-16,"INTRODUCTION: Many countries in Africa are scaling up differentiated service delivery (DSD) models for HIV treatment, but most existing data systems do not describe the models in use. We surveyed organizations that were supporting DSD models in 2019 in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia to describe the diversity of DSD models being implemented at that time. METHODS: We interviewed DSD model implementing organizations for descriptive information about each of the organization's models of care. We described the key characteristics of each model, including population of patients served, location of service delivery, frequency of interactions with patients, duration of dispensing, and cadre(s) of provider involved. To facilitate analysis, we refer to 1 organization supporting 1 model of care as an “organization-model.” RESULTS: The 34 respondents (8 in Malawi, 16 in South Africa, 10 in Zambia) interviewed described a total of 110 organization-models, which included 19 facility-based individual models, 21 out-of-facility-based individual models, 14 health care worker-led groups, and 3 client-led groups; jointly, these encompassed 12 specific service delivery strategies, such as multimonth dispensing, adherence clubs, home delivery, and changes to facility hours. Over two-thirds (n=78) of the organization-models were limited to clinically stable patients. Almost all organization-models (n=96) continued to provide clinical care at established health care facilities; medication pickup took place at facilities, external pickup points, and adherence clubs. Required numbers of provider interactions per year varied widely, from 2 to 12. Dispensing intervals were typically 3 or 6 months in Malawi and Zambia and 2 months in South Africa. Individual models relied more on clinical staff, while group models made greater use of lay personnel. CONCLUSIONS: As of 2019, there was a large variety of differentiated service models being offered for HIV treatment in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia, serving diverse patient populations.","Huber, Amy; Pascoe, Sophie; Nichols, Brooke; Long, Lawrence; Kuchukhidze, Salome; Phiri, Bevis; Tchereni, Timothy; Rosen, Sydney",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324204/,160
20833,Prognostic significance of volume-based (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters and correlation with PD-L1 expression in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma,2021-09-03,"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic value of high fluorescent lymphocytes (HFLC) and smudge cells in diseases like sepsis has been confirmed. In this study, we explore the diagnostic value of HFLC and smudge cells for infectious mononucleosis (IM). METHODS: Sixty‐two IM patients, 67 healthy controls, 84 patients with upper respiratory tract virus infection, and 35 patients with malignant lymphoid diseases were enrolled. The complete blood counts and leukocyte differential counts are tested, and the smudge cells were manually counted. RESULTS: The value of HFLC% and smudge cells of the IM group were significantly higher than those of healthy controls and disease controls (p < 0.05), and the HFLC% value of IM patients was positively correlated with the number of reactive lymphocytes (r = 0.265). When the cutoff value of HFLC% was 0.4%, and the diagnostic value of IM was high (AUC = 0.995). When the smudge cells >2/100 nucleated cells, it can show better (AUC = 1.000). When the cutoff value of the HFLC% was 1.2%, it can effectively distinguish IM patients from upper respiratory tract virus infection patients (AUC = 0.934); when smudge cells >16/100 nucleated cells, it also has high differential diagnosis value (AUC = 0.913). In addition, the AUC of the combination HFLC% and smudge cells for the differential diagnosis can be increased to 0.968. The performance value of single HFLC% (AUC = 0.942) for distinguishing IM from malignant lymphoid diseases was better than smudge cells and combine index with the cutoff value of 0.4%. CONCLUSION: HFLC% and smudge cells can be used as effective indicators in the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of IM.","Huang, Tao; Yang, Shuo; He, Yufeng; Li, Qiang; Cui, Liyan",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418501/,160

In diseases without myocardial necrosis, the elevated troponin levels are relatively low and normalize quickly. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese man with impaired consciousness was transported to our hospital. He was diagnosed as having pneumonia and septic shock. His condition was severe, but his clinical course was good. However, his troponin level remained extremely high during admission; on the second day, it was higher than the measurable range. We consulted a cardiologist and performed echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy but found no new ischemic changes. CONCLUSION: In septic shock, troponin levels can be extremely high, which can persist even after recovery, as in very large myocardial infarctions.","Matsunaga, Naoki; Yoshioka, Yuki; Fukuta, Yasushi",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8433049/,160

30806,New Public Health Strategies for a New Era,2007-12-20,"Plant species continue to be introduced in North America for various purposes. If the trend continues, it is probable that some will escape cultivation and become invasive in native ecosystems. We present a retrospective analysis of several structural, life history, and biogeographical attributes of woody plants introduced in North America to determine which traits characterize species that have and have not invaded. Predictive models derived from discriminant analysis correctly classified 86.2% of the species in cross‐validation, whereas those derived from classification and regression trees classified 76% correctly. From these models we created a hierarchical predictive tree that allows the user to divide species into three categories: admit (low risk of invasiveness), deny admission (high risk of invasiveness), or delay admission for further analyses and/or monitor intensively (risk cannot adequately be assessed based on only the included attributes). We recommend that species that are highly invasive elsewhere not be allowed into the U.S. and that a more conservative introduction policy using a hierarchical predictive method be employed.","Reichard, Sarah Hayden; Hamilton, Clement W.",Conserv Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162396/,160

From the very start, even as the implementation of this continental-wide project in higher education got underway and in parallel to historical analyses (“looking back” too) that begun slowly to emerge, the future of the EHEA has been a constant preoccupation. It is perhaps in the nature of things that while the future can be close or distant, it never quite arrives, like a textitfata morgana, so that any discussion of “the future” can in principle be endless. Or, it could be that in this case discussions about the future indicate continuing uncertainty about the substance, shape and timeline of a European area for higher education. As we are completing the second decade of the Bologna Process and, if we take a formal approach, the first decade of the EHEA, this debate nevertheless takes on added urgency and includes some new elements. We are encouraged by the fact that few if any voices have been heard advocating an end to the EHEA. We therefore disregard this option here.","Bergan, Sjur; Matei, Liviu",European Higher Education Area: Challenges for a New Decade,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653266/,160

As benchmark application, two specific processes common in the integrated steelworks are selected, with the purpose of forecasting the future energy exchanges and transformations. The procedures of training, validation and test are based on data analysis, outlier detection and reconciliation and variable selection starting from real field industrial data.

59564,Addressing international student mental health during COVID-19: an imperative overdue.,2020-05-19,"The early detection of pathogens with epidemic potential is of major importance to public health. Most emerging infections result in dead-end ""spillover"" events in which a pathogen is transmitted from an animal reservoir to a human but is unable to achieve the sustained human-to-human transmission necessary for a full-blown epidemic. It is therefore critical to determine why only some virus infections are efficiently transmitted among humans whereas others are not. We sought to determine which biological features best characterized those viruses that have achieved sustained human transmission. Accordingly, we compiled a database of 203 RNA and DNA human viruses and used an information theoretic approach to assess which of a set of key biological variables were the best predictors of human-to-human transmission. The variables analyzed were as follows: taxonomic classification; genome length, type, and segmentation; the presence or absence of an outer envelope; recombination frequency; duration of infection; host mortality; and whether or not a virus exhibits vector-borne transmission. This comparative analysis revealed multiple strong associations. In particular, we determined that viruses with low host mortality, that establish long-term chronic infections, and that are nonsegmented, nonenveloped, and, most importantly, not transmitted by vectors were more likely to be transmissible among humans. In contrast, variables including genome length, genome type, and recombination frequency had little predictive power. In sum, we have identified multiple biological features that seemingly determine the likelihood of interhuman viral transmissibility, in turn enabling general predictions of whether viruses of a particular type will successfully emerge in human populations.","Geoghegan, Jemma L; Senior, Alistair M; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Holmes, Edward C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1521582113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001840/,160

Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis pain is incompletely understood but involves both nociceptive and non-nociceptive mechanisms, including neuropathic mechanisms. Prevailing guidelines for arthritis-related pain do not differentiate between nociceptive and non-nociceptive pain, sometimes leading to recommendations that do not fully address the nature of pain. NSAIDs are effective in treating the nociceptive arthritis-related pain. However, safety concerns of NSAIDs may cause clinicians to undertreat arthritis-related pain. In this context, combination therapy may be more appropriate to manage the different pain mechanisms involved. A panel convened in November 2010 found that among the currently recommended analgesic products for arthritis-related pain, fixed-low-dose combination products hold promise for pain control because such products allow lower doses of individual agents resulting in decreased toxicity and acceptable efficacy due to synergy between the individual drugs. Better evidence and recommendations are required to improve treatment of chronic arthritis-related pain.","van Laar, Mart; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Mellinghoff, Hans-Ulrich; Merchante, Ignacio Morón; Nalamachu, Srinivas; O'Brien, Joanne; Perrot, Serge; Raffa, Robert B",The open rheumatology journal,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874312901206010320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23264838/,160

In addition to higher case fatality rates, newborns with COVID-19 had much shorter time from symptom onset to death and longer time from symptom onset to discharge. Dyspnoea, sore throat and cough were more prominent in neonate patients, suggestive of both upper and lower respiratory tract infection, as opposed to upper respiratory tract symptoms mostly observed in children.

The concept of visceral politics captures how the physiological nature of our engagement with the social world influences how we make decisions, just as socio-political forces recruit our physiology to influence our socio-political behaviour. This line of research attempts to bridge the psychophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for our affective states with the historical socio-cultural context in which such states are experienced. We review findings and hypotheses at the intersections of life sciences, social sciences and humanities to shed light on how and why people come to experience such emotions in politics and what if any are their behavioural consequences.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Aperio device and compared it with published data of established stent retrievers. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed institutional data of consecutive stroke procedures in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation that were treated between January 2017 and December 2017 with the Aperio. Reperfusion rate regarding to the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale (eTICI), procedural times, early clinical outcome, and complications were documented. RESULTS Eighty-two patients were treated by using the Aperio in LVO in the anterior circulation. Median age was 77 (± 12) years (w = 59.8%). Median Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14. Fifty-three (64.6%) patients received intravenous thrombolysis. Successful recanalization (eTICI≥2b) was achieved in 85.3%. Mean time from groin puncture to final recanalization was 52.3 ± 34.8 min. Embolization to new territories occurred in one case. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h was observed in six patients (7.3%). Twenty-eight (41.2%) out of 68 patients available for assessment of functional outcome at 3 months achieved favorable outcome (mRS 0-2). CONCLUSION The Aperio stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy device demonstrated high rates of successful reperfusion and a good safety profile in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO in the anterior circulation.","Kaschner, Marius Georg; Weiss, Daniel; Rubbert, Christian; Lee, John-Ih; Gliem, Michael; Jander, Sebastian; Ivan, Vivien; Kraus, Bastian; Turowski, Bernd; Caspers, Julian",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-019-03861-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949780/,160

The importance of pre-procedure planning and briefing cannot be emphasised enough as these along with intraoperative management remain the key step in dealing with an adverse cardiac event due to permanent pacemaker malfunction.","Ubee, Sarvpreet S; Selvan, Masilamani; Chandrashekar, Rangaswamy; Cooke, Peter",Journal of perioperative practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1750458918790693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30062930/,160
68097,Learning from Covid.,2020-05-01,"INTRODUCTION In Europe, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicenter in Italy, particularly in the area of Bergamo. Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among cancer patients receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS From the April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive cancer patients, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction] test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. RESULTS In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and anticancer treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. Testing only in case of seropositivity magnified the SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and predicted an RT-PCR number-needed-to-test calculation of 2.5, versus 10 for testing the whole population with RT-PCR. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropostive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSION Among cancer patients, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated cancer patients, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the Covid-19 pandemic. Lacking national/international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARSCoV-2 silent carriers. In our series, consisting of consecutive and unselected cancer patients, the prevalence of both SARSCov-2 seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively) The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARSCoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR negative patients.","Zambelli, Alberto; Chiudinelli, Lorenzo; Fotia, Vittoria; Negrini, Giorgia; Bosetti, Tommaso; Callegaro, Annapaola; Di Croce, Andrea; Caremoli, Elena Rota; Moro, Cecilia; Milesi, Laura; Poletti, Paola; Tasca, Cristina; Mandalà, Mario; Merelli, Barbara; Mosconi, Stefania; Arnoldi, Ermenegildo; Bettini, Anna; Bonomi, Lucia; Messina, Caterina; Ghilardi, Laura; Chirco, Alessandra; Maracino, Michela; Tondini, Carlo",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355953/,160
69166,Maintaining focus on administering effective malaria treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-23,"There is a high prevalence of Indigenous youth experiencing either precarious housing or homelessness in northwestern Ontario. Given that Indigenous pathways to homelessness can differ from non-Indigenous youth, interventions that address homelessness must also adapt to meet diverse needs. The Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) is a tertiary prevention intervention designed to provide congruent housing and peer and mental health supports for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Less is known regarding its adaptability to adequately serve Indigenous youth in northwestern Ontario. This study assessed the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an adaptation of the HOP-C North program for transitional aged Indigenous youth exiting homelessness in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Participants completed premeasures (n = 15) and postmeasures (n = 8) as well as qualitative interviews regarding their experiences in the program. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with staff (n = 14) engaged in implementing the program. After completing the HOP-C North program, participants reported improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased educational enrollment, attainment of employment, reduced hospitalizations, and increased engagement in clinical mental health services. Specific program aspects that participants found helpful included increased program flexibility, accessibility, emphasis on relationships, relevance of programming, fostering participant autonomy, and an adaptive approach to program implementation. These findings suggest that the HOP-C North model, when adapted, is a helpful program for Indigenous youth.

Fetoscopic trocar placement can be performed with transabdominal ultrasound guidance with a posterior placenta and most anterior placentas that have a safe avascular window for entry. However, trocar insertion is challenging in cases of a complete anterior placenta without an avascular window. Current techniques to deal with this situation include mini-laparotomy with exteriorization to allow for dorsal entry, percutaneous lateral entry under transabdominal ultrasound/Doppler guidance, and laparoscopic assisted access with direct visualization of trocar entry. We describe a modified technique of laparoscopic assisted fetoscopic trocar placement using a laparoscopic ultrasound probe, which allows for precise, real-time guidance of trocar placement.","Jarboe, Marcus D; Berman, Deborah R; Wright, Tiffany; Treadwell, Marjorie C; Mychaliska, George B",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000439526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555815/,160

A growing literature base calls for more research on factors influencing palliative and EOL care access, outcomes, and distinct needs of SGM cancer survivors and caregivers. We analyzed peer-reviewed articles published 2015-present to identify trends. RECENT FINDINGS Ten articles were SGM-focused or inclusive, cancer-focused, and included substantive discussion of palliative and/or EOL care. Four were research studies (three case studies and one qualitative interview study) and six were literature reviews. Recurrent topics included disparities in cancer risk, access, and care; essential cultural and clinical competencies; and need for professional and organizational standards and policies addressing interpersonal and institutional discrimination and inclusion. Provision of equitable, competent palliative and EOL care depends on continued advancements in research, translated into person-centered approaches to care.

72066,[Visualization of Contaminated Areas in the Inspection Room by CT Imaging Assuming COVID-19].,2020,"BACKGROUND Cancer 'patients' are increasingly using traditional indigenous and complementary medicines (T&CM) alongside conventional medical treatments to both cure and cope with their cancer diagnoses. To date T&CM use among Indigenous cancer patients from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States has not been systematically reviewed. METHODS We systematically searched bibliographic databases to identify original research published between January 2000 and October 2017 regarding T&CM use by Indigenous cancer patients in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Data from records meeting eligibility criteria were extracted and appraised for quality by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS Twenty-one journal articles from 18 studies across all 4 countries met our inclusion criteria. T&CM use ranged from 19% to 57.7% (differing across countries). T&CM was mostly used concurrently with conventional cancer treatments to meet their spiritual, emotional, social, and cultural needs; however, bush, traditional, and herbal medicines were used in a minority of cases as an alternative. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the importance of T&CM use to Indigenous cancer patients across these 4 countries; we identified multiple perceived spiritual, emotional and cultural benefits to its use. The patient's perception of their health professional's attitudes toward T&CM in some cases hindered or encouraged the patient's disclosure. Additional research is required to further explore the use and disclosure of T&CM among Indigenous cancer patients to help inform and ensure effective, safe, coordinated care for Indigenous cancer patients that relies on shared open decision making and communication across patients, communities, and providers.","Gall, Alana; Leske, Stuart; Adams, Jon; Matthews, Veronica; Anderson, Kate; Lawler, Sheleigh; Garvey, Gail",Integrative cancer therapies,https://doi.org/10.1177/1534735418775821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779402/,160
72273,Fast-track for COVID-19 at CSP.,2020,"INTRODUCTION There have been increasing reports documenting barbiturate-related deaths, despite routine prescribing for only relatively rare indications. The aims of the current study were to examine trends in barbiturate-related deaths in Australia from 2000 to 2019 and determine the case characteristics and circumstances of barbiturate-related deaths. METHODS All barbiturate-related deaths identified in the Australian National Coronial Information System were examined. Information was collected on cause, manner, demographics, location, psychosocial factors, circumstances of deaths and toxicology. We examined these based on the age categories 18-44 years, 45-64 years and ≥65 years. RESULTS We identified 511 cases. Mean age was 57.9 years (SD 20.2, range 18-100) and 56% were male. Intentional poisoning was the most common cause of death (87.5%) and was slightly higher in the oldest age group (92.1%) and lowest in the youngest age group (81.1%). Pentobarbitone was the most common barbiturate (75.7%) and pentobarbitone-related deaths increased from 0% in 2000 to 93.6% in 2017. There were notable differences between age categories, with the youngest age group recording more severe psychiatric histories. In contrast, the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health problems, such as cancer, chronic non-cancer pain, neurological conditions and significant cardiopulmonary morbidity. Euthanasia resources were commonly documented (33.9%), most frequently in the oldest age group (52.3%). CONCLUSION Barbiturate-related deaths in Australia are increasing, particularly pentobarbitone-related deaths. Most deaths were intentional and involved adults across the lifespan. Younger people were more likely to have significant mental health problems, whilst the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health conditions.","Campbell, G; Darke, S; Zahra, E; Duflou, J; Shand, F; Lappin, J",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1789653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633579/,160
73107,Nursing workload in burn intensive care unit.,2020,"Estrogen can reduce sympathetic activity, but its effects on minute ventilation (VE) with group III/IV afferent activation remain unclear. This study examined the influence of estrogen on VE during lower-extremity exercise with group III/IV activation. Females completed two identical visits in follicular and ovulatory menstrual phases. Nine participants (age 25 ± 4 years) performed three minutes of baseline steady-state cycle ergometry and then group III/IV afferents were further activated with proximal thigh cuffs inflated to 20, 60, and 100 mmHg (randomized) for two minutes and five minutes of cycling between each occlusion. Metaboreflex was isolated by post-exercise circulatory occlusion. Ventilation was measured continuously and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded for each stage. During rest and exercise, VE (p < 0.001) and tidal volume (VT) (p = 0.033) were higher in the follicular than ovulatory phase. Minute ventilation, VT, and respiratory rate (RR) with ergoreflex and metaboreflex activation were similar across phases. With cuff occlusion of 100 mmHg, VE increased from baseline by 26.3 ± 7.0 L/min in the follicular phase (p < 0.001) and by 25.3±7.7 L/min in the ovulatory phase (p < 0.001), with no difference between phases (p > 0.05); RR and VT increased similarly with occlusion, also with no phase differences.

74042,Use of nursing technologies for safe perioperative pediatric care.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Patient activation, or level of engagement in one's medical care is linked to hospital readmissions and worse outcomes in a number of diseases. Patients with higher levels of activation are typically guiding their care rather than acting as passive observers of care. This study aims to determine if either patient demographics or type of vascular disease can predict patient activation. METHODS All patients presenting over a 4-month period to an outpatient vascular clinic were asked to complete the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey. 257 completed surveys were collected. Survey responses were scored on a Likert scale with anchors. Responses are tallied with a score of 1-100 and converted to summary levels 1-4 in accordance with the previously validated scoring system. Level 1 patients are considered disengaged and overwhelmed. Patients in level 2 are becoming aware of their health care, but still struggle. Level 3 patients are taking action, while level 4 represents patients that are maintaining healthy behaviors and pushing further. Chi-square and multivariable regression were then performed to determine if patient characteristics or type of disease correlated with activation levels. RESULTS 257 patients completed the survey. The mean participant age was 67 years (± 15). 16% of patients lived alone, 58% were married, and in 39% mean household income was <$50,000. Overall, 21 patients (8.2%) were classified as level 1, 65 (25%) level 2, 94 (37%) as level 3, and 77 (30%) level 4. The group comprised 32% PAD, 20% carotid, 18% aortic/aneurysm, 14% venous, and 16% were various other vascular diseases. Over each disease group there was a wide range of activation, but no significant difference between the type of vascular disease and activation level. Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) patients comprised 35% (n= 29) of the PAD group, and 66% of these patients reported an activation level of 3 (n=10) or 4 (n=9). There was no difference in the levels of activation reported by the CLTI patients compared to the general PAD cohort (p = 0.99). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that age, level of education, household income, and type of vascular disease correlated with PAM score, but there was no correlation between length of symptoms or race and gender. CONCLUSION Patient activation is unpredictable using patient characteristics or type of vascular disease, and CLTI patients report high activation levels. Quality databases that collect only patient demographics may not fully capture patient predictors of poor outcomes. Use of the PAM survey should be further explored in vascular patients to correlate activation level with vascular specific outcomes.","Humphries, Misty D; Welch, Pierce; Hasegawa, Jason; Mell, Matthew W",Annals of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385528/,160

76572,COVID-19 and tuberculosis in South Africa: A dangerous combination.,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND There is a dearth of information about ""brain fog"", concentration, word-finding or memory problems associated with the new World Health Organization provisional classification ""U09.9 Post-COVID-19 Condition."" Beyond this, the extent to which these symptoms may be associated with neurological, pulmonary or psychiatric difficulties is unclear. OBJECTIVE This ongoing cohort study carefully assesses neurocognitive function in the context of neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic/mild and severe cases of COVID-19 after remission and include actively recruited healthy controls. METHODS A total number of 150 participants will be included in this pilot study. The cohort will comprise patients after SARS-CoV-2 positive infection with either an asymptomatic course or a mild course with no symptoms except for olfactory and taste dysfunction (n=50), patients after SARS-CoV-2 positive infection with a severely affected course (n=50), and a healthy control group (n=50) with similar age and sex distribution, based on frequency matching. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment will comprise nuanced aspects of complex attention, include language, executive function, verbal and visual learning and memory. Psychiatric, personality, social and lifestyle factors, sleep and fatigue will be evaluated. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, neurological and physical assessment and pulmonological and lung function examinations (including body plethysmography, diffusion capacity, clinical assessments and questionnaires) will also be conducted. Three visits are planned with comprehensive testing at the baseline and 12-month visit and brief neurological and neuropsychological examinations at the 6-month assessment. Blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration will be quantified for baseline and 12-month samples. RESULTS At the time of submission, the study had begun recruitment, telephone and in-person screenings. The first patient was enrolled into the study at the beginning of April 2021. Interim data analysis of baseline information is expected to be complete in December 2021 and study comple-tion at the end of December 2022. Preliminary group comparisons indicate worse word list learning, verbal recall short-delayed and verbal recall long-delayed, and verbal recognition in both patient cohorts compared to the healthy control group, adjusted for age and sex. Initial volumetric compar-isons show smaller grey matter, frontal and temporal brain volumes in both patient groups com-pared to healthy controls. The results reported here are quite robust, but are not final nor put into the needed context intended at study completion. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to include objective and comprehensive longitudinal analysis of neurocognitive sequelae of COVID-19 in an extreme group comparison stratified by disease severity with actively recruited healthy controls during the Pandemic. Results from this study will contribute to the nascent literature on prolonged effects on neurocognitive performance via our co-assessment of neuroradiological, neurological, pulmonary, psychiatric, and lifestyle factors.

We compared the two approaches for technical success, effectiveness, and outcomes. METHODS We retrospectively compared TRA with TFA for AIS MT at our institute. We additionally performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies describing the use of TRA alone or in comparison with TFA for MT. Primary outcomes included rate of successful reperfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) >2b), number of passes, access-site complications, and 3- month mortality and favorable functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2). RESULTS A total of 222 consecutive patients (TRA=93, TFA=129) were included in our case series. The rate of successful reperfusion was significantly higher for the TFA cohort (91.4% vs 79.6%, P=0.01) with lower mean number of passes (1.8±1.2 vs 2.4±1.6, P=0.014). Three-month mortality in the TFA group was lower (22.1% vs 40.9% for the TRA cohort (P=0.004), with a higher rate of favorable functional outcomes (51.3% vs 34.1%, P=0.015). A meta-analysis of 10 studies showed significant heterogeneity in rates of successful reperfusion (57.1% to 95.6%, heterogeneity=67.55%, P=0.001). None of the previous comparative studies reported 3-month mortality and functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrate a higher successful reperfusion rate, fewer passes, lower 3-month mortality, and improved 3-month functional outcomes with TFA. The systematic review highlights the inadequacy of existing evidence.

Unilateral Withdrawal of Treatment in a State of Exception.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND There are very few randomised, blinded trials comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in achieving remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly silastic ring (SR)-LRYGB. We compared the effectiveness of (LSG) versus SR-LRYGB among patients with T2D and morbid obesity. METHODS Prospective, randomised, parallel, 2-arm, blinded clinical trial conducted in a single Auckland (New Zealand) centre. Eligible patients aged 20-55 years, T2D of at least 6 months duration and BMI 35-65 kg/m2 were randomised 1:1 to LSG (n = 58) or SR-LRYGB (n = 56) using random number codes disclosed after anaesthesia induction. Primary outcome was T2D remission defined by different HbA1c thresholds at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, post-operative complications and mortality. RESULTS Mean ± standard deviation (SD) pre-operative BMI was 42.5 ± 6.2 kg/m2, HbA1c 63 ± 16 mmol/mol (30% insulin-treated, 28% had diabetes duration over 10 years). Proportions achieving HbA1c ≤ 38 mmol/mol, < 42 mmol/mol, < 48 mmol/mol and < 53 mmol/mol without diabetes medication at 1 year in SR-LRYGB vs LSG were 38 vs 43% (p = 0.56), 52 vs 49% (p = 0.85), 75 vs 72% (p = 0.83) and 80 vs 77% (p = 0.82), respectively. Mean ± SD % total weight loss at 1 year was greater after SR-LRYGB than LSG: 32.2 ± 7.7 vs 27.1 ± 7.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Gastrointestinal complications were more frequent after SR-LRYGB (including 3 ulcers, 1 anastomotic leak, 1 abdominal bleeding).

To compare effects of clopidogrel single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with clopidogrel-based DAPT on hemostatic system activation we conducted a RCT in 44 volunteers (clopidogrel [d1: 600mg, d2-6: 150 mg] +/- aspirin [100mg]). Adenosine diphosphate (MEA-ADP) and arachidonic acid (MEA-AA) triggered aggregometry, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), beta thromboglobulin, p-selectin, thromboxane B2 , d-Dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (f1.2), and a phospholipid dependent clotting time (PPL) were measured in venous blood. Changes are described by mean differences (Δmean [95% CI]) or geometric mean ratios (GMR [95% CI]).

This article discusses the role of EBW along the disease continuum of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (PC) in terms of incidence and outcome. Summary Comparison of findings is hampered by the use of different methods to assess EBW. Nevertheless, in acute pancreatitis (AP) and PC, EBW, especially visceral obesity, presents a distinct risk factor and predictor of a negative outcome. Findings of a protective effect likely result from nonconsideration of fat distribution or other confounders. Regarding chronic pancreatitis (CP), few studies indicate lower incidence and a better outcome with higher body mass. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the existence of an obesity paradox. The precise mechanisms of how EBW affects the disease continuum require further elucidation but both common and disease-specific effects seem involved. Key Messages EBW is associated with higher incidence and a negative outcome in AP and PC. The association with CP is less conclusive. Thus, maintaining normal weight is advisable at any stage of the disease continuum.","Wiese, Mats L; Aghdassi, Ali A; Lerch, Markus M; Steveling, Antje",Visceral medicine,https://doi.org/10.1159/000517147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540944/,160

84169,COVID-19 and Physician Mothers.,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is now considered the best serum biomarker of ovarian reserve, while basal sex hormones are classic markers used for assessing ovarian reserve. The interaction between AMH and sex hormones are complicated and not sufficiently addressed. In this study, we took diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) as two extremes of ovarian reserve (deficient and excessive respectively) to investigate the role of AMH and sex hormones in follicular growth. METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional survey was performed. The patients assessed AMH and basal sex hormones in the Second Hospital of Zhejiang University from April 2016 to March 2019 were involved in this study. Serum AMH and sex hormone concentrations were tested with electrochemiluminescence method. Stepwise linear regression and binary logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of AMH level and to explore the involved factors determining DOR and PCOS. RESULTS In the present study, we found that age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were main negative correlation factors, and luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) were main positive factors of AMH. In DOR group, age, FSH and estradiol (E2) increased and T decreased, while in PCOS group, LH and T increased. Binary logistic regression found that age, weight, FSH, E2, and T were the significant factors which independently predicted the likelihood of DOR, and that age, body mass index (BMI), AMH, LH, and T predicted the likelihood of PCOS. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that age, FSH, and T were factors that most closely correlated with AMH level, and T was involved in both DOR and PCOS. Since DOR and PCOS are manifested with insufficient AMH and excessive AMH respectively, it is suggested that total testosterone correlated with AMH closely and plays an important role in follicular growth. More attention should be given to testosterone level during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) process.","Lv, Ping-Ping; Jin, Min; Rao, Jin-Peng; Chen, Jian; Wang, Li-Quan; Huang, Chang-Chang; Yang, Song-Qing; Yao, Qiu-Ping; Feng, Lei; Shen, Jin-Ming; Feng, Chun",BMC endocrine disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12902-020-00569-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641160/,160

The aim of this study was to investigate how different types of primary care data can help quantify the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis on mental health. A retrospective cohort study investigated changes in weekly counts of mental health consultations and prescriptions. The data were extracted from one the UK's largest primary care databases between January 1st 2015 and October 31st 2020 (end of follow-up). The 2020 trends were compared to the 2015-19 average with 95% confidence intervals using longitudinal plots and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A total number of 504 practices (7,057,447 patients) contributed data. During the period of national restrictions, on average, there were 31% (3957 ± 269, p < 0.001) fewer events and 6% (4878 ± 1108, p < 0.001) more prescriptions per week as compared to the 2015-19 average. The number of events was recovering, increasing by 75 (± 29, p = 0.012) per week. Prescriptions returned to the 2015-19 levels by the end of the study (p = 0.854). The significant reduction in the number of consultations represents part of the crisis.

86358,Critical care triage during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa: A constitutional imperative!,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND Hernia formation is common following abdominal operations, and transplant patients are at increased risk due to postoperative immunosuppression. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of incisional hernia formation following primary abdominal solid organ transplantation and identify clinical risk factors for hernia formation. METHODS We performed a single-institution retrospective review of a prospectively collected database to evaluate all patients who underwent primary liver, kidney, or pancreas transplantation between 2000 and 2011. The primary outcome was hernia formation at the transplant incision. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors for incisional hernia formation. RESULTS A total of 3,460 transplants were performed during the study period: 2,247 kidney only, 718 liver only, and 495 pancreas or simultaneous pancreas and kidney (pancreas group). The overall incisional hernia rate was 7.5 %. The Kaplan-Meier rates of hernia formation at 1, 5, and 10 years were 2.5, 4.9, and 7.0 % for kidney; 4.5, 13.6, and 19.0 % for liver; and 2.5, 12.7, and 21.8 % for the pancreas groups. On univariate analysis, surgical site infection (SSI), body mass index (BMI) >25, delayed graft function, and withholding a calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were associated with hernia formation in the kidney group. SSI and BMI >25 were associated with hernia formation in the liver group. In the pancreas group, SSI, cyclosporine, and withholding MMF were all associated with hernia formation. On multivariate analysis, SSI was strongly associated with hernia formation in all groups. Hazard ratio: kidney = 24.71 (13.00-46.97); liver = 12.0 (6.40-22.52); pancreas = 12.95 (2.78-60.29). CONCLUSION Incisional hernias are common following abdominal organ transplant with nearly one in five patients developing an incisional hernia 5 years after liver or pancreas transplantation. Strategies focusing on prevention and early treatment of SSI may help to decrease the risk of incisional hernia formation following abdominal organ transplantation.","Smith, Carter T; Katz, Micah G; Foley, David; Welch, Bridget; Leverson, Glen E; Funk, Luke M; Greenberg, Jacob A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3682-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25125093/,160

DESIGN A modified three-round e-Delphi survey, followed by a survey of parents of the top 20 healthcare professional priorities. SETTING U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS U.K. PICU healthcare professionals who are members of the professional society and parents and family members of children, with experience of a U.K. PICU admission. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Forty-nine healthcare professional submitted topics in round 1, 98 participated in round 2, and 102 in round 3. These topics were categorized into eight broad domain areas, and within these, there were 73 specific topics in round 2. At round 3, 18 topics had a mean score less than 5.5 and were removed, leaving 55 topics for ranking in round 3. Ninety-five parents and family members completed the surveys from at least 17 U.K. PICUs. Both parents and healthcare professional prioritized research topics associated with the PICU workforce. Healthcare professional research priorities reflected issues that impacted on day-to-day management and practice. Parents' prioritized research addressing acute situations such as infection identification of and sepsis management or research addressing long-term outcomes for children and parents after critical illness. Parents prioritized research into longer term outcomes more than healthcare professional. Parental responses showed clear support for the concept of research in PICU, but few novel research questions were proposed. CONCLUSIONS This is the first research prioritization exercise within U.K. PICU setting to include parents' and families' perspectives and compare these with healthcare professional.

The analysis of biological wastewater treatment plant effluents by Kendrick mass defect analysis and liquid chromatography - high resolution - mass spectrometry (LCHRMS) revealed the occurrence of N-nitroso-CIP and N-nitroso-hydrochlorothiazide at concentration levels of 34 ± 3 ng/L and 71 ± 6 ng/L, respectively. In laboratory experiments and dark conditions, produced N-nitroso-CIP concentrations reached a plateau during the course of biodegradation experiments. A mass balance was achieved after identification and quantification of several transformation products by LCHRMS. N-nitroso-CIP accounted for 14.3% of the initial CIP concentration (20 µg/L) and accumulated against time. The use of 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate and superoxide dismutase as scavengers for in situ production of nitric oxide and superoxide radical anion respectively, revealed that the mechanisms of formation of N-nitroso-CIP likely involved a nitrosation pathway through the formation of peroxynitrite and another one through codenitrification processes, even though the former one appeared to be prevalent. This work extended the possible sources of N-nitrosamines by including a formation pathway relying on nitric oxide reactivity with secondary amines under activated sludge treatment.","Brienza, Monica; Manasfi, Rayana; Sauvêtre, Andrés; Chiron, Serge",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818734/,160

The target proteins, including ATP synthase beta chain, protein disulfide isomerase, vimentin, and heat shock protein 60, co-localize with anti-NS1 binding sites on nonfixed HMEC-1 cells using immunohistochemical double staining and confocal microscopy. The cross-reactivity of anti-target protein antibodies with HMEC-1 cells was inhibited by NS1 protein pre-absorption. Furthermore, a cross-reactive epitope on NS1 amino acid residues 311-330 (P311-330) was predicted using homologous sequence alignment. The reactivity of dengue hemorrhagic patient sera with HMEC-1 cells was blocked by synthetic peptide P311-330 pre-absorption.

89529,[Excess deaths from respiratory causes in eight Brazilian metropolises during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic].,2021,"Spiral artery remodeling is an important physiological process in the pregnant uterus which increases blood flow to the fetus. Impaired spiral artery remodeling contributes to preeclampsia, a major disease in pregnancy. Corin, a transmembrane serine protease, is up-regulated in the pregnant uterus to promote spiral artery remodeling. To date, the mechanism underlying uterine corin up-regulation remains unknown. Here we show that Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 17 is a key transcription factor for uterine corin expression in pregnancy. In cultured human uterine endometrial cells, KLF17 binds to the CORIN promoter and enhances the promoter activity. Disruption of the KLF17 gene in the endometrial cells abolishes CORIN expression. In mice, Klf17 is up-regulated in the pregnant uterus. Klf17 deficiency prevents uterine Corin expression in pregnancy. Moreover, Klf17-deficient mice have poorly remodeled uterine spiral arteries and develop gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Together, our results reveal an important function of KLF17 in regulating Corin expression and uterine physiology in pregnancy.","Wang, Can; Wang, Zhiting; He, Meiling; Zhou, Tiantian; Niu, Yayan; Sun, Shengxuan; Li, Hui; Zhang, Ce; Zhang, Shengnan; Liu, Meng; Xu, Ying; Dong, Ningzheng; Wu, Qingyu",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003913117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719113/,160

METHODS Based on the infectivity and hospital requirements of COVID-19, a new simple respirator was designed by the medical staff of the Department of Anesthesiology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, which was applied on the 22 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who needed oxygen therapy admitted to the Cancer Center of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from February 15th to March 15th in 2020. The new simple respirator contained two National Utility Model Patents (a respirator: ZL 2015 2 0410623.6, a fluid switch and oxygen suction device: ZL 2017 2 0873509.6), which was mainly composed of anesthesia mask and filter, L-shaped connecting tube, soft breathing bladder, connecting tube and elastic fixing belt. When in use, the anesthesia mask was fixed to the patient's mouth and nose with elastic straps, the connecting tube was inserted into the oxygen meter interface, the oxygen flow was adjusted to 6-10 L/min, and the L-shaped connecting tube was opened immediately after the soft breathing bag was full. The carbon dioxide and excess oxygen in the body was discharged from exhaust port. The oxygen flow was lowered to 2-3 L/min, the patient's respiratory rate (RR) was observed through the soft breathing bag fluctuations, and the oxygen flow was adjusted at any time. The changes of pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), RR and heart rate (HR) before and after application of new simple respirator were observed, and the blood gas test results of part of the patients were collected. RESULTS Twenty-two patients with severe and critical COVID-19 had significantly higher SpO2 at 10 minutes after application of the new simple ventilator than before application (0.994±0.007 vs. 0.952±0.017, P < 0.01), and RR was significantly lower than that before application (times/min: 27.59±3.63 vs. 29.64±3.81, P < 0.01); after 1 day of application, each index was further improved. All 13 patients who received blood gas analysis indicated no carbon dioxide accumulation. CONCLUSIONS The new simple respirator can significantly improve the oxygen therapy effect of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.

91647,Quality of life and body image of patients with urinary disorders.,2020,"BACKGROUND Clinical Trials (CTs) help in testing and validating the safety and efficacy of newly discovered drugs on specific patient population cohorts. However, these trials usually experience many challenges, such as extensive time frames, high financial cost, regulatory and administrative barriers, and insufficient workforce. In addition, CTs face several data management challenges pertaining to protocol compliance, patient enrollment, transparency, traceability, data integrity, and selective reporting. Blockchain can potentially address such challenges because of its intrinsic features and properties. Although existing literature broadly discusses the applicability of blockchain-based solutions for CTs, only a few studies present their working proof-of-concept. METHODS We propose a blockchain-based framework for CT data management, using Ethereum smart contracts, which employs IPFS as the file storage system to automate processes and information exchange among CT stakeholders. CT documents stored in the IPFS are difficult to tamper with as they are given unique cryptographic hashes. We present algorithms that capture various stages of CT data management. We develop the Ethereum smart contract using Remix IDE that is validated under different scenarios. RESULTS The proposed framework results are advantageous to all stakeholders ensuring transparency, data integrity, and protocol compliance. Although the proposed solution is tested on the Ethereum blockchain platform, it can be deployed in private blockchain networks using their native smart contract technologies. We make our smart contract code publicly available on Github. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the proposed framework can be highly effective in ensuring that the trial abides by the protocol and the functions are executed only by the stakeholders who are given permission. It also assures data integrity and promotes transparency and traceability of information among stakeholders.","Omar, Ilhaam A; Jayaraman, Raja; Salah, Khaled; Simsekler, Mecit Can Emre; Yaqoob, Ibrar; Ellahham, Samer",BMC medical research methodology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01109-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894068/,160

These shortening techniques can be complicated by post-operative: penile shortening, recurrent PC, palpable suture knots and erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, Nesbit procedures require the use of a penile tourniquet to avoid intraoperative bleeding. This observational study aims to assess the results of Nesbit modified corporoplasty, avoiding intraoperative use of tourniquet without risk of bleeding. The objective is to reduce penile ischemic anatomical and functional damages such as long-term erectile dysfunction. Methods Between January 2010 and March 2019, a total of 64 patients with congenital penile curvature (CPC) and Peyronie's disease (PD) underwent surgical correction with a Nesbit modified technique first time described by Rolle et al., with minimal technical differences. The operation notes were retrospectively reviewed. In particular, we evaluated pre- and post-operative erectile functions using IIEF-5 score, penile Doppler ultrasonography and overall patient satisfaction. Results During operations, no intraoperative bleeding was noted, and no short-term complications such as hematomas or neurovascular bundle lesions were reported. At 6 months, no palpable subcutaneous indurations and no sensory change were detected. Post-operative penile shortening was reported in 38 (59.4%) patients (mean 0.83±0.79 cm), but it did not influence the high overall satisfaction rate of 91.4%. Only 2 patients reported a slightly partial recurrence of curvature (<15%) with no need for a redo surgery. Mean IIEF-5 score increased from 17.1±5.2 to 20.8±3.9 at 6 months and 21.8±3.4 at 12 months (P<0.001 in both cases). Mean PSV also significantly increased at the end of follow-up (28.5±6.1 at baseline vs. 31.0±7.1 at 12 months, P=0.03). Conclusions Considering the optimal results in terms of erectile functions increasing and absence of PC recurrence (>15°), we think that Nesbit modified corporoplasty without tourniquet application during reconstruction is a safe and effective surgical procedure for all kind of shortening corporoplasty to reduce the time of penile ischemia, preventing even serious consequences for the normal physiology of erection.","Altieri, Vincenzo Maria; Greco, Francesco; Lisanti, Rocca Carmela; Altieri, Barbara; Esperto, Francesco; Cindolo, Luca; Castellucci, Roberto; Della Camera, Pier Andrea; Sangiorgi, Giuseppe Massimo; Verratti, Vittore",Translational andrology and urology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tau-20-1338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430388/,160
92346,Covid-19 and repercussions in mental health: a narrative review of literature.,2021,"All atom molecular dynamic modeling was applied in order to determine water molecule and electrolyte ion concentration profiles around and inside the myoglobin molecule at various pH values. Significant penetration of counter ions into the molecule was confirmed. The electric potential distribution within and outside the molecule was quantitatively described using the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) approach. Using this model, calculations were performed, yielding the surface and zeta potential for various physicochemical parameters, comprising pH, the electric permittivity, the ion penetration depth and the protein volume fraction (crowding effect). The theoretical results were used for the interpretation of experimental data acquired under different ionic strengths and temperatures by electrophoretic mobility measurements. It is confirmed that the experimental data are adequately reflected for acidic pH values by the non-linear PB model where the nominal molecule charge was calculated from the H++ model. The deviations occurring for larger pH values were accounted for by considering additional non-electrostatic interactions stemming from the van der Waals and ion-induced dipole forces. In this way, it is both experimentally and theoretically confirmed that the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule in electrolyte solutions is considerably smaller than the nominal, structure-based, predicted charge. As a result, under physiological conditions prevailing, e.g. in skeletal muscles, the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule should practically vanish. One can expect that the approach developed in this work can be applied for predicting charging mechanisms of other protein molecules characterized by an analogous charge vs. pH characteristic, e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike proteins, and for soft particles with pH responsive characteristics.","Batys, Piotr; Nattich-Rak, Małgorzata; Adamczyk, Zbigniew",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp03771k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206736/,160

BACKGROUND Conflicting results on the effect of NMB on laparoscopic working space are found in literature. Almost all studies are limited by absence of objective assessment of working space or use surrogate outcomes. METHODS In a standardized porcine laparoscopy model, laparoscopic working-space dimensions with and without NMB were investigated in 16 animals using computed tomography at intra-abdominal pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg during multiple runs of abdominal insufflation. RESULTS No statistically significant effect of NMB on abdominal dimensions and laparoscopic working-space volume was found during CO2 pneumoperitoneum. In contrast, the effect of pre-stretching of the abdominal wall by a previous abdominal insufflation was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS This experimental study confirms the results from several clinical studies that NMB does not influence laparoscopic working space. Studies dealing with working space during laparoscopy should take note of pre-stretching bias.","Vlot, John; Specht, Patricia A; Wijnen, René M H; van Rosmalen, Joost; Mik, Egbert G; Bax, Klaas M A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3927-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361652/,160
93355,"Nursing and ""being with"" in a world with COVID-19: an existentialist look.",2021,"BACKGROUND A virtual oral health care help line was established to provide consultation and triage for people with dental questions and concerns. Its goal during a pandemic was to keep patients from seeking unnecessary in-person care from emergency departments and urgent care clinics, especially when dental practices were closed or limited to providing essential urgent and emergency oral health care. METHODS The Adams School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed the Carolina Dentistry Virtual Oral Health Care Helpline using a quality improvement framework with faculty and staff member feedback. The process included establishing infrastructure (phone, video, protocols, referrals, documentation), personnel (scheduling, training, calibration), and internal and external communication. The authors collected retrospective information for descriptive evaluation of the first month's operations. RESULTS There were 337 telephone calls answered, of which 65 (19%) were administrative and 272 (81%) were related to dental concerns. Dental pain (54%) was the most prevalent reason for calling. Triage and Providers referred 107 of 175 callers (61%) to the school's urgent care center. Of the 79 callers who received teleconsultations from virtual providers, 33 (42%) did not require additional follow-up, and 7 (9%) needed a follow-up phone call. Overall, 4 people were referred to community clinics, and 4 were referred to the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS The Helpline was launched quickly and improved through quality improvement cycles, and it provided a needed community dental service. The process resolved some patient concerns without their seeking urgent or emergency care. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The pandemic has increased teledentistry practice. The authors describe establishing a dental school's virtual oral health Helpline, which provides a framework for dental practices seeking to use this patient communication modality.","Weintraub, Jane A; Quinonez, Rocio B; Smith, Avie Jackson Thompson; Ciarrocca, Katharine; Fouad, Ashraf F; Shazib, Muhammad Ali; Kraszeski, Marlene M; Rankin, David B; Matthews, N Shaun",Journal of the American Dental Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2020.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33121604/,160

We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Melita, Helen",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395080/,160

We present the 10-year journey of a man who had five different cancers and had iterative genetic testing including for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, eventually to discover a pathogenic variant in the CHEK2 gene, possibly explaining his numerous cancers. This diagnosis offered him closure which he had desperately sought for well over a decade. A pathogenic variant in the CHEK2 gene can potentially explain these cancers because of its function as a tumour suppressor gene. Consideration is warranted of what this means for individuals with CHEK2 variants who may develop multiple cancers, their prognosis and whether different treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target agents would need modification. We encourage more research into the many faces of the CHEK2 gene and the potential for predisposition to multiple cancers.","De Silva, Dilanka L; Winship, Ingrid",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-236435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900738/,160

However, little is known about the timing of measures' implementation, scope, and duration in relation to their impact. The study aimed to describe the social distancing measures implemented by Brazil's states and the Federal District, including the types of measures and the timing of their implementation. This is a descriptive study of the measures' type, chronological and epidemiological timing of the implementation, and scope. The survey of measures used searches in official websites of the government departments and each state's Government Register. The official number of COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from an official a data platform. We considered the following categories of social distancing measures: suspension of events, school closure, quarantine of risk groups, economic lockdown (partial or full), restrictions on transportation, and quarantine of the population. The implementation's timing considered both the chronological date and the epidemiological timing, based on the time since the 10th case or 1st death from COVID-19 in each state. All the states implemented distancing measures, mostly during the latter half of March 2020. Economic lockdown was implemented early, prior to the 10th case by 67% of the states and prior to the 1st death from COVID-19 by 89% of the states. Early social distancing measures were widely implemented in Brazil, before or in the initial phase of the exponential growth curve of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the great majority of states.","Silva, Lara Lívia Santos da; Lima, Alex Felipe Rodrigues; Polli, Démerson André; Razia, Paulo Fellipe Silvério; Pavão, Luis Felipe Alvim; Cavalcanti, Marco Antônio Freitas de Hollanda; Toscano, Cristiana Maria",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00185020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965378/,160

97681,Latent class analysis of COVID-19 symptoms in Brazil: results of the PNAD-COVID19 survey.,2021,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in major changes to the provision of alcohol treatment in the UK, these changes coincided with increases in the use of alcohol. This study sought to understand the impact of the pandemic on older adults in alcohol treatment, and to explore how changes in the provision of alcohol treatment were experienced. METHOD Semi-structured interviews were completed with older adults (aged 55+) in alcohol treatment, as well as alcohol practitioners providing support to older adults. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C). RESULTS Thirty older adults in alcohol treatment and fifteen alcohol practitioners were recruited. The COVID-19 pandemic was found to result in both increases and decreases in alcohol use; changes in alcohol use depended on a number of factors, such as living arrangements, family support, physical and mental health. Many alcohol treatment services moved to a model of remote support during the pandemic. However, face-to-face service provision was considered to be essential by both older adults in alcohol treatment and alcohol practitioners. Engagement with online support was low, with older adults facing barriers in using online technology. CONCLUSION The study highlights the importance of face-to-face treatment and intervention for older adults in alcohol treatment. Addiction services may see increased demand for treatment as a result of the pandemic; it is important that services consider the needs of older adults, many of whom may be marginalised by a remote model of service provision.","Seddon, Jennifer; Trevena, Paulina; Wadd, Sarah; Elliott, Lawrie; Dutton, Maureen; McCann, Michelle; Willmott, Sarah",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928805/,160

Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of these 2 tracers in subjects with renal failure. METHODS (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) was prepared with commercially available NTA and a commercially available labeling kit and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 74 MBq (2.0 mCi) of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) were coinjected with approximately 11.1 MBq (300 μCi) of (131)I-OIH in 8 subjects with stage 3-4 renal failure; simultaneous images were obtained for 24 min, followed by an anterior image over the gallbladder and abdomen. Plasma clearances were determined from 10 blood samples obtained 3-180 min after injection using the single-injection, 2-compartment model. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake, and percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 and 180 min were determined. RESULTS There was no difference in the plasma clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) and (131)I-OIH (177 ± 63 vs. 171 ± 66 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively) (P = 0.41). The plasma protein binding and red cell uptake of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) were 35% ± 7% and 6% ± 3%, respectively; both values were significantly lower than the plasma protein binding (71% ± 5%) and red cell uptake (16% ± 2%) of (131)I-OIH (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 min (P = 0.24) and at 3 h (P = 0.82); for comparison, the percentage dose in the urine at 3 h was 77% ± 9% for (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) and 78% ± 11% for (131)I-OIH. Image quality with (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) was excellent and no activity was identified in the gallbladder or intestine.

While polyols have been used traditionally (for about 80 y) to replace sugar in sweet foods to reduce demineralization of tooth enamel and to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels, benefits achieved merely through the absence of sugar, emerging evidence shows that erythritol can play a number of functional roles to actively support maintenance of oral and systemic health. Oral health studies revealed that erythritol can reduce dental plaque weight, reduce dental plaque acids, reduce counts of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental plaque, and reduce the risk for dental caries better than sorbitol and xylitol, resulting in fewer tooth restorations by dentist intervention. Systemic health studies have shown that erythritol, unlike other polyols, is readily absorbed from the small intestine, not systemically metabolized, and excreted unchanged within the urine. This metabolic profile renders erythritol to be noncaloric, to have a high gastrointestinal tolerance, and not to increase blood glucose or insulin levels. Published evidence also shows that erythritol can act as an antioxidant and that it may improve endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes.

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a major complication in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, there are no recognized pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. However, a large number of COVID-19 patients require respiratory support, with a high percentage requiring invasive ventilation. The rapid spread of the infection has led to a surge in the rate of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, which created a challenge to public health, research, and medical communities. The high demand for several therapies, including sedatives, analgesics, and paralytics, that are often utilized in the care of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, has created pressure on the supply chain resulting in shortages in these critical medications. This has led clinicians to develop conservation strategies and explore alternative therapies for sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in COVID-19 patients. Several of these alternative approaches have demonstrated acceptable levels of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in different settings but they are not commonly used in the ICU. Additionally, they have unique pharmaceutical properties, limitations, and adverse effects. This narrative review summarizes the literature on alternative drug therapies for the management of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in COVID-19 patients. Also, this document serves as a resource for clinicians in current and future respiratory illness pandemics in the setting of drug shortages.","Ammar, Mahmoud A; Sacha, Gretchen L; Welch, Sarah C; Bass, Stephanie N; Kane-Gill, Sandra L; Duggal, Abhijit; Ammar, Abdalla A",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620951426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844730/,160

Inadequate staff training and other implementation challenges have been identified as barriers for delivery of evidence-based tobacco treatment. Providing training in tobacco treatment tailored to the unique needs of tobacco-dependent patients with cancer is one strategy to improve adoption of best practices to promote smoking cessation in cancer care. METHODS A tobacco treatment training program for oncology care providers (tobacco treatment training-oncology [TTT-O]) consisting of a 2-day didactic and experiential workshop followed by 6 monthly, collaboratory videoconference calls supporting participants in their efforts to implement National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in their oncology settings was developed and implemented. This article presents preliminary results on program evaluation, changes in participants' self-efficacy, and progress in implementing tobacco treatment. RESULTS Data have been obtained from the first 5 cohorts of TTT-O participants (n = 110) who completed training, course evaluations, baseline and follow-up surveys. Participants rated the training as highly favorable and reported significant gains in self-efficacy in their ability to assess and treat tobacco dependence. Participants also demonstrated significant improvements in tobacco treatment skills and implementation of several indicators of improved adoption of best practices for tobacco treatment in their cancer care settings. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of tobacco treatment training for cancer care providers is feasible, acceptable, and can have a significant positive impact on participants' tobacco treatment skills, self-efficacy, and greater adoption of tobacco treatment delivery in cancer care.","Ostroff, Jamie S; Bolutayo Gaffney, Kemi L; O'Brien, Maureen; deLeon-Sanchez, Suhana T; Whitlock, C Will; Kotsen, Chris S; Carter-Harris, Lisa; Banerjee, Smita C; Schofield, Elizabeth",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914922/,160

OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of higher tidal volumes (HVt) compared to moderate Vt (MVt) in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) facility on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. SETTING AIR facility in the United States. METHODS Eighty-four adults with SCI were divided into MVt group if maximum Vt received in AIR was <15 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and HVt group if maximum Vt was >15 ml/kg PBW. Primary outcomes were incidence of pneumonia and composite pulmonary adverse events (pneumonia, weaning failure, or acute care transfers due to respiratory complications). Secondary outcomes were AIR preweaning days defined as time from AIR admission to beginning of weaning, weaning days defined as days from start to end of weaning, and AIR ventilator days calculated as days on ventilator from AIR admission to discharge. RESULTS MVt was utilized in 50 patients and HVt was utilized in 34 patients. The risk of pneumonia in HVt group was 4.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-12] compared to MVt group. Odds of pulmonary adverse events in HVt group was 5.4 times higher (CI: 1.8-17) compared to MVt group. There was no difference in preweaning days, weaning days, or AIR ventilator days between the two groups.

Here we characterised the aerosol microbial abundance, diversity and composition in the Athens underground railway system. PM10 filter samples were collected from the naturally ventilated Athens Metro Line 3 station ""Nomismatokopio"". Quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene and high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was performed on DNA extracted from PM10 samples. Results showed that, despite the bacterial abundance (mean = 2.82 × 105 16S rRNA genes/m3 of air) being, on average, higher during day-time and weekdays, compared to night-time and weekends, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant. The average PM10 mass concentration on the platform was 107 μg/m3. However, there was no significant correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance and overall PM10 levels. The Athens Metro air microbiome was mostly dominated by bacterial and fungal taxa of environmental origin (e.g. Paracoccus, Sphingomonas, Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Antrodia) with a lower contribution of human commensal bacteria (e.g. Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus). This study highlights the importance of both outdoor air and commuters as sources in shaping aerosol microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise the mycobiome diversity in the air of a Metro environment based on amplicon sequencing of the ITS region. In conclusion, this study presents the first microbial characterisation of PM10 in the Athens Metro, contributing to the growing body of microbiome exploration within urban transit networks. Moreover, this study shows the vulnerability of public transport to airborne disease transmission.","Grydaki, N; Colbeck, I; Mendes, L; Eleftheriadis, K; Whitby, C",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126062/,160

In this study, we explore Lgr5 expression in gastric carcinoma and analyse its role in invasion, metastasis, and prognosis in carcinoma. METHODS A combination of immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect mRNA and protein expression levels of Lgr5 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Small interfering RNA against Lgr5 was designed, synthesised, and transfected into AGS cells. The effects of Lgr5 siRNA on cell invasion were detected by transwell invasion chamber assay and wound healing assay. RESULTS Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 expression was significantly higher in gastric carcinomas than in normal mucosa. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 expression positively correlated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, distance of metastasis, and MMP2 expression levels. Multivariate analysis showed that Lgr5 had an independent effect on survival, and that it positively correlated with MMP2. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 siRNAs inhibited Lgr5 mRNA and protein expression. Transwell assays indicated that these siRNAs resulted in significantly fewer cells migrating through the polycarbonate membrane, and wound healing assay also indicated that siRNAs decreased the migration of cells. Inhibition of Lgr5 resulted in a significant decrease in MMP2 and β-catenin levels compared with those in controls. CONCLUSIONS Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 was correlated with invasion and metastasis. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 inhibition could serve as a novel therapeutic approach.","Xi, H Q; Cai, A Z; Wu, X S; Cui, J X; Shen, W S; Bian, S B; Wang, N; Li, J Y; Lu, C R; Song, Z; Wei, B; Chen, L",British journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2014.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594994/,160

108509,"COVID-19: Experience of a tertiary children's hospital in Western Cape Province, South Africa.",2021-02-15,"Digital health is a rapidly emerging field that offers several promising potentials: health care delivery remotely, in urban and rural areas, in any time zone, and in times of pandemics and ecological crises. Digital health encompasses electronic health, computing science, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, to name but a few technical components. Digital health is part of a vision for systems medicine. The advances in digital health have been, however, uneven and highly variable across communities, countries, medical specialties, and societal contexts. This article critically examines the determinants of digital health (DDH). DDH describes and critically responds to inequities and differences in digital health theory and practice across people, places, spaces, and time. DDH is not limited to studying variability in design and access to digital technologies. DDH is situated within a larger context of the political determinants of health. Hence, this article presents an analysis of DDH, as seen through political science, and the feminist studies of technology and society. A feminist lens would strengthen systems-driven, historically and critically informed governance for DDH. This would be a timely antidote against unchecked destructive/extractive governance narratives (e.g., technocracy and patriarchy) that produce and reproduce the health inequities. Moreover, feminist framing of DDH can help cultivate epistemic competence to detect and reject false equivalences in how we understand the emerging digital world(s). False equivalence, very common in the current pandemic and post-truth era, is a type of flawed reasoning in decision-making where equal weight is given to arguments with concrete material evidence, and those that are conjecture, untrue, or unjust. A feminist conceptual lens on DDH would help remedy what I refer to in this article as ""the normative deficits"" in science and technology policy that became endemic with the rise of neoliberal governance since the 1980s in particular. In this context, it is helpful to recall the feminist writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Le Guin posed ""what if?"" questions, to break free from oppressive narratives such as patriarchy and re-imagine technology futures. It is time to envision an emancipated, equitable, and more democratic world by asking ""what if we lived in a feminist world?"" That would be truly awesome, for everyone, women and men, children, youth, and future generations, to steer digital technologies and the new field of DDH toward broadly relevant, ethical, experiential, democratic, and socially responsive health outcomes.","Özdemir, Vural",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2021.0020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794130/,160
109094,Estimates of serious fungal infection burden in Côte d'Ivoire and country health profile.,2020-11-21,"PURPOSE This study investigated the effects of the menstrual cycle on prolonged exercise performance both in temperate (20°C, 45% relative humidity) and hot, humid (32°C, 60% relative humidity) conditions. METHODS For each environmental condition, 12 recreationally active females were tested during the early follicular (day 3-6) and midluteal (day 19-25) phases, verified by measurement of estradiol and progesterone. For all four tests, thermoregulatory, cardiorespiratory, and perceptual responses were measured during 60 min of exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption followed by an incremental test to exhaustion. RESULTS No differences in exercise performance between menstrual cycle phases were found during temperate conditions (n = 8) despite a higher resting and submaximal exercise core temperature (Tc) in the luteal phase. In hot, humid conditions (n = 8), however, prolonged exercise performance, as exercise time to fatigue, was significantly reduced during the luteal phase. This finding was not only accompanied by higher resting and submaximal exercise Tc but also a higher rate of increase in Tc during the luteal phase. Furthermore, submaximal exercise HR, minute ventilation, and RPE measures were higher during the luteal phase in hot, humid conditions. No significant differences were found over the menstrual cycle in heat loss responses (partitional calorimetry, sweat rate, upper arm sweat composition) and Tc at exhaustion. CONCLUSION In temperate conditions, no changes in prolonged exercise performance were found over the menstrual cycle, whereas in hot, humid conditions, performance was decreased during the luteal phase. The combination of both exercise and heat stress with the elevated luteal phase Tc at the onset of exercise resulted in physiological and perceptual changes and a greater thermosensitivity, which may explain the decrease in performance.","Janse DE Jonge, Xanne A K; Thompson, Martin W; Chuter, Vivienne H; Silk, Leslie N; Thom, Jeanette M",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0b013e3182656f13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776870/,160
111335,Grounded in Justice: An Equity Framework for Chief Residents.,2021-06-01,"AIMS To examine how circulating GLP-1 concentrations during liraglutide treatment relate to its therapeutic actions on glucose and weight, and to study the effects of liraglutide on other proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs), including endogenous GLP-1, GLP-2, glucagon, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, and major proglucagon fragment, which also regulate metabolic and weight control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adults who were overweight/obese (BMI 27-40 kg/m2 ) with prediabetes were randomized to liraglutide (1.8mg/day) vs placebo for 14 weeks. We used specific assays to measure exogenous (liraglutide, GLP-1 agonist (GLP-1A)) and endogenous (GLP-1E) GLP-1, alongside 5 other PGDP concentrations during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) completed at baseline and at week 14 (liraglutide, n=16; placebo, n=19). Glucose during MMTT, steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration for insulin resistance, and insulin secretion rate (ISR) were previously measured. MMTT area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated for ISR, glucose, and levels of PGDPs. RESULTS Participants on liraglutide vs placebo had significantly (p≤0.004) decreased weight (mean -3.6%, 95% CI [-5.2, -2.1]), SSPG (-32% [-43, -22]) and glucose AUC (-7.0% [-11.5, -2.5]), and increased ISR AUC (30%, [16, 44]). Treatment with liraglutide significantly (p≤0.005) increased exogenous GLP-1A AUC (median 310 vs 262 pg/mL X 8h at baseline but decreased endogenous GLP-1E AUC (13.1 vs 24.2 pmol/L x 8h at baseline)), as well as the 5 other PGDPs. Only glucagon AUC decreased in the placebo group (471 vs 594 pg/mL x 8h at baseline). GLP-1A AUC at study end was significantly (p≤0.04) linearly associated with % decrease in weight (r=-0.54) and SSPG (r=-0.59) and increase in ISR AUC (r=0.51) in the liraglutide group. CONCLUSIONS Circulating GLP-1A concentrations, reflecting liraglutide levels, predict improvement in weight, insulin action, and secretion in a linear manner. Importantly, liraglutide also downregulates all other PGDPs, normalization of the levels of which may provide additional metabolic benefits in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

111399,Pedagogical mediations for non-formal nursing teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Background: COVID-19 poses a potentially significant infectious risk during procedures of the head and neck due to high viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Facial plastic surgery has significant exposure to these areas during craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures and rhinoplasty. Methods: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-10 μm range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real time during cadaveric-simulated rhinoplasty and facial trauma conditions. Procedures tested included mandibular plate screw drilling, calvarial drilling, nasal bone osteotomy, nasal dorsal rasping, and piezoelectric saw use. Particulate generation was measured both adjacent to the surgical site and at surgeon mouth level (SML). Results: Mandibular plate screw drilling without irrigation generated significant particulate both adjacent to the surgical site and at SML (p < 0.01). Irrigation mitigated particulate generation at SML to nonsignificant levels. Calvarial drilling additionally produced substantial particulate above baseline adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.01). Standard nasal osteotomies and dorsal rasping did not generate detectable airborne particulate, whereas piezoelectric saw use was associated with significant particulate generation both adjacent to the surgical site (p < 0.001) and at SML (p < 0.01). At SML, smaller particulate represented a significantly higher proportion of total particulate detected. Conclusions: The majority of craniomaxillofacial trauma procedures involve particle generation that may be limited in spread by the use of local irrigation. Most bony work involved in rhinoplasty can be safely performed without a high degree of particle formation. The use of piezoelectric instruments in rhinoplasty should be avoided when concerned for particulate generation.","Gadkaree, Shekhar K; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Workman, Alan D; Feng, Allen L; Quesnel, Alicia M; Shaye, David A",Facial plastic surgery & aesthetic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/fpsam.2020.0322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628569/,160

111976,Public health physician specialty training in Canada and the United States.,2012,"Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) limit viral dissemination prior to the emergence of adaptive immune responses through the concerted action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although IFN-α/β induction by coronaviruses is modest, it effectively limits viral spread within the central nervous system (CNS) and protects against mortality. The protective roles of specific ISGs against the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) members of the coronaviruses are largely unknown. This study demonstrates a protective role of the ISG Ifit2 in encephalitis induced by the dual hepato- and neurotropic MHV-A59. Contrasting the mild encephalitis and 100% survival of MHV-A59-infected wild-type (wt) mice, nearly 60% of infected Ifit2(-/-) mice exhibited severe encephalitis and succumbed between 6 and 8 days postinfection. Increased clinical disease in Ifit2(-/-) mice coincided with higher viral loads and enhanced viral spread throughout the CNS parenchyma. Ifit2(-/-) mice also expressed significantly reduced IFN-α/β and downstream ISG mRNAs Ifit1, Isg15, and Pkr, while expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was only modestly affected in the CNS. Impaired IFN-α/β induction in the absence of Ifit2 was confirmed by ex vivo mRNA analysis of microglia and macrophages, the prominent cell types producing IFN-α/β following MHV CNS infection. Furthermore, both IFN-α/β mRNA and protein production were significantly reduced in MHV-infected Ifit2(-/-) relative to wt bone marrow-derived macrophages. Collectively, the data implicate Ifit2 as a positive regulator of IFN-α/β expression, rather than direct antiviral mediator, during MHV-induced encephalitis.","Butchi, Niranjan B; Hinton, David R; Stohlman, Stephen A; Kapil, Parul; Fensterl, Volker; Sen, Ganes C; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02272-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24198415/,160
114285,[Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Workers'Mental Health].,2021-01-21,"OBJECTIVES Increasing numbers of youth experience mental illness, and also require and benefit from specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Worldwide, such services are underfunded and under-resourced, and services in Ireland are no different. It is vital that existing services are regularly reviewed for both efficacy and acceptability. Our objective was to review published studies evaluating service user satisfaction with CAMHS in Ireland and CAMHS therapeutic efficacy. METHODS MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they reported on service user satisfaction or an evaluation of CAMHS in Ireland. RESULTS From an initial 125 articles identified, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria: four reporting on overall CAMHS satisfaction, three on satisfaction where a specific diagnosis was present, while eight evaluated various interventions offered. Whilst most service users perceived services to be satisfactory, important issues relating to accessibility were present. Evidence of efficacy was present for a small number of interventions, but studies were limited by methodological issues. CONCLUSIONS There is a dearth of studies evaluating CAMHS in Ireland. The extant literature suggests a positive experience once accessed, but long waiting times and poor collaboration are seen to limit services users' experience. More robust methodologically sound studies are urgently required. Given the expected increased demand linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the resultant compromised financial position, it is essential that scant resources are appropriately directed.","Leahy, D; McNicholas, F",Irish journal of psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757610/,160

DESIGN A prospective, observational study. SETTING Operating room of a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS The study comprised 15 patients undergoing vascular surgery of the lower extremities and 15 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS Zero-heat-flux thermometry on the forehead and standard core temperature measurements. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Body temperature was measured using a new thermometry system (SpotOn; 3M, St. Paul, MN) on the forehead and with conventional methods in the esophagus during vascular surgery (n = 15), and in the nasopharynx and pulmonary artery during cardiac surgery (n = 15). The agreement between SpotOn and the conventional methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman random-effects approach for repeated measures. The mean difference between SpotOn and the esophageal temperature during vascular surgery was+0.08°C (95% limit of agreement -0.25 to+0.40°C). During cardiac surgery, during off CPB, the mean difference between SpotOn and the pulmonary arterial temperature was -0.05°C (95% limits of agreement -0.56 to+0.47°C). Throughout cardiac surgery (on and off CPB), the mean difference between SpotOn and the nasopharyngeal temperature was -0.12°C (95% limits of agreement -0.94 to+0.71°C). Poor agreement between the SpotOn and nasopharyngeal temperatures was detected in hypothermia below approximately 32°C. CONCLUSIONS According to this preliminary study, the deep body temperature measured using the zero-heat-flux system was in good agreement with standard core temperatures during lower extremity vascular and cardiac surgery. However, agreement was questionable during hypothermia below 32°C.","Mäkinen, Marja-Tellervo; Pesonen, Anne; Jousela, Irma; Päivärinta, Janne; Poikajärvi, Satu; Albäck, Anders; Salminen, Ulla-Stina; Pesonen, Eero",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2016.03.141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521967/,160

A change-point time-series analysis of weekly incidence for the period January 2010 to September 2016 was used to identify sensitive infectious diseases to the tornado; (3) Results: The 75 to 84 years old group was at the highest risk of both death (RR = 82.16; 95% CIs = 19.66, 343.33) and injury (RR = 31.80; 95% CI = 17.26, 58.61), and females were at 53% higher risk of death than males (RR = 1.53; 95% CIs = 1.02, 2.29). Of the 337 injuries, 274 injuries (81%) were minor. Most deaths occurred indoors (87%) and the head (74%) was the most frequent site of trauma during the tornado. Five diseases showed downward change-points; (4) Conclusions: The experience of the Funing tornado underscores the relative danger of being indoors during a tornado and is successful in avoiding epidemics post-tornado.

115162,Noncommunicable diseases and changes in lifestyles during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.,2021,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. However, although genomic studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures, we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47% of 192 tumors suggests that APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover, PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G>A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G>A [p.Glu545Lys]) were enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking-associated signature was observed in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal (<100 kb) amplifications of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent inactivating mutations in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1, in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60% of 104 ESCC tumors indicates that therapies targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC. Collectively, our data provide comprehensive insights into the mutational signatures of ESCC and identify markers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.","Zhang, Ling; Zhou, Yong; Cheng, Caixia; Cui, Heyang; Cheng, Le; Kong, Pengzhou; Wang, Jiaqian; Li, Yin; Chen, Wenliang; Song, Bin; Wang, Fang; Jia, Zhiwu; Li, Lin; Li, Yaoping; Yang, Bin; Liu, Jing; Shi, Ruyi; Bi, Yanghui; Zhang, Yanyan; Wang, Juan; Zhao, Zhenxiang; Hu, Xiaoling; Yang, Jie; Li, Hongyi; Gao, Zhibo; Chen, Gang; Huang, Xuanlin; Yang, Xukui; Wan, Shengqing; Chen, Chao; Li, Bin; Tan, Yongkai; Chen, Longyun; He, Minghui; Xie, Sha; Li, Xiangchun; Zhuang, Xuehan; Wang, Mengyao; Xia, Zhi; Luo, Longhai; Ma, Jie; Dong, Bing; Zhao, Jiuzhou; Song, Yongmei; Ou, Yunwei; Li, Enming; Xu, Liyan; Wang, Jinfen; Xi, Yanfeng; Li, Guodong; Xu, Enwei; Liang, Jianfang; Yang, Xiaofeng; Guo, Jiansheng; Chen, Xing; Zhang, Yanbo; Li, Qingshan; Liu, Lixin; Li, Yingrui; Zhang, Xiuqing; Yang, Huanming; Lin, Dongxin; Cheng, Xiaolong; Guo, Yongjun; Wang, Jun; Zhan, Qimin; Cui, Yongping",American journal of human genetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.02.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25839328/,160

A database search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they analysed the outcomes of patients who were not transported following ambulance attendance. The primary outcome of this review was subsequent presentation to an ED following a non-transport decision. Secondary outcome measures included hospital admission, subsequent presentation to alternative service provider (e.g. private physician), and death at follow up. The search yielded 1953 non-duplicate articles, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies specified that the non-transport decision was emergency medical services (EMS)-initiated, seven studies did not specify. Meta-analysis found substantial heterogeneity between estimates (I2 >50%) that was likely because of differences in study design, length of follow up, patient demographic and sample size. Between 5% and 46% (pooled estimate 21%; 95% CI 11-31%) of non-transport patients subsequently presented to ED. Few (pooled estimate 8%; 95% CI 5-12%) EMS-initiated non-transport patients were admitted to hospital compared to the unspecified group (pooled estimate 40%; 95% CI 7-72%). Mortality rates were low across included studies. Studies found varying estimates for the proportion of patients discharged at the scene that subsequently presented to ED. Few patients were admitted to hospital when the non-transport decision was initiated by EMS, indicating EMS triage is a relatively safe practice. More research is needed to elucidate the context of non-transport decisions and improve access to alternative pathways.","Yeung, Timothy; Shannon, Brendan; Perillo, Samuel; Nehme, Ziad; Jennings, Paul; Olaussen, Alexander",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943579/,160

Engineering LVs to have the capacity to transduce specific cell types is of great interest to advance the translation of LVs toward the clinic. Here we provide an overview of innovative approaches to target LVs to cells of the immune system. In this overview we distinguish between two types of LV targeting strategies: (i) targeting of the vectors to specific cells by LV surface modifications, and (ii) targeting at the level of transgene transcription by insertion of tissue-specific promoters to drive transgene expression. It is clear that each strategy is of enormous value but ultimately combining these approaches may help reduce the effects of off-target expression and improve the efficiency and safety of LVs for gene therapy.","Froelich, Steven; Tai, April; Wang, Pin",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08923970903420582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20085508/,160

In zebrafish, Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location, which can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.","Katz, Hilary R; Menelaou, Evdokia; Hale, Melina E",The Journal of comparative neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.25033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935362/,160

In the case of pure Hebbian learning, we find that the normalised weights equal the promotion probabilities of weights up to correction terms that depend on the learning rate and are usually small. A similar relation can be derived for STDP algorithms, where the normalised weight values reflect a difference between the promotion and demotion probabilities of the weight. These relations are practically useful in that they allow checking for convergence of Hebbian and STDP algorithms. Another application is novelty detection. We demonstrate this using the MNIST dataset.","Chu, Dominique; Le Nguyen, Huy",Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2020.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401225/,160

We examined whether the type of EEG performed affected seizure treatment decisions (e.g., the choice and number of antiseizure drugs [ASDs]) in therapeutic hypothermia-treated neonates with HI from 2007 to 2015 in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. During this period, 3 different EEG monitoring protocols were utilized: Period 1 (2007-2009), single, brief conventional EEG (1 h duration) at a variable time during therapeutic hypothermia treatment, i.e., ordered when a seizure was suspected; Period 2 (2009-2013), single, brief conventional EEG followed by amplitude-integrated EEG for the duration of therapeutic hypothermia treatment and another brief conventional EEG after rewarming; and Period 3 (2014-2015), continuous video-EEG (cEEG) for the duration of therapeutic hypothermia treatment (72 h) plus for an additional 12 h during and after rewarming. One hundred and sixty-two newborns were included in this retrospective cohort study. As a function of the type and duration of EEG monitoring, we assessed the risk (likelihood) of receiving no ASD, at least 1 ASD, or ≥2 ASDs. We found that the risk of a neonate being prescribed an ASD was 46% less during Period 3 (cEEG) than during Period 1 (brief conventional EEG only) (95% CI 6-69%, p = 0.03). After adjusting for initial EEG and MRI results, compared with Period 1, there was a 38% lower risk of receiving an ASD during Period 2 (95% CI: 9-58%, p = 0.02) and a 67% lower risk during Period 3 (95% CI: 23-86%, p = 0.01). The risk ratio of receiving ≥2 ASDs was not significantly different across the 3 periods. In conclusion, in addition to the higher sensitivity and specificity of continuous video-EEG monitoring, fewer infants are prescribed an ASD when undergoing continuous forms of EEG monitoring (aEEG or cEEG) than those receiving conventional EEG. We recommend that use of continuous video-EEG be considered whenever possible, both to treat seizures more specifically and to avoid overtreatment.","Jan, Saber; Northington, Frances J; Parkinson, Charlamaine M; Stafstrom, Carl E",Developmental neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1159/000454855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28081533/,160

METHODS This was a population-based, cross-sectional, mixed-methods study (13 May 2020-9 June 2020) of participants aged ≥60 years. Self-reported KAP about ten COVID-19 symptoms and six government-endorsed preventive measures were evaluated. Multivariable regression models identified sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and practices in our sample. Associations between knowledge/attitude scores, and practice categories were determined using logistic regression. 78 participants were interviewed qualitatively about practice of additional preventive measures and data were analysed thematically. RESULTS Mean awareness score of the symptoms was 7.2/10. Fever (93.0%) and diarrhoea (33.5%) were the most- and least-known symptoms, respectively. Most knew all six preventive measures (90.4%), perceived them as effective (78.7%), and practiced 'wear a mask' (97.2%). Indians, Malays, and those in smaller housing had poorer mean knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms scores. Older participants had poorer attitudes towards preventive measures. Compared to Chinese, Indians had lower odds of practicing 3/6 recommendations. A one-point increase in knowledge of and attitudes towards preventive measures score had higher odds of always practicing 3/6 and 2/6 measures, respectively. Qualitative interviews revealed use of other preventive measures, e.g. maintaining a healthy lifestyle. CONCLUSION Elderly Singaporeans displayed high levels of KAP about COVID-19 and related preventive measures, with a positive association between levels of knowledge/attitude, and practice. However, important ethnic and socioeconomic disparities were evident, suggesting key vulnerabilities remain, requiring immediate attention.","Aravindhan, Amudha; Gan, Alfred Tau Liang; Lee, Ester Pei Xuan; Gupta, Preeti; Man, Ryan; Ho, Kam Chun; Sung, Sharon C; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Ling, Moi Lin; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Wong, Tien Yin; Fenwick, Eva K; Lamoureux, Ecosse L",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2021152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628802/,160

The patient is a 70 year-old female with a history of infectious mononucleosis in her teens who presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath, associated with cough and fever. She underwent extensive work up and her serologic workup revealed positive anti-EBV antibodies, pointing towards the diagnosis of EBV induced pneumonitis. EBV-induced Pneumonitis is a very rare entity and is especially hardly seen among immunocompetent individuals. This interesting case shows that in this new era of viral pneumonias, EBV induced pneumonitis should be considered among differentials when dealing with lung infections. Prompt initiation of treatment with steroids or antiviral medication may result in complete recovery. The choices among treatment options can be individualized according to the severity of disease, course of disease progression, and side effect profile of medications.

Methods Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IA to IB) from endometrial curettage and preoperative imaging studies were selected at Dongsan Medical Center from March 2014 to November 2015. All surgical procedures, including hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic node dissection, and cytology aspiration, were performed by robotic single-site instruments (da Vinci Si® surgical system; Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Results A total of 15 women with early-stage endometrial cancer underwent the RSSS operation. The median patient age and body mass index were 53 years (range, 37-70 years) and 25.4 kg/m2 (range, 18.3-46.4 kg/m2). The median docking time, console time, and total operative time were 8 minutes (range, 4-15 minutes), 75 minutes (range, 55-115 minutes), and 155 minutes (range, 125-190 minutes), respectively. The median retrieval of both pelvic lymph nodes was 9 (range, 6-15). There were no conversions to laparoscopy or laparotomy. Conclusion The RSSS operation is feasible and safe in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. In this study, operative times were reasonable, and the surgical procedure was well-tolerated by the patients. Further evaluation of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer should be performed in large-scale comparative studies using the laparoendoscopic, single-site staging operation to confirm the safety and benefits of the RSSS operation for early-stage endometrial cancer.","Chung, Hyewon; Jang, Tae-Kyu; Nam, Seung Hyub; Kwon, Sang-Hoon; Shin, So-Jin; Cho, Chi-Heum",Obstetrics & gynecology science,https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.2019.62.3.149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139590/,160

Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is widespread in Australia and has been shown to contribute to BRD occurrence. As part of a prospective longitudinal study on BRD, effects of exposure to BVDV-1 on risk of BRD in Australian feedlot cattle were investigated. A total of 35,160 animals were enrolled at induction (when animals were identified and characteristics recorded), held in feedlot pens with other cattle (cohorts) and monitored for occurrence of BRD over the first 50days following induction. Biological samples collected from all animals were tested to determine which animals were persistently infected (PI) with BVDV-1. Data obtained from the Australian National Livestock Identification System database were used to determine which groups of animals that were together at the farm of origin and at 28days prior to induction (and were enrolled in the study) contained a PI animal and hence to identify animals that had probably been exposed to a PI animal prior to induction. Multi-level Bayesian logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the effects of exposure to BVDV-1 on the risk of occurrence of BRD. Although only a total of 85 study animals (0.24%) were identified as being PI with BVDV-1, BVDV-1 was detected on quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 59% of cohorts. The PI animals were at moderately increased risk of BRD (OR 1.9; 95% credible interval 1.0-3.2). Exposure to BVDV-1 in the cohort was also associated with a moderately increased risk of BRD (OR 1.7; 95% credible interval 1.1-2.5) regardless of whether or not a PI animal was identified within the cohort. Additional analyses indicated that a single quantitative real-time PCR test is useful for distinguishing PI animals from transiently infected animals. The results of the study suggest that removal of PI animals and/or vaccination, both before feedlot entry, would reduce the impact of BVDV-1 on BRD risk in cattle in Australian feedlots. Economic assessment of these strategies under Australian conditions is required.","Hay, K E; Ambrose, R C K; Morton, J M; Horwood, P F; Gravel, J L; Waldron, S; Commins, M A; Fowler, E V; Clements, A C A; Barnes, T S; Mahony, T J",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.01.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26907209/,160

124207,The unacceptable tragedy of maternal mortality associated with COVID-19: (re)politicization of women's health and rights and the position of Brazilian nursing.,2020-10-16,"Surgery remains the curative treatment modality for colorectal cancer in all stages, including stage IV with resectable liver metastasis. There is emerging evidence that the stress response caused by surgery as well as other perioperative therapies such as anesthesia and analgesia may promote growth of pre-existing micro-metastasis or potentially initiate tumor dissemination. Therapeutically targeting the perioperative period may therefore reduce the effect that surgical treatments have in promoting metastases, for example by combining β-adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in the perioperative setting. In this paper, we highlight some of the mechanisms that may underlie surgery-related metastatic development in colorectal cancer. These include direct tumor spillage at the time of surgery, suppression of the anti-tumor immune response, direct stimulatory effects on tumor cells, and activation of the coagulation system. We summarize in more detail results that support a role for catecholamines as major drivers of the pro-metastatic effect induced by the surgical stress response, predominantly through activation of β-adrenergic signaling. Additionally, we argue that an improved understanding of surgical stress-induced dissemination, and more specifically whether it impacts on the level and nature of heterogeneity within residual tumor cells, would contribute to the successful clinical targeting of this process. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that ex-vivo analyses of colorectal cancer patient-derived samples using RGB-labeling technology can provide important insights into the heterogeneous sensitivity of tumor cells to stress signals. This suggests that intra-tumor heterogeneity is likely to influence the efficacy of perioperative β-adrenergic receptor and COX-2 inhibition, and that ex-vivo characterization of heterogeneous stress response in tumor samples can synergize with other models to optimize perioperative treatments and further improve outcome in colorectal and other solid cancers.","Behrenbruch, Corina; Shembrey, Carolyn; Paquet-Fifield, Sophie; Mølck, Christina; Cho, Hyun-Jung; Michael, Michael; Thomson, Benjamin N J; Heriot, Alexander G; Hollande, Frédéric",Clinical & experimental metastasis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10585-018-9873-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335811/,160

124756,The Family Update: An Underappreciated Challenge in Treating Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19.,2021-02-02,"AIM Many surgeons consider total proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as the treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis with dysplasia. However, obstruction occurring at the pouch inlet or involving the afferent limb can be refractory to nonoperative or endoscopic management. Historically, these refractory obstructions have usually required resection of the pouch. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that pouch salvage surgery may be feasible in these patients. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients of a single surgical practice who underwent a neo ileal-pouch anastomosis for J-pouch inlet obstructions between 2000 and 2017. Data collected included patient demographics, preoperative workup, intra-operative findings, type of surgical intervention and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Surgical interventions were performed on eight patients with J-pouch inlet obstructions. Six patients had inlet strictures or acute angulations at the inlet, which were either bypassed or resected and primarily anastomosed. Two patients had internal hernias posterior to the mesentery, with volvulus of the pouch. At a mean follow-up of 36.5 months, all patients retained their pouches and the mean number of daily bowel movements was eight. Two major and two minor complications occurred. DISCUSSION J-pouch inlet obstructions may take years to develop. In patients with obstruction who are refractory to endoscopic or medical treatment, good functional results may be obtained with pouch salvage procedures. With increasing numbers of J-pouches being performed, awareness of novel surgical techniques is important.","Sellers, M M; Elnekaveh, B M; Hahn, S J; Hirten, R P; Greenstein, A J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.14574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706608/,160

A total of 127 pre-Covid clinic letters from November to December 2019 and 103 peri-Covid clinic letters from April to May 2020 were identified and assessed for readability. Text was analyzed using a standardized set of commonly used readability formulae, including SMOG, Flesch Reading Ease, and the Coleman-Liao Index. A total of 100 pre-Covid and 58 peri-Covid letters were suitable for inclusion. Median results for formulae that output a U.S. grade score ranged between 9 and 12.9 for letters written prior to Covid-19 and 9 and 13.2 for those written during Covid-19. Eight percent of letters were sent to patients pre-Covid, increasing to 28% during the pandemic. Letters sent to patients had a median grade score of between 8 and 12 prior to Covid-19 and 8 and 10.6 during Covid-19. Letters sent to clinicians ranged between 9 and 13 and 9 and 13.3, respectively. Outpatient plastic surgery letters are written at a readability level too high to facilitate understanding among the general population.

Our objective was to report prospective, single-centre data regarding patient and physician experience with virtual INR clinics for routine follow-up appointments. METHODS We surveyed all patients that participated in a virtual INR clinic follow-up appointment at our hospital over a 3 month period. Information gathered included length of appointment delays (ie, wait times), length of appointment times, overall satisfaction, and perceived safety metrics. A survey was also sent out to all physicians who participated in virtual clinics with similar questions. RESULTS 118/122 patients and 6/6 physicians completed the survey. Wait times before previous in-person appointments were perceived to be much longer than virtual appointments, whereas in-person appointment times were longer. 112/118 (94.9%) patients and 4/6 (67%) physicians reported general satisfaction with their virtual clinic experience. There were 8/118 patients who felt their conditions could not be safely assessed virtually, compared with 1/6 (17%) physicians. Lastly, 72.2% of patients reported that they would prefer virtual or telephone visits in the future for non-urgent follow-up, and 5/6 (83%) of physicians reported the same. CONCLUSION Virtual INR clinics are more efficient and are preferred among patients and physicians for non-urgent follow-up appointments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a virtual platform for INR care, which could be sustainable for future practice.","Lun, Ronda; Walker, Gregory; Daham, Zeinab; Ramsay, Tim; Portela de Oliveira, Eduardo; Kassab, Mohammed; Fahed, Robert; Quateen, Aiman; Lesiuk, Howard; P Dos Santos, Marlise; Drake, Brian",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028673/,160

Solutions such as buttressing, oversewing or roofing the staple line with gelatin matrix have been proposed with controversial results. Because the use of fibrin sealant has shown a possible benefit in reducing the reoperation rate due to early complication in patients (pts) undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP), this solution has been tested in 100 consecutive pts undergoing LSG. A clinical trial has been performed on 100 consecutive pts. Exclusion criteria from the study were considered ASA IV pts, treated or untreated malignancies at any stage, steroids or FANS assumption, previous sovramesocolic surgery and conversion to open surgery. All pts were randomized to receive (group A, 50 pts) or to not receive (group B, 50 pts) 4 ml of human fibrin sealant (Tisseel™, Baxter(®) Deerfield, IL, USA) sprayed along the suture line. Primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications: leaks, bleeding of the staple line or stenosis of the gastric remnant. Significance was assigned at a p level <0.05. By considering pts in group A vs. pts in group B our results shown no significant difference in fistulas or strictures occurrence (p = 0.2). Bleeding was significantly higher in patients not sprayed with sealant (group A vs. group B, 1/7, p = 0.03). This randomized trial has so far shown the use of fibrin sealant in LSG to significantly reduce postoperative bleeding. Although a trend in reducing leak occurrence emerges, it does not reach statistical significance.","Musella, Mario; Milone, Marco; Maietta, Paola; Bianco, Paolo; Pisapia, Anna; Gaudioso, Dario",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-014-0257-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961471/,160
126448,Our Essential Status: Perspective from Across the Pond.,2020-12-04,"Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, Nsp1, for shutting down host translation. However, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing Nsp1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes are preferentially translated in the context of Nsp1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we uncovered a remarkable enrichment of 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) tracts among preferentially translated genes. Using reporter assays, we validated that 5' UTRs from TOP transcripts can drive preferential expression in the presence of NSP1. Finally, we found that LARP1, a key effector protein in the mTOR pathway may contribute to preferential translation of TOP transcripts in response to Nsp1 expression. Collectively, our study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by Nsp1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","Rao, Shilpa; Hoskins, Ian; Tonn, Tori; Garcia, Daniela; Ozadam, Hakan; Sarinay Cenik, Elif; Cenik, Can",RNA,https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.078661.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127534/,160

To understand HuNoV biology and the epithelial response to infection, we performed transcriptomic analyses, RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas9 modification of human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures, and functional studies with two virus strains (a pandemic GII.4 and a bile acid-dependent GII.3 strain). We identified a predominant type III interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response to HuNoV infection. Replication of both strains is sensitive to exogenous addition of IFNs, suggesting the potential of IFNs as therapeutics. To obtain insight into IFN pathway genes that play a role in the antiviral response to HuNoVs, we developed knockout (KO) HIE lines for IFN alpha and lambda receptors and the signaling molecules, MAVS, STAT1, and STAT2 An unexpected differential response of enhanced replication and virus spread was observed for GII.3, but not the globally dominant GII.4 HuNoV in STAT1-knockout HIEs compared to parental HIEs. These results indicate cellular IFN responses restrict GII.3 but not GII.4 replication. The strain-specific sensitivities of innate responses against HuNoV replication provide one explanation for why GII.4 infections are more widespread and highlight strain specificity as an important factor in HuNoV biology. Genetically modified HIEs for innate immune genes are useful tools for studying immune responses to viral or microbial pathogens.","Lin, Shih-Ching; Qu, Lin; Ettayebi, Khalil; Crawford, Sue E; Blutt, Sarah E; Robertson, Matthew J; Zeng, Xi-Lei; Tenge, Victoria R; Ayyar, B Vijayalakshmi; Karandikar, Umesh C; Yu, Xiaomin; Coarfa, Cristian; Atmar, Robert L; Ramani, Sasirekha; Estes, Mary K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010834117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907944/,160

In response to this crisis, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief funds programs that serve orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and their families. These programs retain case workers, known as activistas, who provide and refer beneficiaries to services to increase beneficiaries' knowledge of their HIV status and to improve retention in care among those living with HIV. To improve program effectiveness, implementing organizations need to understand how different case management attributes affect beneficiary outcomes. We applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), based on 119 interviews, to identify the combinations of case management attributes that led to (1) increased knowledge of HIV status, and (2) high percentages of beneficiaries with known HIV status. We identified 6 pathways for the first outcome and 5 pathways for the second outcome. Each pathway demonstrates an alternative combination of conditions that positively influences the outcome and is equally sufficient in achieving the outcome. To improve knowledge of HIV status, programs in a similar context as this study may select any of the identified pathways based on their existing resources and work on ensuring the presence of each of the conditions in the pathway. Overall, based on the presence of some of the factors in multiple pathways, we conclude that to improve knowledge of HIV status it is important that programs implement a formal process to assign cases considering case complexity and existing caseload to reduce overwork; provide activistas with external support such as weekly care team meetings, weekly supervisor meetings, and/or low supervision ratios; hire experienced activistas; provide all activistas with follow-up trainings so they have the tools to address challenging cases; expand the financial resources offered to activistas; and reimburse activistas for work-related expenses.","Davis, Allie; Allen, Zola; Nascimento, Nena do; Chapman, Jenifer; Donco, Rotafina; Velthausz, Daan","Global health, science and practice",https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008862/,160

El 20 de marzo de 2020 se inició el confinamiento preventivo obligatorio en Argentina. Estudios realizados en el marco de esta pandemia en China, han evidenciado consecuencias psicológicas como resultado del temor al contagio y de las medidas de aislamiento. El objetivo del presente estudio es explorar a través de una encuesta autoadministrada por vía electrónica, actitudes y temores frente al COVID-19, la presencia de sintomatología depresiva y el patrón de consumo de alcohol de la población argentina durante el confinamiento (n = 759). Como resultado, observamos que el temor al COVID-19 fue mayor en las personas de entre 55 y 59 años, con un descenso abrupto en los mayores de 70; que el ánimo depresivo y el incremento en el consumo de alcohol fueron más frecuentes en los más jóvenes y que el estado de ánimo depresivo mostró una frecuencia mayor en quienes perdieron el empleo durante el confinamiento. Finalmente, observamos que el grado de acuerdo de los participantes con la medida de confinamiento fue superior al 90% incluso en aquellas personas que sufrieron una disminución de sus ingresos mayor al 80% durante la cuarentena.

Introduction After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. Methods The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). Results As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed.","Alomo, Martín; Gagliardi, Georgina; Peloche, Sebastian; Somers, Eugenia; Alzina, Pilar; Prokopez, Cintia R",Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Medicas,https://doi.org/10.31053/1853.0605.v77.n3.28561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991105/,160
132893,"Have we learnt anything from COVID-19, and can we put it to good use in the future?",2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND Obesity rates have reached epidemic levels with over 300 million obese individuals worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a primarily restrictive bariatric surgical procedure has been shown to be effective in producing marked weight loss. However, LSG-associated gastric leakage and hemorrhages remain the most important challenges postoperatively. Staple line buttress reinforcement has been suggested to reduce these postoperative complications. Our objective was to assess staple line buttress reinforcement via the Duet™ tissue reinforcement stapler system in morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG as part of a comprehensive weight management strategy, focusing on postoperative complications. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2011, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 116 consecutive patients that underwent LSG with staple line buttress reinforcement at an academic teaching hospital with advanced bariatric fellowship. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 44.3 ± 9.5 years, with mean preoperative BMI of 44 ± 7 kg/m2. The mean operative time to perform LSG was 96 ± 25 min. Postoperative weight was significantly lower following LSG at 1-year follow-up compared to baseline (104 ± 25 vs. 125 ± 27 kg, P < 0.05). There were no postoperative gastric leaks observed. Postoperative bleeding from the gastric staple line occurred in one patient (0.9%) and was treated with conservative management. CONCLUSIONS In LSG, staple line buttress reinforcement limits postoperative gastric leakage and bleeding in morbidly obese patients.","Gill, Richdeep S; Switzer, Noah; Driedger, Mike; Shi, Xinzhe; Vizhul, Andrey; Sharma, Arya M; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0598-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258197/,160

Considerations about the COVID-19 lockdown.,2021,"Background: Despite the effectiveness of hand hygiene (HH) for infection control, there is a lack of robust scientific data to guide how HH can be improved in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study is to use the literature, researcher, and stakeholder opinion to explicate potential interventions for improving HH compliance in the ICU, and provide an indication of the suitability of these interventions. Methods: A four-phase co-design study was designed. First, data from a previously completed systematic literature review was used in order to identify unique components of existing interventions to improve HH in ICUs. Second, a workshop was held with a panel of 10 experts to identify additional intervention components. Third, the 91 intervention components resulting from the literature review and workshop were synthesised into a final list of 21 hand hygiene interventions. Finally, the affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability, side-effects/safety, and equity of each intervention was rated by 39 stakeholders (health services researchers, ICU staff, and the public). Results: Ensuring the availability of essential supplies for HH compliance was the intervention that received most approval from stakeholders. Interventions involving role models and peer-to-peer accountability and support were also well regarded by stakeholders. Education/training interventions were commonplace and popular. Punitive interventions were poorly regarded. Conclusions: Hospitals and regulators must make decisions regarding how to improve HH compliance in the absence of scientific consensus on effective methods. Using collective input and a co-design approach, the guidance developed herein may usefully support implementation of HH interventions that are considered to be effective and acceptable by stakeholders.","Lambe, Kathryn; Lydon, Sinéad; McSharry, Jenny; Byrne, Molly; Squires, Janet; Power, Michael; Domegan, Christine; O'Connor, Paul",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13296.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34250439/,160
133538,[Excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic: underreporting and regional inequalities in Brazil].,2021,"Proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus by host trypsin-like proteases is required for viral infectivity. Some serine proteases are capable of cleaving influenza virus HA, whereas some serine protease inhibitors (serpins) inhibit the HA cleavage in various cell types. Kallikrein-related peptidase 1 (KLK1, also known as tissue kallikrein) is a widely distributed serine protease. Kallistatin, a serpin synthesized mainly in the liver and rapidly secreted into the circulation, forms complexes with KLK1 and inhibits its activity. Here, we investigated the roles of KLK1 and kallistatin in influenza virus infection. We show that the levels of KLK1 increased, whereas those of kallistatin decreased, in the lungs of mice during influenza virus infection. KLK1 cleaved H1, H2, and H3 HA molecules and consequently enhanced viral production. In contrast, kallistatin inhibited KLK1-mediated HA cleavage and reduced viral production. Cells transduced with the kallistatin gene secreted kallistatin extracellularly, which rendered them more resistant to influenza virus infection. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated kallistatin gene delivery protected mice against lethal influenza virus challenge by reducing the viral load, inflammation, and injury in the lung. Taking the data together, we determined that KLK1 and kallistatin contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus by affecting the cleavage of the HA peptide and inflammatory responses. This study provides a proof of principle for the potential therapeutic application of kallistatin or other KLK1 inhibitors for influenza. Since proteolytic activation also enhances the infectivity of some other viruses, kallistatin and other kallikrein inhibitors may be explored as antiviral agents against these viruses.","Leu, Chia-Hsing; Yang, Mei-Lin; Chung, Nai-Hui; Huang, Yen-Jang; Su, Yu-Chu; Chen, Yi-Cheng; Lin, Chia-Cheng; Shieh, Gia-Shing; Chang, Meng-Ya; Wang, Shainn-Wei; Chang, Yao; Chao, Julie; Chao, Lee; Wu, Chao-Liang; Shiau, Ai-Li",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00065-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149981/,160

Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of either the PL2 core domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 180) or the immediate downstream region (aa 181 to 323) is lethal to the virus. In this study, the PL2 domain was found to encode an active enzyme that mediates efficient processing of nsp2-3 in CHO cells. The PL2 protease possessed both trans- and cis-cleavage activities, which were distinguished by individual point mutations in the protease domain. The minimal size required to maintain these two enzymatic activities included nsp2 aa 47 to 240 (Tyr(47) to Cys(240)) and aa 47 to 323 (Tyr(47) to Leu(323)), respectively. Introduction of targeted amino acid mutations in the protease domain confirmed the importance of the putative Cys(55)- His(124) catalytic motif for nsp2/3 proteolysis in vitro, as were three additional conserved cysteine residues (Cys(111), Cys(142), and Cys(147)). The conserved aspartic acids (e.g., Asp(89)) were essential for the PL2 protease trans-cleavage activity. Reverse genetics revealed that the PL2 trans-cleavage activity played an important role in the PRRSV replication cycle in that mutations that impaired the PL2 protease trans function, but not the cis activity, were detrimental to viral viability. Lastly, the potential nsp2/3 cleavage site was probed. Mutations with the largest impact on in vitro cleavage were at or near the G(1196)|G(1197) dipeptide.","Han, Jun; Rutherford, Mark S; Faaberg, Kay S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00834-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19587037/,160

We aimed to describe the experiences of women in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery programs by (1) exploring the pandemic's impact on their lives, sobriety, and recovery capital and (2) tracking COVID-19 perceptions and preventative behaviors. METHODS We conducted monthly semistructured interviews with women in residential and outpatient SUD recovery programs in Kansas City in April, May, and June 2020. Participants described the pandemic's impact on their life and sobriety and completed survey items on factors related to COVID-19 preventative behaviors. We interpreted qualitative themes longitudinally alongside quantitative data. RESULTS In 64 interviews, participants (n = 24) described reduced access to recovery capital, or resources that support sobriety, such as social relationships, housing, employment, and health care. Most experienced negative impacts on their lives and feelings of stability in March and April but maintained sobriety. Four women described relapse, all attributed to pandemic stressors. Participants described relief related to societal re-opening in May and June, and increased engagement with their communities, despite rising infection rates. CONCLUSIONS For women recovering from SUDs during COVID-19, securing recovery capital often meant assuming greater COVID-19 risk. As substance use appeared to have increased during the pandemic and COVID-19 transmission continues, public health planning must prioritize adequate and safe access to recovery capital and timely distribution of vaccines to people struggling with SUDs.","Hurley, Emily A; Piña, Kimberly; Cegielski, Victoria; Noel-MacDonnell, Janelle R; Miller, Melissa K",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080549/,160

METHODS A retrospective review of morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with a hand-sewn GJ between April 2011 and 2012 was performed. The authors' traditional technique (TT) consisted of using standard monofilament absorbable suture to close the common JJ enterotomy in a single running layer and to create the GJ with a two-layer anastomosis. A novel technique (NT) was introduced using knotless unidirectional barbed monofilament absorbable suture to perform both tasks. A comparison between these two techniques was performed. RESULTS In this study, 84 patients with a mean body mass index of 41.7 ± 4.7 kg/m(2) underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass using a hand-sewn technique. For the 84 patients, 75 primary procedures (89.3 %) and 9 revisional procedures (10.7 %) were performed. In 38 procedures (45.2 %), the TT was used, whereas 46 cases (54.8 %) were managed using the NT. For the primary procedures, the average operating room times were slightly faster in the NT group (178.9 ± 44.4 vs 154.2 ± 74.7 min; p = 0.08). The average hospital length of stay was comparable between the two groups (2.3 ± 0.7 vs 2.6 ± 1.4 days; p = 0.25). A 30-day follow-up assessment was obtained for all 84 patients, without a significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups (TT 18.4 % vs NT 13 %; p = 0.77). No complications were secondary to the JJ closure or gastrojejunostomy. The complications included bleeding (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 1), dehydration (n = 2), esophagitis (n = 1), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 1). No anastomotic leak or stenosis occurred in either group. The mean percentage of excess weight loss at 1 month was 21.3 % ± 5.4 %, without a significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION In the study cohort, the use of knotless unidirectional barbed suture instead of traditional monofilament absorbable suture had similar 30-day outcomes and appears to be a feasible option for laparoscopic bowel closure and anastomosis creation.","Tyner, Ryan P; Clifton, G Travis; Fenton, Stephen J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2616-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23093243/,160

It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children.

136870,Psychosocial impact of COVID-19-related quarantine: reflections after the first case of suicide in Colombia.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Hydrops and abnormalities of inner fluid pressure are involved in some otologic diseases such as Ménière's disease (MD). However, demonstrating abnormal perilymphatic or endolymphatic pressure is challenging. Multifrequency tympanometry studies in MD patients demonstrated an increase of the width of conductance tympanograms (outside an attack) compared with controls. To confirm that the increase in conductance width is caused by hyperpressure and not hypopressure in these patients tested outside an attack, we assessed the effect of changes in inner ear fluid pressure caused by body tilt on the results of multifrequency admittancemetry tympanograms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A multifrequency tympanometry including conductance (G) tympanogram at 2 kHz and resonance frequency measurements were performed in 20 volunteers (40 ears) free of otologic or neurologic disease. The measures were collected in three different positions: vertical, supine, and Trendelenburg positions. RESULTS Changes in inner ear fluid pressure caused by body tilt induced an increase in the width of G tympanograms. In the vertical position, the mean value was 141.7 ± 56.5 daPa; in the supine position, it increased to 158 ± 58.3 daPa; and increased even more in the Trendelenburg position (20 degrees), with a mean of 184 ± 69.6 daPa (p < 0.01). Resonance frequency also increased in the Trendelenburg position.We conclude that the increased width of G tympanograms in MD patients outside an attack may be caused by an increase in inner ear fluid pressure.","Franco-Vidal, Valérie; Bonnard, Damien; Bellec, Olivier; Thomeer, Hans; Darrouzet, Vincent","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000000604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251302/,160

Since its discovery, fac-[M(I)(OH2)3(CO)3](+) has served as an essential scaffold for the development of new targeted (99m)Tc based radiopharmaceuticals due to its labile aquo ligands. However, the lipophilic nature of the fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) core can influence the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the complexes. In an effort to understand and improve this behavior, monosubstituted pyridine ligands were used to assess the impact of donor nitrogen basicity on binding strength and stability of fac-[M(I)(CO)3](+) in a 2 + 1 labeling strategy. A series of Re and (99m)Tc complexes were synthesized with picolinic acid as a bidentate ligand and 4-substituted pyridine ligands. These complexes were designed to probe the effect of pKa from the monodentate pyridine ligand both at the macro scale and radiochemical concentrations.

TRIM25 has recently been identified as an RNA-binding protein, raising the question of whether its RNA-binding activity is important for its role in innate immunity. Here, we review TRIM25's mechanisms and pathways in noninfected and infected cells. We also introduce models that explain how TRIM25 binding to RNA could modulate its functions and play part in the antiviral response.

Trends have shown clear improvement in quality of life and satisfaction. However, to the best of our knowledge, overall patient satisfaction after transmasculine chest surgery and associated factors are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to estimate the overall patient satisfaction in transgender men and nonbinary population after transmasculine chest surgery and to assess associated factors. Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching literature in several databases. Meta-analyses of prevalence with a random-effect model for overall and subgroup prevalence were performed. Meta-regression, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results A total of 1052 transmasculine patients underwent any type of transmasculine chest surgery. The pooled overall postoperative satisfaction was 92% [95% confidence interval (CI) 88-96%]. In the subgroup metanalysis, patient satisfaction after periareolar mastectomy was 93% (CI 88%-97%) and after mastectomy with or without free nipple grafting was 90% (CI 84%-95%). Patient satisfaction for studies with mean follow-up >1 year was 91% (CI 83%-97%) and for mean follow-up of 1 year or less was 93% (CI 89%-96%). Conclusions This study shows a high level of satisfaction in transmasculine chest surgery for both techniques, which remain stable over time. Also, our results show that this procedure impacts patient satisfaction beyond chest appearance and surgical outcomes. This corroborates its broad acceptance and the improvements in the standard of care, and decision-making approach.","Bustos, Valeria P; Bustos, Samyd S; Mascaro, Andres; Del Corral, Gabriel; Forte, Antonio J; Ciudad, Pedro; Kim, Esther A; Langstein, Howard N; Manrique, Oscar J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

145132,"[Report of the Global Committee, a Survey of International Conferences Held Online due to the Effects of COVID-19 Infectious Diseases].",2021,"PURPOSE There has been a growing interest in the development of energy-specific collimators for low-energy pencil beam scanning (PBS) to reduce the lateral penumbra. One particular device that has been the focus of several recent published works is the dynamic collimation system (DCS), which provides energy-specific collimation by intercepting the scanned proton beam as it nears to target edge with a set of orthogonal trimmer blades. While several computational studies have shown that this dynamic collimator can provide additional healthy tissue sparing, there has not been any rigorous experimental work to benchmark the theoretical models used in these initial studies. Therefore, it was the purpose of this work to demonstrate an experimental method that could integrate an experimental prototype with a clinical PBS system and benchmark the Monte Carlo methods that have been used to model the DCS. METHODS An experimental DCS prototype was designed and built in house to actively collimate individual proton beamlets during PBS within a well-characterized experimental setup. Monte Carlo methods were initially used to assess construction tolerances and later benchmarked against measurements, including integral depth dose and lateral asymmetric beamlet profiles. The experimental apparatus and measurement geometry were modeled using MCNP6 benchmarked from measurements performed at the Northwestern Chicago Proton Center. RESULTS Gamma analysis tests were used to evaluate the agreement between the measured and simulated profiles with a strict 1 mm/1% criteria and 5% dose threshold. Excellent agreement was observed between the simulated and measured profiles, which included 1 mm/1% gamma analysis pass rates of at least 100% and 95% for the integral depth dose (IDD) profiles and lateral profiles, respectively. Differences in the relative profile shape were observed experimentally between beamlets collimated on- and off-axis, which was attributed to the partial transmission of the beam through an unfocused collimator. Exposure rates resulting from the activation of the device were monitored with survey meter measurements and were found to agree with Monte Carlo estimates of the exposure rate to within 20%. CONCLUSION A DCS prototype was constructed and integrated into a clinical dose delivery system. While the results of this work are not exhaustive, they demonstrate the effects of beam source divergence, device activation, and beamlet deflection during scanning, which were found to be successfully modeled using Monte Carlo methods and experimentally benchmarked. Excellent agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured lateral spot profiles of collimated beamlets delivered on- and off-axis in PBS. The Monte Carlo models adequately predicted the measured elevated plateau region in the integral depth-dose profiles from the low-energy scatter off the collimators.","Smith, Blake R; Pankuch, Mark; Hyer, Daniel E; Culberson, Wesley S",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411329/,160

This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. DATA The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. METHODS Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. RESULTS Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health.

147093,Long-term outcomes of patients with necrotizing fasciitis.,2010,"BACKGROUND Experimental experience and the technological evolution of minimally invasive surgical devices have allowed initial reports describing the clinical applicability of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Colorectal resections are an interesting target for the NOTES platform. Theoretically, the transrectal approach could overcome the proposed limitations of transvaginal access, increasing NOTES clinical applicability. Hybrid procedures such as minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery (MA-NOS) are the safe progression to pure NOTES. This report describes the first clinical case of a transrectal MA-NOS total colectomy. METHODS The patient was a 36-year-old man with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who experienced failure of immunosuppressive therapy. The standard steps of laparoscopic total colectomy were respected, with basic triangulation maintained throughout the case. A transrectal endoscopic device was used for optic assistance, colon dissection, ileum section, and specimen retrieval. Transrectal MA-NOS total colectomy was assisted by three laparoscopic ports: a 12-mm port used as the terminal ileostomy site, a 2-mm needle epigastric port, and a 5-mm umbilical port used as a drain site at the final intervention. No intraoperative complications occurred. RESULTS The total operative time was 240 min. Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 2. Because of UC rectal activity, a course with azathioprine was completed, and the patient was discharged receiving 1 g of rectal mesalazine for maintenance. The final pathology demonstrated pancolonic inflammatory bowel disease in the form of UC with severe activity. CONCLUSIONS Transrectal MA-NOS total colectomy was feasible and safe in the reported case. Improvement in NOTES instrumentation and selective clinical applications are mandatory before clinical trials.","Lacy, Antonio M; Saavedra-Perez, David; Bravo, Raquel; Adelsdorfer, Cedric; Aceituno, Montserrat; Balust, Jaume",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2117-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258297/,160

The aim of our study was, therefore, to assess the course of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) during the first 72h after birth in infants with prenatally diagnosed duct-dependent congenital heart disease. In addition, we identified clinical parameters that were associated with rcSO2. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included 56 infants with duct-dependent congenital heart disease. We measured arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and rcSO2 during the first 72h after birth. Simultaneously, we calculated FTOE. RESULTS We observed median rcSO2 values of approximately 60%, a decreasing FTOE from 0.34 on day 1 to 0.28 on day 3 and stable preductal SpO2 values around 90%. Several clinical variables were associated with rcSO2. In a multiple linear regression model only type of CHD and preductal SpO2 were significant predictors of rcSO2 during the first three days after birth. Infants with a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation had up to 12% lower rcSO2 values than infants with a duct-dependent systemic circulation. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that, during the first three days after birth, cerebral oxygen saturation is low in infants with duct-dependent congenital heart disease. Furthermore, this study provides preoperative reference values of rcSO2 and FTOE in infants with duct-dependent CHD.","Mebius, Mirthe J; van der Laan, Michelle E; Verhagen, Elise A; Roofthooft, Marcus Tr; Bos, Arend F; Kooi, Elisabeth Mw",Early human development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2016.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741476/,160

Participants (n = 110) completed a dual task composed of (i) a flanker attention and (2) working memory load task, while SA was induced by threat of noise. Electrocardiography was measured during the task and during four baseline periods in order to calculate vmHRV. RTs on the flanker task were fit to an ex-Gaussian distribution, which estimated three RT parameters: mu (Gaussian mean), sigma (Gaussian SD), and tau (combination of exponential mean and SD). First, findings indicate that threat of noise was associated with reductions in mu and tau, suggesting that SA might improve attention and motor responding. Second, higher resting vmHRV was associated with relatively lower tau (averaged across conditions), as well as to relatively stronger threat-related decreases in tau. Third, intra-individual decreases in vmHRV were accompanied by concomitant decreases in tau. These findings support roles for trait and state vagal control in guiding adaptive anxiety-related (and anxiety-unrelated) attentional responses. Findings are consistent with extant theories that emphasize functional interrelations among emotion, cognition, and vagal function.","Spangler, Derek P; Cox, Katherine R; Thayer, Julian F; Brooks, Justin R; Friedman, Bruce H",International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.08.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069780/,160

METHODS We used data from a mandatory, population-based registry that includes external monitoring of completeness, which assesses reperfusion therapies for consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke since 2011. We described outcomes overall and by subgroups (age ≤ or >80 years; onset-to-groin puncture ≤ or >6 hours; anterior or posterior strokes; previous IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or isolated endovascular treatment/therapy; revascularization or no revascularization), and determined independent predictors of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2) and mortality at 3 months by multivariate modeling. RESULTS We analyzed 536 patients, of whom 285 received previous IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Overall, revascularization (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scores, 2b and 3) occurred in 73.9%, 5.6% developed symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages, 43.3% achieved good functional outcome, and 22.2% were dead at 90 days. Adjusted comparisons by subgroups systematically favored revascularization (lower proportion of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages and death rates and higher proportion of good outcome). Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent protective effect of revascularization. Additionally, age >80 years, stroke severity, hypertension (deleterious), atrial fibrillation, and onset-to-groin puncture ≤6 hours (protective) also predicted good outcome, whereas lack of previous disability and anterior circulation strokes (protective) as well as and hypertension (deleterious) independently predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study reinforces the role of revascularization and time to treatment to achieve enhanced functional outcomes and identifies other clinical features that independently predict good/fatal outcome after endovascular treatment/therapy.","Abilleira, Sònia; Cardona, Pere; Ribó, Marc; Millán, Mònica; Obach, Víctor; Roquer, Jaume; Cánovas, David; Martí-Fàbregas, Joan; Rubio, Francisco; Alvarez-Sabín, José; Dávalos, Antoni; Chamorro, Angel; de Miquel, Maria Angeles; Tomasello, Alejandro; Castaño, Carlos; Macho, Juan M; Ribera, Aida; Gallofré, Miquel",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.003489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595590/,160

Their use was accelerated further by the COVID-19 pandemic, but their impact on patients and outcomes has not been adequately investigated. These technologies offer promising avenues to detect clinical deterioration early, increasing clinician's ability to treat patients in place. A review of literature was executed to further explore the modalities' ability to maximize access to specialty care, modernize care models, and improve patient outcomes. DESIGN Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review methodology was used to analyze quantitative and qualitative studies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Primary research conducted in NH settings or focused on NH residents was included. Participants included clinicians, NH residents, subacute patients, and families. METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, PsycNET, and JSTOR were searched, yielding 16 studies exploring telemedicine and telehealth in NH settings between 2014 and 2020. RESULTS Measurable impacts such as reduced emergency and hospital admissions, financial savings, reduced physical restraints, and improved vital signs were found along with process improvements, such as expedient access to specialists. Clinician, resident, and family perspectives were also discovered to be roundly positive. Studies showed wide methodologic heterogeneity and low generalizability owing to small sample sizes and incomplete study designs. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Preliminary evidence was found to support geriatrician, psychiatric, and palliative care consults through telemedicine. Financial and clinical incentives such as Medicare savings and reduced admissions to hospitals were also supported. NHs are met with increased challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which telemedicine and telehealth may help to mitigate. Additional research is needed to explore resident and family opinions of telemedicine and telehealth use in nursing homes, as well as remote monitoring costs and workflow changes incurred with its use.","Groom, Lisa L; McCarthy, Margaret M; Stimpfel, Amy Witkoski; Brody, Abraham A",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.02.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819450/,160

Italy has been one of the first countries, together with Cina, dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19 and adopting severe measures to limit viral transmission. The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity and medical and nursing personnel should be know these implications. The initial experience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the exponential rise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of potential tissue donors which can adversely affect the overall donation activity and reduce the number of transplants.

157775,"Books: Health Is Made at Home, Hospitals Are For Repairs. Building a Healthy and Health-Creating Society: Healthy Individuals Depend on Healthy Communities, a Healthy Society, and a Healthy Planet.",2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Public health emergencies require resources at state, regional, federal, and often international levels; however, community preparedness is the crucial first step in managing these events and mitigating their consequences, particularly for children. Community preparedness can be optimized through system-wide planning that includes integrating multiple points of contact, such as the community, prehospital care, health facilities, and regional level of care assets.Citizen readiness, call centers, alternate care facilities, emergency medical services, and health emergency operations centers linked to community incident command systems should be considered as important options for delivery of population-based care. Early collaboration between pediatric clinicians and public health authorities is essential to ensure that pediatric needs are addressed in community preparedness for mass critical care events. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force recommends active promotion of programs to ensure an informed citizenry; education of children and families in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention community mitigation strategies; emphasis on community-level preparedness empowering the public to provide self care; use of 9-1-1 telephone triage with pre-established protocols and in coordination with emergency medical services; and advocacy for healthcare coalitions and other creative operational concepts that provide guidance and protocols for care of the pediatric population.","Burkle, Frederick M; Williams, Alcia; Kissoon, Niranjan",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e318234a786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067923/,160

158060,The multidisciplinary surgical center team's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Ventral hernia repair fails frequently despite advanced mesh inserting surgery. A model for dynamic intermittent straining (DIS) of ventral hernia repairs was developed. The influence of phospholipids, position, overlap, fixation and tissue quality of various meshes on the durability of hernia repair was studied. DIS comprises the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Pig tissues simulate a ventral hernia with a standardized 5cm defect. Commercially available meshes strengthened with tacks, glue and sutures were used to bridge this defect in an underlay (IPOM) or sublay (retromuscular) position starting with a 5cm overlap in all directions. We tested 35 different ways of ventral hernia repair with up to 425 submaximal intermittent dynamic impacts until mesh dislocation occurred 10 times or a maximum of 4000 impacts each were withstood. The likelihood of a failing repair was related to the mesh, the lubricants, the position, the overlap, the fixation and the tissue quality. Most meshes dislocated easily and required fixation. One of the meshes tested was stable without fixation with a 5cm overlap and failed after reducing the overlap. Phospholipids exerted a strong influence on the biomaterial tested. The sublay position was about 10% more durable in comparison to the IPOM position. DIS revealed distinct degrees of stability with primarily stable, intermediate and primarily unstable repairs. Based on the DIS results available, the currently used ventral hernia repair options can be classified. In the future, DIS investigations can improve the durability of hernia repair.","Kallinowski, Friedrich; Baumann, Elena; Harder, Felix; Siassi, Michael; Mahn, Axel; Vollmer, Matthias; Morlock, Michael M",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.09.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476761/,160

161697,The COVID-19 Curriculum.,2020-05-14,"INTRODUCTION The covid-19 pandemic has meant a change in working protocols, as well as in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Obstetricians have had to adapt quickly to these changes without knowing how they affected their clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate how COVID-19 pandemic and PPE can affect operative time, operating room time, transfer into the operating room to delivery time and skin incision to delivery time in cesarean section. METHODS This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Women with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection having a cesarean section after March 7th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study. For each woman with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, a woman who had a cesarean section for the same indication during the COVID-19 pandemic and with similar clinical history but not affected by SARS-CoV-2 was included. RESULTS 42 cesarean sections were studied. The operating room time was longer in the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected women: 90 (73.0 to 110.0) versus 61 (48.0 to 70.5) minutes; p < .001. The transfer into the operating room to delivery time was longer, but not statistically significant, in urgent cesarean sections in COVID-19 confirmed or suspected women: 25.5 (17.5 to 31.75) versus 18.0 (10.0 to 26.25) minutes; p = .113. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in the operative time, transfer into the operating room to delivery time and skin incision to delivery time when wearing PPE in cesarean section. The COVID-19 pandemic and the use of PPE resulted in a significant increase in operating room time.","Cuerva, Marcos Javier; Carbonell, María; Martín Palumbo, Giovanna; Lopez Magallon, Sara; De La Calle, María; Bartha, José Luis","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1793324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662314/,160
161737,Problematization educational intervention to promote healthy habits in elderly people with diabetes: randomized clinical trial.,2020,"Sialic acids (Sia) are the primary receptors for influenza viruses and are widely displayed on cell surfaces and in secreted mucus. Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including α2-3 or α2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes N-glycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. (241 words)IMPORTANCESialic acids (Sia) are involved in numerous different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably among between different animals, and their inhibitory effects on IAV NA and HA activities and on bacterial sialidases (neuraminidases) suggest a host-variable protective role in secreted mucus.","Barnard, Karen N; Alford-Lawrence, Brynn K; Buchholz, David W; Wasik, Brian R; LaClair, Justin R; Yu, Hai; Honce, Rebekah; Ruhl, Stefan; Pajic, Petar; Daugherity, Erin K; Chen, Xi; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey L; Aguilar, Hector C; Varki, Ajit; Parrish, Colin R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01567-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051275/,160

168258,Balancing Public Health and Civil Liberties: Privacy Aspects of Contact-Tracing Technologies,2021,"Motivation For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correct function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy minimization, which imposes strong prior assumptions and is slow to run. Results Here we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data without any thermodynamic assumptions. UFold improves substantially upon previous models, with approximately 10~30% improvement over traditional thermodynamic models and 14% improvement over other learning-based methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.91 on base pair prediction accuracy on an RNA structure prediction benchmark dataset. UFold is also fast with an inference time about 160ms per sequence up to 1600bp length.

169695,Covid-19: The effects of distance learning in Indonesia based on a commognitive perspective,2021,"Background Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States (US) was already facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Overdose deaths continued to surge during the pandemic. To limit COVID-19 spread and to avoid disruptions in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine and methadone, US federal and state agencies granted unprecedented exemptions to existing MOUD guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), including loosening criteria for unsupervised take-home doses. We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on MOUD treatment experiences for providers and patients at an OTP in California. Methods We interviewed 10 providers and 20 patients receiving MOUD. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed all interviews to identify emergent themes. Results Providers discussed clinical decision-making processes and experiences providing take-homes. Implementation of expanded take-home policies was cautious. Providers reported making individualized decisions, using patient factors to decide if benefits outweighed risks of overdose and misuse. Decision-making factors included patient drug use, overdose risk, housing status, and vulnerability to COVID-19. New patient groups started receiving take-homes and providers noted few adverse events. Patients who received take-homes reported increased autonomy and treatment flexibility, which in turn increased likelihood of treatment stabilization and engagement. Patients who remained ineligible for take-homes, usually due to ongoing non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use, desired greater transparency and shared decision-making. Conclusion Federal exemptions in response to COVID-19 led to the unprecedented expansion of access to MOUD take-homes within OTPs. Providers and patients perceived benefits to expanding access to take-homes and experienced few adverse outcomes, suggesting expanded take-home policies should remain post-COVID-19. Future studies should explore whether these findings are generalizable to other OTPs and assess larger samples to quantify patient-level outcomes resulting from expanded take-home policies.","Suen, L.

We thought evaluating the use of RC application in patients at home. Objective: Remote-Control management of cardiac devices in patients at home is safe, effective with patients’ acceptance. Methods: Patients (pts) with pacemakers and defibrillators using CareLink network were offered to participate on up to two home RC sessions. A technician visited the patient’s home and set up a telehealth tablet and a dedicated programmer with modem card and RC software. These devices were connected via a cellular hot spot to the internet. The investigator had a videoconference interview with the pt and instructed the technician to input a randomized session key number to enable the programmer encrypted communication via a third-party host. At this point the investigator had remote-control of the programmer for usual full device function testing and data assessment. Parameters reprogramming was performed as clinically deemed necessary. In all cases a legend regarding the RC session was programmed in the device information field. A patients’ feedback questionnaire was recorded. Results: A total of 58 pts were evaluated for a total of 78 RC sessions. Pacemakers: 45 and 14 ICDs (one pt had 2 devices). There were no complications or communication interruptions once proven stable after the first minute. In 13 sessions the initial interrogation communication was interrupted upon device interrogation requiring to be re-established (sometimes resourcing to an alternative cellular carrier). Clinically driven parameters reprogramming was performed in 22 sessions. Programming of notations regarding RC session were performed in all of them.

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all ≥1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD ≥5.0 Å), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, Siqi; Tian, Chang; Liu, Panpan; Guo, Dongjie; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Yang; Liu, Lijun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349,160

178703,Clinical trial of black seeds against covid – 19 in Kirkuk city/ Iraq,2021,"Background: Collecting lymphatic vessel (CLV) dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previous studies in the tumor necrosis factor-transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model of inflammatory-erosive arthritis have demonstrated reduced joint-draining CLV contractility that correlates with arthritic severity. Clinically, RA patients with active hand arthritis exhibit significantly reduced lymphatic clearance of the web spaces adjacent to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and a reduction in total and basilic-associated CLVs on the dorsal surface of the hand by dynamic near-infrared (NIR) imaging of indocyanine green (ICG). In this pilot study, we assessed direct lymphatic drainage from MCP joints, and aimed to visualize the total lymphatic anatomy using novel dual-agent relaxation contrast magnetic resonance lymphography (DARC-MRL) in the upper extremity of healthy human subjects. Methods: Two healthy male subjects participated in the study. We performed NIR imaging following intra-dermal web space and intra-articular MCP joint injections of ICG to visualize the CLV anatomy on the dorsal surface of the hand and antecubital fossa. Subsequently, we performed conventional or DARC-MRL after intra-dermal web space and intra-articular MCP joint injections of gadolinium to evaluate the total lymphatic anatomy of the upper extremity and compare with NIR-ICG imaging. Results: NIR-ICG imaging demonstrated that web space and MCP lymphatics drain via distinct CLV tributaries. Web space draining CLVs tended to be associated with the cephalic side of the antecubital fossa, while MCP draining CLVs were localized to the basilic side of the forearm. The DARC-MRL methods used in this study did not adequately nullify the contrast in the blood vessels, and limited gadolinium-filled CLVs could be identified. Conclusion: Through the use of NIR-ICG imaging, we found that MCP joints predominantly drain into basilic CLVs in the forearm, which may explain the reduction in basilic-associated CLVs in the hands of RA patients.

In order to enhance the operation of infrastructures, challenges such as supply temperature reduction and load uncertainty with the development of algorithms and technologies are growing. Therefore, traditional control strategies and diagnosis approaches cannot achieve these goals. Accordingly, to address these shortcomings, researchers have developed plenty of innovative methods based on their applications and features. The main purpose of this paper is to review recent publications that include both hard and soft computing implementations such as model predictive control and machine learning algorithms with applications also on both fourth and fifth generation district heating and cooling networks. After introducing traditional approaches, the innovative techniques, accomplished results and overview of the main strengths and weaknesses have been discussed together with a description of the main capabilities of some commercial platforms.","Buffa, Simone Mohammad Hossein Fouladfar Franchini Giuseppe Ismael Lozano Gabarre Manuel Andrés Chicote",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11010455,160
178806,The state and tourism in Brazil: analysis of public policies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established the polygenic nature of PTSD. To date, only four distinct genome-wide significant loci have been identified in the (largest) meta-analysed GWAS of Million Veteran Program and PGC-PTSD case-control of European ancestry. Given the complex genetic architecture and polygenic nature of the disease, multi-omics analysis can elucidate further on the disease aetiology and risk prediction. Here, we present a multi-omics pipeline that leverages the power of largescale GWAS and our multi-omics datasets of war veterans to robustly identify disease-associated loci, methylation biomarkers and genes. Methods: The multi-omics pipeline involves imputation-based and conventional methylome-wide association analyses to discover the genetically regulated methylation sites (CpGs) and genetic loci associated with PTSD risk. First, we use the imputation-based approach to identify the differentially methylated (DM) CpGs followed by differential methylation analysis of PTSD cases and controls to validate the predicted DM CpGs. Downstream analyses include further characterisation of identified CpGs, associated genetic loci and genes, via pathway and functional enrichment, and differential expression to provide deeper insights into disease aetiology and underpinning biological mechanisms. Results: Using our pipeline, preliminary imputation-based analysis using PGC-PTSD GWAS summary results (∼200,00 cases and controls) identified 492 CpG sites significantly associated with PTSD risk (P < 0.005), several of which were novel and have not been previously reported to be associated with PTSD. Pathway analysis of the associated 254 genes identified 24 significant pathways (FDR < 0.05). Top pathways included regulation of RAC1 activity, signalling by G protein-coupled receptor, signaling by GTPases, endochondral ossification and purine metabolism. Discussion: More than 70% of adults worldwide experience an extreme, life-threatening stress at some time in their lives. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental illness which can occur as a consequence of exposure to traumatic events. Additionally, with the current Covid-19 pandemic, the prevalence of PTSD is increasingly seen among first responders, healthcare workers, young adults, and general population due to quarantine. Our multi-omics pipeline by leveraging the power of largescale GWAS results, pre-built methylation prediction models and multi-omics data, has the potential to overcome current GWAS limitations to identify novel PTSD risk loci, biomarkers and genes that can guide in diagnosis and treatment.

Forty-seventh report of the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.,1998,"A close interaction between the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system of an individual results in a diverse clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. While adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance, the innate immune cells, such as macrophages, may contribute, in some cases, to the disease progression. Macrophages have shown a significant production of IL-6 suggesting they may contribute to the excessive inflammation in COVID-19 disease. Macrophage Activation Syndrome may further explain the high serum levels of CRP, which are normally lacking in viral infections. In adaptive immune responses, it has been revealed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exhibit functional exhaustion patterns, such as the expression of NKG2A, PD-1, and TIM-3. Since SARS-CoV-2 restrains antigen presentation by downregulating MHC class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role. Specific IgA response appears to be stronger and more persistent than IgM response. Moreover, IgM and IgG antibodies show similar dynamics in COVID-19 disease.","Paces, J; Strizova, Z; Smrz, D; Cerny, J",Physiological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32469225/,160

188915,Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19.,2020-07-16,"INTRODUCTION During recent months, reports describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in China, Italy, and the United States have been published. Military veterans represent another unique population affected by COVID-19. This report summarizes the demographics and baseline clinical comorbidities in veterans testing positive for COVID-19 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. METHODS Patient evaluations were conducted at the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin between March 11, 2020 and June 1, 2020. Patient demographics, baseline comorbidities, home medications, presenting symptoms, and outcomes were obtained via electronic medical record. RESULTS Ninety-five patients (88 men, 7 women) tested positive for COVID-19 and were evaluated. Fourteen required mechanical ventilation; 50 and 31 patients were treated in the hospital without ventilation or were discharged to home isolation, respectively. Discharged patients were younger than patients hospitalized. Most patients with COVID-19 were African American (63.2%). Patients whose disease progressed to mechanical ventilation had, on admission, more dyspnea, higher heart and respiratory rates, and lower oxygen saturation than other patients. COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation had a longer length of stay and higher mortality than other groups and were more likely to have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia than patients who were discharged to home quarantine (85.7% and 78.6% vs 48.4% and 45.2%, respectively; P < 0.05 for each). CONCLUSION COVID-19-positive veterans are predominantly African American men with hypertension and hyperlipidemia receiving beta blockers or ACEi/ARB. COVID-19-positive veterans who presented with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia were more likely to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, had longer hospital length-of-stay, and experienced greater mortality than comparison groups.","Ebert, Thomas J; Dugan, Shannon; Barta, Lauren; Gordon, Brian; Nguyen-Ho, Calvin; Pagel, Paul S",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428834/,160

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been used often in the last decade as treatment for morbid obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate modifications in the male reproductive hormone profile after LSG. PATIENTS AND METHODS The prospective study included 28 males with body mass index (BMI) 35 kg m2 who underwent LSG.Total Testosterone (TT), Sex Hormone Binding Globulin(SHBG) and Luteinizing hormone (LH), together with biochemical and anthropometric data, were evaluated at baseline and after LSG. RESULTS Baseline patients had a mean BMI of 50.10 (+-11.19)kg m2, SHBG 23.37 (+-17.47) nmol L, LH 3.83 (+-1.76)mUI ml and TT 8.31 (+-3.24) nmol L. After LSG, patients showed a mean BMI of 35.87 (+-7.02) kg m2 (p 0.001),SHBG 37.81 (+-18.95) nmol L (p 0.05), LH 4.76 (+-2.49)mUI ml (p 0.05), whereas mean TT was 12.7 (Â+-3.8) nmol L(p 0.001). The percentage of excess body weight loss (%EBL)was 43.07 (+-9.56) and metabolic syndrome prevalence decreased significantly from 75% to 25% (p 0.001).

Rapidly evolving RNA viruses present a challenge for diagnosis because they accumulate mutations that may render them undetectable. To explore the effect of sequence variations on assay performance, we generated every possible single point mutation within the target region of the widely used TaqMan assay for WNV and found that the TaqMan assay failed to detect 47% of possible single nucleotide variations in the probe-binding site and was unable to detect any targets with more than two mutations. In response, we developed and validated a less expensive assay with the intercalating dye SYBR green. The SYBR green-based assay was as sensitive as the TaqMan assay for WNV. Importantly, it detected 100% of possible WNV target region variants. The assay developed here adds an additional layer of protection to guard against false-negative results that result from natural variations or drug-directed selection and provides a rapid means to identify such variants for subsequent detailed analysis.","Papin, James F; Vahrson, Wolfgang; Dittmer, Dirk P",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070997/,160

METHODS Bats were diagnosed as positive for rabies using the fluorescent antibody test and mouse inoculation test. The isolates were characterized antigenically using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies. The samples were also genetically analyzed by partial sequencing of the portion of nucleoprotein gene between positions 1157 and 1445 nt. RESULTS Analysis of the results verified that the sample isolated from the species M. molossus presented antigenic variant 6, while the other two samples showed a different profile from that established in the panel, one not previously reported in the literature. The results of genetic analysis revealed that the M. molossus sample segregated with Lasiurus sp. isolates, M. neglectus segregated with a subgroup of Eptesicus furinalis isolates and the Myotis riparius sample segregated with Myotis sp. isolates.

What should hospitals do?,2020-09-11,"The consequences of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can be severe. Disease can be localized to skin, eye and mouth (SEM disease), involve the central nervous system (CNS) or manifest as disseminated infection involving multiple organs. Most surviving infants in the latter two categories have neurological sequelae, and the mortality rate in the absence of therapy is very high (80%) for babies in the latter category. The International Herpes Management Forum (IHMF) has produced guidelines on the diagnosis, prevention and effective management of neonatal herpes. Neonatal herpes may occur in the absence of skin lesions, so if the infection is suspected, swabs of the oropharynx, conjunctiva, rectum, skin lesions, mucosal lesions and urine should be promptly taken and submitted for virus culture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of HSV DNA. Evidence for disseminated or CNS infection should be sought using liver function tests, complete blood cell count, CSF analysis and chest X-ray, if respiratory abnormalities are present. Neonates with suspected HSV infection should be treated with intravenous aciclovir (20 mg/kg) every 8 h for 21 days. If disease is localized to the SEM, treatment should be limited to 14 days. The neutrophil count for children receiving intravenous aciclovir should be monitored. If the absolute neutrophil count falls below 500/mm3, decreasing the aciclovir dose or administering granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) should be considered. At the end of therapy in CNS and disseminated disease, PCR assessment of CSF should be used and treatment continued if the child remains PCR positive at this site.","Kimberlin, David",Herpes : the journal of the IHMF,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15319092/,160

Clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, dyspnea, sneezing. ataxia, and paresis. Variable nonspecific changes included leukocytosis, monocytosis, moderate left shift of neutrophils, moderate hypercalcemia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperglobulinemia. Thoracic radiographs revealed interstitial and alveolar changes, consolidation or collapse of a lung lobe, bullae formation, and a pulmonary mass. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) serology for Blastomyces dermatitidis was performed in five felids and was positive in three. The tiger had cerebral blastomycosis and was positive for AGID serologic tests of both cerebrospinal fluid and serum.

200476,Out of Africa: A Solidarity-Based Approach to Vaccine Allocation,2021,"The Parapoxvirus Orf virus represents a promising candidate for novel vector vaccines due to its immune modulating properties even in nonpermissive hosts such as mouse or rat. The highly attenuated Orf virus strain D1701 was used to generate a recombinant virus (D1701-VrVp40) expressing nucleoprotein p40 of Borna disease virus, which represents a major antigen for the induction of a Borna disease virus-specific humoral and cellular immune response. Infection with Borna disease virus leads to distinct neurological symptoms mediated by the invasion of activated specific CD8+ T cells into the infected brain. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. In the present study we show for the first time that intramuscular application of the D1701-VrVp40 recombinant protected rats against Borna disease, and importantly, virus clearance from the infected brain was demonstrated in immunized animals. Even 4 and 8 months after the last immunization, all immunized animals were still protected against the disease. Initial characterization of the immune cells attracted to the infected brain areas suggested that D1701-VrVp40 mediated induction of B cells and antibody-producing plasma cells as well as T cells. These findings suggest the induction of various defense mechanisms against Borna disease virus. First studies on the role of antiviral cytokines indicated that D1701-VrVp40 immunization did not lead to an enhanced early response of gamma or alpha interferon or tumor necrosis factor alpha. Collectively, this study describes the potential of the Orf virus vector system in mediating long-lasting, protective antiviral immunity and eliminating this persistent virus infection without provoking massive neuronal damage.","Henkel, Marco; Planz, Oliver; Fischer, Timo; Stitz, Lothar; Rziha, Hanns-Joachim",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15596826/,160

The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected.

207707,Strategic management as adaptation to changes in the ecosystems of public hospitals in Israel,2020,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that act as a bridge between innate immunity and adaptive immunity. After activation, DCs differentiate into subtypes with different functions, at which point they upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and produce various cytokines and chemokines. Activated DCs also process antigens for presentation to T cells and regulate the differentiation and function of T cells to modulate the immune state of the body. Non-coding RNAs, RNA transcripts that are unable to encode proteins, not only participate in the pathological mechanisms of autoimmune-related diseases but also regulate the function of immune cells in these diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of non-coding RNAs contributes to DC differentiation, functions, and so on, consequently producing effects in various autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarize the main non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs) that regulate DCs in pathological mechanisms and have tremendous potential to give rise to novel therapeutic targets and strategies for multiple autoimmune diseases and immune tolerance-related diseases.","Liu, Yifeng; Wang, Xiaoze; Yang, Fan; Zheng, Yanyi; Ye, Tinghong; Yang, Li",Front Immunol,,160

Valid near-term projections of cases are required to inform the escalation, maintenance and de-escalation of public health measures, and for short-term health care resource planning. METHODS: Near-term case and epidemic growth rate projections for Canada were estimated using three phenomenological models: the logistic model, Generalized Richard's model (GRM) and a modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, these models have been validated against official national epidemiological data on an ongoing basis. RESULTS: The best-fit models estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases predicted to be reported in Canada as of April 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 would be 11,156 (90 % prediction interval: 9,156-13,905) and 54,745 (90 % prediction interval: 54,252-55,239). The three models varied in their projections and their performance over the first seven weeks of their implementation. Both the logistic model and GRM under-predicted cases reported a week following the projection date in nearly all instances. The logistic model performed best at the early stages, the m-IDEA model performed best at the later stages, and the GRM performed most consistently during the full period assessed. CONCLUSIONS: All three models have yielded qualitatively comparable near-term forecasts of cases and epidemic growth for Canada. Under or over-estimation of projected cases and epidemic growth by these models could be associated with changes in testing policies and/or public health measures. Simple forecasting models can be invaluable in projecting the changes in trajectory of subsequent waves of cases to provide timely information to support the pandemic response.","Smith, Ben A; Bancej, Christina; Fazil, Aamir; Mullah, Muhammad; Yan, Ping; Zhang, Shenghai",Epidemics,,160

Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. Methods: This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The cross-sectional study data was collected using an online survey following the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with some other basic information collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of socio-demographic and media specific factors on anxiety and depression. Results: The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores. Conclusion: This study indicated that higher media consumption was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Worldwide it should be acknowledged that excessive media consumption, particularly social media relating to COVID-19, can have an effect on mental health. However, as this was a cross-sectional study we cannot infer any directionality as we cannot infer cause and effect; therefore, future research involving longitudinal data collection and analyses of variables over time is warranted.","Neill, Ruth D; Blair, Carolyn; Best, Paul; McGlinchey, Emily; Armour, Cherie",Z Gesundh Wiss,,160
217247,"Untangling the Inherited IRA Rules, Part II: Certified Public Accountant",2021,"We investigated the geographical character of the COVID-19 infection in China and correlated it with satellite- and ground-based measurements of air quality. Controlling for population density, we found more viral infections in those prefectures (U.S. county equivalent) afflicted by high Carbon Monoxide, Formaldehyde, PM 2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. When summarizing the results at a greater administrative level, we found that the 10 provinces (U.S. state equivalent) with the highest rate of mortality by COVID-19, were often the most polluted but not the most densely populated. Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for the incidence of this disease, despite the conventionally apprehended influence of human mobility on disease dynamics from the site of first appearance, Wuhan. The raw correlations reported here should be interpreted in a broader context, accounting for the growing evidence reported by several other studies. These findings warn communities and policymakers on the implications of long-term air pollution exposure as an ecological, multi-scale public health issue.","Pansini, Riccardo; Fornacca, Davide",Front Public Health,,160

RECENT FINDINGS: Risk assessment tools can assist surgeons and other healthcare providers in identifying the benefit-risk ratio of surgical candidates. These tools gather demographic, medical history, and other pertinent patient-reported measures to calculate a probability utilizing regression or machine learning statistical foundations. Currently, much is still unknown about the use of these tools to predict quality of life, disability, and other factors following spine surgery. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines that identified risk assessment tools that utilized patient-reported outcome measures as part of the calculation. From 8128 identified studies, 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were accepted into this review. The range of c-index values reported in the studies was between 0.63 and 0.84, indicating fair to excellent model performance. Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes were identified in the following categories (n = total number of predictive models): return to work (n = 3), pain (n = 9), physical functioning and disability (n = 5), quality of life (QOL) (n = 6), and psychosocial disposition (n = 2). Our review has synthesized the available evidence on risk assessment tools for predicting patient-centered outcomes in patients undergoing spine surgery and described their findings and clinical utility.","White, Hannah J; Bradley, Jensyn; Hadgis, Nicholas; Wittke, Emily; Piland, Brett; Tuttle, Brandi; Erickson, Melissa; Horn, Maggie E",,,160

This article addresses: 1) why Covid-19 specifically targets the modalities of smell and possibly taste and what is the mechanism 2) what is the frequency of smell and taste loss and, 3) what is the overall prognosis. It is suggested that mouth breathers may be at particular risk of Covid-19. Symptom-based questionnaires are likely to under-estimate the prevalence of chemosensory impairment by as much as 50%. The prevalence of smell loss is so high that a person who has normal olfaction on formal testing is unlikely to be infected significantly with Cov-2. Furthermore, someone without symptoms who has an abnormal smell test could still be infected and liable to spread the disease. Brief, low cost, olfactory tests are available that would permit a high throughput in field stations and airports. A normal result might obviate the need for a nasopharyngeal swab for the Cov-2 virus.","Hawkes, Christopher H",QJM,,160

The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in characterizing myocardial damage in active COVID-19 patients, through the correlation between qualitative and quantitative imaging biomarkers with clinical and laboratory evidence of myocardial injury. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we enrolled 27 patients with diagnosis of active COVID-19 and suspected cardiac involvement, referred to our institution for CMR between March 2020 and January 2021. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, including high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), and CMR imaging data were obtained. Relationships between CMR parameters, clinical and laboratory findings were explored. Comparisons were made with age-, sex- and risk factor-matched control group of 27 individuals, including healthy controls and patients without other signs or history of myocardial disease, who underwent CMR examination between January 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR examination was 20 (13.5-31.5) days. Hs-cTnT values were collected within 24 h prior to CMR and resulted abnormally increased in 18 patients (66.6%). A total of 20 cases (74%) presented tissue signal abnormalities, including increased myocardial native T1 (n = 11), myocardial T2 (n = 14) and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) (n = 10), late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (n = 12) or pericardial enhancement (n = 2). A CMR diagnosis of myocarditis was established in 9 (33.3%), pericarditis in 2 (7.4%) and myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in 3 (11.11%) patients. T2 mapping values showed a moderate positive linear correlation with Hs-cTnT (r = 0.58; p = 0.002). A high degree positive linear correlation between ECV and Hs-cTnT was also found (r 0.77; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CMR allows in vivo recognition and characterization of myocardial damage in a cohort of selected COVID-19 individuals by means of a multiparametric scanning protocol including conventional imaging and T1-T2 mapping sequences. Abnormal T2 mapping was the most commonly abnormality observed in our cohort and positively correlated with hs-cTnT values, reflecting the predominant edematous changes characterizing the active phase of disease.","Galea, Nicola; Marchitelli, Livia; Pambianchi, Giacomo; Catapano, Federica; Cundari, Giulia; Birtolo, Lucia Ilaria; Maestrini, Viviana; Mancone, Massimo; Fedele, Francesco; Catalano, Carlo; Francone, Marco",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,,160

We conducted an ecological study aimed at identifying predictors of early introduction, incidence rates of COVID-19 and mortality (up to 8 May 2020) among 604 municipalities in inner São Paulo State, Brazil. Socio-demographic indexes, road distance to the state capital and a classification of regional relevance were included in predictive models for time to COVID-19 introduction (Cox regression), incidence and mortality rates (zero-inflated binomial negative regression). In multivariable analyses, greater demographic density and higher classification of regional relevance were associated with both early introduction and increased rates of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Other predictive factors varied, but distance from the State Capital (São Paulo City) was negatively associated with time-to-introduction and with incidence rates of COVID-19. Our results reinforce the hypothesis of two patterns of geographical spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection: one that is spatial (from the metropolitan area into the inner state) and another which is hierarchical (from urban centres of regional relevance to smaller and less connected municipalities). Those findings may apply to other settings, especially in developing and highly heterogeneous countries, and point to a potential benefit from strengthening non-pharmaceutical control strategies in areas of greater risk.","Fortaleza, C M C B; Guimarães, R B; de Almeida, G B; Pronunciate, M; Ferreira, C P",Epidemiol Infect,,160

Globally, access was 58% lower in April than in February 2020. Strategies to improve osteoporosis care, with greater use of fracture risk assessments, offer a partial solution. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant detrimental impact on the management of chronic diseases including osteoporosis. We have quantified the global impact by examining changes in the usage of online FRAX fracture risk assessments before and after the declaration of the pandemic (11 March 2020). METHODS: The study comprised a retrospective analysis using GoogleAnalytics data on daily sessions on the FRAX® website ( www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX ) from November 2019 to April 2020 (main analysis period February-April 2020), and the geographical source of that activity. RESULTS: Over February-April 2020, the FRAX website recorded 460,495 sessions from 184 countries, with 210,656 sessions in February alone. In March and April, the number of sessions fell by 23.1% and 58.3% respectively, a pattern not observed over the same period in 2019. There were smaller reductions in Asia than elsewhere, partly related to earlier and less-marked nadirs in some countries (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam). In Europe, the majority of countries (24/31, 77.4%) reduced usage by at least 50% in April. Seven countries showed smaller reductions (range - 2.85 to - 44.1%) including Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Finland. There was no significant relationship between the reduction in FRAX usage and measures of disease burden such as COVID-attributed deaths per million of the population. CONCLUSION: This study documents a marked global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of osteoporosis as reflected by FRAX online fracture risk assessments. The analysis suggests that impact may relate to the societal and healthcare measures taken to ameliorate the pandemic.","McCloskey, E V; Harvey, N C; Johansson, H; Lorentzon, M; Vandenput, L; Liu, E; Kanis, J A",Osteoporos Int,,160

The primary endpoint was to determine the Hb cutoff between 24 and 30 gestational weeks that is predictive of anemia at delivery by using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Independent risk factors for anemia at delivery were assessed using stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Hb and infrequent iron supplement treatment were independent risk factors for anemia at delivery (OR 0.3 95%CI [0.2-0.4] and OR 2.4 95%CI [1.2-4.8], respectively; C statistics 83%).

We specifically focus on children with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with asthma, CF, and lung transplant recipients do not appear to have an increased risk of morbidity or mortality with COVID-19 infection compared to the general pediatric population. Data does not support the change or withdrawal of any asthma or CF maintenance medications; however, does advocate for the cessation of aerosolized medications whenever possible to minimize transmission risk. It may not be necessary to adjust immunosuppressive therapy when managing COVID-19 in pediatric lung transplant patients. Mechanisms of infection in airway epithelial cells in children may differ from adults, resulting in a milder phenotype. SUMMARY: Current data about pediatric patients with chronic lung disease infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is promising but remains scarce. Additional study is needed to definitively understand the complex interplay of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the airway of children with chronic lung disease, how it differs from adults, and how best to manage the symptoms of acute infection.","Palla, John; Laguna, Theresa A",Curr Opin Pediatr,,160
251207,No evidence supports the use of ether and chloroform inhalation for treating COVID-19,2020,"RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from positive-stranded RNA viruses has always been a hot target for designing of new drugs. Major class of drugs that are targeted against RdRP are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides (NTPs) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the RdRP has been presented here. RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Unfortunately, vitamin C has been associated with glucose measurement interference and thus this study highlights the elevated levels of blood glucose correlated with the presence of vitamin C interference. METHODOLOGY: Thirty samples were selected randomly and the blood glucose were measured prior and post the addition of spiked standard concentrations of vitamin C. The interference of vitamin C with glucose readings in COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and observed employing the Auto Chemistry Analyzer machine. RESULTS: The addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) standards (spikes) into the isolated samples shows a correlated increment in the reading measures. Thereafter, the increments of Random Blood Sugar (RBS) readings after being spiked with the vitamin C standards shows a logarithmic correlation with good interesting R-squared (R2 = 0.9921). CONCLUSIONS: The authors find that the presence of vitamin C in blood actively and significantly alters the glucose level readings especially with the highly consumption of vitamin C during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Obaidi, Zaid Mahdi Jaber; Hussain, Yasmeen Ali; Ali, Alaa A; Al-Rekabi, Mohammed Dakhil",J Infect Dev Ctries,,160

261409,Between Crisis and Convention: How Should We Address Contingency?,2020,"PURPOSE: This descriptive investigation was undertaken at three oncology units to report queries, needs, and fears related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) of patients with cancer and to avoid uncontrolled treatment delays or withdrawal, behavioral mistakes, and panic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS: The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results. In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.","Gebbia, Vittorio; Piazza, Dario; Valerio, Maria Rosaria; Borsellino, Nicolò; Firenze, Alberto",JCO Glob Oncol,,160

262256,COVID-19 and Youth in Detention,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 named as COVID-19 imposing a huge burden on public health as well as global economies, is caused by a new strain of betacoronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2. The high transmission rate of the virus has resulted in current havoc which highlights the need for a fast and effective approach either to prevent or treat the deadly infection. Development of vaccines can be the most prominent approach to prevent the virus to cause COVID-19 and hence will play a vital role in controlling the spread of the virus and reducing mortality. The virus uses its spike proteins for entering into the host by interacting with a specific receptor called angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) present on the surface of alveolar cells in the lungs. Researchers all over the world are targeting the spike protein for the development of potential vaccines. Here, we discuss the immunopathological basis of vaccine designing that can be approached for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 infection and different platforms that are being used for vaccine development. We believe this review will increase our understanding of the vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently contribute to the control of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Also, it gives an insight into the current status of vaccine development and associated outcomes reported at different phases of trial.","Rawat, Kajal; Kumari, Puja; Saha, Lekha",Eur J Pharmacol,,160

The aim of the present article was to review the properties of montelukast that could be beneficial in COVID-19. Ten experimentally supported properties were retrieved, either related to SARS-CoV-2 (antiviral properties, prevention of endotheliitis and of neurological disorders linked to SARS-CoV-2), and/or related to the host (improvement of atherogenic vascular inflammation, limitation of the ischemia/reperfusion phenomenon, improvement of respiratory symptoms), and/or related to serious COVID-19 outcomes (limitation of the cytokine storm, mitigation of acute respiratory distress syndrome), and/or related to tissue sequelae (antioxidant properties, anti-fibrosis effects).

285625,"Disparities in Education: E-Learning and COVID-19, Who Matters?",2020,"Introduction: Lemierre's syndrome is an extremely rare disease that generally occurs in young, healthy adults and is characterized by oropharyngeal infection followed by septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. We present a case of COVID-19 infection complicated by acute mastoiditis with concomitant Lemierre's syndrome. Case Presentation: A 57-year-old male with obesity and asthma presented with worsening dyspnea after diagnosis of COVID-19 three days prior. The patient was febrile to 101 degrees Fahrenheit and hypoxemic requiring 15 liters supplemental oxygen. CT chest showed severe multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities and initial blood cultures were negative. He received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma but clinical status deteriorated with progression of respiratory and renal failure. The patient was eventually intubated and a left internal jugular central venous catheter was placed for renal replacement therapy. Hospital course was further complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR, for which amiodarone and heparin infusions were started. Four days later, the patient developed intermittent fevers and was found to have Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteremia. Doppler ultrasound showed thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein consistent with Lemierre's syndrome. Physical exam did not exhibit neck edema, induration or dental infection, but CT head and chest revealed acute bilateral mastoiditis and new right upper lobe abscess. Despite removal of internal jugular venous catheter, continued anticoagulation, and initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed worsening multiorgan failure and septic shock requiring vasopressors. He ultimately underwent PEA arrest and did not survive resuscitation. Discussion: Lemierre's syndrome is a rare condition with an estimated worldwide incidence of one in 1 million and a high mortality between 5% to 18%. The most common pathogen is Fusobacterium necrophorum. Moreover, our patient had elevated risk of thrombosis from COVID-19 and a recently placed central venous catheter. As providers increasingly care for patients with COVID-19, early recognition and management of this rare complication is paramount to reduce mortality. Fusobacterium bacteremia should lead to a high index of suspicion for timely diagnosis and treatment of Lemierre's syndrome.","Wang, J.; Young, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,160

While many factors contribute to environmental injustices, Pb is particularly insidious, and is associated with cardio-vascular, kidney, and immune dysfunctions and is a leading cause of premature death worldwide. Here, we present a revised analysis from the New Orleans dataset of soil lead (SPb) and children's blood Pb (BPb), which was systematically assembled for 2000-2005 and 2011-2016. We show the spatial-temporal inequities in SPb, children's BPb, racial composition, and household income in New Orleans. Comparing medians for the inner city with outlying areas, soil Pb is 7.5 or 9.3 times greater, children's blood Pb is ~2 times higher, and household income is lower. Between 2000-2005 and 2011-2016, a BPb decline occurred. Long-standing environmental and socioeconomic Pb exposure injustices have positioned Black populations at extreme risk of adverse health consequences. Given the overlapping health outcomes of Pb exposure with co-morbidities for conditions such as COVID-19, we suggest that further investigation be conducted on Pb exposure and pandemic-related mortality rates, particularly among Black populations. Mapping and remediating invisible environmental Pb provides a path forward for preventing future populations from developing a myriad of Pb-related health issues.","Egendorf, Sara Perl; Mielke, Howard W; Castorena-Gonzalez, Jorge A; Powell, Eric T; Gonzales, Christopher R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,160
291974,On the COVID-19 pandemic and the health model in Colombia,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The NHS Health Check aims to identify individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among the adult population in England. The Health Check includes calculation of CVD risk and discussion of pharmacological and lifestyle approaches to manage risk, including referral to lifestyle support services. The programme is commissioned by Local Authorities (LAs) and is delivered by a range of different providers in different settings. There is significant variation in activity, with uptake ranging from 25% to 85% in different areas, and clear evidence of variation in implementation and delivery practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to understand how the NHS Health Check programme works in different settings, for different groups, so that we can recommend improvements to maximise intended outcomes. To do so, we will undertake a realist review and a survey of LA public health teams. Our review will follow Pawson's five iterative stages: (1) locate existing theories, (2) search for evidence, (3) article selection, (4) extract and organise data and (5) synthesise evidence and draw conclusions. Our review will include documents describing local implementation alongside published research studies. We will recruit a stakeholder group (including Public Health England, commissioners and providers of Health Checks, plus members of the public and patients) to advise us throughout. Our survey will be sent to all 152 LAs in England to gather detailed information on programme delivery (including COVID-19-related changes) and available referral services. This will enable us to map delivery across England and relate these data to programme outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this review. For the survey, we have received approval from the University of Kent Research Ethics Committee. Our findings will be used to develop recommendations on tailoring, implementation and design strategies to improve delivery of the NHS Health Check in different settings, for different groups.

292755,When is it safe to return to exercise post-COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize challenges and benefits to the use of tele-medicine for the treatment of pediatric orthopedic patients during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A novel survey was sent to all faculty members at an academic pediatric orthopedic practice in New York City regarding their use of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Faculty members performed 227 unique tele-health visits with pediatric orthopedic patients over a 7-week period in early 2020, and this formed the basis for responses to the survey. The results of the faculty survey suggest that telemedicine has substantial clinical benefits for pediatric orthopedic surgeons and our patients that extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers recognize the limits of conducting physical exams over telemedicine and should always use clinical judgment when evaluating patients, par-ticularly trauma patients who may require prompt referral for additional care. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to provide pediatric orthopedic care through telemedicine has allowed us to safely evaluate and treat pediatric patients with musculoskeletal problems in New York City and its environs despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficient evaluation of both new and exist-ing pediatric orthopedic patients via telehealth is viable. Physical examination is the most challenging aspect of the physician-patient encounter to replicate virtually. Targeted educational efforts for patients and their families before the visit about what to expect and how to prepare improves efficiency with virtual pediatric orthopedic visits. Efforts to limit disparities in access to telemedicine will be needed to allow all pediatric orthopedic patients to participate in telemedicine equitably.","Carter, Cordelia W.; Herrero, Christina P.; Bloom, David A.; Karamitopoulos, Mara; Castañeda, Pablo G.",Bull Hosp Jt Dis (2013),,160

296164,2020 and the prospect of a ‘COVID Christmas’,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York State ordered the suspension of all elective surgeries to increase intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity. Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions), and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n=1,232,986/n=12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5 year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n=1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n=165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n=345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n=722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n=323,789/n=1,232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n=20,652), 32.8% (n=106,186) and 60.8% (n=196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n=2496/n=3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions. More work is needed to better understand how best to maximize ICU capacity for pandemics requiring heavy use of critical care resources.","Poeran, Jashvant; Zhong, Haoyan; Wilson, Lauren; Liu, Jiabin; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",,,160

In this study, in relation to the pandemic, psychological distress, sleep quality and affecting factors in adults were examined. METHODS: Using the convenience sampling method, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questionnaires to determine psychological distress levels and sociodemographic characteristics were distributed online to 405 participants. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score of the participants was 34.55 ± 8.07, while their mean sleep quality score was 6.39 ± 3.31. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.1%. The psychological distress scores were higher among the men than the women, married participants than single ones, those with children than those without children and those who were employed than those who were not. The sleep quality of the single participants and the participants with low education levels was poorer. The sleep quality of those who left work in the pandemic period was poorer than those who were working from home/office and those who were already not employed before the pandemic. The sleep quality of those not working in the field of health was better than healthcare professionals and those not working at all. The scores for psychological distress were positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with sleep quality levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological distress and sleep quality of adults.

We have performed molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations of tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin at the interface of zwitterionic phospholipid bilayers. In this work, we will review recent computer simulation developments and report microscopic properties, such as the area per lipid and thickness of the membranes, atomic radial distribution functions, angular orientations, and free energy landscapes of small molecule binding to the membrane. Cholesterol affects the behaviour of the small molecules, which are mainly buried in the interfacial regions. We have observed a competition between the binding of small molecules to phospholipids and cholesterol through lipidic hydrogen-bonds. Free energy barriers that are associated to translational and orientational changes of melatonin have been found to be between 10-20 kJ/mol for distances of 1 nm between melatonin and the center of the membrane. Corresponding barriers for tryptophan and serotonin that are obtained from reversible work methods are of the order of 10 kJ/mol and reveal strong hydrogen bonding between such species and specific phospholipid sites. The diffusion of tryptophan and melatonin is of the order of 10-7 cm2/s for the cholesterol-free and cholesterol-rich setups.","Martí, Jordi; Lu, Huixia",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,160

Slovenia has some of the most physically active children globally, and it has responded rapidly to incorporate national physical activity (PA) interventions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite aggressive campaigns to maintain PA at home, the country has seen a tremendous decrease in child physical fitness over the past several months as self-isolation measures have been mandated by national authorities. These trends prompted researchers to create a method of tracking and communicating government decisions which have a direct impact on child physical activity, fitness and overall health (i.e., the SLOfit Barometer). The research team assembled experts for consultation on creation of the SLOfit Barometer after processing preliminary data on 20,000 schoolchildren which found the greatest decline in child physical fitness since systematic testing began more than 30 years ago. Only 2 months of self-isolation erased over 10 years of hard-fought health gains acquired from national public health policies and PA interventions. This crisis in child fitness requires integrated community participation and a robust public health policy response, and with the SLOfit Barometer acting as a national bellwether system, it is envisioned that policy makers and the public will advocate for bold, progressive actions to combat this national health emergency. This surveillance tool tracks government action to combat the increasing child physical inactivity and obesity trends brought on as a direct result of COVID-19 isolation regulations.","Jurak, Gregor; Morrison, Shawnda A; Kovac, Marjeta; Leskosek, Bojan; Sember, Vedrana; Strel, Janko; Starc, Gregor",Front Public Health,,160

317431,Men's mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic: is there a mobilization of masculinities?,2021,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the need to find healthcare solutions that boost or support immunity. There is some evidence that high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) controlled vertebral thrusts have the potential to modulate immune mediators. However, the mechanisms of the link between HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts and neuroimmune function and the associated potential clinical implications are less clear. This review aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that can explain the HVLA controlled vertebral thrust--neuroimmune link and discuss what this link implies for clinical practice and future research needs. A search for relevant articles published up until April 2021 was undertaken. Twenty-three published papers were found that explored the impact of HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts on neuroimmune markers, of which eighteen found a significant effect. These basic science studies show that HVLA controlled vertebral thrust influence the levels of immune mediators in the body, including neuropeptides, inflammatory markers, and endocrine markers. This narravtive review discusses the most likely mechanisms for how HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts could impact these immune markers. The mechanisms are most likely due to the known changes in proprioceptive processing that occur within the central nervous system (CNS), in particular within the prefrontal cortex, following HVLA spinal thrusts. The prefrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune system. Bi-directional neuro-immune interactions are affected by emotional or pain-related stress. Stress-induced sympathetic nervous system activity also alters vertebral motor control. Therefore, there are biologically plausible direct and indirect mechanisms that link HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts to the immune system, suggesting HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts have the potential to modulate immune function. However, it is not yet known whether HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts have a clinically relevant impact on immunity. Further research is needed to explore the clinical impact of HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts on immune function.","Haavik, Heidi; Niazi, Imran Khan; Kumari, Nitika; Amjad, Imran; Duehr, Jenna; Holt, Kelly",Medicina (Kaunas),,160
319988,Predicting COVID-19 disease progression and patient outcomes based on temporal deep learning,2021,"Two factors that are often ignored but could play a crucial role in the progression of an infectious disease are the distributions of inherent susceptibility ($\sigma_{inh}$) and external infectivity ($\iota_{ext}$), in a given population. While the former is determined by the immunity of an individual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to the infection. We model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a generalized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the susceptibility and infectivity distributions to understand their combined effects, which appear to remain inadequately addressed till date. We consider the coupling between $\sigma_{inh}$ and $\iota_{ext}$ through a new Critical Infection Parameter (CIP) ($\gamma_c$). We find that the neglect of these distributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation of the amount of infection in a population, which leads to incorrect (higher) estimates of the infections required to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Additionally, we include the effects of seeding of infection in a population by long-range migration. We solve the resulting master equations by performing Kinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our simulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic. The latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of susceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly different from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these additional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating system where the disease cluster survives by migrating from region to region.","Mukherjee, Saumyak; Mondal, Sayantan; Bagchi, Biman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15053v1.pdf,160

323662,Clinical features of 47 patients infected with COVID-19 admitted to a Regional Reference Center,2020,"We present the first results from the 2mm Mapping Obscuration to Reionization (MORA) survey, the largest ALMA contiguous blank-field survey to-date with a total area of 184 sq. arcmin and the only at 2mm to search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We use the 13 sources detected above 5sigma to estimate the first ALMA galaxy number counts at this wavelength. These number counts are then combined with the state-of-the-art galaxy number counts at 1.2mm and 3mm and with a backward evolution model to place constraints on the evolution of the IR luminosity function and dust-obscured star formation in the last 13 billion years. Our results suggest a steep redshift evolution on the space density of DSFGs and confirm the flattening of the IR luminosity function at faint luminosities, with a slope of $\alpha_{LF} = -0.42^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$. We conclude that the dust-obscured component, which peaks at z=2-2.5, has dominated the cosmic history of star formation for the past ~12 billion years, back to z~4. At z=5, the dust-obscured star formation is estimated to be ~35% of the total star formation rate density and decreases to 25%-20% at z=6-7, implying a minor contribution of dust-enshrouded star formation in the first billion years of the Universe. With the dust-obscured star formation history constrained up to the end of the epoch of reionization, our results provide a benchmark to test galaxy formation models, to study the galaxy mass assembly history, and to understand the dust and metal enrichment of the Universe at early times.","Zavala, J.

The present study was designed to assess the therapeutic effects and the possible underlying mechanism of action of Manjarix, a herbal combination composed of ginger and turmeric powder extracts, on chemically induced osteoarthritis in rats. An OA model was generated by intra-articular injection of 50 µL (40 mg mL-1) of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joint of rats. After one week of osteoarthritis induction, a comparison of the anti-inflammatory efficacy of indomethacin at an oral dose of 2 mg kg-1 daily for 4 successive weeks versus five decremental dose levels of Manjarix (1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 mg kg-1) was performed. Serum inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured, along with weekly assessment of the knee joint swelling. Pain-like behavior was assessed and knee radiographic and histological examination were performed to understand the extent of pain due to cartilage degradation. Manjarix significantly reduced the knee joint swelling, decreased the serum levels of IL6, TNF-&#945;, CTX-II and HA, and reduced the pathological injury in joints, with no evidence of osteo-reactivity in the radiographic examination. Manjarix also significantly prevented MIA-induced pain behavior. These results demonstrate that Manjarix exhibits chondroprotective effects and can inhibit the OA pain induced by MIA, and thus it can be used as a potential therapeutic product for OA.","Abdel-Rahman, Rehab F; Abd-Elsalam, Reham M; Amer, Mohammed S; El-Desoky, Ahmed M; Mohamed, Shanaz O",Food funct,,160
332583,COVID-19 pandemic: a health and humanitarian crisis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The high variability of SARS-CoV-2 serological response after COVID-19 infection hampers its use as indicator of the timing of infection. A potential alternative method is the determination of affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, expressed as the SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration and avidity were measured in sera of hospitalized COVID-19 patients sampled at two weeks and &#8805;12 weeks post symptom onset using an in-house developed protocol based on EUROIMMUN (anti-spike) and EDI&#8482; (anti-nucleocapsid) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA protocols. RESULTS: We included 68 confirmed COVID-19 patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both the initial and follow-up specimen sampled at a median of 14 (range 10-18) days and 120 (range 84-189) days, respectively, post symptom onset. The median anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity response was 40% (range 9-93%) and 72% (range 27-104%), respectively, for the first sample, and 66% (range 28-90%) and 57% (range 25-94%), respectively, for the second sample. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity results &#8805;60% was significantly lower for anti-spike compared to anti-nucleocapsid IgG for initial samples (p< 0.01) and vice versa for follow-up samples (p< 0.01). CONCLUSION: Anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG maturation occurs faster and avidity decreases faster than anti-spike IgG, indicating different kinetics of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG. Further, affinity maturation after SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently incomplete.","Heireman, Laura; Boelens, Jerina; Coorevits, Liselotte; Verhasselt, Bruno; Vandendriessche, Stien; Padalko, Elizaveta",Acta Clin Belg,,160

Additionally, data from respiratory specimen analysis from the past year show that current mask mandates established for COVID-19 have inadvertently reduced the rates of other respiratory diseases, including influenza. Thus, the question arises as to whether comparatively mild measures should be kept in place after the pandemic to reduce the impact of influenza. In this study, we employed a series of differential equations to simulate past influenza seasons, assuming people wore face masks. This was achieved by introducing a variable to account for the efficacy and prevalence of masks and then analyzing its impact on influenza transmission rate in an SEIR model fit to the actual past seasons. We then compared influenza rates in this hypothetical scenario with the actual rates over the seasons. Our results show that several combinations of mask efficacy and prevalence can significantly reduce the burden of seasonal influenza. Particularly, our simulations suggest that a minority of individuals wearing masks greatly reduce the number of influenza infections. Considering the efficacy rates of masks and the relatively insignificant monetary cost, we highlight that it may be a viable alternative or complement to influenza vaccinations.

339501,"Challenges and priorities in skeletal, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary and lung scintigraphy during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"In this article I argue that while the COVID-19 outbreak is at its early stages in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal enclave is particularly vulnerable to its effects – not least due to the multiplicity of existing development challenges that have resulted from an ongoing Israeli and Egyptian-imposed blockade. With the economy at a standstill, the Palestinian governing authority has limited financial resources to (re)build key sanitation, hygiene, waste treatment and water supply infrastructure. These (infrastructural) inadequacies, while already a public health concern before the onset of the pandemic, now renders Gaza particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses and diseases. Additionally, the limited movement of goods because of the siege has led to an acute shortage of medical supplies and equipment that are essential for combating a pandemic. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 outbreak is also “unique” in that it presents Gaza with a crisis that has little to do with the hostilities that define the politics of Israel-Palestine. Yet, the potential of a widespread outbreak also lays bare to the development challenges that Gaza faces as a result of the conflict. This, I conclude, provides an opportunity for the donor community to, under pretext of combating the pandemic, remedy some of the consequences of the conflict and siege without having to contend with the (political) stigma of doing so.","Sen, Somdeep",World Dev.,,160

We retrospectively investigated the potential of immunologic parameters as early predictors of COVID-19.METHODSA total of 1018 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in our 2-center retrospective study. Clinical feature, laboratory test, immunological test, radiological findings, and outcomes data were collected. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and survival curves were plotted to evaluate their clinical utility.RESULTSThe counts of all T lymphocyte subsets were markedly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors, especially CD8+ T cells. Among all tested cytokines, IL-6 was elevated most significantly, with an upward trend of more than 10-fold. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, IL-6 levels of more than 20 pg/mL and CD8+ T cell counts of less than 165 cells/µL were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. Groups with IL-6 levels of more than 20 pg/mL and CD8+ T cell counts of less than 165 cells/µL had a higher percentage of older and male patients as well as a higher proportion of patients with comorbidities, ventilation, intensive care unit admission, shock, and death. Furthermore, the receiver operating curve of the model combining IL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell counts (<165 cells/µL) displayed a more favorable discrimination than that of the CURB-65 score. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good fit of the model, with no statistical significance.CONCLUSIONIL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell counts (<165 cells/µL) are 2 reliable prognostic indicators that accurately stratify patients into risk categories and predict COVID-19 mortality.FundingThis work was supported by funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81772477 and 81201848).","Luo, Miao; Liu, Jing; Jiang, Weiling; Yue, Shuang; Liu, Huiguo; Wei, Shuang",JCI insight,,160

361504,5PSQ-155 Assistance pressure in oncohaematological dispensation area during the COVID pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at greater risk of infection during COVID 19 pandemic. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 among healthcare workers at working at Seti Zonal Hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed between April and May 2020 at Seti Zonal Hospital with purposive sampling technique and self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. The demographic characteristics mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers were identified and inferential statistics t-test, ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to show the relationship between variables. RESULTS: A total of 230 healthcare workers (92% response rate) had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8±0.88 and 7.88±1.32, respectively with good knowledge and a low positive attitude. Majority (94.7%) were familiar with the sign and symptoms, agreed that chronic diseases patients and HCWs are at a higher risk (97%) and (87.8%) respectively while knowledge related to COVID 19 vaccination, isolation period and treatment by antibiotics was poor with low positive attitude towards information availability about COVID 19 (41%), government ability to control the epidemic (49%), and the family members might get infection (60%). There was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and attitude scores (r=0.28, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a significant gap in information source, sufficient knowledge and low positive attitude about COVID 19 among health care workers. Greater educational efforts about prevention should be directed to different level of health workers.","Parajuli, Janaki; Mishra, Pradip; Sharma, Seema; Bohora, Krishna Bahadur; Rathour, Pratiksha Singh; Joshi, Jagadish; Kamar, Sher Bahadur; Pandey, Hemaraj; Chaudhary, Ashok",J Nepal Health Res Counc,,160

Despite the significant efforts made in developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs, there is currently no available effective treatment against this new coronavirus infection, hence the need to continue research which is aimed at limiting the progression of this virus. The present study which has as objective to carry out in silico studies on the metabolites of some Cameroonian medicinal plants of the Asteraceae family with a view to propose potential molecules to fight against COVID-19. The selected plants are commonly used to treat respiratory infectious diseases, and for this reason they may contain some constituents which could exhibit an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a set of 74 naturally occurring compounds are computed with SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (PDB ID: 6lu7) and spike protein (PDB ID: 6m0j) for their affinity and stability using binding energy analysis and molecular docking. Chrysoeriol-7-O-ß-D-glucuronopyranoside (compound 16) has showed promising results including excellent Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) parameters as well as insignificant toxicity. Finally, the stability of this compound is complex with the two proteins validated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, they displayed stable trajectory and molecular properties with consistent interaction profile in molecular dynamics simulations. These findings call for further in vitro and in vivo challenges of phytoconstituents against the COVID-19 as a potential agent to fight the spread of this dramatic pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

370744,COVID-19 Pandemic: health professionals' perception about the assistance mentioned in television media,2021,"BackgroundPhase III trials have estimated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. MethodsWe developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. ResultsVE against asymptomatic infection measured by PCR or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias towards underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4 to 77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8 to 80.7) respectively. ConclusionMultiple biases are likely to influence COVID-19 VE estimates, potentially explaining the observed difference between ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. These biases should be considered when interpreting both efficacy and effectiveness study results.","Williams, Lucy R.; Ferguson, Neil M.; Donnelly, Christl A.; Grassly, Nicholas C.",,,160

The current pandemic caused by this coronavirus has already negatively affected millions of people and the economies of countries worldwide. However, the challenges faced by Saudi Arabia during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic that began in 2012 led to marked improvements in the government's response to the current pandemic. Saudi Arabia is one of largest countries in the Middle East and is home to the holiest Muslim sites. Since the global risk of the virus was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia has taken substantial public health measures to control the spread of the infection. This review reports on the transmission of SARS-COV-2 in Saudi Arabia and the proactive responses taken by the government, comparing the Saudi government's actions and their effects with those of other countries. Although Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing the peak of the pandemic, their early precautionary responses have shortened the period of individual/family isolation, reduced the number of confirmed infections and infection-related fatality rates, and decreased the economic burden of the people and the country compared with other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere.","Obied, Dalia A; Alhamlan, Fatimah S; Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A; Al-Ahdal, Mohammed N",J Infect Dev Ctries,,160
375830,COVID-19 with abdominal symptoms and acute abdominal pain: a guide to identification for general practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSI) are the commonest healthcare associated infections. They severely compromise patient safety, are a significant burden on healthcare resources and have an adverse impact on patient quality of life. The incidence of SSIs can be as high as 10% after colorectal procedures. The laparoscopic approach is being increasingly used to undertake colorectal procedures. It provides advantages over the traditional open approach with smaller incisions, shorter hospital stay and equal oncological outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether the laparoscopic approach for colorectal procedures reduces the incidence of SSI compared to the open approach. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two approaches published since 2000 were included in the review. Revman 5.3 software was used to carry out the review. Data were pooled and the results were shown as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals using the fixed effects model. RESULTS: Sixteen RCT's were included in the analysis comprising 5797 patients. These covered a range of colorectal pathologies including colon cancer, rectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Analysis showed significantly lower wound infection rates (RR: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.88, p = 0.001) and lower abdominal abscess rates (RR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.62-1.27, p = 0.51). The combined SSI rate was significantly lower in laparoscopic compared to open surgery (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery significantly lowers the incidence of SSI compared to open surgery.","Kulkarni, N; Arulampalam, T",Tech. coloproctol,,160

More recently, intravenous monoclonal antibody (mAb) combinations have been authorized by the US FDA for emergency use (EUA) for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 including some active against emerging SARS-COV-2 variants of concern (VOC). Easier to administer therapeutics including intramuscular and subcutaneous mAbs and oral antivirals are in clinical trials. Reliable, safe, effective COVID-19 treatment for early infection in the outpatient setting is of urgent and critical importance.

This survey was launched in February 2021 and ran for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose &#8805;7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. The survey was completed by 2002 respondents of whom 26.6% had a prior COVID-19 infection. A prior COVID-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (1.05-1.11)), fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like illness (1.78 (1.51-2.10)), fatigue (1.34 (1.20-1.49)) and local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)). It was also associated with an increased risk of severe side effects leading to hospital care (1.56 (1.14-2.12)). While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 (1.01-1.11)) compared with viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p < 0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine recipients reported a considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR < 0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 (0.31-0.58)). Our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. For the first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with an increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects but more local reactions.","Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Ghrew, Murad; Ustianowski, Andrew; Ahmad, Shazaad; Borrow, Ray; Papavasileiou, Lida Pieretta; Petrakis, Dimitrios; Bakerly, Nawar Diar",,,160

Worldwide, such services are underfunded and under-resourced, and services in Ireland are no different. It is vital that existing services are regularly reviewed for both efficacy and acceptability. Our objective was to review published studies evaluating service user satisfaction with CAMHS in Ireland and CAMHS therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they reported on service user satisfaction or an evaluation of CAMHS in Ireland. RESULTS: From an initial 125 articles identified, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria: four reporting on overall CAMHS satisfaction, three on satisfaction where a specific diagnosis was present, while eight evaluated various interventions offered. Whilst most service users perceived services to be satisfactory, important issues relating to accessibility were present. Evidence of efficacy was present for a small number of interventions, but studies were limited by methodological issues. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of studies evaluating CAMHS in Ireland. The extant literature suggests a positive experience once accessed, but long waiting times and poor collaboration are seen to limit services users' experience. More robust methodologically sound studies are urgently required. Given the expected increased demand linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the resultant compromised financial position, it is essential that scant resources are appropriately directed.","Leahy, D; McNicholas, F",Ir J Psychol Med,,160

393764,Barriers imposed in the relationship between puerperal mothers and newborns in the pandemic scenario of COVID-19/ Barreiras impostas na relação entre puérperas e recém-nascidos no cenário da pandemia do COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic. Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood-brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection. Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.","Hepburn, Madihah; Mullaguri, Naresh; George, Pravin; Hantus, Stephen; Punia, Vineet; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Newey, Christopher R",Neurocritical care,,160

The discovery of giant viruses has changed these standard paradigms. Their genetic, proteomic and structural complexities resemble those of cells, prompting a redefinition and reclassification of viruses. In a previous genome-wide analysis of the evolution of structural domains in proteomes, with domains defined at the fold superfamily level, we found the origins of viruses intertwined with those of ancient cells. Here, we extend these data-driven analyses to the study of fold families confirming the co-evolution of viruses and ancient cells and the genetic ability of viruses to foster molecular innovation. The results support our suggestion that viruses arose by genomic reduction from ancient cells and validate a co-evolutionary 'symbiogenic' model of viral origins.","Mughal, Fizza; Nasir, Arshan; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo",Arch. virol,,160

Since then, this epidemic has spread worldwide; in Europe, Italy has been involved. Effective preventive and therapeutic strategies are absolutely required to block this serious public health concern. Unfortunately, few studies about SARS-CoV-2 concerning its immunopathogenesis and treatment are available. On the basis of the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV (about 82 % of genome homology) and that its characteristics, like the modality of transmission or the type of the immune response it may stimulate, are still poorly known, a literature search was performed to identify the reports assessing these elements in patients with SARS-CoV-induced infection. Therefore, we have analysed: (1) the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; (2) the clinical signs and symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms observed during the development of acute respiratory syndrome and the cytokine release syndrome; (3) the modification of the cell microRNome and of the immune response in patients with SARS infection; and (4) the possible role of some fat-soluble compounds (such as vitamins A, D and E) in modulating directly or indirectly the replication ability of SARS-CoV-2 and host immune response.","Fiorino, Sirio; Zippi, Maddalena; Gallo, Claudio; Sifo, Debora; Sabbatani, Sergio; Manfredi, Roberto; Rasciti, Edoardo; Rasciti, Leonardo; Giampieri, Enrico; Corazza, Ivan; Leandri, Paolo; de Biase, Dario",Br J Nutr,,160

It is thus important for governments to ensure their official messages outpace misinformation and efficiently reach the public. Some countries and regions that are currently worst affected by the virus including Europe, South America and India, encounter an additional difficulty: multilingualism. Understanding the specific role of multilingual users in the process of information diffusion is critical to adjust their publishing strategies for the governments of such countries and regions. In this paper, we investigate the role of multilingual users in diffusing information during the COVID-19 pandemic on popular social networks. We collect a large-scale dataset of Twitter from a populated multilingual region from the beginning of the pandemic. With this dataset, we successfully show that multilingual users act as bridges in diffusing COVID-19 related information. We further study the mental health of multilingual users and show that being the bridges, multilingual users tend to be more negative. This is confirmed by a recent psychological study stating that excessive exposure to social media may result in a negative mood.","Chen, Ninghan; Chen, Xihui; Zhong, Zhiqiang; Pang, Jun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04331v1.pdf,160
397383,68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT With Lung Involvement in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to map the roles of rural and remote primary health care professionals (PHCPs) during disasters. INTRODUCTION: Disasters can have catastrophic impacts on society and are broadly classified into natural events, man-made incidents, or a mixture of both. The PHCPs working in rural and remote communities face additional challenges when dealing with disasters and have significant roles during the Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery (PPRR) stages of disaster management. METHODS: A Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology was utilized, and the search was conducted over seven electronic databases according to a priori protocol. RESULTS: Forty-one papers were included and sixty-one roles were identified across the four stages of disaster management. The majority of disasters described within the literature were natural events and pandemics. Before a disaster occurs, PHCPs can build individual resilience through education. As recognized and respected leaders within their community, PHCPs are invaluable in assisting with disaster preparedness through being involved in organizations' planning policies and contributing to natural disaster and pandemic surveillance. Key roles during the response stage include accommodating patient surge, triage, maintaining the health of the remaining population, instituting infection control, and ensuring a team-based approach to mental health care during the disaster. In the aftermath and recovery stage, rural and remote PHCPs provide long-term follow up, assisting patients in accessing post-disaster support including delivery of mental health care.

Describir el comportamiento de la diseminación de noticias falsas en el contexto de la mortalidad por COVID-19 y el manejo de la infodemia en seis países latinoamericanos. Métodos. Estudio ecológico descriptivo que explora el porcentaje de la población con incapacidad para reconocer las noticias falsas, el porcentaje de confianza en el contenido de las redes sociales y el porcentaje de su uso como única fuente de noticias en Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, México y Perú hasta el 29 de noviembre del 2020. Se calculó el índice de penetración de Internet en cada país, la tasa de penetración de Facebook y la tasa de mortalidad por la COVID-19. La información sobre las medidas implementadas se obtuvo mediante búsquedas bibliográficas y en portales gubernamentales y de noticias de los países seleccionados, según las cinco áreas de acción propuestas por la Organización Mundial de la Salud: identificación de la evidencia, trasmisión de la ciencia y el conocimiento, acciones amplificadas, cuantificación del impacto, y coordinación y gobernanza. Resultados. Chile y Argentina fueron los países con los mayores índices de penetración de Internet (92,4% y 92,0%, respectivamente) y también están entre los que mayor uso hacen de las redes sociales como único medio para la obtención de noticias (32,0% y 28,0%, respectivamente); Brasil y Colombia mostraron un comportamiento intermedio en ambos indicadores. México tiene el uso más alto de redes sociales, mientras Perú y Colombia presentaron los mayores valores del índice de incapacidad para reconocer noticias falsas. Conclusiones. Se observó que en los países con menor uso de las redes sociales como único medio para la obtención de la información y menor confianza en el contenido de redes sociales, las tasas de mortalidad fueron también menores.","Nieves-Cuervo, Giselly Mayerly; Manrique-Hernández, Edgar F.; Robledo-Colonia, Angelo Fernando; Grillo Ardila, Elvia Karina",Rev. panam. salud pública,,160

412938,Cognitive abilities and probabilities of adherence to containment measures against the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"As an emerging technology, additive manufacturing (AM) is able to fabricate products with complex geometries using various materials. In particular, cyber-enabled AM systems have recently become widely applied in many real-world applications. It significantly improves the flexibility and productivity of AM but poses the system under high risks of cyber-physical attacks. For example, cyber-physical attack could maliciously tamper the product design and process parameters, which, in turn, leads to significant alteration of the desired properties in AM products. Therefore, there is an urgent need in incorporating advanced technologies to improve the cyber-physical security for the cyber-enabled AM systems. In this study, two common types of cyber-physical attacks regarding the G-code security were investigated, namely, unintended design modifications and intellectual property theft. To effectively secure the G-code against these two attacks, a new methodology is developed in this study, which consists of a novel blockchain-based data storage approach and an effective asymmetry encryption technique. The proposed method was also applied to a real-world AM case for ensuring the cyber-physical security of the face shield fabrication, which is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the proposed methodology, malicious tampering can be accurately detected in time, and meanwhile, the risk of unauthorized access of the G-code file is greatly eliminated as well. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

428402,SNMMI Statement: COVID-19 and Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) Lung Studies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite electronic health records being in existence for over 50 years, our ability to exchange health data remains frustratingly limited. Commonly used clinical content standards, and the information models that underpin them, are primarily related to health data exchange, and so are usually document- or message-focused. In contrast, over the past 12 years, the Clinical Models program at openEHR International has gradually established a governed, coordinated, and coherent ecosystem of clinical information models, known as openEHR archetypes. Each archetype is designed as a maximal data set for a universal use-case, intended for reuse across various health data sets, known as openEHR templates. To date, only anecdotal evidence has been available to indicate if the hypothesis of archetype reuse across templates is feasible and scalable. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, between February and July 2020, 7 openEHR templates were independently created to represent COVID-19-related data sets for symptom screening, confirmed infection reporting, clinical decision support, and research. Each of the templates prioritized reuse of existing use-case agnostic archetypes found in openEHR International's online Clinical Knowledge Manager tool as much as possible. This study is the first opportunity to investigate archetype reuse within a range of diverse, multilingual openEHR templates. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the use and reuse of openEHR archetypes across the 7 openEHR templates as an initial investigation about the reuse of information models across data sets used for a variety of clinical purposes. METHODS: Analysis of both the number of occurrences of archetypes and patterns of occurrence within 7 discrete templates was carried out at the archetype or clinical concept level. RESULTS: Across all 7 templates collectively, 203 instances of 58 unique archetypes were used. The most frequently used archetype occurred 24 times across 4 of the 7 templates. Total data points per template ranged from 40 to 179. Archetype instances per template ranged from 10 to 62. Unique archetype occurrences ranged from 10 to 28. Existing archetype reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 90%. Total reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the amount of archetype reuse across the 7 openEHR templates in this initial study has demonstrated significant reuse of archetypes, even across unanticipated, novel modeling challenges and multilingual deployments. While the trigger for the development of each of these templates was the COVID-19 pandemic, the templates represented a variety of types of data sets: symptom screening, infection report, clinical decision support for diagnosis and treatment, and secondary use or research. The findings support the openEHR hypothesis that it is possible to create a shared, public library of standards-based, vendor-neutral clinical information models that can be reused across a diverse range of health data sets.","Leslie, Heather",J Med Internet Res,,160

We aim to report the real-life performance in high volume GI endoscopy units during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A web-based survey covering all aspects of daily performance in GI endoscopy units was sent to endoscopy units worldwide. Responses were collected and data were analyzed to reveal the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopy practice. RESULTS: Participants from 48 countries (n = 163) responded to the survey with response rate of 67.35%. The majority (85%) decreased procedure volume by over 50%, and four endoscopy units (2.45%) completely stopped. The top three indications for procedures included upper GI bleeding (89.6%), lower GI bleeding (65.6%) and cholangitis (62.6%). The majority (93.9%) triaged patients for COVID-19 prior to procedure. N95 masks were used in (57.1%), isolation gowns in (74.2%) and head covers in (78.5%). Most centers (65%) did not extend use of N95 masks, however 50.9% of centers reused N95 masks. Almost all (91.4%) centers used standard endoscopic decontamination and most (69%) had no negative pressure rooms. Forty-two centers (25.8%) reported positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients and 50 (30.7%) centers reported positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among their healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Most GI endoscopy centers had a significant reduction in their volume and most procedures performed were urgent. Most centers used the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) by GI societies however there is still a possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GI endoscopy units.","Alboraie, Mohamed; Piscoya, Alejandro; Tran, Quang Trung; Mendelsohn, Robin B; Butt, Amna Subhan; Lenz, Luciano; Alavinejad, Pezhman; Emara, Mohamed H; Samlani, Zouhour; Altonbary, Ahmed; Monged, Ashraf; Lemmers, Arnaud; Sudovykh, Irina; Ho, Dang Quy Dung; Ghazanfar, Shahriyar; Kamau, Edna; Iqbal, Shahzad; Tan, Damien Meng Yew; Liao, Wei-Chih; Vignesh, Shivakumar",Arab J Gastroenterol,,160

We have analyzed the trends of incident cases, deaths, and intensive care unit admissions (ICU) in both countries before and after their respective national lockdowns using an interrupted time-series design. Data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. After the first lockdown, incidence trends were considerably reduced in both countries. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising. During the second lockdown, implementing more restrictive measures for mobility, it has been a change in the trend slopes for both countries in daily incident cases and ICUs.

This work discovered computational star-shaped-similar molecules exhibiting lower binding-scores (higher-affinities) to S-SLSF with probable cross-binding properties of their targeted α-helices but with lower hydrophobicities and smaller molecular sizes. Most star-shaped-similar leads contained Trihydroxyl-Triphenyls arms branching from each of the three carbons of a central Triazine core (TTT). Deconstruction of TTTs by core-replacement (X), fragment extension (F), and 2D deep-screening among millions of molecular possibilities, found additional leads that by combining structural features (F+TTX) reduced their binding-scores to S-SLSF. Such leads maximize their possibilities to stabilize wild-type S-SLSF α-helices, with the aim to reduce host-coronavirus membrane fusion using drug-like ligands rather than mutations.","Coll, Julio",,,160

We use cross-sectional microdata covering the 2014-2018 period. We do not find important differences in the determinants in common between unemployed individuals with and without previous job experience (such as, age, education, and citizenship). The main difference between the two samples is in the composition, with more young people in the latter group (mainly individuals in the school-to-work transition) than in the first one. We find that better-educated unemployed people have more of a multichannel attitude when searching for jobs than their counterparts. Moreover, for unemployed individuals with previous job experience, the characteristics of their last job play a crucial role in influencing the choice of search channel(s). For example, unemployed individuals from high-skilled professions (that typically require the employment of better-educated individuals) choose the internet with a higher probability than other channels, while those from low-skilled professions and with experience in manufacturing have a higher probability of considering employment agencies than those in qualified professions in commercial activities and services. We have assumed that the unobservable factors affecting the decision process of a multichannel job search (estimated through the pairwise correlation coefficients across the residuals of the models) are represented by personality features of an individual, such as motivation, self-control, and preferences. A strong, positive, and significant correlation is found between job searching through the internet and direct contact with firms, but with some spatial differences between macro-areas of the country.","Mussida, Chiara; Zanin, Luca",Soc Indic Res,,160

467732,Surveys on COVID-19 in nuclear medicine: what happened and what we learned,2020,"BACKGROUND: During a global pandemic, it is critical that the public is able to rapidly acquire new and accurate health information. The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19-related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants' CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach &#945;=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized ß=-.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized ß=-.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized ß=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized ß=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized ß=-.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","An, Lawrence; Bacon, Elizabeth; Hawley, Sarah; Yang, Penny; Russell, Daniel; Huffman, Scott; Resnicow, Ken",J Med Internet Res,,160

The necessity for rapid testing combined with the limitations of other diagnostic tests has led to the proposal of various potential roles for LUS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis focused specifically on the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in adult patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. MethodsTraditional and grey-literature searches were performed on June 1st 2021. Two authors independently carried out the searches, selected studies and completed the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Meta-analysis was carried out using established open-source packages in R. We report overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve for LUS. Heterogeneity was determined using the I2 statistic. ResultsTwenty studies were included, providing data from a total of 4,314 patients. The prevalence and admission rates were generally high across all studies. Overall LUS was found to be 87.2% sensitive (95% CI 83.6-90.2) and 69.5% specific (95% CI 62.2-72.5) and demonstrated overall positive and negative predictive values of 3.0 (95% 2.3-4.1) and 0.16 (95% 0.12-0.22) respectively. Separate analyses for each reference standard revealed similar sensitivities and specificities for LUS. Heterogeneity between studies was found to be high, and QUADAS-2 assessment identified risks of bias in many studies. ConclusionDuring a period of high prevalence, LUS is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for COVID-19. However, more research is required to confirm these results in more generalisable populations, including those less likely to be admitted to hospital.","Matthies, Ashley; Trauer, Michael; Chopra, Karl; Jarman, Robert",,,160

481761,"Doubt, Disorientation, and Death in the Plague Time",2020,"BACKGROUND: Since 2010, more than half of World population lives in Urban Environments. Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano. METHODS: Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC > 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 < VC < 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC < 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship (R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index (R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation (R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified (R = - 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down. HYPOTHESIS AND DISCUSSION: The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology. The pilot study conducted during the lock-down period indicates an improvement of glucose control utilizing a remote glucose control system in the Milano Metropolitan Area, suggesting a wider utilization of similar methodologies during the present ""second wave"" lock-down.","Luzi, Livio; Carruba, Michele; Crialesi, Roberta; Da Empoli, Stefano; Dagani, Regina; Lovati, Elisabetta; Nicolucci, Antonio; Berra, Cesare C; Cipponeri, Elisa; Vaccaro, Ketty; Lenzi, Andrea",Acta Diabetol,,160

Young adults are vulnerable to pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes, but little is known about the impact on adolescents. We examined factors associated with perceived changes in mood and anxiety among male youth in urban and Appalachian Ohio. METHODS: In June 2020, participants in an ongoing male youth cohort study were invited to participate in an online survey that included questions about changes in mood, anxiety, closeness to friends and family, and the major impacts of the pandemic. Weighted log-binomial regression models were used to assess the risk of worsened mood and increased anxiety. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between perceived changes in mood and anxiety and perceived changes in closeness to friends and family and open-ended responses to a question about COVID-19's impact on participants. RESULTS: Perceived worsened mood and increased anxiety during the pandemic were associated with higher household socioeconomic status, older age, feeling less close to friends and family, and reporting that COVID-19 negatively affected mental health. A perceived increase in anxiety was also associated with a history of symptoms of depression or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Specific subgroups of male youth may be at heightened risk of worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target vulnerable adolescents and seek to increase closeness to social contacts. Such efforts could involve novel programs that allow youth to stay connected to friends, which might mitigate the negative impact on mental health.","Tetreault, Eleanor; Teferra, Andreas A; Keller-Hamilton, Brittney; Shaw, Shreya; Kahassai, Soliana; Curran, Hayley; Paskett, Electra D; Ferketich, Amy K",J Adolesc Health,,160

491911,[Operations Management of General X-ray Section during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period],2020,"The formulation of a claim rests at the core of argument mining. To demarcate between a claim and a non-claim is arduous for both humans and machines, owing to latent linguistic variance between the two and the inadequacy of extensive definition-based formalization. Furthermore, the increase in the usage of online social media has resulted in an explosion of unsolicited information on the web presented as informal text. To account for the aforementioned, in this paper, we proposed DESYR. It is a framework that intends on annulling the said issues for informal web-based text by leveraging a combination of hierarchical representation learning (dependency-inspired Poincare embedding), definition-based alignment, and feature projection. We do away with fine-tuning computer-heavy language models in favor of fabricating a more domain-centric but lighter approach. Experimental results indicate that DESYR builds upon the state-of-the-art system across four benchmark claim datasets, most of which were constructed with informal texts.

In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.","Mahajan, Swapnil; Kode, Vasumathi; Bhojak, Keshav; Karunakaran, Coral; Lee, Kayla; Manoharan, Malini; Ramesh, Athulya; Hv, Sudheendra; Srivastava, Ankita; Sathian, Rekha; Khan, Tahira; Kumar, Prasanna; Gupta, Ravi; Chakraborty, Papia; Chaudhuri, Amitabha",Sci Rep,,160

Overall, 32% of community referrals and 7% of hospital referrals became symptomatic after testing positive; 83% of isolation hotel clients reported symptoms at some point; 93% completed isolation. Among 302 noncongregate hotel clients, median stay was 18 weeks; 61% were discharged to permanent housing or had a permanent housing discharge plan. DISCUSSION: Overall, a high proportion of PEH completed isolation at the hotel, suggesting a high level of acceptability. Many PEH with COVID-19 diagnosed in the community developed symptoms after testing, indicating that proactive, community-based testing can facilitate early isolation. Noncongregate hotels can be a useful COVID-19 community mitigation strategy by bridging PEH at risk of severe illness to permanent housing.","Montgomery, Martha P; Paulin, Heather N; Morris, Asher; Cotton, Afrika; Speers, Austin; Boyd, Andrew T; Buff, Ann M; Mathews, Darlene; Wells, Alyssa; Marchman, Cathryn; Gaffga, Nicholas; Bamrah Morris, Sapna; Cavanaugh, Sean S",J Public Health Manag Pract,,160
509365,4CPS-390 Dispensing of anticancer investigational drugs during lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: experience in an oncological centre,2021,"BACKGROUND: While a treatment or the vaccine against COVID-19 is not available, access to information about the new coronavirus, transmission route, and ways to prevent the spread of infection are critical sanitary measures worldwide. Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic, as they can offer qualified content while providing interactivity with the user and have great reach over the internet. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of bringing scientific-based information on prevention and personal care against COVID-19. Besides, it proposed to assess the players' knowledge about COVID-19 topics. METHODS: The study was carried out with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the Progressive Web App with the Framework Ionic, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Typescripts (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics API. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images suitable for young audiences. Cards with characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player reinforcing the correct answers or alert the need to know more about the disease. The players' performance was assessed by the rate of errors and successes and analyzed by the linear correlation coefficient, over seven weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology provided quick and daily interactions by developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. RESULTS: The game ""COVID-19 - Did you know?"" was available for free in the university public domain, on April 1st, 2020. The access number was 17,571, until September 2020. Disclosure actions such as reports on social media and television had a temporal correspondence with a greater access number. The players' error rate in the topic ""Mask"" showed a negative trend (r = -.83; P = .01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, considered a priority in the strategy of orientation towards the social distance. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players' performance. The improvement in the users' performance in the topic about the use of the mask may reflect more information or adherence to its use over time.","Gaspar, Juliano De Souza; Lage, Eura Martins; Silva, Fernando José Da; Mineiro, Érico; Oliveira, Isaias José Ramos De; Oliveira, Igor; Souza, Rayner Guilherme De; Gusmão, Juan Rodrigues Oliveira; Souza, Camila Fernanda Donadoni De; Reis, Zilma Silveira Nogueira",,,160

519403,What Has Covid-19 Exposed in Bioethics? Four Myths,2021,"The American healthcare payment model introduced Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) into a position of power that currently puts into question the state of the pharmacy profession, especially in the community field. Reimbursement plans had been designed to benefit all stakeholders and save patients money but have only been shown to increase costs for these involved parties. There exist unresolved gaps in care as a result of the healthcare structure and underutilized skills of trained pharmacists who do not have the federal means to provide clinical services. Four collaborative payment models have been proposed, offering methods to quell the monetary problems that exist and are predicted to continue with the closure of community pharmacies and sustained influence of PBMs. These models may additionally allow the expansion of pharmacy career paths and improve healthcare benefits for patients. With a reflective perspective on the healthcare structure and knowledge of positive impacts with the inclusion of pharmacists, solutions to payment challenges could present a progressive approach to an outdated system. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights a dependency on pharmacists and community settings. This outlook on pharmacists may persist and an established expansion of services could prove beneficial to all healthcare stakeholders.","Mercadante, Amanda R.; Yokota, Mai; Hwang, Angela; Hata, Micah; Law, Anandi V.",Pharm.,,160

Objective: To characterize the clinical manifestations and course of the first cases of contagion by SARS-CoV-2 in doctors of Peru. Methodology: We present a series of six cases of doctors infected by SARS-CoV-2, with confirmed positivity for COVID-19, showing the daily evolution from the diagnosis of the disease, its main signs and symptoms, evolution, and until the outcome in each case. Results: Five were men. The median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 27 to 33). In three cases the physician worked more than 12 hours a day in emergency and hospitalization services and not wear a mask at all times. The most frequent symptoms were axillary temperature above 38°C, malaise, dry cough, and odynophagia (the latter in three of the cases). The diagnosis was made at a median of 3 days (interquartile range: 3 to 4 days). The symptoms that persisted the most were dry cough (present during ten days in four doctors). Dysgeusia was the only symptom with the most extended duration (15 days in only one doctor). In the six cases, the course was favorable. However, these doctors found it difficult to return to functions in their hospital centers adequately. Discussion: Despite a small number of cases, it is the first report detailing the evolution of symptoms day by day, which can help for occupational health and even for case surveillance and monitoring.","Vilela-Estrada, Martín A; Benites-Flores, Irwing R; García-Saavedra, Mario B; Mejia, Christian R",Medwave,,160

This microchip design in connection with optics involved hinders the deployment of this technology for point-of-care applications. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of sample preparation, DNA amplification, and electrochemical detection in a single silicon and glass-based microchamber and its application for the multiplexed detection of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells. The microdevice has a thin-film heater and temperature sensor patterned on the silicon substrate. An array of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was constructed within the microchamber as the transduction element. Oligonucleotide probes specific to the target amplicons are individually positioned at each ITO surface by electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrrole−probe conjugate. These immobilized probes were stable to the thermal cycling process and were highly selective. The DNA-based identification of the two model pathogens involved a number of steps including a thermal lysis step, magnetic particle-based isolation of the target genomes, asymmetric PCR, and electrochemical sequence-specific detection using silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles. The microchamber platform described here offers a cost-effective and sample-to-answer technology for on-site monitoring of multiple pathogens.","Yeung, Siu-Wai; Lee, Thomas Ming-Hung; Cai, Hong; Hsing, I-Ming",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17000638/,160

Further scientific evidence, real-world clinical trials, and economic modelling are needed to fully realise this potential. Additionally, tools such as polygenic risk scores, and results from Mendelian randomisation analyses, are only in the early stages of clinical translation and merit further investigation. Genetically targeted rational drug design has a strong evidence base and, due to the nature of genetic data, academia, direct-to-consumer companies, healthcare systems, and industry may meet in an unprecedented manner. Data sharing navigation may prove problematic. The present manuscript addresses these issues and concludes a need for further guidance to be provided to prescribers by professional bodies to aid in the consideration of such complexities and guide translation of scientific knowledge to personalised clinical action, thereby striving to improve patient care.

611108,Acute Findings on FDG PET/CT: Key Imaging Features and How to Differentiate Them from Malignancy,2020-09-12,"BACKGROUND: East Africa is home to 170 million people and prone to frequent outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers and various bacterial diseases. A major challenge is that epidemics mostly happen in remote areas, where infrastructure for Biosecurity Level (BSL) 3/4 laboratory capacity is not available. As samples have to be transported from the outbreak area to the National Public Health Laboratories (NPHL) in the capitals or even flown to international reference centres, diagnosis is significantly delayed and epidemics emerge. MAIN TEXT: The East African Community (EAC), an intergovernmental body of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan, received 10 million € funding from the German Development Bank (KfW) to establish BSL3/4 capacity in the region. Between 2017 and 2020, the EAC in collaboration with the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (Germany) and the Partner Countries’ Ministries of Health and their respective NPHLs, established a regional network of nine mobile BSL3/4 laboratories. These rapidly deployable laboratories allowed the region to reduce sample turn-around-time (from days to an average of 8h) at the centre of the outbreak and rapidly respond to epidemics. In the present article, the approach for implementing such a regional project is outlined and five major aspects (including recommendations) are described: (i) the overall project coordination activities through the EAC Secretariat and the Partner States, (ii) procurement of equipment, (iii) the established laboratory setup and diagnostic panels, (iv) regional training activities and capacity building of various stakeholders and (v) completed and ongoing field missions. The latter includes an EAC/WHO field simulation exercise that was conducted on the border between Tanzania and Kenya in June 2019, the support in molecular diagnosis during the Tanzanian Dengue outbreak in 2019, the participation in the Ugandan National Ebola response activities in Kisoro district along the Uganda/DRC border in Oct/Nov 2019 and the deployments of the laboratories to assist in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics throughout the region since early 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The established EAC mobile laboratory network allows accurate and timely diagnosis of BSL3/4 pathogens in all East African countries, important for individual patient management and to effectively contain the spread of epidemic-prone diseases.","Affara, Muna; Lagu, Hakim Idris; Achol, Emmanuel; Karamagi, Richard; Omari, Neema; Ochido, Grace; Kezakarayagwa, Eric; Kabatesi, Francine; Nkeshimana, Anatole; Roba, Abdi; Ndia, Millicent Nyakio; Abudo, Mamo U.; Kabanda, Alice; Mpabuka, Etienne; Mwikarago, Emil Ivan; Kutjok, Philip Ezekiel; Samson, Donald Duku; Deng, Lul Lojok; Moremi, Nyambura; Kelly, Maria Ezekiely; Mkama, Peter Bernard Mtesigwa; Magesa, Alex; Balinandi, Stephen Karabyo; Pimundu, Godfrey; Nabadda, Susan Ndidde; Puradiredja, Dewi Ismajani; Hinzmann, Julia; Duraffour, Sophie; Gabriel, Martin; Ruge, Gerd; Loag, Wibke; Ayiko, Rogers; Sonoiya, Stanley Serser; May, Juergen; Katende, Michael J.; Gehre, Florian",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238298/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02028-y,160

So, while one epidemic has a face and a name, we point to a second, more silent yet potentially equally devastating one, unacknowledged grief, and emphasize how policy can be a current therapeutic.

614450,Emergencies: on the misuse of government powers,2021-07-22,"Abstract The COVID-19 outbreak suddenly broke out globally in 2020. Pressure from the blockade and ban on food exports are starting to affect agricultural supply chains, it has led to a rapid rise in global food prices. As many grain exporting countries announced a ban on grain exports, food security issues in China have attracted great international attention. This study builds the Suitability Distribution Model and Soybean-Cereal Constraint Model to explore the relationship between soybean production potential and food security. As a result, the soybean potential planting area in China is 164.3 million ha. If the outbreak prevents China from importing soybeans, the soybean planting area will need to be increased by 6.9 times to satisfy the demands. In the meantime, the cereal self-sufficiency rate will drop to 63.4%, which will greatly affect food security. Each additional unit of soybean production will reduce 3.9 units of cereals, and 1% increase in the self-sufficiency rate of soybeans will result in a 0.63% drop in cereals. It is not sustainable to sacrifice cereal to grow soybeans and to rely heavily on imports. But to ensuring the cereal security, the self-sufficiency rate of soybeans is difficult to exceed 42%. China still need to import more than 68% of the original import volume of soybean. In the short term, the outbreak will not affect food security in China, but as soybean imports decrease, insufficient supply of soybeans will affect people's quality of life. To prevent the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, China should increase soybean stocks and strengthen international cooperation in short term. In the long term, increasing the self-sufficiency rate is the fundamental solution to soybean problem, and the key to increasing soybean cultivation is to make soybean cultivation profitable and to build a sustainable soybean planting chain. So, China need to formulate a soybean cultivation strategy prudently.","Yao, Huizong; Zuo, Xiaoxing; Zuo, Daxing; Lin, Han; Huang, Ximeng; Zang, Chuanfu",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666683920300250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666683920300250?v=s5,160

Since obesity and insulin resistance predispose to thrombotic diseases, we investigated the relationship between hemostatic alterations and body fat distribution in subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes. Subjects and methods Body fat distribution (visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue) and liver fat content of 150 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose was determined using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Participants underwent precise metabolic characterization and major hemostasis parameters were analyzed. Results Procoagulant factors (FII, FVII, FVIII and FIX) and anticoagulant proteins (antithrombin, protein C and protein S) were significantly associated with body fat distribution. In subjects with fatty liver, fibrinogen (298 mg/dl vs. 264 mg/dl, p=0.0182), FVII (99% vs. 90%, p=0.0049), FVIII (114% vs. 90 %, p=0.0098), protein C (124% vs. 111%, p=0.0006) and protein S (109% vs. 89%, p<0.0001) were higher than in controls. In contrast, antithrombin (97% vs. 102%, p=0.0025) was higher in control subjects. In multivariate analyses controlling for insulin sensitivity, body fat compartments and genotype variants (PNPLA3 I148MM/MI/TM6SF2 E167KK/KE), only protein C and protein S remained significantly increased in fatty liver. Conclusions Body fat distribution is significantly associated with alterations of procoagulant as well as anticoagulant parameters. Liver fat plays a key role for the regulation of protein C and protein S suggesting a potential counteracting mechanism to the prothrombotic state in subjects with prediabetes and fatty liver.","Hörber, Sebastian; Lehmann, Rainer; Stefan, Norbert; Machann, Jürgen; Birkenfeld, Andreas L.; Wagner, Robert; Heni, Martin; Häring, Hans-Ulrich; Fritsche, Andreas; Peter, Andreas",Mol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101262; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877821001071?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082137/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212877821001071,160

The United States has borne the largest absolute burden of disease globally, as COVID-19 exploited pre-existing poor population health among Americans to spread rapidly, with devastating consequences. Why does the country that spends the most on healthcare in the world have one of the worst responses to COVID-19? We argue that this is because the United States conception of health is predominantly focused on healthcare, an overwhelming investment in developing drugs and treatments, and an underinvestment in the foundational conditions that keep people healthy. COVID-19 has exposed the limits of this approach to health. In order to prevent COVID-19 and future such pandemics, we must create the conditions that can keep population-level health threats at bay. This means addressing the conditions that shape health, including economics, employment, community networks, racial disparities, how we treat older adults, and the physical layout of our communities. To do so means acknowledging health as a public good, as a transnational project with countries working together to build a healthier world. It also means acknowledging that everyone has a right to health.

621159,MERS—the latest threat to global health security,2015-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30–70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. METHODS: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","Palani, Nandhini; Sistla, Sujatha",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346655/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420301159?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420301159,160

625477,The importance of PrEP persistence in preventing HIV infections on PrEP,2020-08-26,"Perhaps there is some similarity between the coronavirus of 2017 and the COVID-19. Consequently, a predictive model for the antiviral activity for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2017) could be useful for designing the strategy and tactics in the struggle with coronaviruses in general and with COVID 19 in particular. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) of inhibitory activity to MERS-CoV were developed. The index of ideality of correlation was applied to build up these models for the antiviral activity. The statistical quality of the best model is quite good (r2 = 0.84). A mechanistic interpretation of these models based on the molecular features with strong positive (i.e. promoters for endpoint increase) and strong negative (i.e. promoters for endpoint decrease) influence on the inhibitory activity is suggested. A collection of possible biologically active compounds, constructed using data on the above molecular features which are statistically reliable promoters of increase or decrease of the activity, is presented.","Toropov, A A; Toropova, A P; Benfenati, E",SAR QSAR Environ Res,https://doi.org/10.1080/1062936x.2021.1952649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293992/,160
625869,Finding Light in the Uncertain,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that rooms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present the potential for healthcare-associated transmission through aerosols containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, data on the presence of these aerosols outside of patient rooms are limited. We investigated whether virus-containing aerosols were present in nursing stations and patient room hallways in a referral center with critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Eight National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health BC 251 2-stage cyclone samplers were set up throughout 6 units, including nursing stations and visitor corridors in intensive care units and general medical units, for 6 h each sampling period. Samplers were placed on tripods which held 2 samplers positioned 102 cm and 152 cm above the floor. Units were sampled for 3 days. Extracted samples underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for selected gene regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid and the housekeeping gene human RNase P as an internal control. RESULTS: The units sampled varied in the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients present on the days of sampling. Some of the units included patient rooms under negative pressure, while most were maintained at a neutral pressure. Of 528 aerosol samples collected, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the estimated limit of detection of 8 viral copies/m(3) of air. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 outside of patient rooms was undetectable. While healthcare personnel should avoid unmasked close contact with each other, these findings may provide reassurance for the use of alternatives to tight-fitting respirators in areas outside of patient rooms during the current pandemic.","Lane, Morgan A; Brownsword, Erik A; Babiker, Ahmed; Ingersoll, Jessica M; Waggoner, Jesse; Ayers, Marie; Klopman, Matthew; Uyeki, Timothy M; Lindsley, William G; Kraft, Colleen S",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506256/,160

Immune normalization may also be implemented in cancer prevention of “sub-healthy” individuals. We established in vitro cultured mixed-natural killer (NKM) cells to achieve immune normalization. The in vitro cytotoxicity of NKM cells was tenfold higher than that of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The cytotoxicity of NKM cells was negatively correlated with the proportion of T-helper cells (cluster of differentiation: CD3+CD4+ T), and positively correlated with the proportion of NK cells (especially CD56(bright)CD16(bright) NK cells). Then, we defined “sub-healthy individuals” after measuring Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expression in PBMCs from 95 donors aged > 50 years. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential clinical application of NKM-cell therapy in 11 patients with malignant lymphoma, one patient with pancreatic cancer, and four sub-healthy individuals. NKM-cell therapy elicited good tolerance and side-effects were not found. In sub-healthy individuals, the proportion of CD3(+)PD-1(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+)PD-1(+) T cells was reduced significantly after NKM-cell treatment. We demonstrated that a new method using NKM cells was safe and efficacious as adjuvant treatment for cancer patients as well as therapy for sub-healthy individuals. Normalization of the peripheral immune system through NKM-cell therapy could expand its scope of application in different disorders.","Li, Ying; Harunori, ODA; Fu, Shihu; Xing, Fuyuan; Wu, Huawan; Wang, Juan; Chen, Aihua; Ren, Xinhua; Peng, Dawei; Ling, Xia; Shi, Ming; Wu, Hongjin",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461606/,160

Health care workers having close contact with infected individuals play a decisive role in infection control. This study assessed the level of knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) and perceived stress among health care workers of Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A cross sectional study was performed between March 11, 2020 and March 25, 2020 among health care workers of Karachi, Pakistan. Data were collected through an online, self-administered questionnaire. The level of KAP was categorized using modified Bloom’s cut off point. Chi-square test, independent sample t test, and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Results: A total of 304 health care workers responded to the survey. The most popular source of information was found to be TV/radio/newspaper. Although 54.3%, 75%, and 58.9% respondents had good knowledge, good attitude, and good practice, respectively, more than 40% of respondents did not use gloves during patient interaction. Most of participants rated their level of knowledge as moderate and were inclined towards the need for more training. Around 80% of participants had either moderate stress or severe perceived stress. Conclusion: Our study revealed a relatively good level of KAP among respondents, but there is a need for further training programs. This study yielded high stress levels among respondents, with personal and family safety being the main concerns. The government should, therefore, take proper measures to alleviate the stress levels to provide a strong frontline force.","Jawed, Fatima; Manazir, Sana; Zehra, Arhama; Riaz, Ramsha",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://doi.org/10.34171/mjiri.34.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437728/,160

The goal of this project was to document the impact and experiences of COVID-19 on Infection Preventionists (IPs) in real time. Methods A weekly link to a Google survey for IPs about the COVID-19 experience was posted on social media started on March 8, 2020. Contacts of the authors and survey participants were emailed links to all subsequent surveys. Based on participant feedback, the survey was semi-monthly from May 15 - -July 15. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Participation was voluntary and no Institutional Review Board review was sought. Results Fifty-two individuals completed 154 surveys over 14 survey rounds. Forty-two percent completed 1 survey, and 4% completed 11. Sixteen US states and 4 countries were represented. Most participants worked in Acute care. Respondents worked significant overtime in March (mean 68 hours/week) and April (mean 51 hours/week) and observed decreases in COVID-19 patient census in the first half of May. Themes that emerged from qualitative analysis were basic IP practices and personal protective equipment shortages. Overall, IPs reported high stress early in study, with emotional exhaustion peaking at the end of the study. IPs reported more empowerment, credibility, and value to their facilities during the pandemic. Conclusions IPs are specialized healthcare workers at the heart of managing this pandemic. IPs predictably worked long hours, were concerned about PPE and basics of infection prevention that are critical to keeping staff safe. They also reported that the impact of COVID-19 on the IP role was largely positive.","Bubb, Tania N.; Haas, Janet P.",American Journal of Infection Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.04.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655321002297; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655321002297,160

The electrolyte makes the battery and battery pack unsafe, which drives the research and development to replace the flammable liquid by a solid electrolyte.","Salgado, Rui Martim; Danzi, Federico; Oliveira, Joana Espain; El-Azab, Anter; Camanho, Pedro Ponces; Braga, Maria Helena",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073571/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26113188,160
644646,Zoonoses and wet markets: beyond technical interventions,2021-01-07,"OBJECTIVE: Occupational stress is considered a worldwide epidemic experienced by a large proportion of the working population. The identification of characteristics that place people at high risk for occupational stress is the basis of managing and intervening in this condition. In this study, we aimed to identify and validate the risk features for occupational stress among medical workers using a risk model and nomogram. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1988 eligible participants from Henan Province in China. Occupational stress and worker-occupation fit were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Worker-Occupation Fit Inventory (WOFI). The identification of risk features was achieved through constructing multiple logistic regression model, and the risk features were used to develop the risk model and nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were generated to assess the effectiveness and calibration of the risk model. RESULTS: Among 1988 participants in our study, there were 42.5% (845/1988) medical workers experienced occupational stress. The risk features for occupational stress included poor work-occupation fit (WOF score < 25, expected risk: 77.3%), nurse population (expected risk: 63.1%), male sex (expected risk: 67.2%), work experience duration of 11–19 years (expected risk: 54.5%), experience of a traumatic event (expected risk: 65.3%) and the lack of a regular exercise habit (expected risk: 60.2%). For medical workers who have these risk features, the expected risk probability of occupational stress would be 90.2%. CONCLUSION: The current data can be used to identify medical workers at risk of developing occupational stress. Identifying risk features for occupational stress and the work-occupation fit can support hierarchical stress management in hospitals.

Interestingly, following convalescent plasma therapy natural killer cells matured and virus-specific T cells expanded, presumably allowing virus clearance and recovery from the disease. Our findings, thus, suggest that convalescent plasma therapy can activate cellular immune responses to clear SARS-CoV-2 infections.

653077,Decarbonising economies is like denuclearising weaponry—essential for survival,2020-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: The mitigation measures to face the health emergency due to the COVID 19 pandemic generated a deep economic, social, and psychological crisis at the community level. This effect is greater in the people, who are the most violated in their rights. In relation to the social crisis and gender perspective, women are particularly affected by the pandemic. Given the disadvantaged situation of women socially, economically, and politically, their self-care is diminished. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether there is an association between the classic risk factors for prematurity and fetal growth restriction and the increase in these pathologies in the period March-September 2020, in a maternity hospital that assists women from low resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study, with a comparative analysis of the periods between 15 March and 30 September 2019 and the same period in 2020. The data were obtained from an electronic clinical database. The prevalence of preterm birth and small-for-gestational age newborn was analyzed. Indicators available in the database that reflect maternal conditions that lead to an unfavorable maternal environment were selected and they were classified into categories. RESULTS: In the period of 2019, 3225 births were registered and in the period of 2020, 3036 births. In the 2019 period, 12.2% of prematurity was evidenced, while in the 2020 period, 14.5% (RR = 1.19, IC 95% = 1.05-1.35, p = .005). In relation to PEG 5.5% in the first period versus 6.9% in the second (RR = 1.26, CI 95% = 1.04-1.53, p = .01). No increases were found in the indicators that are traditionally related to the etiologies proposed to explain the increase in prematurity and small-for-age gestational, there was no evidence of an increase in inflammatory or vascular conditions. CONCLUSION: The economic, psychological and social crises, in the 1st semester of the health emergency, seriously affected the social determinants of the health of pregnant women who use the Public Maternity of reference in Uruguay. This situation is at the base of the poor perinatal results in the period of the maximum mediated mitigation of the pandemic.","Briozzo, Leonel; Tomasso, Giselle; Viroga, Stephanie; Selma, Hugo; Cardozo, Virginia; Niz, Clara; Nozar, Fernanda; Bianchi, Ana",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219582/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1946791,160

This study aims to evaluate the role of social cognitive abilities in the perceived impact of COVID-19 emergency, and the effects of lockdown measures on patients' social network and caregivers' burden. Methods: Fourteen PD patients performed a neuropsychological battery including sociocognitive tasks before the introduction of COVID-19 restrictive measures (i.e., social distancing and isolation). A structured interview through an online platform was performed in the last 2 weeks of the first lockdown phase to assess patients' health status, perception of COVID-19 emergency, changes in caregivers' burden, and patients' social isolation. Non-parametric analyses were performed to evaluate the association between social skills and patients' COVID-19 perception, as well as the effects of restrictive measures. Results: At baseline evaluation, half of the PD patients showed sociocognitive dysfunctions, mainly on mentalizing abilities. Patients with impaired social cognition skills showed a significantly lower concern on the possible effects of COVID-19 on their health. Caregiver burden and patients' social network remained stable during the lockdown. Conclusion: These preliminary results underline that PD sociocognitive dysfunctions might affect patients' abilities to estimate the effects of COVID-19 infection. However, the lack of a significant increase in caregivers' burden and social isolation suggests, in our sample, a good coping to COVID-19 emergency. Since COVID-19 pandemic can have direct and indirect severe consequences in patients with PD, the development of educational and preventive programs is recommended.","Dodich, Alessandra; Papagno, Costanza; Turella, Luca; Meli, Claudia; Zappini, Francesca; Narduzzi, Pamela; Gober, Alessandro; Pierotti, Enrica; Falla, Marika",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.571991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859588/,160

The initial phase is chosen to purposely identify the essential and largest impact of the first-line of defense measure for similar pandemic: social distancing. METHODS. Spatial Durbin models with county fixed effects were used to account for spatial dependencies and identify spatial spillover effects and spatial heterogeneity. RESULTS. Besides the substantial curve flattening effects of social distancing, our results show significant spillover effects induced by neighboring counties’ social distancing levels even in the absence of significant within-county effects. Urban and areas with high social vulnerability are the ones benefit the most from social distancing and high level of compliance is needed.

An improved ability to predict a patient’s clinical course would facilitate optimal care decisions, resource allocation, family counseling, and strategies for safely easing distancing restrictions. The Care Assessment Need (CAN) score is an existing risk assessment tool within the Veterans Health Administration (VA), and produces a score from 0 to 99, with a higher score correlating to a greater risk. The model was originally designed for the nonacute outpatient setting and is automatically calculated from structured data variables in the electronic health record. This multisite retrospective study of 6591 Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020 was designed to assess the utility of repurposing the CAN score as objective and automated risk assessment tool to promptly enhance clinical decision making for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. We performed bivariate analyses on the dichotomized CAN 1-year mortality score (high vs. low risk) and each patient outcome using Chi-square tests of independence. Logistic regression models using the continuous CAN score were fit to assess its predictive power for outcomes of interest. Results demonstrated that a CAN score greater than 50 was significantly associated with the following outcomes after positive COVID-19 test: hospital admission (OR 4.6), prolonged hospital stay (OR 4.5), ICU admission (3.1), prolonged ICU stay (OR 2.9), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.6), and mortality (OR 7.2). Repurposing the CAN score offers an efficient way to risk-stratify COVID-19 Veterans.

We investigated the quality of life during the epidemic in enterprise workers who just returned to work, and assessed its potential influencing factors to have a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 epidemic lockdown and home confinement. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of enterprise workers conducted in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The Chinese version of EQ5D was used to assess life quality, and information about general characteristics and COVID-19 related factors was collected by a structured questionnaire, which was distributed through the social application “WeChat”. Multiple liner regression was used to investigate potential influencing factors. RESULTS: A total of 2420 participants were enrolled, 59.5% of which worked in Deqing. About 50% of the participants reported worries about the COVID-2019 epidemic and 40.2% had a centralized or home quarantine during the epidemic. The mean EQ-5D score and VAS were 0.990 and 93.5. Multiple liner regression showed that the quality of life measures was related to physical activities (β = 0.006) and keeping home ventilation (β = 0.063) in Deqing, and were related to wearing a mask when going out (β = 0.014), keeping home ventilation (β = 0.061), other marital status (β = − 0.011), worry about the epidemic (β = − 0.005) and having a centralized or home quarantine (β = − 0.005) in Taizhou. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life for returning enterprise workers in areas with different risks of COVID-19 was affected by different factors. Associated factors identified from this study would help develop proper intervention measures for enterprise workers to reduce the impact of large-scale public health events like the COVID-19 on their quality of life.","Chen, Xiaoxiao; Xu, Qian; Lin, Haijiang; Zhu, Jianfu; Chen, Yue; Zhao, Qi; Fu, Chaowei; Wang, Na",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11414-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246225/,160

We review the antibody response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of humans and how it may inform vaccine research. The isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and humans and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus challenge experiments in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses are recombinant proteins, which were not included in the initial wave of Warp Speed immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccines. We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the Warp Speed vaccine program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse influence on vaccine uptake generally.","Moore, John P.; Klasse, P.

Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed.","Lee, Whanhee; Kim, Honghyok; Choi, Hayon Michelle; Heo, Seulkee; Fong, Kelvin C.; Yang, Jooyeon; Park, Chaerin; Kim, Ho; Bell, Michelle L.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33744577/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721014029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721014029?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146334,160

Once it was a vibrant fishing and farming community, but today its economy is reliant on tourism. The majority of enterprises provide only a marginal income and most workers are seasonal. Yet, this business provides the residents with the economic rationale to remain on the island, and in doing so, enables them to retain their existing social networks, sense of place, and connection to their ancestral homes. Thus, the net social benefits of pursuing subsistence-level tourism outweigh the limited economic gains.","McKercher, Bob; Fu, Candace",Annals of Tourism Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2005.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372774/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738305001908; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160738305001908,160

We established a modelling support team to facilitate the application of epidemiological modelling analyses in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Here, we present an innovative, stepwise approach to participatory modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic that engaged decision-makers and public health professionals from countries throughout all stages of the modelling process. Our approach consisted of first identifying the relevant policy questions, collecting country-specific data and interpreting model findings from a decision-maker’s perspective, as well as communicating model uncertainty. We used a simple modelling methodology that was adaptable to the shortage of epidemiological data, and the limited modelling capacity, in our region. We discuss the benefits of using models to produce rapid decision-making guidance for COVID-19 control in the WHO EMR, as well as challenges that we have experienced regarding conveying uncertainty associated with model results, synthesising and comparing results across multiple modelling approaches, and modelling fragile and conflict-affected states.","Adib, Keyrellous; Hancock, Penelope A; Rahimli, Aysel; Mugisa, Bridget; Abdulrazeq, Fayez; Aguas, Ricardo; White, Lisa J; Hajjeh, Rana; Al Ariqi, Lubna; Nabeth, Pierre",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762253/,160

Cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a potential treatment for COVID‐19 ARDS based on preclinical and clinical studies supporting the concept that MSCs modulate the inflammatory and remodeling processes and restore alveolo‐capillary barriers. The authors performed a systematic literature review and random‐effects meta‐analysis to determine the potential value of MSC therapy for treating COVID‐19‐infected patients with ARDS. Publications in all languages from 1990 to March 31, 2020 were reviewed, yielding 2691 studies, of which nine were included. MSCs were intravenously or intratracheally administered in 117 participants, who were followed for 14 days to 5 years. All MSCs were allogeneic from bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood, adipose tissue, or unreported sources. Combined mortality showed a favorable trend but did not reach statistical significance. No related serious adverse events were reported and mild adverse events resolved spontaneously. A trend was found of improved radiographic findings, pulmonary function (lung compliance, tidal volumes, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, alveolo‐capillary injury), and inflammatory biomarker levels. No comparisons were made between MSCs of different sources.","Qu, Wenchun; Wang, Zhen; Hare, Joshua M.; Bu, Guojun; Mallea, Jorge M.; Pascual, Jorge M.; Caplan, Arnold I.; Kurtzberg, Joanne; Zubair, Abba C.; Kubrova, Eva; Engelberg‐Cook, Erica; Nayfeh, Tarek; Shah, Vishal P.; Hill, James C.; Wolf, Michael E.; Prokop, Larry J.; Murad, M.

686223,A commentary on “World Health Organization declares global emergency: A review of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)”,2020-03-10,"ABSTRACT: Diagnosis of bacterial infections until today mostly relies on conventional microbiological methods. The resulting long turnaround times can lead to delayed initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy and prolonged periods of empiric antibiotic therapy (e.g., in intensive care medicine). Therewith, they contribute to the mortality of bacterial infections and the induction of multidrug resistances. The detection of species specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by bacteria has been proposed as a possible diagnostic approach with the potential to serve as an innovative point-of-care diagnostic tool with very short turnaround times. A range of spectrometric methods are available which allow the detection and quantification of bacterial VOCs down to a range of part per trillion. This narrative review introduces the application of spectrometric analytical methods for the purpose of detecting VOCs of bacterial origin and their clinical use for diagnosing different infectious conditions over the last decade. KEY POINTS: • Detection of VOCs enables bacterial differentiation in various medical conditions. • Spectrometric methods may function as point-of-care diagnostics in near future.","Kunze-Szikszay, Nils; Euler, Maximilian; Perl, Thorsten",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11469-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415392/,160
687674,Establishment of epidemic early warning index system and optimization of infectious disease model: Analysis on monitoring data of public health emergencies,2021-09-02,"Background During Fall 2020 in the United States (U.S.), despite high COVID-19 case numbers and recommendations from public health officials not to travel and gather with individuals outside one's household, millions of people gathered for Thanksgiving. The objective of this study was to understand if individuals' behaviors and risk perceptions influenced their decision to gather, and if they did gather, their subsequent test seeking and diagnoses. Methods Participants were part of the CHASING COVID Cohort study - a U.S. national prospective cohort. The study sample consisted of participants who completed routine questionnaires before and after Thanksgiving. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) use informed behavioral risk scores and a score of perceived risk of COVID-19 were assigned to each participant. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the association between higher risk behaviors and gathering with other households, and the association of gathering with subsequent testing and test positivity. Results A total of 1,932 (40.5%) cohort participants spent Thanksgiving with individuals from at least one other household. Participants with higher behavioral risk scores had greater odds of gathering with one other household (aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 2.0, 2.7), two other households (aOR: 4.54, 95% CI: 3.7, 5.6), and three or more other households (aOR: 5.44, 95% CI: 4.1, 7.2). Participants perceiving COVID-19 as a low-risk to themselves and others had greater odds of gathering with one other household (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.3), two other households (aOR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7), and three or more other households (aOR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.4). Those who spent Thanksgiving with one or more other households had 1.23 times greater odds (95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) of having a COVID-19 test afterward. There was no association between gathering for Thanksgiving and subsequent COVID-19 test positivity or developing COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions Those who gathered with other households for Thanksgiving tended to engage in higher-risk activities. Thanksgiving gathering with other households was not associated with subsequently testing positive for COVID-19, but only a small proportion obtained post-travel testing. Public health messaging should emphasize behavior change strategies that promote safer gathering.","You, W.; Rane, M. S.; Zimba, R.; Berry, A.; Kulkarni, S. G.; Westmoreland, D.
