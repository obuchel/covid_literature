1556,Arrival time pattern and waiting time distribution of patients in the emergency outpatient department of a tertiary level health care institution of North India,2014,"BACKGROUND: Emergency Department (ED) of tertiary health care institute in India is mostly overcrowded, over utilized and inappropriately staffed. The challenges of overcrowded EDs and ill-managed patient flow and admission processes result in excessively long waits for patients. AIM: The objective of the present study was to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in an Emergency out Patient Department (EOPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This short cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the EOPD of a Tertiary level health care Institution in North India in the month of May, 2011. The data was obtained from 591 patients, who were present in the EOPD during the month of May, 2011. The waiting time, inter arrival time between two consecutive patients were calculated in addition to the daily census data (discharge rate, admission rate and transfer out rates etc.) of the emergency. RESULTS: Arrival time pattern of patients in the EOPD was highly stochastic with the peak arrival hours to be 9.00-12.00 h in which around 26.3% patients arrived in the EOPD. The primary waiting areas of patients included patients under observation (29.6%); waiting for routine diagnostic tests (16.4%) and waiting for discharge (14.6%). Around 71% patients were waiting due to reasons within emergency complex. CONCLUSION: The patient flow of the ED could only be addressed by multifaceted, multidisciplinary and hospital wide approach.","Tiwari, Yogesh; Goel, Sonu; Singh, Amarjeet",J Emerg Trauma Shock,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126114/,307
7326,Influenza Vaccination of Health Care Workers in Long-Term-Care Hospitals Reduces the Mortality of Elderly Patients,1997-01-11,"In countries where malaria transmission has decreased substantially, thanks to the scale-up of control interventions, malaria elimination may be feasible. Nevertheless, this goal requires new strategies such as the active detection and treatment of infected individuals. As the detection threshold for the currently used diagnostic methods is 100 parasites/μL, most low-density, asymptomatic infections able to maintain transmission cannot be detected. Identifying them by molecular methods such as PCR is a possible option but the field deployment of these tests is problematic. Isothermal amplification of nucleic acids (at a constant temperature) offers the opportunity of addressing some of the challenges related to the field deployment of molecular diagnostic methods. One of the novel isothermal amplification methods for which a substantial amount of work has been done is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. The present review describes LAMP and several other isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification, strand displacement amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and explores their potential use as high-throughput, field-based molecular tests for malaria diagnosis.","Oriero, Eniyou C.; Jacobs, Jan; Van Geertruyden, Jean-Pierre; Nwakanma, Davis; D'Alessandro, Umberto",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109677/,307
7729,Linkages of acute care and emergency medical services to state and local public health programs: the role of interactive information systems for responding to events resulting in mass injury(),2004-06-16,"The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is usually based on clinical and radiological criteria. The identification of a causative organism is not required for the diagnosis. Although numerous microbiological techniques are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not high enough to guide first-line antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, this treatment remains most often empiric. If the causative organism is identified, the antimicrobial treatment is adapted. Sputum analysis may be proposed as a diagnostic tool for patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in specific cases (prior antibiotherapy, hospitalization, failure of the empiric antimicrobial treatment).","Leroy, O.",Med Mal Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119138/,307
8571,Human brain evolution and the “Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:” Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder,2006-03-23,"The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether or not patients with chronic otitis media are infected with viruses or Mycoplasma at the time of sudden increase in otorrhea. From 26 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, sera were collected at the time of sudden increase in otorrhea and three to four weeks later. These paired sera were examined for antibody titer to respiratory viruses (21 species) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Of them, influenza B virus and RSV infections were demonstrated in four and two cases, respectively. Examinations showed no infection in 10 control cases without acute exacerbation. In 36 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, attempts were made to isolate viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae from the pharynx and otorrhea. Consequently, influenza B virus was detected in pharyngeal mucous scrapings in two cases and RSV in one. The probability of respiratory virus infection leading to acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media appears to be lower than that provoking acute otitis media in children and infants. However, the present data suggest that the development of respiratory virus infection in patients with chronic otitis media may cause an increase in the otorrhea, eventually resulting in an acute exacerbation of inflammation.","Sugiyama, Masao; Nakai, Yoshiaki; Tanabe, Kyoji; Chang, Kuan Cheng",Auris Nasus Larynx,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130747/,307

Six participants engaged in a 2 h semi-structured focus group. Participants were guided through a series of nine questions regarding their transition to leadership, professional communication and relationships. Seven themes emerged: managing dual relationships; having difficult conversations; push and pull of leadership; taking responsibility for others; taking responsibility for self-care; addressing stigma in the workplace, and, spirituality/a calling to help. These professionals integrate their personal experiences of recovery into their direct care and leadership approaches in the workplace. This blending of recovery concepts and supervision approaches reflect some of the powerful elements that peer recovery specialists are uniquely qualified to lead in the healthcare workforce. These findings provide important implications for leadership development among this growing segment of the healthcare workforce.","Jenkins, G.

11564,Multiple arboviral infections during a DENV-2 outbreak in Solomon Islands,2020-05-15,"Immunotherapy is the most promising therapeutic approach against malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Despite technological progress, the number of targetable antigens or specific antibodies is limited, thus hindering the full potential of recent therapeutic interventions. All possibilities of finding new targeting molecules must be exploited. The specificity of targeting is guaranteed by the use of monoclonal antibodies, while fully human antibodies are preferred, as they are functional and generate no neutralizing antibodies. The aim of this review is to appraise the latest advances in screening methods dedicated to the identification and harnessing of fully human antibodies. The scope of identifying useful molecules proceeds along two avenues, i.e., through the antigen-first or binding-first approaches. The first relies on screening human antibody libraries or plasma from immunized transgenic mice or humans to isolate binders to specific antigens. The latter takes advantage of specific binding to tumor cells of antibodies present in phage display libraries or in responders’ plasma samples without prior knowledge of the antigens. Additionally, next-generation sequencing analysis of B-cell receptor repertoire pre- and post-therapy in memory B-cells from responders allows for the identification of clones expanded and matured upon treatment. Human antibodies identified can be subsequently reformatted to generate a plethora of therapeutics like antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins, and advanced cell-therapeutics such as chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T-cells.","Nicolini, Fabio; Bocchini, Martine; Angeli, Davide; Bronte, Giuseppe; Delmonte, Angelo; Crinò, Lucio; Mazza, Massimiliano",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226231/,307
11670,Association between racial discrimination and health-related quality of life and the impact of social relationships,2020-05-22,"BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of palliative patients show higher levels of depression and distress compared with the general population. Fegg’s (2013) existential behavioural therapy was shortened to two individual 1-h sessions (short-term existential behavioural therapy). AIM: Testing the effectiveness of sEBT on psychological symptoms of informal caregivers in comparison with active control. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Informal caregivers of palliative in-patients. METHODS: The primary outcome was depression; secondary outcomes were anxiety, subjective distress and minor mental disorders, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, quality of life and direct health care costs. General linear mixed models allow several measurements per participant and change over time. Reasons for declining the intervention were investigated by Rosenstock’s Health Belief Model. RESULTS: Overall inclusion rate was 41.0%. Data of 157 caregivers were available (63.1% females; mean age: 54.6 years, standard deviation (SD): 14.1); 127 participants were included in the main analysis. Participation in sEBT or active control was not significantly associated with post-treatment depression. Outcomes showed prevailingly significant association with time of investigation. Self-efficacy, scepticism of benefit of the intervention, belief of better coping alone and support by family and friends were significant factors in declining participation in the randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Inclusion rate was tripled compared with a previously evaluated longer EBT group intervention. By shortening the intervention, inclusion rate was traded for effectiveness and the intervention could not impact caregivers’ psychological state. Early integration of sEBT and combination of individual and group setting and further study of the optimal length for caregiver interventions are suggested.","Kühnel, Martina B; Marchioro, Linda; Deffner, Veronika; Bausewein, Claudia; Seidl, Hildegard; Siebert, Sarah; Fegg, Martin",Palliat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243077/,307
11772,Ophthalmology of clinically normal alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in the United Kingdom: a cross-sectional study,2020-05-16,"INTRODUCTION: Incidence of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is projected to rise 276% in 2030, and psychological distress affects up to 42% of people with knee osteoarthritis undergoing TKA, with demonstrated detrimental effects on postoperative outcomes. Few studies have assessed psychological treatment in people awaiting TKA, and these have been psychologist-delivered treatments. No evidence exists regarding psychologically-informed interventions delivered by health professionals currently embedded in TKA clinical pathways. The primary aim of this pilot study is to explore the safety, acceptability and feasibility of the Knee Osteoarthritis Management with Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (KOMPACT) approach in people awaiting TKA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 51 community-dwelling adults scheduled for a primary TKA at two hospitals will be recruited to this pilot, mixed-methods, prospective randomised controlled trial with assessor blinding. Participants will be randomised in a 1:2 ratio to either usual care (education class) or usual care plus KOMPACT (2 hours 20 min of preoperative physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). Our primary outcome measures are safety (length of stay, complications and psychological health after KOMPACT), acceptability (treatment credibility and qualitative data) and feasibility (recruitment, retention and intervention fidelity) of the KOMPACT approach. Secondary outcomes include health service outcomes, patient-reported physical and psychological outcomes, and physical performance measures. Quantitative data collection was conducted at baseline, 1–2 weeks before TKA, 6 weeks after TKA and 6 months after TKA. Qualitative data collection is 1–2 weeks before TKA. Data analysis will take a quantitative-led approach with triangulation after thematic analysis of the qualitative data.

12804,Stressing the potential of guanfacine as a treatment for cocaine use disorder,2020-03-09,"In addition to the well-known cardiotonic effects, cardiac glycosides (CGs) produce potent anticancer effects with various molecular mechanisms. We previously show that ouabain induces autophagic cell death in human lung cancer cells by regulating AMPK-mediated mTOR and Src-mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathways. However, whether and how AMPK and Src signaling interacts in ouabain-treated cancer cells remains unclear. Given the pivotal role of AMPK in metabolism, whether ouabain affects cancer cell metabolism remains elusive. In this study we showed that treatment with ouabain (25 nM) caused simultaneous activation of AMPK and Src signaling pathways in human lung cancer A549 cells and human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Cotreatment with AMPK inhibitor compound C or siRNA greatly abrogates ouabain-induced Src activation, whereas cotreatment with Src inhibitor PP2 has little effect on ouabain-induced AMPK activity, suggesting that AMPK served as an upstream regulator of the Src signaling pathway. On the other hand, ouabain treatment greatly depletes ATP production in A549 and MCF7 cells, and supplement of ATP (100 μM) blocked ouabain-induced AMPK activation. We further demonstrated that ouabain greatly inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cancer cells, and exerted differential metabolic effects on glycolysis depending on cancer cell type. Taken together, this study reveals that the altered cancer cell metabolism caused by ouabain may contribute to AMPK activation, as well as its cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.","Shen, Jia-jia; Zhan, Yue-chen; Li, Hui-ying; Wang, Zhen",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468359/,307
12870,Does rural primary care ophthalmology teaching need revisiting?,2020-03-11,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinease-1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by hypotonic stimuli, which is involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Our previous study shows that activation of volume-regulated Cl(−) channels (VRCCs) protects rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether SGK1 was involved in the protective effect of VRCCs in BASMCs. We showed that hypotonic challenge significantly reduced H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis, and increased SGK1 phosphorylation, but did not affect SGK1 protein expression. The protective effect of hypotonic challenge against H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis was mediated through inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, evidenced by increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and inhibition of the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These protective effects of hypotonic challenge against H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis was diminished and enhanced, respectively, by SGK1 knockdown and overexpression. We further revealed that SGK1 activation significantly increased forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) phosphorylation, and then inhibited the translocation of FOXO3a into nucleus and the subsequent expression of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). In conclusion, SGK1 mediates the protective effect of VRCCs against H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in BASMCs via inhibiting FOXO3a/Bim signaling pathway. Our results provide compelling evidences that SGK1 is a critical link between VRCCs and apoptosis, and shed a new light on the treatment of vascular apoptosis-associated diseases, such as vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and atherosclerosis.","Chen, Bao-yi; Huang, Cheng-cui; Lv, Xiao-fei; Zheng, Hua-qing; Zhang, Ya-juan; Sun, Lu; Wang, Guan-lei; Ma, Ming-ming; Guan, Yong-yuan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470837/,307
14102,Archetypes of Gamification: Analysis of mHealth Apps,2020-10-19,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitalized patients and beyond the hospital stay and these long-term sequelae are due in part to unresolved inflammation. Metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis links metabolism to inflammation and such a shift is commonly observed in sepsis under normoxic conditions. By shifting the metabolic state from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized it would reverse unresolved inflammation and subsequently improve outcome. We propose a shift from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation as a sepsis therapy by targeting the pathways involved in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Chemical manipulation of PDH using dichloroacetic acid (DCA) will promote oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis and decrease inflammation. We tested our hypothesis in a Drosophila melanogaster model of surviving sepsis infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Drosophila were divided into 3 groups: unmanipulated, sham and sepsis survivors, all treated with linezolid; each group was either treated or not with DCA for one week following sepsis. We followed lifespan, measured gene expression of Toll, defensin, cecropin A, and drosomycin, and levels of lactate, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA as well as TCA metabolites. In our model, metabolic effects of sepsis are modified by DCA with normalized lactate, TCA metabolites, and was associated with improved lifespan of sepsis survivors, yet had no lifespan effects on unmanipulated and sham flies. While Drosomycin and cecropin A expression increased in sepsis survivors, DCA treatment decreased both and selectively increased defensin.","Bakalov, Veli; Reyes-Uribe, Laura; Deshpande, Rahul; Maloy, Abigail L.; Shapiro, Steven D.; Angus, Derek C.; Chang, Chung-Chou H.; Le Moyec, Laurence; Wendell, Stacy Gelhaus; Kaynar, Ata Murat",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7643993/,307

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of 101 PCNSL patients admitted to 3 ICUs over a two-decade period. RESULTS: Acute respiratory failure, mainly secondary to aspiration pneumonia and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, was the leading reason for ICU admission (33%). Aspiration pneumonia was more common in patients with brainstem tumor (67% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), whereas patients with intracranial hypertension were more frequently admitted for coma without seizures (61% vs. 9%, p = 0.004). Hospital and 6-month mortality were 47% and 53%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, admission for coma without seizures (OR 7.28), cancer progression (OR 3.47), mechanical ventilation (OR 6.58) and vasopressors (OR 4.07) were associated with higher 6-month mortality. Karnofsky performance status prior to ICU admission was independently associated with lower 6-month mortality (OR 0.96). DISCUSSION: Six-month survival of PCNSL patients admitted to the ICU appears to be relatively favorable (around 50%) and the presence of PCNSL alone is not a relevant criterion for ICU refusal.

However, there is a variety of intervention types, and their differential efficacy is widely unclear. The aim of the planned network meta-analysis (NMA) is to compare the efficacy of family interventions that differ in content (eg, psychoeducation, mutual support, skills training) and format (eg, number of sessions, inclusion of patients, form of delivery). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions directed at the adult relatives, friends or non-professional carers of people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum) to any kind of control condition. The main outcomes will be global clinical state for the patients and coping with psychosis as well as attitudes towards psychosis for the relatives. Additional outcomes will be severity of symptoms, functioning, burden and compliance/drop-out. We conducted a comprehensive search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (8 August 2019) and reference lists of review articles. Full-text assessment of eligibility, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment will be done by two independent reviewers. An NMA will be conducted for any of the planned outcomes and intervention characteristics for which sufficient and appropriate data are available. The analyses will make use of a random effects model within a frequentist framework. Estimates for all pairwise treatment effects will be obtained using standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. Interventions will be ranked according to their relative efficacy. We will address the assumption of transitivity, heterogeneity and inconsistency using theoretical and statistical approaches. The possibility of publication bias and the strength of evidence will also be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There are no ethical concerns.

However, insufficient systemic delivery remains a hurdle to clinical deployment. Here, we demonstrate that MOTS‐c, a mitochondria‐derived bioactive peptide, with an intrinsic muscle‐targeting property, augmented glycolytic flux and energy production capacity of dystrophic muscles in vitro and in vivo, resulting in enhanced phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) uptake and activity in mdx mice.

16095,Advance care planning in older hospitalised patients following an emergency admission: A mixed methods study,2021-03-05,"IMPORTANCE: The 2016 presidential campaign was marked by intensified rhetoric around the deportation of undocumented immigrants. The association of such rhetoric with primary, emergency, and inpatient care among undocumented immigrants is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of increased anti-immigrant rhetoric during the 2016 presidential campaign with health care use among a group of Medicaid-ineligible patients largely composed of undocumented immigrants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, this cohort study analyzed health care use between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2018, in a retrospective cohort of Medicaid and Medicaid-ineligible (>90% undocumented) adult and pediatric patients. The inflection point of interest was June 16, 2015, the date of Donald Trump’s announcement of candidacy, which represented a documented increase in anti-immigration rhetoric during the presidential campaign. Analyses were controlled for age, self-reported sex, and baseline comorbidities. Data analysis was conducted from August 28, 2018, to September 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The DID of the number of completed primary care encounters before and after June 16, 2015, in Medicaid compared with Medicaid-ineligible patients. Secondary outcomes included the DID of emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient discharges over the same period. RESULTS: There were 20 211 patients included in the analysis: 1501 (7.4%) in the sample of predominantly undocumented Medicaid-ineligible patients (861 [57.4%] female) and 18 710 (92.6%) in the Medicaid control group (10 443 [55.8%] female). The mean (SD) age as of 2018 in the Medicaid-ineligible group was 38.2 (15.4) years compared with 22.2 (16.5) years in the control group. There was a differential decrease in completed visits among Medicaid-ineligible children compared with Medicaid children (DID estimate, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9) and Medicaid-ineligible adults (DID estimate, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9). There was also a significant differential increase in ED visits among Medicaid-ineligible children (DID estimate, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0). In addition, there was a differential decrease in inpatient discharges among Medicaid-ineligible adults (DID estimate, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7), with no significant change in ED visits or ED admission rates in this group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, there was a significant decrease in primary care use among undocumented patients during a period of increased anti-immigrant rhetoric associated with the 2016 presidential campaign, coincident with an increase in ED visits among children and a decrease in inpatient discharges among adults, with the latter possibly attributed to a decrease in elective admissions during this period.","Nwadiuko, Joseph; German, Jashalynn; Chapla, Kavita; Wang, Frances; Venkataramani, Maya; Vaidya, Dhananjay; Polk, Sarah",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7936260/,307

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of in vitro and in vivo studies investigating bioeffects of MMWs at low exposure levels. METHODS: We identified 107 in vitro and in vivo studies investigating MMWs and biological effects in which the power density employed has been below 100 W/m(2), which is below the current standards for occupational local exposures. Where possible, we estimated the magnitude of the principal effect reported or set this magnitude to zero in studies reporting no significant effects. We also estimated the quality of the studies, based on a methodology used in previous analyses. RESULTS: We show a negative correlation between effect size and both power density and specific absorption rate. There was also a significant negative correlation between effect size and quality score. A multivariate analysis revealed that there is an increase in the effect size for certain biological systems being investigated and laboratories in which the work was carried out whilst the quality score for some of these tends to be low. We note that many of the studies were motivated by a desire to elucidate the possible mechanisms in therapeutic devices rather than assessing the safety of telecommunications systems. Finally, it appears that the presence or absence of modulation does not influence the reported effect size. SIGNIFICANCE: Many of the findings of this meta-analysis have not been reported before and have important implications for overall interpretation of in vitro and in vivo data. Overall, the results of this study do not confirm an association between low-level MMWs and biological effects.","Wood, Andrew; Mate, Rohan; Karipidis, Ken",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7962924/,307
17622,Predictors of acceptability and engagement in a self-guided online program for depression and anxiety(),2021-05-05,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant carcinomas worldwide with poor prognosis, imposing an increasingly heavy burden on patients. Previous experiments and epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D and vitamin D-related genes play a vital role in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to construct a vitamin D-related gene signature to predict prognosis in CRC. The CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was performed as the training set. A total of 173 vitamin D-related genes in the TCGA CRC dataset were screened, and 17 genes associated with CRC prognosis were identified from them. Then, a vitamin D-related gene signature consisting of those 17 genes was established by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. Moreover, four external datasets (GSE17536, GSE103479, GSE39582, and GSE17537) were used as testing set to validate the stability of this signature. The high-risk group presented a significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk group in both of training set and testing sets. Besides, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for signature on OS in training set at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.710, 0.708, 0.710 respectively. The AUCs of the ROC curve in GSE17536 for 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.649, 0.654, and 0.694. These results indicated the vitamin D-related gene signature model could effectively predict the survival status of CRC patients. This vitamin D-related gene signature was also correlated with TNM stage in CRC clinical parameters, and the higher risk score from this model was companied with higher clinical stage. Furthermore, the high accuracy of this prognostic signature was validated and confirmed by nomogram model. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel vitamin D-related gene model to predict the prognosis of CRC, which will help provide new therapeutic targets and act as potential prognostic biomarkers for CRC.","Bu, Luping; Huang, Fengxing; Li, Mengting; Peng, Yanan; Wang, Haizhou; Zhang, Meng; Peng, Liqun; Liu, Lan; Zhao, Qiu",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8126261/,307

It is known that the biofilms from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) promote expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to suppress T-cell proliferation and benefit bacterial infections. This study finds that GMI, a fungal immunomodulatory peptide isolated from Ganoderma microsporum, suppresses MDSC expansion to promote the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. The enhancement is likely attributed to increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α and reduction in ROS expression. Similar beneficial effects of GMI on the suppression of MDSC expansion and IL-6 expression are also observed in the whole blood and reduces the accumulation of MDSCs in the infected bone region in a mouse PJI infection model. This study shows that GMI is potentially useful for treating S. aureus-induced PJIs.","Peng, Kuo-Ti; Chen, Jiun-Liang; Kuo, Liang-Tseng; Yu, Pei-An; Hsu, Wei-Hsiu; Lee, Chiang-Wen; Chang, Pey-Jium; Huang, Tsung-Yu",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268560/,307

Previous studies in the newborn CF pig demonstrated decreased bile flow into the small intestine and a microgallbladder with increased luminal mucus and fluid secretion defects. In this study, we examined the intrahepatic bile ducts of the newborn CF pig. We assessed whether our findings from the gallbladder are present elsewhere in the porcine biliary tract and if CF pig cholangiocytes have fluid secretion defects. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated apical CFTR expression in non‐CF pig intrahepatic bile ducts of a variety of sizes; CF pig intrahepatic bile ducts lacked CFTR expression. Assessment of serum markers did not reveal significant signs of hepatobiliary disease except for an elevation in direct bilirubin. Quantitative histology demonstrated that CF pigs had smaller bile ducts that more frequently contained luminal mucus. CF intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids were smaller and lacked cAMP‐mediated fluid secretion. Together these data suggest that cholangiocyte fluid secretion is decreased in the CF pig, contributing to structural changes in bile ducts and decreased biliary flow.","Zarei, Keyan; Meyerholz, David K.; Stoltz, David A.",Physiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290831/,307

Consequently and significantly, the times of board meetings is positively correlated with over-investment, while the proportion of on-site board meetings is negatively correlated with over-investment. That is, the on-site meeting for the Board decision-making will better inhibit the enterprises’ over-investment behaviors. Further research shows that when there is a controlling shareholder in the company or in a dual position, the on-site board meeting no longer has a significant inhibitory effect on over-investment. By research on the independence of the Board of Directors, it is found that when selecting on-site board decision-making, the existence of independent directors has an over-investment suppression effect, and the higher the proportion of independent directors, the more obvious the inhibitory effect is. The samples are divided into state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, the study found that when choosing on-site board meetings, state-owned enterprises have a greater inhibitory effect on over-investment than private enterprises.

Here we describe a patient who developed invasive mucormycosis after receiving only a short course of dexamethasone. The purpose is to highlight this atypical presentation of a rare disease. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and small cell lung cancer with metastasis to the brain presented to the Emergency Department with altered mental status and a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Three weeks before, she had been diagnosed with DM (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 6.5%) and was started on dexamethasone to treat cerebral edema. On admission, her HbA1c was 10.8%, although she had received only a short course of dexamethasone. Her physical exam was concerning for left eyelid swelling and ophthalmoplegia. Computed tomography of the head and neck revealed signs of left ocular proptosis and invasive rhinomaxillary fungal disease. The patient underwent urgent surgical debridement; subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive fungal disease extending into her left inferior frontal lobe. A surgical pathology report was positive for Rhizopus oryzae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Her blood cultures were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. She was treated with antibiotics and amphotericin B. Her clinical course was complicated by hypokalemia. She eventually recovered and was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights an atypical presentation of mucormycosis. Clinicians should remain vigilant for this rare complication of dexamethasone use even when the therapy is given for a short time.","Randhawa, Gurchetan; Hagaman, Sean; Tootkaboni, Mahsa Pourabdollah; Kundal, Sanchit V.; Oli, Sharad; Alrassi, James; Schild, Sam D.; Abu-Ghanem, Sara; Brejt, Shelly",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323743/,307
20576,Perceptions of a short animated film on adverse childhood experiences: a mixed methods evaluation,2021-08-17,"Climate change is one of the critical determinants affecting life cycles and transmission of most infectious agents, including malaria, cholera, dengue fever, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and the recent Corona-virus pandemic. HFMD has been associated with a growing number of outbreaks resulting in fatal complications since the late 1990s. The outbreaks may result from a combination of rapid population growth, climate change, socioeconomic changes, and other lifestyle changes. However, the modeling of climate variability and HFMD remains unclear, particularly in statistical theory development. The statistical relationship between HFMD and climate factors has been widely studied using generalized linear and additive modeling. When dealing with time-series data with clustered variables such as HFMD with clustered states, the independence principle of both modeling approaches may be violated. Thus, a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) is used to investigate the relationship between HFMD and climate factors in Malaysia. The model is improved by using a first-order autoregressive term and treating all Malaysian states as a random effect. This method is preferred as it allows states to be modeled as random effects and accounts for time series data autocorrelation. The findings indicate that climate variables such as rainfall and wind speed affect HFMD cases in Malaysia. The risk of HFMD increased in the subsequent two weeks with rainfall below 60 mm and decreased with rainfall exceeding 60 mm. Besides, a two-week lag in wind speeds between 2 and 5 m/s reduced HFMD's chances. The results also show that HFMD cases rose in Malaysia during the inter-monsoon and southwest monsoon seasons but fell during the northeast monsoon. The study's outcomes can be used by public health officials and the general public to raise awareness, and thus, implement effective preventive measures.","Abdul Wahid, Nurmarni Athirah; Suhaila, Jamaludin; Rahman, Haliza Abd.",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379622/,307

20674,Associations Between Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder Symptoms Mediated by Depressive Symptoms and Hopelessness Among College Students,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Stress fractures are a common and potentially debilitating overuse injury to bone and occur frequently among military recruits and athletes. Recovery from a lower body stress fracture typically requires several weeks of physical rehabilitation. Teriparatide, a recombinant form of the bioactive portion of parathyroid hormone (1–34 amino acids), is used to treat osteoporosis, prevent osteoporotic fractures, and enhance fracture healing due to its net anabolic effect on bone. The study aim is to investigate the effect of teriparatide on stress fracture healing in young, otherwise healthy adults undergoing military training. METHODS: In a two-arm, parallel, prospective, randomised controlled, intention-to-treat trial, Army recruits (n = 136 men and women, 18–40 years) with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosed lower body stress fracture (pelvic girdle, sacrum, coccyx, or lower limb) will be randomised to receive either usual Army standard care, or teriparatide and usual Army standard care. Teriparatide will be self-administered by subcutaneous injections (20 μg/day) for 16 weeks, continuing to 24 weeks where a fracture remains unhealed at week 16. The primary outcome will be the improvement in radiological healing by two grades or more, or reduction to grade zero, 8 weeks after randomisation, assessed using Fredericson grading of MRI by radiologists blind to the randomisation. Secondary outcomes will be time to radiological healing, assessed by MRI at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, until healed; time to clinical healing, assessed using a clinical severity score of injury signs and symptoms; time to discharge from Army physical rehabilitation; pain, assessed by visual analogue scale; health-related quality of life, using the Short Form (36) Health Survey; and adverse events. Exploratory outcomes will include blood and urine biochemistry; bone density and morphology assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and high-resolution pQCT; physical activity measured using accelerometers; and long-term future fracture rate. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate whether teriparatide, in addition to standard care, is more effective for stress fracture healing than standard care alone in Army recruits who have sustained a lower body stress fracture.

21036,Barriers to and Facilitators for Using Nutrition Apps: Systematic Review and Conceptual Framework,2021-06-19,"INTRODUCTION: In Africa, oral pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is largely provided via over‐burdened public HIV care clinics. Successfully incorporating PrEP services into these clinics may require adaptations to practices outlined in national implementation guidelines and modifications to routine existing service delivery. We aimed to describe adaptations made by public HIV clinics in Kenya to integrate PrEP delivery into existing services. METHODS: The Partners Scale‐Up Project aimed to catalyse integration of PrEP in 25 public HIV care clinics. Between May and December 2018, we conducted qualitative interviews with health providers and documented clinic observations in technical assistance (TA) reports to understand the process of PrEP service integration. We analysed 36 health provider interview transcripts and 25 TA reports to identify clinic‐level adaptations to activities outlined in Kenyan Ministry of Health PrEP guidelines and modifications made to existing service delivery practices to successfully incorporate PrEP services. Identified adaptations were reported using the expanded framework for reporting adaptations and modifications (FRAME). RESULTS: All clinics (n = 25) performed HIV testing, HIV risk assessment, PrEP education and adherence counselling as stipulated in the guidelines. Most clinics initiated clients on PrEP without creatinine testing if otherwise healthy. While monthly refill appointments are recommended, a majority of clinics issued PrEP users two to three months of pills at a time. Clinics also implemented practices that had not been specified in the guidelines including incorporating PrEP‐related topics into routine health talks, calling clients with missed PrEP appointments, discussing PrEP service delivery in regular staff meetings, ‘fast‐tracking’ PrEP clients and dispensing PrEP in clinic rooms rather than at clinic‐based pharmacies. PrEP initiation numbers were highest among clinics that did not require creatinine testing, conducted peer on‐the‐job PrEP training and those that discussed PrEP delivery in their routine meetings. Above‐average continuation was observed among clinics that discussed PrEP in their routine meetings, dispensed PrEP in clinic rooms and offered PrEP at nonregular hours. CONCLUSIONS: Health providers in public HIV care clinics instituted practices and made innovative adaptations to PrEP delivery to reduce barriers for clients and staff. Encouraging clinic level adaptations to national implementation guidelines will facilitate scale‐up of PrEP delivery.","Irungu, Elizabeth M.; Odoyo, Josephine; Wamoni, Elizabeth; Bukusi, Elizabeth A.; Mugo, Nelly R.; Ngure, Kenneth; Morton, Jennifer F.; Mugwanya, Kenneth K.; Baeten, Jared M.; O'Malley, Gabrielle",J Int AIDS Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8425783/,307

21372,Establishing the effectiveness of technology-enabled dementia education for health and social care practitioners: a systematic review,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in mortality rates according to socioeconomic position (SEP) have been rising in England. We describe the association between recent changes in socioeconomic inequality and trends in mortality disparities for different age and sex groups at small-area level in England. METHODS: Vital registration data from the Office for National Statistics on resident population size and number of deaths in each Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in England from 2002 to 2018 were stratified by sex and 5-year age group. We grouped LSOA into ventiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), our indicator of SEP. We examined time trends in smoothed mortality rates, using 3 year moving averages for the period 2003-2017, by age across the IMD distribution. We measured mortality inequalities using the ratio of mortality rates between different deprivation groups. We calculated mortality rate ratios between the most and the least deprived 10% of areas (Total Inequality) and between the median and least deprived (Lower Inequality) 10% of areas by year, gender and age group, to examine where in the distribution of deprivation trends in mortality inequality arose. FINDINGS: Among <1 year olds, the inequality in mortality rates between the poorest 10% of LSOAs and the richest 10% of LSOAs fell between 2003 and 2017 by 22•7% for men and 22•8% for women. The largest inequalities were observed among 40 to 54 year olds. This inequality increased over the study period – from 3•2 times higher mortality rates for men in the most as opposed to the least deprived 10% of LSOAs in 2003 to 3•3 times in 2017. The rise was from 2•4 to 2•6 for women. Age groups ≥65 years, who experience the highest mortality risk, had low but rising inequality. Men and women aged 65 to 79 living in the most deprived LSOAs had a mortality rate 1•9 times higher than the least deprived in 2003 but this had increased to 2•2 times higher for women and 2•3 times higher for men by 2017. This was due to rising inequality in both halves of the distribution – between the top 10% of LSOA and the middle, and between the middle and the bottom 10% of LSOA. INTERPRETATION: Overall mortality inequality rose in England but there were substantial differences in the trends for specific age and sex groups. Infant and child mortality inequality fell. At older ages, mortality inequality rose across cohorts, although in different ways, as each cohort's exposure to life-course to labour market inequality has differed. Policy goals of reducing mortality inequality will be best met by a focus on the risk factors that are specific to particular age and deprivation groups.

Increasing antibiotic resistance as well as identifying genetic diversity and factors associated with pathogenicity and prevalence of this bacterium is important. The aim of this study was the investigation of molecular typing, biofilm production, and detection of carbapenemase genes in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from different infection sites using ERIC-PCR in Iran. METHODS: Forty isolates of A. baumannii were obtained from various wards of the central hospital, in the west of Iran. Phenotypic identification and genetic diversity, biofilm production assay, and detection of Carbapenemase genes carried out. RESULTS: Tracheal samples 26 (61.9 %) are the most frequent isolates, and 95 % of isolates were identified as MDR. 32.5 % of all A. baumannii strains were capable to form a strong biofilm. It was founded that antimicrobial resistance patterns had a significant relationship with strong biofilm formation (P = 0.001). Most frequencies of the studied genes were in the order of VIM (81 %), SPM (45.2 %), and IMP (35.7 %) genes. The VIM gene was the most frequent in all isolates which were significant (P = 0.006). 14 different ERIC-types were observed including 7 common types and 7 unique or single types.

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 among IBD patients; its influence on disease severity and outcome; its relationship to medication use; and how the pandemic affected IBD management. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was posted online to members of the Israel Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Foundation (November 2020- January 2021). The questionnaire addressed the course of IBD disease and COVID-19 infection over the past year. RESULTS: 2152 IBD patients completed the questionnaire. 104 (4.8%) had been infected with COVID-19, significantly lower than the “expected” infected cases among the Israeli population (p=0.033). The median age of participants was 39; 60.5% were female. Most patients (75.6%) had no comorbidities other than IBD. No correlation was found between IBD type or disease severity and COVID-19 infection. Most IBD patients reported mild COVID-19 disease, regardless of the type of IBD medications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, elevated BMI, and diabetes were independent risk factors for COVID-19 infection. IBD treatment including 5-aminosalicylic acid, smoking, and hypertension were protective factors. 25.2% of COVID-19 patients discontinued their IBD treatment, compared to 8.5% of non-COVID-19 infected patients. IBD flares were significantly higher in those who discontinued treatment (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: IBD patients do not have an increased risk for COVID-19, regardless of IBD activity or treatment. Patients should be encouraged to continue effective IBD therapy, including biologics and steroids, to minimize active IBD.","Richter, V; Bermont, A; Cohen, D L; Broide, E; Shirin, H",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194608/,307

Ambulatory clinic visits were replaced by the implementation of telehealth modalities in most of IBD units during the pandemic lockdown. However, the efficacy, efficiency, and patient′s acceptability of using telemedicine by telephone consultation has not been evaluated. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in IBD patients who underwent telephone consultation during lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic between 16(th) march and 13(th) April 2020. To assess the efficacy of this telephone consultation (COVID-visit), change in disease′s activity and treatment, non-scheduled visits, emergency consultation, hospital admission and non-elective surgery from COVID-visit to the next scheduled consultation (postCOVID-visit) were checked. To evaluate efficiency, the time period between COVID-visit and postCOVID-visit were compared with previous consultation (preCOVID-visit). Only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD, regular follow-up in our IBD unit and with full available requested test results were included. A telephone survey was designed (5 questions) and conducted in all patients to rate satisfaction for using telemedicine. RESULTS: Out of a total of 274 patients, 220 patients (52.2% male; mean age 49±16 years; crohn′s disease n=126/ ulcerative colitis n=83/ indeterminate colitis n=11) were included. During the COVID-visit 41% patients were using biologic agents, 15% had active disease and 6.8% changed treatment (40% initiated corticosteroids; 30% started immunomodulators or biologic agents; 30% upgraded usual treatment). Only 1 patient consulted at the emergency department, 11 patients needed to rearrange the visit and none patient underwent surgery before the scheduled post-COVID visit. The interval to post- COVID visit compared to pre-COVID visit was reduced in 28.6%, remained equal in 33.6% and increased in 37.7% of patients. The satisfaction survey (n=185) revealed that 81.1% patients rated care as excellent, 94.6% perceived it was effective and solved doubts in 96.2% of patients. However, 44.4% of patients rather prefer on-site consultation for follow-up and only 52% considered that incorporating video would improve care. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine care during the lockdown and despite been abruptly and rapidly implemented in IBD units, shows to be effective and efficient to care IBD patients. In addition, telephone consultation is well accepted by patients for short follow-up periods. Further follow-up studies should be carried out to determine the patient profile that will benefit most from this monitoring.","Ramos Lopez, L; Reygosa, C; Carrillo-Palau, M; Alonso-Abreu, I; González, Y; de la Barreda, R; Amaral, C; Hernández, A; Benítez-Zafra, F; Hernández-Guerra, M",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195041/,307

Surveys last 20–30 minutes and include information about respondent and household characteristics; experiences with household water insecurity [using the Household Water Insecurity Experiences Scale-4 (HWISE-4), range: 0–12], hunger, and illness in the prior 2 weeks; and 24-hour dietary recall (range: 0–10 food groups). We assessed the relationship between water insecurity and dietary diversity, hunger, and illness using random coefficient models (which account for variation by site and adjust for measured confounders) among sites with available baseline data: Senegal (interviews conducted June 2020, n = 501), Nepal (July 2020, n = 759), Ghana (September 2020, n = 543), Nigeria (September 2020, n = 501), Kenya (October 2020, n = 547), and Niger (October 2020, n = 364). Additional data from other sites and timepoints are forthcoming. RESULTS: The prevalence of water insecurity (HWISE-4 scores > 3) ranged from 8.9% of sampled households in Nepal to 47.4% in Ghana. In bivariate analyses for each site, household water insecurity did not differ by respondent sex but was consistently lower among households that had an on-premises compared to off-premises water source [e.g., mean, 2.3 vs. 3.7, p < 0.001 in Senegal]. In adjusted models across all sites, greater water insecurity was associated with lower dietary diversity (B: –0.08; 95% CI: –0.10, –0.05), and higher odds of experiencing hunger (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.14) and having an ill household member (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07). CONCLUSIONS: Water insecurity is experienced by many households and may be an important determinant of nutritional and physical well-being.

Thus, setting specific evidence is pivotal to plan, evaluate, and improve national preventive measures and to achieve international sustainable development goals. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was the first of its kind to estimate the pooled prevalence of stillbirth and its determinants among diabetic mothers in Ethiopia. Methods: Primary studies were exhaustively searched using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases, and gray literature found in Addis Ababa and Haramaya University online repositories was accessed. Eligible studies were selected and critically appraised for quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality appraisal checklist. The overall prevalence of stillbirth among diabetic mothers was estimated using a weighted inverse random-effect model. I(2) statistic was used for evidence of heterogeneity. Egger's test and funnel plot were used to check the presence of publication bias. Results: The pooled prevalence of stillbirth among diabetic mothers was 2.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): −0.20, 4.97]. Being a housewife [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.26, 3.23], maternal age of <30 years [AOR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 3.13)], and gestational age of <37 completed weeks [AOR = 9.76 (95% CI: 7.83, 11.70)] increased the risk of stillbirth among diabetic mothers. Conclusions: The national pooled prevalence of stillbirth among diabetic mothers was 2.39%. Maternal age of <30 years, gestational age of <37 completed weeks, and being a housewife were significantly associated with stillbirth.

The development of selectively acting formulations requires the creation of smart delivery systems based on carriers that would first find the target cells and enter them and then release the active substance locally. Nanoparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers can be effectively used as such carriers. Flexible regulation of the molecular structure and architecture of polymers, as well as the modification of nanoparticles with vector molecules, allows one to construct carrier particles for the development of nanoformulations for active agents of various nature. This review presents the main approaches to the design of nanoformulations for targeted delivery, describes the methods for the preparation and study of nanoparticles based on hydrophobic and amphiphilic biodegradable lactide polymers, and discusses the effect of the molecular structure and preparation conditions on the characteristics of nanoparticles in detail.

Various deep learning-based classifiers, which can generate better models using sentence embedding, have been proposed to address this challenging task. These approaches, however, do not work well due to the lack of task-related information. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel framework that incorporates prior information by employing awareness of events and time expressions (time–event entities) with various window sizes to focus on context words around the entities as a filter. We refer to this module as “question encoder.” In our approach, this kind of prior information can extract task-related information from simple sentence embedding. Our experimental results on a publicly available Timebank-Dense corpus demonstrate that our approach outperforms some state-of-the-art techniques, including CNN-, LSTM-, and BERT-based temporal relation classifiers.","Seki, Yohei; Zhao, Kangkang; Oguni, Masaki; Sugiyama, Kazunari",Int J Digit Libr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513567/,307

Due to the influence of the antenna radiation power and the low-pass filtering function of the earth medium, an intense amplitude gain cannot be obtained when the signal is intercepted. This article addresses a plane beam signal ground penetrating radar array observation method based on high radiation power gain. The transmitting antenna array simultaneously excites the pulse signal with the same centre frequency. All the transmitted signals interfere with each other at the near surface to form a plane beam signal, and the electromagnetic energy is superimposed mutually to increase the radiation power. We applied the plane beam signal ground penetrating radar array method to different geological models constructed by the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for numerical simulation in this research. Since there are various offsets in the array ground penetrating radar observation method, we introduce a composite frequency shift-perfect matching layer (CFS-PML) based on the recursive convolution method as the absorbing boundary condition. It eliminates the problem of secondary reflection caused by the angle variation of the incident wave. The research result shows that the plane beam signal illuminates the target uniformly in space, can eliminate the discontinuity in profile data caused by the directivity of the antenna, improve the stability and quality of the echo signal, and enrich the target response parameters.","Cui, Fan; Chen, Yi; Zhang, Yongqi; Du, Yunfei",Acta Geophys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514008/,307

The clear picture of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under investigation. In this review, we evaluated whether C-reactive protein biomarker is able to predict the clinical outcomes or correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. The databases MEDLINE, Hinari, Google Scholar, and Google search were used to find potential studies published from COVID-19 epidemic until May 2021. A format prepared in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to extract the appropriate details from each original report. For further review, the extracted data were exported to STATA/MP version 16.0 software. Keywords including “COVID-19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “C-reactive protein,” among others were used to search relevant articles. Only studies which reported the average C-reactive protein value and COVID-19 disease stage outcomes were included. Twenty articles were included in the review. All studies found considerably higher level of C-reactive protein in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to mildly infected patients. This review evidenced that it is still there for a given biomarker to early identify the state of progression in asymptomatic and/or mildly infected individuals into severe disease; the level of C-reactive protein may be used in predicting the likelihood of disease progression. Findings from this review showed level of C-reactive protein is a good biomarker to predict the severity of COVID-19 disease. Although COVID-19 researches are at the early stages, investigation of C-reactive protein levels throughout the disease course may have paramount importance for clinicians in early detection of severe manifestations and subsequently improve the prognosis. However, further large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings.","Yitbarek, Getachew Yideg; Walle Ayehu, Gashaw; Asnakew, Sintayehu; Ayele, Fanos Yeshanew; Bariso Gare, Moyeta; Mulu, Anemut Tilahun; Dagnaw, Fentaw Teshome; Melesie, Biruk Demissie",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516378/,307

Six corn-soybean meal-based diets were used: 1) positive control (PC, formulated with <1.5 ppm DON corn), negative control (NC, formulated with 5.5 ppm DON corn), NC + FA1 (clay plus yeast cell wall extract), NC + FA2 (aluminosilicate), NC + FA3 (aluminosilicate plus fungal extract), and NC + FA4 (sodium metabisulfite, SMB). In exp. 1, 144 pigs (body weight [BW], 10.2 ± 0.1kg) were housed (4 pigs/pen), allocated to diets (n = 6) based on BW, and fed for 4-wk. The BW and feed intake were monitored weekly. On d 7, one pig/pen was bled for plasma and euthanized for organ weight and tissue samples. Assayed DON concentration in PC, NC, NC + FA4 was 0.29, 2.86, and 1.21 ppm, respectively. In wk-1, the average daily gain (ADG) of pigs fed NC + FA4 was not different (P > 0.05) to that of pigs fed PC diet but greater (P = 0.01) than for pigs fed NC without or with other FA. Pigs fed NC and NC + FA2 had lower (P = 0.026) average daily feed intake (ADFI) than pigs fed PC and NC + FA3. Pigs fed NC + FA4 had greater (P = 0.003) G:F than pigs fed the other diets. Diets had no effect (P > 0.05) on ADG, ADFI, and G: F after first week, plasma concentration of urea and creatinine or liver and spleen weight. Pigs fed NC diets had greater (P = 0.01) jejunal mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase 1 relative to pigs fed PC or NC plus FA. Jejunal histomorphology and mRNA expression of nutrient transporters, inflammatory cytokines, and tight junction proteins and ceca digesta concentration of short-chain fatty acids were not affected (P > 0.05) by the diet. In exp. 2, 24 barrows (BW 10.2 ± 0.3 kg) were individually placed in metabolism crates and allocated to four diets: PC, NC, NC + FA3, and NC + FA4 (n = 6) containing TiO2 as digestibility marker. Pigs were adjusted to diets for 5 d, followed by a 2-d grab fecal sample collection. Pigs fed PC and NC + FA4 diets had higher ATTD of dry matter, gross energy, and crude protein than NC fed pigs. The FA3 was intermediate in digestibility response. In conclusion, FA containing sequestering component plus fungal extract or SMB in DON-contaminated feed resulted in commensurate nursery pig performance to PC. The tested FA mitigated intestinal oxidative stress through decreased expression of genes for superoxide dismutase.","Mwaniki, Alice W; Buis, Quincy R; Trott, David; Huber, Lee-Anne; Yang, Chengbo; Kiarie, Elijah G",Translational animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txab050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085027/,307
61161,An Activity Tracker-Guided Physical Activity Program for Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy: Protocol for a Prospective Phase III Trial (OnkoFit I and II Trials).,2021-09-22,"BACKGROUND It is unknown whether cerebral oxygenation in patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) differs from that in patients without CAS. Thus, the effect of the presence of CAS ≥ 50 % on cerebral oxygenation during off-pump CABG in adult patients was evaluated retrospectively. METHODS Eleven patients with CAS ≥ 50% and 14 patients without CAS ≥ 50% were enrolled. Regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) was quantified using near-infrared spectroscopy. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, central venous pressure (CVP), and rSO2 at specific points were collected, and significant changes in each parameter were detected using repeated analysis of variance. Mean rSO2 and minimum rSO2 during anastomosis were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for cerebral desaturation (a decrease in rSO2 ≥ 10% from preoperative value). RESULTS Two patients with CAS ≥ 50% who received complete carotid artery stenting preoperatively were excluded from the analyses. In both patients with and without CAS, a decrease in rSO2 and cardiac index and an increase in CVP were observed during anastomosis. Mean (SD) maximum decrease in rSO2 from preoperative value was 9.2 (12.7) % on the left side and 8.1 (11.7) % on the right side in patients with CAS ≥ 50%, and 13.5 (11.3) % on the left side and 16.1 (9.8) % on the right side in patients without CAS ≥ 50% (p = 0.316). Neurological complications were not identified in both patients with and without CAS ≥ 50%. In multiple logistic regression analysis, CAS ≥ 50% was not associated with an increased risk of cerebral desaturation (OR 0.160, 95% CI 0.036-0.707, p = 0.016), and rSO2 decreased with decreasing cardiac index < 2.0 l/min/m(2) (OR 3.287, 95 % CI 2.218-5.076, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS CAS ≥ 50% was not an independent risk factor of cerebral desaturation during off-pump CABG.

61563,Communication practices for delivering health behaviour change conversations in primary care: a systematic review and thematic synthesis.,2019,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been around since the 1990s. A novel surgical approach known as laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been developed to reduce the port-related morbidities and improve the cosmetic outcomes of laparoscopic surgery, including totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the LESS TEP technique for inguinal hernia repair and compare the outcomes with the standard TEP approach. METHODS Between January and May 2009, 54 consecutive healthy patients (48 men and 6 women) underwent LESS TEP inguinal hernia repair at our institute. All procedures were performed using our homemade single port for simultaneous passage of the laparoscope and instruments. The perioperative data, including patient age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hernia characteristics, operative time, complications, length of hospital stay, return to normal activity, pain score, and cosmetic result, were prospectively collected. RESULTS All LESS TEP procedures were completed successfully without conversion to standard laparoscopic or open surgery. A total of 98 LESS TEP hernia repairs were performed in 54 patients and compared with 152 standard TEP operations. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in the standard TEP series (61.8 ± 26.0 vs. 70.9 ± 23.8 min, p = 0.04). Other perioperative parameters, including the length of hospital stay, time until return to full activity, complication rate, pain score, and cosmetic result, were all comparable between the two techniques. CONCLUSION Our short-term experience with LESS TEP inguinal hernia repair has shown that in experienced hands, inguinal hernia repair via the LESS TEP technique is as safe as the standard TEP technique. However, based on our evidence, we currently believe that the LESS TEP technique is not an efficacious surgical alternative to the standard TEP technique for inguinal hernias.","Tai, Huai-Ching; Lin, Chia-Da; Chung, Shiu-Dong; Chueh, Shih-Chieh Jeff; Tsai, Yao-Chou; Yang, Stephen Shei-Dei",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1636-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21667210/,307

We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knock-out (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild-type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L's window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- versus anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β+ cells compared to WT. At 21 d post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase (Arg)-1+ cells and Arg-1+ microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L's modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.","Wakley, Alexa A; Leeming, Reno; Malon, Jenn; Arabatzis, Taxiarhia J; Yuen Koh, Woon; Cao, Ling",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0218-18.2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417077/,307

Advance care planning is essential to assist patient autonomy and prevent non-beneficial medical interventions. AIM To describe early (taken within 72 h after hospital admission) resuscitation orders in oldest-old hospitalized with COVID-19. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS A cohort of patients aged 80 years and older admitted to the acute hospital in March and April 2020 with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited from 10 acute hospitals in Belgium. Recruitment was done through a network of geriatricians. RESULTS Overall, 766 octogenarians were admitted of whom 49 were excluded because no therapeutic relationship with the geriatrician and six because of incomplete case report form. Early decisions not to consider intensive care admission were taken in 474/711 (66.7%) patients. This subgroup was characterized by significantly higher age, higher number of comorbidities and higher frailty level. There was a significant association between the degree of the treatment limitation and the degree of premorbid frailty (p < 0.001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.6% in patients with an early decision not to consider intensive care admission (67.1% in persons who developed respiratory failure vs 16.7% in patients without respiratory failure (p < 0.001)). Of 104 patients without early decision not to consider intensive care admission but who developed respiratory failure, 59 were eventually not transferred to intensive care unit with in-hospital mortality of 25.4%; 45 were transferred to the intensive care unit with mortality of 64.4%.

Stranded juvenile northern elephant seals (NESs; Mirounga angustirostris) undergoing rehabilitation at the Marine Mammal Center experience high mortality rates due to severe arteritis caused by the lungworm, Otostrongylus circumlitis (OC), and there are currently no effective antemortem diagnostic tools for this disease. To characterize patterns of the acute-phase response in the NES, two APPs-serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP)-were measured, and serum protein electrophoresis was performed to measure albumin and globulin fractions in 81 serum samples from 58 NESs in four different health states: healthy, malnourished, preclinical for OC infection, or clinical for OC infection. Compared to healthy NESs (median, 11.2 mg/L), SAA concentrations were significantly increased in malnourished (33.9 mg/L), preclinical (247 mg/L), and clinical OC-infected NESs (328 mg/L) (P < 0.05). CRP concentrations were increased only in clinical OC-infected NESs (median, 53.9 mg/L) and were below detectable limits in the other three groups (<0.01 mg/L). These results show that SAA and CRP are positive APPs in NESs with OC infection, and that SAA may serve as the major APP for this species. Albumin : globulin ratios were significantly increased in malnourished NESs (median, 1.26) and decreased in clinical OC-infected NESs (0.53). As a result, albumin is a negative APP in the NES, similar to other mammalian species. APP monitoring can be helpful in detecting and monitoring inflammation in rehabilitating juvenile NESs.","Sheldon, Julie D; Johnson, Shawn P; Hernandez, Jorge A; Cray, Carolyn; Stacy, Nicole I",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2016-0267.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28920814/,307

METHODS The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed (2008-2019), Embase (2008-2019), and MEDLINE (2008-2019) were queried for literature reporting on PLC reconstruction or repair, with or without concomitant ligamentous or meniscal surgery. Data including type of surgery performed, concomitant procedures, and follow-up time were extracted. Complications recorded included intra- and postoperative complications. RESULTS After the intra- and postoperative complication data of 60 studies (1747 cases) were combined, surgical management of PLC injuries was associated with an intraoperative complication rate of 0.34% (range, 0%-2.8%) and a postoperative complication rate of 20% (range, 0%-51.2%). The most common postoperative complication was arthrofibrosis (range, 0%-20%). The overall infection rate was 1.3% (range, 0%-10%). Four cases of postoperative common peroneal nerve palsy were reported. Failure of reconstruction or repair was reported in 164 (9.4%) of all cases examined (range, 0%-37.1%). CONCLUSION Although the intraoperative rate of complications during PLC reconstructions is low, postoperative complications rates of 20% can be expected, including arthrofibrosis, infection, and neurovascular injury. PLC structures repaired or reconstructed failed in 9.4% of the cases.","Maheshwer, Bhargavi; Drager, Justin; John, Nalin S; Williams, Brady T; LaPrade, Robert F; Chahla, Jorge",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520981697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502894/,307
66056,Optimal sleep health among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-18,"A Japan Society of Clinical Oncology (JSCO)-hosted expert meeting was held in Japan on 27 October 2019 which comprised experts from the JSCO, the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology (JSMO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the Taiwan Oncology Society (TOS). The purpose of the meeting was to focus on what we have learnt from both microsatellite instability (MSI)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) biomarkers in predicting the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy, and the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions in predicting the efficacy of inhibitors of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) proteins, across a range of solid tumour types. The recent regulatory approvals of the anti PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab and the TRK inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib, based on specific tumour biomarkers rather than specific tumour type, have heralded a paradigm shift in cancer treatment approaches. The purpose of the meeting was to develop international expert consensus recommendations on the use of such tumour-agnostic treatments in patients with solid tumours. The aim was to generate a reference document for clinical practice, for pharmaceutical companies in the design of clinical trials, for ethics committees in the approval of clinical trial protocols and for regulatory authorities in relation to drug approvals, with a particular emphasis on diagnostic testing and patient selection.","Yoshino, T; Pentheroudakis, G; Mishima, S; Overman, M J; Yeh, K-H; Baba, E; Naito, Y; Calvo, F; Saxena, A; Chen, L-T; Takeda, M; Cervantes, A; Taniguchi, H; Yoshida, K; Kodera, Y; Kitagawa, Y; Tabernero, J; Burris, H; Douillard, J-Y",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32272210/,307
67558,Association of ERCC gene polymorphism with osteosarcoma risk.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to determine the factors influencing conversion from laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) to open surgery, and the effect of such conversion on the outcome. METHODS This retrospective single-center study included 70 consecutive patients undergoing LDP. The primary endpoint was the rate of conversion to open surgery during LDP. The secondary endpoints were determining the reasons for conversion to open surgery, with detailed analyses of these cases and a comparison of the surgical outcome with and without conversion. RESULTS Seven patients (10%) required conversion to open surgery during LDP. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was identified as a risk factor for conversion (p = 0.010). The reasons for conversion included technical difficulty (two bleeding, one severe adhesion) and pancreatic stump-related issues (two margin-positive, two stapling failures). Although the overall morbidity rate (29 vs. 11%, p = 0.48) and the rate of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (14 vs. 5%, p = 0.82) were no different for the patients with or without open conversion, the postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the former (median 15 vs. 10 days, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Careful preoperative assessment is required when planning LDP for PDAC. Although conversion to open surgery does not result in failure of LDP, efforts to reduce the duration of postoperative hospital stay and the occurrence of complications are desirable to improve the outcome of LDP.","Matsumoto, Ippei; Kamei, Keiko; Satoi, Shumpei; Murase, Takaaki; Matsumoto, Masataka; Kawaguchi, Kohei; Yoshida, Yuta; Lee, Dongha; Takebe, Atsushi; Nakai, Takuya; Takeyama, Yoshifumi",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02056-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577881/,307

There are no data on the impact of the IVDR on laboratories in the European Union. Methods Laboratory tests performed in UZ Leuven were divided in four groups: core laboratory, immunology, special chemistry, and molecular microbiology testing. Each test was classified as Conformité Européenne (CE)-IVD, modified/off-label CE-IVD, commercial Research Use Only (RUO) or LDT. Each matrix was considered a separate test. Results We found that 97.6% of the more than 11.5 million results/year were generated with a CE-IVD method. Of the 922 different laboratory tests, however, only 41.8% were CE-IVD, 10.8% modified/off-label CE-IVD, 0.3% RUO, and 47.1% LDT. Off-label CE-IVD was mainly used to test alternative matrices not covered by the claim of the manufacturer (e.g., pleural or peritoneal fluid). LDTs were mainly used for special chemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular testing. Excluding flow cytometry, the main reasons for the use of 377 LDTs were lack of a CE-IVD method (71.9%), analytical requirements (14.3%), and the fact the LDT was in use before CE-IVD available (11.9%). Conclusions While the large majority of results (97.6%) were generated with a CE-IVD method, only 41.8% of laboratory tests were CE-IVD. There is currently no alternative on the market for 71.5% of the 537 LDTs performed in our laboratory which do not fall within the scope of the current IVD directive (IVDD). Compliance with the IVDR will require a major investment of time and effort.","Vermeersch, Pieter; Van Aelst, Tobias; Dequeker, Elisabeth M C",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692695/,307
68348,Understanding and Using the ACGME Resident Surveys to Improve Your Residency Program.,2021,"Background: Coronavirus (CoV) is an emerging human pathogen causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) around the world. Earlier identification of biomarkers for SARS can facilitate detection and reduce the mortality rate of the disease. Thus, by integrated network analysis and structural modeling approach, we aimed to explore the potential drug targets and the candidate drugs for coronavirus medicated SARS. Methods: Differentially expression (DE) analysis of CoV infected host genes (HGs) expression profiles was conducted by using the Limma. Highly integrated DE-CoV-HGs were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: Using the Walktrap algorithm highly interconnected modules include module 1 (202 nodes); module 2 (126 nodes) and module 3 (121 nodes) modules were retrieved from the PPI network. MYC, HDAC9, NCOA3, CEBPB, VEGFA, BCL3, SMAD3, SMURF1, KLHL12, CBL, ERBB4, and CRKL were identified as potential drug targets (PDTs), which are highly expressed in the human respiratory system after CoV infection. Functional terms growth factor receptor binding, c-type lectin receptor signaling, interleukin-1 mediated signaling, TAP dependent antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, stimulatory T cell receptor signaling, and innate immune response signaling pathways, signal transduction and cytokine immune signaling pathways were enriched in the modules. Protein-protein docking results demonstrated the strong binding affinity (-314.57 kcal/mol) of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex which was selected as a drug target. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated the structural stability and flexibility of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex. Further, Wortmannin was proposed as a candidate drug to ERBB4 to control SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis through inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent macropinocytosis, MAPK signaling, and NF-kb singling pathways that regulate host cell entry, replication, and modulation of the host immune system. Conclusion: We conclude that CoV drug target ""ERBB4"" and candidate drug ""Wortmannin"" provide insights on the possible personalized therapeutics for emerging COVID-19.","Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Kaliamurthi, Satyavani; Peslherbe, Gilles H; Wei, Dong-Qing",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.50850.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968364/,307
68701,Common themes in early state policy responses to substance use disorder treatment during COVID-19.,2021-04-28,"The new disease concept of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which is a systemic inflammatory syndrome with multiple organ involvement after SARS-CoV2 infection, was established in 2020. MIS-C is common in Hispanic and black children in Europe and North America, with few reports in East Asians. A significant portion of patients with MIS-C develop Kawasaki disease (KD)-like symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis is challenging, especially in East Asia, where KD is most prevalent. No Japanese cases have been reported in the literatures so far. We report a case of MIS-C in Japan with KD-like symptoms. A 9-year-old Japanese boy, who was infected with SARS-CoV2 1 month previously along with his family, was admitted to our hospital owing to fever for 6 days and erythema mainly in the groyne and pubic area. He also had conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, and diarrhoea. His laboratory findings were as follows: WBC, 12,840/µL (lymphocytes, 4%); CRP, 22.6 mg/dL, pro-calcitonin, 1.8 ng/mL (normal, <0.50 ng/mL); NT pro-BNP, 7627 pg/mL (<125 pg/mL); and troponin T, 0.14 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). His cardiac function was normal. We initially diagnosed him with KD. His fever rapidly resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin and there were no coronary artery lesions. Desquamation of the fingers was observed later. Finally, a history of SARS-COV2 infection, his age, atypical skin rash, elevation of markers of inflammation and heart failure, and lymphopenia suggested the diagnosis of MIS-C rather than KD. Differentiation between KD and MIS-C is necessary even in Japan, especially in patients with atypical features of KD.","Fukuda, Sayaka; Kaneta, Mio; Miyake, Mayuko; Ohya, Takashi; Miyakawa, Kei; Iwamoto, Mari; Ito, Shuichi",Modern rheumatology case reports,https://doi.org/10.1080/24725625.2021.1920140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904379/,307

Having turned his institute toward nuclear physics, making it a pioneer institution in this emerging field, Bohr escaped from Nazi-occupied Denmark in 1943. Learning in England about the advanced state of the secret project to develop an atomic bomb, which Bohr had so far considered impracticable in a foreseeable future, he agreed to join the project. Bohr decided instantly that the prospect of such a weapon of mass destruction would require what he came to call an ""open world"" among nations, and he worked conscientiously toward this end until he died in 1962. In the process, statesmen, including Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as diplomats from several countries, came to encounter Bohr and his political mission. Although not as successful as his scientific achievements, his mission was considered by Bohr himself as equally important. Yet it constitutes a hitherto relatively neglected part of Bohr's career.1.","Aaserud, Finn",Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte,https://doi.org/10.1002/bewi.202000026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283305/,307

69858,"Correction to: Health-related qualify of life, angina type and coronary artery disease in patients with stable chest pain.",2020-06-29,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) first emerged in Vietnam in 2009. In this study, the complete genomes of three Vietnamese PEDV isolates were characterized. These three isolates were isolated from 3-day-old pigs experiencing diarrhea. Two isolates were from swine farms in the south, and the other was from northern Vietnam. The whole genome sequences of these isolates are 28,035 nucleotides in length and have characteristics similar to those of other PEDV isolates. All three Vietnamese PEDV isolates share 99.8 % and 99.6 % sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively, and have insertions of four amino acids (GENQ) and one amino acid (N) at positions 56-59 and 140, respectively, and one deletion of two amino acids (DG) at positions 160-161. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome revealed that the three Vietnamese PEDV isolates are grouped together with new variants from China from 2011 to 2012 and are genetically distinct from US isolates and the classical PEDV variant. The results suggest that Vietnamese PEDV isolates are new variants, as evidenced by their genetic composition of insertions and a deletion in the spike gene, and they might have originated from the same ancestor as the Chinese PEDV strain. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of PEDV in Vietnam.","Vui, Dam Thi; Thanh, To Long; Tung, Nguyen; Srijangwad, Anchalee; Tripipat, Thitima; Chuanasa, Taksina; Nilubol, Dachrit",Archives of virology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2463-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026958/,307

Most papers refer to the need for respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase; however, that fact that the infection also affects other organ systems has to be considered in rehabilitation interventions. Long-term symptoms in many cases severely limit activity and participation and alter quality of life, leading to rehabilitation needs. This paper proposes a phase-adapted model of linking the acute, post-acute, and long-term symptoms of COVID-19 with the well-established matrix of acute, post-acute, and long-term rehabilitation services. A review of currently available recommendations for phase-adapted rehabilitation strategies, including the relevance of prehabilitation within this context, is provided.","Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Nugraha, Boya; Martin, Lidia Teixido",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901039/,307

Under the current extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which social distancing is key to limiting the spread of the virus, the model used to provide care to transplant recipients has undergone a very rapid transformation. In the spirit of medical distancing, we have been using the donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) test for screening for rejection. METHODS This article describes our experience with this approach between March 15th and May 20th, 2020. RESULTS This test was obtained for-cause in 23 patients and for monitoring in 9 patients. Normal results aided in forgoing biopsy in 63% of the patients for whom the test was obtained in the outpatient setting. The test is neither 100% sensitive nor specific for rejection; however, when used in combination with the available clinical information, it can be used for determining whether bringing in a transplant recipient into a medical facility is necessary. CONCLUSIONS In the event COVID-19 becomes a long-term challenge for our community, noninvasive biomarkers such as the dd-cfDNA may become more relevant than ever in enhancing our ability to care for our transplant patients while maximizing the distancing measures.","Garg, Neetika; Hidalgo, Luis G; Aziz, Fahad; Parajuli, Sandesh; Mohamed, Maha; Mandelbrot, Didier A; Djamali, Arjang",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800517/,307

To identify potential candidate species to investigate these interactions, accurate knowledge of the distribution of the endosymbiont within Culicoides populations is needed. We used conventional and nested PCR assays to screen Cardinium infection in 337 individuals of 25 Culicoides species from both Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. Infections were observed in several vector species including C. imicola and the Pulicaris complex (C. pulicaris, C. bysta, C. newsteadi and C. punctatus) with varying prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Gyrase B gene grouped all new isolates within 'group C' of the genus, a clade that has to date been exclusively described in Culicoides.

The authors describe their experience with the laparoscopic approach to attempted reversal for patients with an exteriorized intestine. METHODS A consecutive series of patients under the care of a single surgeon (D.B.) underwent laparoscopic restoration of intestinal continuity (LapRICon). All the patients first underwent exclusion of intraabdominal sepsis with computed tomography (CT) scanning and then preoperative localization of proximal and distal bowel ends via water-soluble contrast studies. Stomal sites were used for initial access, establishment of capnoperitoneum, and formation of anastomoses extracorporeally. All adhesiolysis and mobilization of bowel ends were performed intracorporeally. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected for all the patients. Return of intestinal function, overall hospital length of stay, and postoperative complications were collected. Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS A total of 13 patients (6 women) were followed up for 9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5-16 months). The median age of the patients was 39 years (IQR, 28-64 years). Nine patients were categorized as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 1. One patient was ASA 2, and the remaining patients were ASA 3. The median colorectal physiologic and operative severity scores for the enumeration of mortality and morbidity (CR-POSSUM) were 0.68 (IQR, 0.68-1.72). The intraoperative blood loss was minimal (median 30 ml; IQR, 20-125 ml). The median operative duration was 240 min (IQR, 180-240 min), and a median of 4 ports (IQR, 3-5 ports) were used. Enterocolonic anastomoses were fashioned in six patients, enterorectal anastomoses in two patients, and enteroentero anastomoses in three patients. A single patient had multiple anastomoses. The median time to return of intestinal function was 5 days (IQR, 3-13 days), and the overall hospital stay was 8 days (IQR, 5-24 days). Four complications (25%) (2 recurrent fistulas, 1 anastomotic leak, and 1 open conversion) occurred in this series of patients.

Methods This retrospective study enrolled 31 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020. Lung ultrasounds were performed in all cases to evaluate the ultrasound manifestations of the patient's lung lesions and to determine the lung ultrasound scores (LUS). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for the multifactor analysis of 7 candidate parameters, including the LUS and the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the LUS. Results Lung ultrasound images of COVID-19 patients mainly reflected the presence of interstitial pulmonary lesions (90.3%, 28/31). The lung lesions were primarily distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. Multivariate analyses identified the oxygenation index, the LUS, and the lymphocyte count as factors related to the progression to severe-critical disease in COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). With a cut-off value of 9.5, the area under the ROC curve was 0.910. The LUS showed a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 93.0%, respectively (P≤0.001), with an overall accuracy of 75%. Conclusions The lung ultrasound findings in COVID-19 patients were mainly and specifically manifested as interstitial lesions involving the peripheral zones of the lung.

75959,Utilizing Telemedicine in a Novel Approach to COVID-19 Management and Patient Experience in the Emergency Department.,2020-08-18,"Objectives: A prospective longitudinal single-centre study to assess the mental health impact of COVID-19 on nurses working in the frontline during the first wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Belgium, 2020.Patients and Methods: The study was performed between April 1st and 30 June 2020. Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4 weeks later and 8 weeks later.Results: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.Conclusion: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU. These results highlight the importance of psychological support and proper long-term follow-up to mitigate this impact.","Van Steenkiste, Eveline; Schoofs, Jessie; Gilis, Shauni; Messiaen, Peter",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1903660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779529/,307

We evaluated the reliability and consistency of the system in newborns. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 1,046 infants 0 to 90 days old undergoing ultrasound for hydronephrosis 243 were randomly selected for study inclusion. Seven readers (4 radiologists and 3 urologists) at 4 institutions classified complete, de-identified ultrasound studies on a Web based platform. Interobserver and intra-observer agreement was evaluated using the Fleiss kappa statistic. RESULTS Interobserver agreement for Urinary Tract Dilation risk score was moderate among the 7 readers (kappa = 0.421, 95% CI 0.404-0.438). Interobserver agreement using the Society for Fetal Urology scale was worse than with the Urinary Tract Dilation classification (kappa = 0.344, 95% CI 0.330-0.359). All 7 readers assigned the same Urinary Tract Dilation score in 19.3% of cases (47 of 243). In 38.7% of cases (94 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a Urinary Tract Dilation score different from that assigned by the other readers. In 7% of cases (17 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a score of P0/P1, while at least 3 readers scored the same cases as P2/P3. At least 3 different Urinary Tract Dilation risk scores were assigned to the same patient in 30.45% of patients (74 of 243). Among individual Urinary Tract Dilation elements calyceal dilatation and bladder status had the highest disagreement. Five readers regraded 80 cases and agreed with their previous Urinary Tract Dilation risk score in 63.8% to 75.0% of cases (kappa 0.458 to 0.729). CONCLUSIONS Interobserver agreement using the Urinary Tract Dilation grading system is fair to moderate, with variable agreement on individual elements of the system.

81362,Rammya Mathew: We must let patients choose how to access primary care.,2020-07-07,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to analyze the anatomical structures relevant for endodontic microsurgery in the mandibular posterior teeth using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 963 mandibular posterior teeth were analyzed in CBCT scans from 133 patients. The buccolingual and mesiodistal dimensions of the root and the buccal bone thickness overlying the root were measured at the site of root resection (apical 3 mm). At this location, the relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root was classified into three types (separated, contact, and exposed), and the distance from the root apex to the mandibular canal was measured. RESULTS The thickest buccolingual dimension of the roots was found in the mesial roots of first molars, at 5.59 ± 0.97 mm. The buccal bone thickness overlying the root became thicker in posterior tooth locations. In the first premolar and first molar mesial root, contact was the most common type of relationship between the buccal cortical bone and root. As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the distance from the apex to the mandibular canal became shorter. CONCLUSIONS As the position of the teeth became more posterior, the buccal bone thickness increased and the distance to the mandibular canal became closer; therefore, particular attention is required for posterior teeth. The first premolar and the first molar mesial root are often in contact with the buccal cortical bone, which may allow infections to spread to the buccal structure more easily and negatively affect for post-surgical healing. CLINICAL RELEVANCE When planning and performing endodontic microsurgery, understanding the anatomical structure of the surgical site will help minimize tissue damage and reduce complications.","Jeon, Kug Jin; Lee, Chena; Choi, Yoon Joo; Han, Sang-Sun",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-020-03562-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901333/,307

82230,The impact of and response to the COVID-19 pandemic on a hospital palliative care team.,2021-03-01,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world. The metabolic disease type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly increases the risk of developing active TB. Effective new TB vaccine candidates and novel therapeutic interventions are required to meet the challenges of global TB eradication. Recent evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a significant role in how the host responds to infection, injury and neoplastic changes. Animal models that closely reflect human physiology are crucial in assessing new treatments and to decipher the underlying immunological defects responsible for increased TB susceptibility in comorbid patients. In this study, using a diet-induced murine T2D model that reflects the etiopathogenesis of clinical T2D and increased TB susceptibility, we investigated how the intestinal microbiota may impact the development of T2D, and how the gut microbial composition changes following a very low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our data revealed a substantial intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in T2D mice compared to non-diabetic animals. The observed differences were comparable to previous clinical reports in TB patients, in which it was shown that Mtb infection causes rapid loss of microbial diversity. Furthermore, diversity index and principle component analyses demonstrated distinct clustering of Mtb-infected non-diabetic mice vs. Mtb-infected T2D mice. Our findings support a broad applicability of T2D mice as a tractable small animal model for studying distinct immune parameters, microbiota and the immune-metabolome of TB/T2D comorbidity. This model may also enable answers to be found to critical outstanding questions about targeted interventions of the gut microbiota and the gut-lung axis.","Sathkumara, Harindra D; Eaton, Janet L; Field, Matt A; Govan, Brenda L; Ketheesan, Natkunam; Kupz, Andreas",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179725/,307

Our main objective was to demonstrate the ability of the RER, indirectly measured by the anaesthesia respirator, to predict the occurrence of postoperative complications following laparoscopic surgery. We performed an observational, prospective and monocentric study. Haemodynamic and respiratory parameters were collected at several timepoints to calculate the RER by a non-volumetric method: RER = (FetCO2-FiCO2)/(FiO2-FetO2). Fifty patients were prospectively included. Nine patients (18%) had at least one postoperative complication. The mean RER was significantly higher for the subgroup of patients with complications than the subgroup without (1.04 ± 0.27 vs 0.88 ± 0.13, p < 0.05). The RER could predict the occurrence of post-operative complications with an area under the ROC curve of 0.73 (95% CI 0.59-0.85, p = 0.021). The best cut off was 0.98, with a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 88%. One hour after insufflation, the FiO2-FetO2 difference was significantly lower and the RER was significantly higher in the complications subgroup than in the subgroup without complications (4.4/- 1.6% vs 5.8/- 1.2%, p = 0.001 and 0.95 [0.85-1.04] vs 0.83 [0.75-0.92], p = 0.04, respectively).

We tested the hypothesis that FDA-approved antiretrovirals, antibiotics, and antimalarials will effectively inhibit COVID-19 two major drug targets, coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified. The study showed that COVID-19 likely originated from bat, owing to the over 90% genomic similarity observed, and that lopinavir, levofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine might serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for additional optimization and drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

84695,Pharmacists Should Be Part of the Primary Care Team.,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE The course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 may be aggravated by bioaerosols containing other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, occurring mainly in the occupational environment. Hence, the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 should address such a possibility in the anamnesis, treatment and final recommendations for avoiding of adverse exposure. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE As SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the respiratory system and the severe manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, diagnostics should include the following clinical and laboratory examinations: chest X-ray; high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); pulmonary function tests; arterial-blood gas test; genetic tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, in the future with the use of highly specific and sensitive nano-based biosensors; tests for the presence of specific immunity against the antigens of microorganisms causing other infectious or allergic pulmonary diseases (in the case of anamnestic indications). Because an universally accepted treatment for COVID-19 does not exist, the hitherto prescribed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs should be used be with caution. In many cases, a better alternative could be a safe supportive therapy, such as supplementation of the diet with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements. SUMMARY The most important preventive measures against COVID-19 should include: vaccination; the use of filter or surgical masks; disinfection and sterilization; maintaining of well-functioning ventilation and air conditioning systems; reduction of the community air pollution which has been identified as an important factor increasing the COVID-19 severity. In the choice of preventive measures, the above should be considered for their potential efficacy against other bioaerosols as potential disease-aggravating agents.","Mackiewicz, Barbara; Lemieszek, Marta Kinga; Dutkiewicz, Jacek",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/133896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775065/,307

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 th, 2020. Although the global number of COVID-19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive assessment of sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have contributed to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak so far. As a group of early career scientists and the next generation of African scientific leaders with experience of working in medical and diverse health research fields in both SSA and resource-rich countries, we present a unique perspective on the current public health interventions to fight COVID-19 in Africa. Our perspective is based on extensive review of the available scientific publications, official technical reports and announcements released by governmental and non-governmental health organizations as well as from our personal experiences as workers on the COVID-19 battlefield in SSA. We documented public health interventions implemented in seven SSA countries including Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, the existing gaps and the important components of disease control that may strengthen SSA response to future outbreaks.","Umviligihozo, Gisele; Mupfumi, Lucy; Sonela, Nelson; Naicker, Delon; Obuku, Ekwaro A; Koofhethile, Catherine; Mogashoa, Tuelo; Kapaata, Anne; Ombati, Geoffrey; Michelo, Clive M; Makobu, Kimani; Todowede, Olamide; Balinda, Sheila N",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16070.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984549/,307

86001,Prevalence of overweight/obesity and its associated factors among a sample of Moroccan type 2 diabetes patients.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Since December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases caused by COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. People are generally susceptible to COVID-19 because people lack immunity to this new virus. With the spread of this epidemic disease from Wuhan, a national outbreak soon appeared, and now many countries have this disease. Unfortunately, no effective drug for COVID-19 treatment has been found so far. METHODS We designed a retrospective study based on patients admitted to The Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University from January 22, 2020, to February 25, 2020, with diagnosed COVID-19. We analyzed correlations between RT-PCR negative time and laboratory indicators, then divided all cases into 2 groups according to oxygenation index, data of RT-PCR negative time and related laboratory indicators of the two groups were com-pared. RESULTS We collected 84 confirmed patients whose RT-PCR had turned negative, including 23 patients with the lowest oxygenation index ≤ 300 mmHg and 61 patients had > 300 mmHg. There was a positive correlation between the RT-PCR negative time and age, WBC count, LDH, SCr. There were statistically significant differences in fever numbers, WBC count, lymphocyte count, CRP, ALT, AST, albumin, LDH, SCr, D-dimer, and fibrinogen between the two groups based on the oxygenation index. CONCLUSIONS Age, WBC count, LDH, and SCr may be related to the duration of COVID-19 disease. Fever, WBC count, lymphocyte count, CRP, ALT, AST, albumin, LDH, SCr, D-dimer, and fibrinogen are related to the severity of acute lung injury.","Zhang, Yukun; Chen, Qing; Yao, Lin; Chen, Jun; Yu, Xin",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491433/,307
86022,The Adoption of Video Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic by VA Home Based Primary Care.,2020-12-07,"INTRODUCTION Pneumonia is both the most common type of lower respiratory tract infection and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 raised an extremely serious concern, because its most frequent clinical presentation was pneumonia. Features such as sex play an active role in the incidence and outcomes of pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate differences between sexes concerning COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS This was a retrospective, multicentre study that enrolled 340 consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia. Of these patients, 219 were males (64.4%) and 121, females (35.6%). Primary endpoints were differences between both sexes as per clinical features, laboratory and radiologic results, and inhospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included differences between both sexes and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Males admitted to the COVID-19 Unit were older than females (74.5 ± 15.7 vs. 64.5 ± 11.9). Cardiovascular disorders were more frequent in males (19.17% vs 13.25%), whereas obesity was more common in females (54.5% vs 37.45%). In-hospital and 30-day mortality were higher in males than in females (23.3% vs 15.7%; 24.6% vs 19.8%, respectively). No differences were observed in hospital stay; however, males had a longer ICU stay when compared with females (11.04±5.4 vs 7.05±3.4). Variables associated with a higher mortality rate included older age, a lower number of lymphocytes upon admission and higher levels of ferritin and troponin upon admission. CONCLUSIONS Males had significantly higher mortality and longer ICU stay than females. More comorbidities in males than in females could explain the difference in mortality rates. The protective role of genetic factors can partially explain the better outcomes observed in female patients with COVID-19.","Banfi, Paolo; Garuti, Giancarlo; Diaz de Teran, Teresa; Ruiz, Juan; Ferraioli, Gianluca; Russo, Giuseppe; Casu, Francesco; Gandolfo, Corinna; Cinque, Enrico; Gallo, Fabrizio; Cilloniz, Catia; Torres, Antoni; Nicolini, Antonello",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.21.04165-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618509/,307

We hypothesize that this new methodology is superior to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy alone. Methods and design ERic Acute StrokE Recanalization is an investigator-initiated prospective single-arm, multicenter, controlled, open label study to compare the safety and effectiveness of a new recanalization device and distal access catheter in acute ischemic stroke patients with symptoms attributable to acute ischemic stroke and vessel occlusion of the internal cerebral artery or middle cerebral artery. Study outcome The primary effectiveness endpoint is the volume of saved tissue. Volume of saved tissue is defined as difference of the actual infarct volume and the brain volume that is predicted to develop infarction by using an optimized high-level machine learning model that is trained on data from a historical cohort treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator. Sample size estimates Based on own preliminary data, 45 patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria need to complete the study to show an efficacy >38% with a power of 80% and a one-sided alpha error risk of 0.05 (based on a one sample t-test). Discussion ERic Acute StrokE Recanalization is the first prospective study in interventional stroke therapy to use predictive analytics as primary and secondary endpoint.

We used a multi-generation pedigree and detailed phenotypic records, spanning 18 years, to estimate the quantitative genetic influences on the timing of hibernation emergence in a wild population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus). Emergence date was significantly heritable [h(2) = 0.22 ± 0.05 (in females) and 0.34 ± 0.14 (in males)], and there was a positive genetic correlation (r(G) = 0.76 ± 0.22) between male and female emergence dates. In adult females, the heritabilities of body mass at emergence and oestrous date were h(2) = 0.23 ± 0.09 and h(2) = 0.18 ± 0.12, respectively. The date of hibernation emergence has been hypothesized to have evolved so as to synchronize subsequent reproduction with upcoming peaks in vegetation abundance. In support of this hypothesis, although levels of phenotypic variance in emergence date were higher than oestrous date, there was a highly significant genetic correlation between the two (r(G) = 0.98 ± 0.01). Hibernation is a prominent feature in the annual cycle of many small mammals, but our understanding of its influences lags behind that for phenological traits in many other taxa. Our results provide the first insight into its quantitative genetic influences and thus help contribute to a more general understanding of its evolutionary significance.","Lane, J E; Kruuk, L E B; Charmantier, A; Murie, J O; Coltman, D W; Buoro, M; Raveh, S; Dobson, F S",Journal of evolutionary biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02334.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21682787/,307

Patients with asthma were significantly affected by the 2019/2020 bushfire season with an increased burden compared to the general population. Patients with controlled asthma do not appear to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection or death than the general population. Personalized medicine is proposed as the next era for asthma management, with treatable traits as a strategy to implement personalized medicine into practice. Patient engagement in personalized medicine strategies is important and needs to be further explored. Oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in asthma is common and contributes a major burden. OCS stewardship is recommended. Biologic therapies reduce exacerbations of severe asthma and biomarkers can be used to predict treatment responders. Epithelia at mucosal and cutaneous surfaces are components in asthma pathogenesis, through airway immunity and inflammation. Dysregulation of resident microbial communities in the lung, gut and skin microbiome is relevant to asthma pathogenesis, but there are still many unknowns in this field.","Wang, Gang; McDonald, Vanessa M",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164877/,307

Rates of opioid use and opioid agonist maintenance treatment have increased substantially in recent years, particularly among women. Trends and outcomes of opioids use on fertility, pregnancy and breastfeeding, and longer-term child developmental outcomes have not been well-described. Here, we review the existing evidence on the health effects of opioid use on female fertility, pregnancy, breastmilk and the exposed infant. We find that the current literature is primarily concentrated on the impact of opioid use in pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, with little exploration of its effects on fertility. Studies are limited in number, with small sample sizes, and are hampered by methodological challenges related to confounding and other potential biases. Opioid use is becoming more prevalent. More research is needed to better elucidate its effects on reproductive health among younger women to support the development of evidence-based recommendations for safe prescription practices and public health messaging.","Corsi, Daniel J; Sq Murphy, Malia",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650271/,307

Here, we show that the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of U2OS cells harbors triglyceride synthesis enzymes, including ACSL3, AGPAT2, GPAT3/GPAT4, and DGAT1/DGAT2, and generates nuclear LDs in situ. mTOR inhibition increases nuclear LDs by inducing the nuclear translocation of lipin-1 phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase. Seipin, a protein essential for normal cytoplasmic LD formation in the ER, is absent in the INM. Knockdown of seipin increases nuclear LDs and PA in the nucleus, whereas seipin overexpression decreases these. Seipin knockdown also up-regulates lipin-1β expression, and lipin-1 knockdown decreases the effect of seipin knockdown on nuclear LDs without affecting PA redistribution. These results indicate that seipin is not directly involved in nuclear LD formation but instead restrains it by affecting lipin-1 expression and intracellular PA distribution.","Sołtysik, Kamil; Ohsaki, Yuki; Tatematsu, Tsuyako; Cheng, Jinglei; Maeda, Asami; Morita, Shin-Ya; Fujimoto, Toyoshi",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202005026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315072/,307

Alchemilla vulgaris in glycerine (Neo Mucosal Activator®) suppresses inflammatory response, possibly relieving sore throat. Methods We enrolled 94 patients (age ≥ 18 years) scheduled for thoracic surgery using double-lumen tube intubation. Before intubation, 0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone was administered intravenously and 2 ml of normal saline was sprayed into the oropharyngeal cavity (Group D; n = 45), or 0.04 ml/kg normal saline was administered intravenously and 1 g of Neo Mucosal Activator® mixed with 1 ml of normal saline was sprayed into the oropharyngeal cavity (Group N; n = 43), in a double blind and prospectively randomized manner. Postoperative sore throat and hoarseness were recorded using a numeral rating scale and a 4-point scale to detect a change in voice quality following tracheal extubation (at 1, 6, and 24 h). The primary outcome was the incidence of sore throat at 24 h following surgery. The secondary outcomes were incidence and severity of sore throat and hoarseness. Results There were no significant differences in the incidence of sore throat at 24 h following surgery (57.8% vs. 46.5%; P = 0.290) or in the incidence and intensity of sore throat and hoarseness at 1, 6, and 24 h following surgery between the groups. Conclusions A. vulgaris in glycerine did not significantly differ from dexamethasone for preventing sore throat and hoarseness owing to intubation.","Chung, Chan Jong; Jeong, Seong Yeop; Jeong, Joon Ho; Kim, Sung Wan; Lee, Kyung Hyun; Kim, Jeong Ho; Park, Sang Yoong; Choi, So Ron",Anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.17085/apm.20082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866772/,307

93964,Systematic review of clinical prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care.,2019,"BACKGROUND During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) many studies have investigated laboratory biomarkers in management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients, however to date, few have investigated arterial blood gas (ABG), acid-base and blood pressure (BP) patterns. The aim of the study is to assess the ABG and acid-base patterns, BP findings and their association with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated COVID-19 ICU in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission ABG, serum electrolytes, renal function and BP readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26 March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS A total of 56 ICU patients had admission ABG performed at the time of ICU admission. An alkalaemia (pH > 7.45) was observed in 36 (64.3%) patients. A higher arterial pH [median 7.48 (IQR: 7.45-7.51 vs. 7.46 (IQR: 7.40-7.48), p=0.049] and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood [PaO2; median 7.9kPa (IQR 7.3- 9.6) vs. 6.5kPa (IQR: 5.2-7.3), p=<0.001] were significantly associated with survival. Survivors also tended to have a higher systolic BP [median: 144mmHg (IQR: 134- 152) vs. 139mmHg (IQR: 125-142), p=0.078] and higher arterial HCO3 [median: 28.0mmol/L (IQR: 25.7- 28.8) vs. 26.3mmol/L (IQR: 24.3-27.9); p=0.059). CONCLUSIONS The majority of the study population admitted to ICU had an alkalaemia on ABG. A higher pH and lower PaO2 on ABG analysis were significantly associated with survival.","Bezuidenhout, Morne C; Wiese, Owen J; Moodley, Desiree; Maasdorp, Elizna; Davids, Mogamat Razeen; Koegenlenberg, Coenraad Fn; Lalla, Usha; Khine-Wamono, Aye Aye; Zemlin, Annalise E; Allwood, Brian W",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004563220972539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103442/,307

In the liver, there is a large body of evidence showing a protective and pro-regenerative role for IL6 cis and trans signaling. While a few studies suggest a pathological role for IL6 trans-signaling in the liver. IL11 is often thought of as similar to IL6 and redundancy has been inferred. However, recent studies reveal that IL6R and IL11RA are expressed on dissimilar cell types and these cytokines actually have very different roles in biology and pathology. In the liver, IL6R is mostly expressed on immune cells, whereas IL11RA is highly expressed on hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, both of which exhibit autocrine IL11 activity. In contrast to the beneficial effects of IL6 in the liver, IL11 causes liver disease and its expression in stromal and parenchymal cells leads to fibrosis, inflammation, steatosis and hepatic failure. In this review, we address IL6 and IL11 in the context of liver function. We end by discussing the possibility of IL6 gain-of-function versus IL11 inhibition as therapeutic approaches to treat liver disease.","Widjaja, Anissa A; Chothani, Sonia P; Cook, Stuart A",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1761203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530750/,307

The purpose of this study was to compare patient outcomes after these treatment strategies. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for English language papers up to April 24, 2020, identifying 2,129 papers. STUDY SELECTION Studies evaluating complications in elderly patients treated for distal femur fractures with either immediate DFR or surgical fixation were included. Studies with mean patient age <55 years, nontraumatic indications for DFR, or SF with non-locking plates were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Two studies provided Level II or III evidence while the remaining 28 studies provided Level IV evidence. Studies were formally evaluated for methodologic quality using established criteria. Treatment failure between groups was compared using an incidence rate ratio. DATA SYNTHESIS Treatment failure was defined for both surgical fixation and arthroplasty as complications requiring a major reoperation for reasons such as mechanical failure, nonunion, deep infection, aseptic loosening, or extensor mechanism disruption. There were no significant differences in complication rates or knee range of motion between SF and DFR. CONCLUSION SF and DFR for the treatment of geriatric distal femur fractures demonstrate similar overall complication rates. Given the available evidence, no strong conclusions on the comparative effectiveness between the two treatments can be definitively made. More rigorous prospective research comparing SF versus DFR to treat acute geriatric distal femur fractures is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level IV.

100534,Global forum on telemedicine: connecting the world through partnerships.,2008,"Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat and limit the development of severe COVID-19 disease. Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent, has been shown to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero cells at a concentration of 5 μM. These limited in vitro results triggered the investigation of ivermectin as a treatment option to alleviate COVID-19 disease. In April 2021, the World Health Organization stated, however, the following: ""the current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive"". It is speculated that the in vivo concentration of ivermectin is too low to exert a strong antiviral effect. Here, we performed a head-to head comparison of the antiviral activity of ivermectin and the structurally related, but metabolically more stable, moxidectin in multiple in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including physiologically relevant human respiratory epithelial cells. Both moxidectin and ivermectin exhibited antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells. Subsequent experiments revealed that the compounds predominantly act on a step after virus cell entry. Surprisingly, however, in human airway-derived cell models, moxidectin and ivermectin failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, even at a concentration of 10 μM. These disappointing results call for a word of caution in the interpretation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of drugs solely based on Vero cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that, even by using a high-dose regimen of ivermectin or switching to another drug in the same class are unlikely to be useful for treatment against SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Dinesh Kumar, Nilima; Ter Ellen, Bram M; Bouma, Ellen M; Troost, Berit; van de Pol, Denise P I; van der Ende-Metselaar, Heidi H; van Gosliga, Djoke; Apperloo, Leonie; Carpaij, Orestes A; van den Berge, Maarten; Nawijn, Martijn C; Stienstra, Ymkje; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A; Smit, Jolanda M",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01543-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633839/,307

Analysis of the spectra included the perimeter model and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. With the increasing number of phenyl substituents, the molecule is transformed from a positive hard (△HOMO > △LUMO) to a soft (△HOMO ≈ △LUMO) chromophore. This is manifested by a drastic decrease of the absorption intensity in the (0-0) region of the Q band and by the strongly altered ratio of MCD intensities in the Q and Soret regions. Such behavior can be readily predicted using perimeter model, by analyzing frontier orbital shifts caused by various perturbations: alkyl and aryl substitution, insertion of a metal, and deviations from planarity. TDDFT calculations confirm the trends predicted by the perimeter model, but fail, in cases of less symmetrical derivatives, to properly reproduce the MCD spectra in the Soret region.

102873,Hormonal Contraceptives and the Acquisition of Sexually Transmitted Infections: An Updated Systematic Review.,2019,"Understanding how structural, social and psychosocial factors come to affect our health resulting in health inequalities is more relevant now than ever as trends in mortality gaps between rich and poor appear to have widened over the past decades. To move beyond description, we need to hypothesise about how structural and social factors may cause health outcomes. In this paper, we examine the construction of health over the life course through the lens of influential theoretical work. Based on concepts developed by scholars from different disciplines, we propose a novel framework for research on social-to-biological processes which may be important contributors to health inequalities. We define two broad sets of mechanisms that may help understand how socially structured exposures become embodied: mechanisms of exogenous and endogenous origin. We describe the embodiment dynamic framework, its uses and how it may be combined with an intersectional approach to examine how intermeshed oppressions affect social exposures which may be expressed biologically. We explain the usefulness of this framework as a tool for carrying out research and providing scientific evidence to challenge genetic essentialism, often used to dismiss social inequalities in health.","Kelly-Irving, Michelle; Delpierre, Cyrille",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376565/,307

105618,Risk-taking behaviors and falls in community-dwelling older adults: a scoping review protocol.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND The hybrid close-loop system (HCL) is a rapidly emerging treatment method for type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the long-term effectiveness of the system remains unclear. This study investigates the influence of the HCL on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1D in a real-life setting during the first year on HCL. METHODS This retrospective study included all the patients (n=111) aged 3 to 16 years with T1D who initiated the HCL system between 1st of December 2018 and 1st of December 2019 in the Helsinki University Hospital. Time in range (TIR), HbA1c, mean sensor glucose (SG) value, time below range (TBR), and SG coefficient of variance (CV) were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The changes over time were analyzed with a repeated mixed model adjusted with baseline glycemic control. RESULTS After the initiation of HCL, all measures of glycemic control, except HbA1c, improved and the effect lasted throughout the study period. Between 0 and 12 months, TIR increased (β=-2.5 [95%CI: -3.6-(-1.3)], p<0.001), whereas mean SG values (β=-0.7 [95%CI: -0.9-(-0.4)]), TBR (β=-2.5 [95%CI: -3.6-(-1.3)]), and SG CV (β=-4.5 [95%CI: -6.3-[-2.8]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). Importantly, the changes occurred regardless of the age of the patient. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of glycemic control, except HbA1c, improved significantly after the initiation of the HCL system and the favorable effect lasted throughout the follow-up. These results support the view that HCL is an efficacious treatment modality for children and adolescents with T1D of all ages. This article is protected by copyright.

106679,Assessment of anxiety and health-related quality of life in patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial occlusive disease.,2020,"Background We aim to evaluate the speed and rates of reperfusion in tandem large vessel occlusion acute stroke patients undergoing upfront cervical lesion treatment (Neck-First: angioplasty and/or stent before thrombectomy) as compared to direct intracranial occlusion therapy (Head-First) in a large international multicenter cohort. Methods The Thrombectomy In TANdem Lesions (TITAN) collaboration pooled individual data of prospectively collected thrombectomy international databases for all consecutive anterior circulation tandem patients who underwent emergent thrombectomy. The co-primary outcome measures were rates of successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3) and time from groin puncture to successful reperfusion. Results In total, 289 patients with tandem atherosclerotic etiology were included in the analysis (182 Neck-First and 107 Head-First patients). Except for differences in the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS; median 8 [range 7-10] Neck-First vs. 7 [range 6-8] Head-First; p < 0.001) and cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) lesion severity (complete occlusion in 35% of the Neck-First vs. 57% of the Head-First patients; p < 0.001), patient characteristics were well balanced. After adjustments, there was no difference in successful reperfusion rates between the study groups (odds ratio associated with Neck-First: 1.18 [95% confidence interval, 0.60-2.17]). The time to successful reperfusion from groin puncture was significantly shorter in the Head-First group after adjustments (median 56 min [range 39-90] vs. 70 [range 50-102]; p = 0.001). No significant differences in the rates of full reperfusion, symptomatic hemorrhage, 90-day independence, or mortality were observed. Sensitivity analysis excluding patients with complete cervical ICA occlusion yielded similar results. Conclusions The upfront approach of the intracranial lesion in patients with tandem large vessel occlusion strokes leads to similar reperfusion rates but faster reperfusion as compared to initial cervical revascularization followed by mechanical thrombectomy. Controlled studies are warranted.","Haussen, Diogo C; Turjman, Francis; Piotin, Michel; Labreuche, Julien; Steglich-Arnholm, Henrik; Holtmannspötter, Markus; Taschner, Christian; Eiden, Sebastian; Nogueira, Raul G; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Boutchakova, Maria; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Lapergue, Bertrand; Dorn, Franziska; Cognard, Christophe; Killer, Monika; Mangiafico, Salvatore; Ribo, Marc; Psychogios, Marios N; Spiotta, Alejandro M; Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Mazighi, Mikael; Biondi, Alessandra; Richard, Sébastien; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Anxionnat, René; Bracard, Serge; Gory, Benjamin",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000496292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508890/,307

107665,Behavioral Economic Insights to Improve Medication Adherence in Adults with Chronic Conditions: A Scoping Review.,2019,"As countries in Europe gradually relaxed lockdown restrictions after the first wave, test-trace-isolate strategies became critical to maintain COVID-19 viral activity at low levels1,2. Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of COVID-19 symptomatic cases in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 incident symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks following lockdown from May 11 to June 28 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed WHO recommendations (5%)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% [6-8]% to 38% [35-44]% over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease of epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic COVID-19 cases did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behavior in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low levels of viral circulation achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing epidemic activity. Substantially more aggressive, targeted, and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. Testing strategy will be once again of critical value to lift current restrictive measures in Europe and avoid a third wave.","Pullano, Giulia; Di Domenico, Laura; Sabbatini, Chiara E; Valdano, Eugenio; Turbelin, Clément; Debin, Marion; Guerrisi, Caroline; Kengne-Kuetche, Charly; Souty, Cécile; Hanslik, Thomas; Blanchon, Thierry; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Figoni, Julie; Vaux, Sophie; Campèse, Christine; Bernard-Stoecklin, Sibylle; Colizza, Vittoria",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03095-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348340/,307

108098,Sleep extension: an explanation for increased pandemic dream recall?,2020-09-04,"OBJECTIVE Many physiological signals are degraded by significant corruptions that limit their usefulness. One example is cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals, measured by transcranial Doppler, which are susceptible to large errors from patient motion. In this paper we propose a method to remove artifacts and impute sections of missing data in these signals. METHODS The method exploits the low-order dynamical relationship between CBFV, arterial blood pressure, and, where available, intracranial pressure. It enhances the measured signals by fitting them to a low-order dynamical model, using convex regularization terms that improve robustness to large deviations and missing data. The method is based on a convex optimization formulation, and utilizes recent work in trace norm approximation and subspace system identification. RESULTS Simulations demonstrate that the method successfully removes real CBFV artifacts, and can impute missing data with reasonable accuracy. Performance was improved when intracranial pressure data was available. CONCLUSION The methods presented can be used by researchers to remove artifacts and estimate missing sections in CBFV signals. The general approach may be applied to other biomedical signal processing settings. SIGNIFICANCE This low-order dynamical approach has ongoing applications in noninvasive intracranial pressure estimation.","Gunn, Cameron Allan; Hu, Xiao; Vandenberghe, Lieven",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aba492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647103/,307

METHODS A comparative, retrospective, mono-centric study in a university maternity unit was designed and included all primiparous women who delivered spontaneously after 37 weeks of gestation in cephalic presentation. Two cohorts were studied, before and after the practice of Couder's maneuver. In the first cohort, the ''OSE cohort'' only selective episiotomies were performed from January 2009 to December 2010. In the second cohort, from January 2016 to December 2017, the ''SEC cohort'' selective episiotomies combined with Couder's maneuver were performed by midwives and obstetricians. The primary outcome was the type of perineal tears, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) classification. RESULTS A total of 2081 patients were included: 909 patients in the OSE cohort and 1172 patients in the SEC cohort. Couder's maneuver was performed in 59% of the SEC cohort. In the SEC cohort, there were an increase in the number of intact perinea (55% versus 63%, p < 0.001), a decrease in second-degree perineal tears (18% versus 11%, p < 0.001) and a decrease in labia minora tears (48% versus 37%, p < 0.001). The rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries was less than 1% in both cohorts (0.3% versus 0.5%, p = 0.7).

Materials and Methods A proficiency-based progression stepwise curriculum was developed consisting of didactic, technical and non-technical components using a virtual reality simulator (VRS). It focused on: scope navigation, anatomical landmarks identification, mucosal inspection, retro-flexion, pathology identification, and targeting biopsy. A total of 5 experienced and 10 novice endoscopists were recruited. All participants performed each of the selected modules twice, and mean and median performance were compared between the two groups. Novices pre-set level of proficiency was set as 2 standard deviations below the mean of experts. Performance was assessed using multiple-choice questions for knowledge, while validated simulator parameters incorporated into a novel checklist; Simulation Endoscopic Skill Assessment Score (SESAS) were used for technical skills. Results : The following VRS outcome measures have shown expert vs novice baseline discriminative ability: total procedure time, number of attempts for esophageal intubation and time in red-out. All novice trainees achieved the preset level of proficiency by the end of training. There were no statistically significant differences between experts' and trainees' rate of complications, landmarks identification and patient discomfort.

The current brief report demonstrates the rapid growth in TMH-V appointments in the weeks following the pandemic declaration within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest healthcare system in the United States. Methods: COVID-19 changes in TMH-V appointments were captured during the six weeks following the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration (March 11, 2020-April 22, 2020). Pre-COVID-19 TMH-V encounters were assessed from October 1, 2017 to March 10, 2020. Results: Daily TMH-V encounters rose from 1,739 on March 11 to 11,406 on April 22 (556% growth, 222,349 total encounters). Between March 11-April 22, 114,714 patients were seen via TMH-V, and 77.5% were first-time TMH-V users. 12,342 MH providers completed a TMH-V appointment between March 11-April 22, and 34.7% were first-time TMH-V users. The percentage growth of TMH-V appointments was higher than the rise in telephone appointments (442% growth); in-person appointments dropped by 81% during this time period. Discussion and Conclusions: The speed of VA's growth in TMH-V appointments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was facilitated by its pre-existing telehealth infrastructure, including earlier national efforts to increase the number of providers using TMH-V. Longstanding barriers to TMH-V implementation were lessened in the context of a pandemic, during which non-urgent in-person MH care was drastically reduced. Future work is necessary to understand the extent to which COVID-19 related changes in TMH-V use may permanently impact mental health care provision.","Connolly, Samantha L; Stolzmann, Kelly L; Heyworth, Leonie; Weaver, Kendra R; Bauer, Mark S; Miller, Christopher J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926664/,307
111415,Physical Distancing With Social Connectedness.,2020-05-01,"T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3, also known as HAVCR2) is an activation-induced inhibitory molecule involved in tolerance and shown to induce T-cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancers. Under some conditions, TIM-3 expression has also been shown to be stimulatory. Considering that TIM-3, like cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy, it is important to identify the circumstances under which TIM-3 can inhibit and activate T-cell responses. Here we show that TIM-3 is co-expressed and forms a heterodimer with carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), another well-known molecule expressed on activated T cells and involved in T-cell inhibition. Biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallography studies show that the membrane-distal immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like amino-terminal domain of each is crucial to these interactions. The presence of CEACAM1 endows TIM-3 with inhibitory function. CEACAM1 facilitates the maturation and cell surface expression of TIM-3 by forming a heterodimeric interaction in cis through the highly related membrane-distal N-terminal domains of each molecule. CEACAM1 and TIM-3 also bind in trans through their N-terminal domains. Both cis and trans interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3 determine the tolerance-inducing function of TIM-3. In a mouse adoptive transfer colitis model, CEACAM1-deficient T cells are hyper-inflammatory with reduced cell surface expression of TIM-3 and regulatory cytokines, and this is restored by T-cell-specific CEACAM1 expression. During chronic viral infection and in a tumour environment, CEACAM1 and TIM-3 mark exhausted T cells. Co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhancement of anti-tumour immune responses with improved elimination of tumours in mouse colorectal cancer models. Thus, CEACAM1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 that is required for its ability to mediate T-cell inhibition, and this interaction has a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour immunity.","Huang, Yu-Hwa; Zhu, Chen; Kondo, Yasuyuki; Anderson, Ana C; Gandhi, Amit; Russell, Andrew; Dougan, Stephanie K; Petersen, Britt-Sabina; Melum, Espen; Pertel, Thomas; Clayton, Kiera L; Raab, Monika; Chen, Qiang; Beauchemin, Nicole; Yazaki, Paul J; Pyzik, Michal; Ostrowski, Mario A; Glickman, Jonathan N; Rudd, Christopher E; Ploegh, Hidde L; Franke, Andre; Petsko, Gregory A; Kuchroo, Vijay K; Blumberg, Richard S",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363763/,307

The Patients Prone to Recurrence after Endovascular Treatment (PRET) trial was designed to assess whether hydrogel coils were superior to platinum coils in these high-risk patients. This article reports periprocedural safety and operator-assessed angiographic results from the PRET trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS PRET was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients had ≥10-mm aneurysms (PRET-1) or a major recurrence after coiling of an aneurysm of any size (PRET-2). Patients were randomly allocated to hydrogel or control arms (any platinum coil) by using concealed allocation with minimization. Assist devices could be used as clinically required. Aneurysms could be unruptured or recently ruptured. Analyses were on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS Four hundred forty-seven patients were recruited (250 PRET-1; 197 PRET-2). Aneurysms were recently ruptured in 29% of PRET-1 and 4% of PRET-2 patients. Aneurysms were ≥10 mm in all PRET-1 and in 50% of PRET-2 patients. They were wide-neck (≥4 mm) in 70% and in the posterior circulation in 24% of patients. Stents were used in 28% of patients (35% in PRET-2). Coiling was successful in 98%. Adverse events occurred in 28 patients with hydrogel and 23 with platinum coils. Mortality (n=2, unrelated to treatment) and morbidity (defined as mRS>2 at 1 month) occurred in 25 patients (5.6%; 12 hydrogel, 13 platinum), related to treatment in 10 (4 hydrogel; 6 platinum) (or 2.3% of 444 treated patients). No difference was seen between hydrogel and platinum for any of the indices used to assess safety up to at least 30 days after treatment. At 1 month, 95% of patients were home with a good outcome (mRS≤2 or unchanged). Operator-assessed angiographic outcomes were satisfactory (complete occlusion or residual neck) in 339 of 447 or 76.4% of patients, with no significant difference between groups.

Contact sites called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) allow bi-directional communication between organelles as part of the essential functions in the cell to maintain its homeostasis. Different groups have deeply studied the role of MAM in aging; however, it's necessary to analyze their involvement in the progression of age-related diseases.

OBJECTIVES To review a laparoscopic technique to repair Morgagni hernias in pediatric patients. METHODS Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent minimally invasive repair of a Morgagni hernia from November 2009 to September 2017 within a defined population. RESULTS During an 8-year period, 15 patients with Morgagni hernias were identified. Four patients with Morgagni hernias were excluded because they had open repairs. Eleven Morgagni hernias were repaired through a completely minimally invasive approach. Three repairs were completed using a soft-tissue patch (Gore-Tex patch, W L Gore & Associates Inc, Flagstaff, AZ). All minimally invasive repairs were completed with transfascial sutures using an endoscopic suturing device (Endo Close, Covidien/Medtronic, Fridley, MN) and 2-0 nonabsorbable synthetic sutures with extracorporeal knot tying. Median follow-up was 40 months (range = 2.6 months to 7.3 years). No patients had postoperative pectus excavatum defects. There were no recurrences. CONCLUSION Morgagni hernias are amenable to minimally invasive repair with this simple technique. With large defects, synthetic patches should be used. Recurrences are rare, and morbidity is low.","Lim, Lian; Gilyard, Sarah M; Sydorak, Roman M; Lau, Stanley T; Yoo, Edward Y; Shaul, Donald B",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/18.208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31926567/,307

Western countries were the first to formulate vaccine guideline. Asian countries developed their national and international vaccine guidelines a little later in order to reduce the risk of mortality from viral infections. However, no studies to date have examined the differences in vaccinations that prevail among Asian countries. Summary This review summarizes the vaccination status and schedules in various Asian countries for immunocompromised IBD patients. Vaccination rates, regardless of the specific vaccine, were high in Japan, South Korea, and China and low in India and the Philippines. Vaccine schedules differed by country, and outbreaks of measles and rubella were seen due to low vaccination rates in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Live vaccines cannot be administered during immunosuppressive treatment. Infection with measles, mumps, and varicella during immunosuppressive therapy carries a high risk of mortality, and thus confirmation of immunization status is recommended as soon as IBD is diagnosed and, when possible, live vaccines should be administered before the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment. In patients seronegative for hepatitis B, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine is also recommended. Key Messages Physicians, while considering severity of outbreaks, should understand the differences in vaccination status that exist among the various Asian countries and regions.","Sagami, Shintaro; Kobayashi, Taku; Hibi, Toshifumi",Inflammatory intestinal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000489643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505836/,307

Latent class analysis identified four subgroups among 2,619 urban middle school students (90% African American; 52% female): messages supporting fighting (32%), messages supporting nonviolence (29%), mixed messages (23%), and no messages (16%). We found significant differences across subgroups in their frequency of physical aggression and peer victimization and beliefs about the use of aggressive and nonviolent responses to peer provocation. Beliefs significantly mediated the relation between parental messages subgroups and both aggression and victimization. Findings illustrate the heterogeneity in the messages urban adolescents perceive from their parents, as well as relations with adolescents' beliefs and behavior.","O'Connor, Kelly E; Coleman, Jasmine N; Farrell, Albert D; Sullivan, Terri N",Journal of research on adolescence : the official journal of the Society for Research on Adolescence,https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726487/,307

OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy of non-pharmacological (exercise and/or nutritional) interventions on musculoskeletal measures and outcomes in osteosarcopenic adults by reviewing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS This review was registered at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020179292) and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases were searched for RCTs assessing the effect of at least one non-pharmacological intervention (any form of exercise and/or supplementation with protein, vitamin D, calcium or creatine) on any musculoskeletal measure/outcome of interest (BMD, bone strength/turnover, muscle mass and strength, physical performance, falls/fractures) in adults with osteosarcopenia as defined by any proposed criteria. RESULTS Two RCTs (of n=106 older osteosarcopenic adults (≥65 years)) assessing the effects of progressive resistance training (RT) (via resistance bands or machines; 2-3 times/week; ~60 minutes in duration) were eligible for inclusion. The two RCTs demonstrated moderate quality evidence that RT increases muscle mass, strength, and quality, with changes in strength and quality occurring before muscle mass (12 vs 28 weeks). There was low quality evidence that RT increases lumbar spine BMD and maintains total hip BMD when performed for 12 and 18 months, respectively, and moderate quality evidence that RT has no effect on markers of bone turnover or physical performance. No major adverse effects were recorded in either of the RCTs. There were no eligible RCTs examining the impact of nutritional interventions. CONCLUSION Chronic RT is safe and effective at potentiating gains in muscle mass, strength, and quality, and increasing or maintaining BMD in older osteosarcopenic adults. No RCT has examined the effects of protein, vitamin D, calcium, or creatine against a control/placebo in this high-risk population.","Atlihan, R; Kirk, B; Duque, G","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1537-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367459/,307

However, it is difficult to diagnose and is unique in that it is both a genetic and transmissible disease. The disease is characterised by symptoms of a rapidly progressive dementia. Palliation is the only treatment and early diagnosis is an important aspect in relation to gaining speedy access to palliative and end-of-life care services. People with CJD may be cared for in a diversity of settings including; general hospital wards, neurological units, hospices; care homes and in their own home. Management of physical and psychosocial symptoms and dealing with family bereavement is complex and challenging. Due to the complexity of the physical symptoms input from clinicians with palliative care expertise is an important consideration. Given transmission risk and the latent incidence of infection in the general population, following the emergence of variant CJD; plus the recent hypothesis of a potential relationship between immune responses to COVID-19 and the acceleration of preclinical or evident neurodegenerative disease, there is a need for renewed interest in research in this field. Over the past 20 years, many thousands of articles have been published on CJD. These have been predominately in the medical and science literature and very few publications have addressed the nursing care of persons and families dealing with CJD.

Given the limited scientific evidence available, most drugs have been used off-label or in the context of clinical trials, which should be the preferred option in order to create new evidence. Among kind different situations we have faced are the increase in workload, the expansion of coverage to new wards and ICUs and shortages, which have caused the use of alternative drugs and even other routes of administration. Given that covid-19 affects elderly population with greater severity and many of them are polymedicated, great effort have been focused on monitoring interactions, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (specially prolongation of the QT interval), monitoring correct concentrations of electrolytes, nutritional support, adaptation of chemotherapy treatment protocols and anticoagulant management, among others. The use of personal protective equipment added difficulty for nursing work and some measures had been taken to minimize the number of entries into the rooms. Eventually, team's split to guarantee care, the challenge of teleworking, remote validation, telemedicine and telepharmacy for communication between professionals and patients, as well as training in this pandemic situation have been a challenge for our profession. These difficulties have risen up new learning opportunities we hope will be useful to us in the event we have to face similar situations in the future.","Sevilla-Sánchez, Daniel; Tuset-Creus, Montse",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533666/,307

117221,Monitoring New Symptoms After COVID-19 Infection Among Primary Care Patients in New York City.,2021,"BACKGROUND Amongst various options of vascularized lymph node transfers, the submental flap has the lowest risk for iatrogenic lymphedema. The aim of this study was to gain insight into distribution, number, and size of lymph nodes along the mandible using computed tomography angiography (CTA). METHODS A total of 52 CTA scans of head/neck region were evaluated retrospectively. Lymph nodes in the submental and submandibular region, related to the origin of the submental artery, were recorded using a three-dimensional coordinate system, and standardized using an iterative closest point algorithm. Results were analyzed for gender, location, size, and number. RESULTS The mean number and size of lymph nodes were 5.30 ± 2.00 and 5.28 ± 1.29 mm, respectively. The mean distance of the lymph nodes to the origin of the submental artery was 25.53 ± 15.27 mm. There was no significant difference between both sides when comparing size (left: 5.39 ± 1.28; right: 5.17 ± 1.34; P = .19), number (left: 5.46 ± 2.10; right: 5.17 ± 1.96; P = .49), and distance (left: 24.78 ± 12.23; right: 26.32 ± 14.73; P = .19). No significance was found between males and females concerning number (P = .60), size (P = .50), and distance (P = .06). CONCLUSION The variance of lymph node distribution along the mandible may warrant conducting a CTA scan to maximize the number of transferred lymph nodes and aid in flap design.","Paulus, Vera A A; Winters, Harm; Hummelink, Stefan; Schulten, Sascha; Ulrich, Dietmar J O; Vasilic, Dalibor",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668040/,307
117472,Early Effects of COVID-19 on Programs Providing Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Jails and Prisons.,2020-08-27,"UNLABELLED The 5' cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA stability and protein translation. Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2'-O-methyltransferases (2'-O-MTase) to autonomously modify their mRNAs and carry a cap-1 structure (m7GpppNm) at the 5' end, thereby facilitating viral replication and escaping innate immune recognition in host cells. Previous studies showed that the 2'-O-MTase activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) needs to be activated by nsp10, whereas nsp16 of feline coronavirus (FCoV) alone possesses 2'-O-MTase activity (E. Decroly et al., J Virol 82:8071-8084, 2008, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00407-08; M. Bouvet et al., PLoS Pathog 6:e1000863, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863; E. Decroly et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002059, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002059; Y. Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294) . In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses. Based on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models. Interestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection. Therefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2'-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential. SARS-CoV encodes the 2'-O-MTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity. Our current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides. We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice. This work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2'-O-MTase of coronaviruses.","Wang, Yi; Sun, Ying; Wu, Andong; Xu, Shan; Pan, Ruangang; Zeng, Cong; Jin, Xu; Ge, Xingyi; Shi, Zhengli; Ahola, Tero; Chen, Yu; Guo, Deyin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00948-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041293/,307

Vaccination can mitigate these risks but only if safe and effective in MS patients, including those taking disease-modifying drugs. METHODS A modified Delphi consensus process (October 2017-June 2018) was used to develop clinically relevant recommendations for making decisions about vaccinations in patients with MS. A series of statements and recommendations regarding the efficacy, safety and timing of vaccine administration in patients with MS were generated in April 2018 by a panel of experts based on a review of the published literature performed in October 2017. RESULTS Recommendations include the need for an 'infectious diseases card' of each patient's infectious and immunisation history at diagnosis in order to exclude and eventually treat latent infections. We suggest the implementation of the locally recommended vaccinations, if possible at MS diagnosis, otherwise with vaccination timing tailored to the planned/current MS treatment, and yearly administration of the seasonal influenza vaccine regardless of the treatment received. CONCLUSION Patients with MS should be vaccinated with careful consideration of risks and benefits. However, there is an urgent need for more research into vaccinations in patients with MS to guide evidence-based decision making.","Riva, Agostino; Barcella, Valeria; Benatti, Simone V; Capobianco, Marco; Capra, Ruggero; Cinque, Paola; Comi, Giancarlo; Fasolo, Maria Michela; Franzetti, Fabio; Galli, Massimo; Gerevini, Simonetta; Meroni, Luca; Origoni, Massimo; Prosperini, Luca; Puoti, Massimo; Scarpazza, Cristina; Tortorella, Carla; Zaffaroni, Mauro; Moiola, Lucia",Multiple sclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520952310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940128/,307

We aim to compare the characteristics and outcomes of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent open vs laparoscopic treatment at our centre. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review was performed. Collected data included demographics, indication for surgery, operative characteristics, histopathology results, post-operative course and peri-operative complications. RESULTS A total of 58 patients underwent subtotal colectomy for IBD, with 38 laparoscopic procedures. The cohort included 33 males and 25 females with a mean age at surgery of 12.9 ± 3.3 years. The pre-operative diagnosis was ulcerative colitis in n = 41, Crohn's disease in n = 5 and indeterminate colitis in n = 11. There was an 84.2% concordance between the pre-operative and the post-operative histological diagnoses. Overall, 34 (58.6%) patients had complications, of which 19 (32.7%) patients required return to theatre. The complication rate was significantly smaller for laparoscopic compared to open procedures (42.1% vs 75%) as well as for elective compared with emergency colectomies (38.4% vs 75%). Four patients (10.5%) required conversion to open approach. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe in most paediatric patients with IBD and has a lower complication rate and better recovery than open procedures, especially when performed in an elective setting.","Muntean, Ancuta; Stoica, Ionica; McMahon, Suzanne Victoria; Mortell, Alan; Gillick, John; Sweeney, Brian Terence",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-019-04467-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847603/,307

One of the major complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is represented by leaks along the staple line. Several reinforcement techniques have been proposed, but scarce data about the real strengthening offered are present. Thus, we aimed to evaluate if different reinforcements produced different bursting pressures after LSG, and then to verify if the clinical application of the stronger reinforcement produced a reduction in leakage rate. Methods. We prospectively enrolled all consecutive obese patients that underwent LSG. We tested 3 different types of staple lines, as follows: group 1, no reinforcement; group 2, bioabsorbable buttress reinforcement; group 3, invaginating overrunning barbed suture. A burst pressure test was applied to the gastric specimen by means of high-resolution manometric catheter. After burst pressure tests, a subsequent consecutive series of patients were treated with the most effective reinforcement, and rate of leaks was recorded. Results. We enrolled in total 110 obese patients; 20 patients for each group of staple line reinforcement and then other 50 consecutive patients underwent LSG with the higher burst pressure staple line reinforcement. Median burst pressures were similar in group 1 and group 2; group 3 showed a statistically significant pressure increase (P < .0001) than group 1 and group 2, with a 5.2-fold value. Other consecutive 50 obese patients underwent LSG with overrunning reinforcement. In none of them a leak was detected. Conclusions. Reinforcement of the SG staple line, with overrunning suture, seems to drastically increase bursting pressures in an ex vivo model and it is promising when reproduced in vivo.","Tolone, Salvatore; Gambardella, Claudio; Del Genio, Gianmattia; Brusciano, Luigi; Ruggiero, Roberto; Lucido, Francesco Saverio; Docimo, Ludovico",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350620969002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100138/,307

Using intravital imaging, we demonstrate that invading cells exhibit dorsoventral (top-to-bottom) polarity in vivo. To investigate the impact of dorsoventral polarity on cell locomotion through different confining geometries, we fabricated microchannels of fixed cross-sectional area, albeit with distinct aspect ratios. Vertical confinement, exerted along the dorsoventral polarity axis, induces myosin II-dependent nuclear stiffening, which results in RhoA hyperactivation at the cell poles and slow bleb-based migration. In lateral confinement, directed perpendicularly to the dorsoventral polarity axis, the absence of perinuclear myosin II fails to increase nuclear stiffness. Hence, cells maintain basal RhoA activity and display faster mesenchymal migration. In summary, by integrating microfabrication, imaging techniques, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that dorsoventral polarity, observed in vivo and in vitro, directs cell responses in confinement by spatially tuning RhoA activity, which controls bleb-based versus mesenchymal migration.","Wisniewski, Emily O; Mistriotis, Panagiotis; Bera, Kaustav; Law, Robert A; Zhang, Jitao; Nikolic, Milos; Weiger, Michael; Parlani, Maria; Tuntithavornwat, Soontorn; Afthinos, Alexandros; Zhao, Runchen; Wirtz, Denis; Kalab, Petr; Scarcelli, Giuliano; Friedl, Peter; Konstantopoulos, Konstantinos",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba6505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789173/,307

We show that the Nanoscribe two-photon polymerization direct laser writing system is capable of fabricating complex 3D micro-blade geometries. However, structures made of the Nanoscribe IP-S resin have low adhesion to silicon, and they tend to peel off from the substrate after at most two times of replica molding in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Our work demonstrates that the use of a secondary mold replicates Nanoscribe-printed features faithfully for at least 10 iterations. Finally, we show that complex micro-blade features can generate different degrees of cell wounding and cell survival rates compared with simple blades possessing a vertical cutting edge fabricated with conventional 2.5D photolithography.

Intraoperative normothermia is recommended by national guidelines to minimize additional morbidity/mortality, but limited evidence exists regarding hypothermia's effect on orthopedic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in patients with operatively treated hip fractures and evaluate its effect on complications and outcomes. Retrospective chart review was performed on clinical records from 1541 consecutive patients who sustained a hip fracture and underwent operative fixation at the authors' institution between January 2005 and October 2013. A total of 1525 patients were included for analysis, excluding those with injuries requiring additional surgical intervention. Patient demographic data, surgery-specific data, postoperative complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission were recorded. Patients with a mean intraoperative temperature less than 36°C were identified as hypothermic. Statistical analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling evaluated associations with hypothermia and effect on complications/outcomes. The incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in operatively treated hip fractures was 17.0%. Hypothermia was associated with an increase in the rate of deep surgical-site infection (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-9.14; P=.022). Lower body mass index and increasing age demonstrated increased association with hypothermia (P=.004 and P=.005, respectively). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first and largest study analyzing the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in orthopedic patients. In patients with hip fractures, the study's findings confirm evidence found in other surgical specialties that hypothermia may be associated with an increased risk of deep surgical-site infection and that lower body mass index and increasing age are risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia.

A side specific functionalization method is hence required. The deposition of a nanosized polydopamine film on PTFE is known to be possible but immersion of the e-PTFE membrane in an aerated dopamine solution leads to a functionalization not only on both faces of the membrane but also in its porous volume. The fact that polydopamine also forms at the water/air interface has allowed to transfer a polydopamine film on only one face of the e-PTFE membrane.

124171,Payment Discrepancies and Access to Primary Care Physicians for Dual-eligible Medicare-Medicaid Beneficiaries.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Conventional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has been the reference standard for bariatric surgery but requires 5-7 trocar incisions. We have developed a new procedure-single-incision transumbilical LRYGB (SITU-LRYGB)-that results in minimal scarring and is more cosmetically acceptable. To compare the surgical results and patient satisfaction between 5-port LRYGB and the novel SITU-LRYGB at a university hospital. METHODS We performed 5-port or SITU-LRYGB on 140 morbidly obese patients; the patients chose the operation method. We used a novel liver traction method and omega-umbilicoplasty specifically designed for SITU-LRYGB. RESULTS Before surgery, the patients in the 5-port surgery group were more obese than those in the SITU group (120.8 kg versus 108.9 kg, P = .013). The rate of hypertension was also greater in the former group. The operative time was longer for SITU-LRYGB (101.1 versus 81.1 min, P = .001) without increased intraoperative complications. The total morphine dose for the SITU group seemed to be greater but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference in complications was observed. Postoperatively, the percentage of excess body weight lost the SITU and 5-port surgery groups was 21.2% and 20.9%, 40.4% and 39.4%, 55.0% and 55.2%, 64.8% and 75.2%, and 75.4% and 78.2% at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. The SITU-LRYGB patients reported greater satisfaction related to scarring than those who had undergone 5-port surgery (score 4.57 versus 3.96, respectively, P = .005). No patient died. CONCLUSION Compared with conventional LRYGB, SITU-LRYGB resulted in acceptable complications, the same recovery, comparative weight loss, and better patient satisfaction related to scarring.","Huang, Chih-Kun; Lo, Chi-Hsien; Houng, Jer-Yiing; Chen, Yaw-Sen; Lee, Po-Huang",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2010.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296033/,307

An excellent example of a targeted illness is respiratory failure leading to urgent unplanned intubation, where early detection might lead to interventions that improve patient outcomes. Previously, we identified signatures of this illness in the continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring data of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and devised algorithms to identify patients at rising risk. Here, we externally validated three logistic regression models to estimate the risk of emergency intubation developed in Medical and Surgical ICUs at the University of Virginia. APPROACH We calculated the model outputs for more than 8000 patients in the University of California-San Francisco ICUs, 240 of whom underwent emergency intubation as determined by individual chart review. MAIN RESULTS We found that the AUC of the models exceeded 0.75 in this external population, and that the risk rose appreciably over the 12 h before the event. SIGNIFICANCE We conclude that there are generalizable physiological signatures of impending respiratory failure in the continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring data.","Callcut, Rachael A; Xu, Yuan; Moorman, J Randall; Tsai, Christina; Villaroman, Andrea; Robles, Anamaria J; Lake, Douglas E; Hu, Xiao; Clark, Matthew T",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ac2264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580242/,307
127975,Radiation oncology's role in the next chapter of payment reform.,2021-02-01,"A comprehensive description of the spin dynamics underlying the formation of Ortho-Deuterium Induced Polarization (ODIP) is presented. ODIP can serve as a tool for enhancing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals of 2H nuclei, being important probes of molecular structure and dynamics. To produce ODIP, in the first step, the D2 gas is brought to thermal equilibrium at low temperature, here 30 K, so that the ortho-component, corresponding to the total spin of the 2H nuclei equal to 0 and 2, is enriched, here to 92%. In the second step, the orthodeuterium molecule is attached to a substrate molecule using a suitable hydrogenation catalyst such that the symmetry of the two 2H nuclei is broken. As a result, the non-thermal spin order of orthodeuterium is converted into enhancement of observable NMR signals. In this work, we perform a theoretical study of ODIP and calculate the shape of ODIP spectra and their dependence on the magnetization flip angle. These results are compared with experiments performed for a number of substrates; good agreement between experimental and calculated ODIP spectra is found. We also discuss the performance of NMR techniques for converting anti-phase ODIP spectral patterns into in-phase patterns, which are more suitable for signal detection and for transferring ODIP to heteronuclei, here to 13C spins. Experimental procedures reported here allowed us to reach signal enhancement factors of more than 1000 for 2H nuclei in the liquid phase. These results are useful for extending the scope of spin hyperpolarization to the widely used 2H nuclei.","Kozinenko, Vitaly P; Kiryutin, Alexey S; Knecht, Stephan; Buntkowsky, Gerd; Vieth, Hans-Martin; Yurkovskaya, Alexandra V; Ivanov, Konstantin L",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0022042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962366/,307
128244,Post-traumatic stress disorder: a differential diagnostic consideration for COVID-19 survivors.,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND Three pharmacist-specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes exist to facilitate medication therapy management (MTM) reimbursement (codes 99605, 99606, and 99607). However, no studies have used CPT codes in administrative claims databases to identify subjects who have received MTM services. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of MTM services provided, using CPT codes identified in an administrative dataset. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a subset of Medicare Part D individuals from the IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Research Databases (2009-2015). Researchers identified beneficiaries who received MTM services using CPT codes 99605, 99606, and 99607. RESULTS Of the 16,483,709 individuals in the dataset, only 3,291 had CPT codes indicating that they received MTM services, representing an overall prevalence of 0.020%. CONCLUSIONS The use of CPT codes as an indicator of MTM service provision resulted in far lower MTM utilization rates than in published literature. Reliance on CPT codes to identify MTM services in administrative claims is not recommended, given that it limited the researchers' ability to properly identify patient receipt of such services. More accurate methodologies are warranted for identifying MTM use and its effects on patient outcomes.

Prior to the pandemic, hospice and palliative care adopted telehealth slowly compared with other specialties, but its rapidly increasing utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic has long-term implications for access to primary and specialty palliative care, particularly for patients in rural communities and populations experiencing inequitable access to services. Telehealth also shows great promise for leveraging technology to provide care more effectively and efficiently. As more provider organizations become equipped with telehealth infrastructure, and as advocacy for broader reimbursement of these services grows, telehealth services for hospice and palliative care are expected to continue. This article highlights the work of expert clinicians from multiple hospice and palliative care organizations to develop best practices for conducting telehealth visits in inpatient and community settings. The authors propose that best practices be compiled and considered to ensure quality-driven, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines with interprofessional applicability.","Webb, Michelle; Hurley, Susan Lysaght; Gentry, Jennifer; Brown, Melanie; Ayoub, Cynthia",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33911060/,307
128956,The Impact of Telemedicine for Monitoring and Treatment of Phenylketonuria Patients on Metabolic Outcome During Coronavirus Disease-19 Outbreak.,2021-03-12,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae The RNA viral genome encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1-dependent manner by an unconventional route. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA and is responsible for the cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 associates with and relies on the CCC for secretion. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors, such as brefeldin A, Golgicide A, and Fli-06, showed no effect on NS1 secretion but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV-1 or FKBP52 with short interfering RNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion, again without affecting virion release. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays indicated that NS1 colocalizes and interacts with all proteins of the CCC. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV-infected cells. Results obtained with Zika virus-infected cells suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway as that observed for DENV NS1. These results uncover important differences in the dengue virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex.IMPORTANCE The dengue virus protein NS1 is secreted efficiently from both infected vertebrate and mosquito cells. Previously, our group reported that NS1 secretion in mosquito cells follows an unconventional secretion pathway dependent on caveolin-1. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion takes place in association with the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, CyA, and Cy40, which are in charge of cholesterol transport inside the cell. Results obtained with ZIKV-infected mosquito cells suggest that ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. These results uncover important differences in the virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex. Moreover, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy to combat these two mosquito-borne diseases.","Rosales Ramirez, Romel; Ludert, Juan E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01985-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463973/,307

The sequelae from this specific complication are severe; consequently, the topic of renal artery coverage is a pertinent issue. We present a case series of patients undergoing EVAR with unintentional renal artery coverage, review the treatment options available, and suggest a treatment algorithm for this scenario based on the evidence. METHODS AND RESULTS We report four patients who were found to have renal artery occlusion after EVAR detected up to 5 weeks postoperatively. Renal revascularization was achieved using endovascular renal artery stenting in two patients, and open hepato-spleno-renal bypass in the remaining two cases. Treatment strategies used led to symptom resolution and recovery of renal function in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Both open and endovascular techniques may be used as procedures to treat this condition-the choice of procedure is primarily determined by accessibility of the renal orifice.","Adu, John; Cheshire, Nicholas J; Riga, Celia V; Hamady, Mohamad; Bicknell, Colin D",Annals of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2012.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23068430/,307
129322,COVID-19 Pandemic: A Chance to Promote Cultural Sensitivity on Advance Care Planning.,2021-05-01,"During the past 35 years, survival rates for children with extracranial malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) have increased significantly. Success has been achieved primarily through the application of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens; however, clinical challenges in GCTs remain. Excellent outcomes are not distributed uniformly across the heterogeneous distribution of age, histologic features, and primary tumor site. Despite good outcomes overall, the likelihood of a cure for certain sites and histologic conditions is less than 50%. In addition, there are considerable long-term treatment-related effects for survivors. Even modest cisplatin dosing can cause significant long-term morbidities. A particular challenge in designing new therapies for GCT is that a variety of specialists use different risk stratifications, staging systems, and treatment approaches for three distinct age groups (childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood). Traditionally, pediatric cancer patients younger than 15 years have been treated by pediatric oncologists in collaboration with their surgical specialty colleagues. Adolescents and young adults with GCTs often are treated by medical oncologists, urologists, or gynecologic oncologists. The therapeutic dilemma for all is how to best define disease risk so that therapy and toxicity can be appropriately reduced for some patients and intensified for others. Further clinical and biologic insights can only be achieved through collaborations that do not set limitations by age, sex, and primary tumor site. Therefore, international collaborations, spanning different cooperative groups and disciplines, have been developed to address these challenges.","Olson, Thomas A; Murray, Matthew J; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Nicholson, James C; Billmire, Deborah F; Krailo, Mark D; Dang, Ha M; Amatruda, James F; Thornton, Claire M; Arul, G Suren; Stoneham, Sara J; Pashankar, Farzana; Stark, Daniel; Shaikh, Furqan; Gershenson, David M; Covens, Allan; Hurteau, Jean; Stenning, Sally P; Feldman, Darren R; Grimison, Peter S; Huddart, Robert A; Sweeney, Christopher; Powles, Thomas; Lopes, Luiz Fernando; dos Santos Agular, Simone; Chinnaswamy, Girish; Khaleel, Sahar; Abouelnaga, Sherif; Hale, Juliet P; Frazier, A Lindsay",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2014.60.5337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26304902/,307

METHODS The following data were retrieved for 260 eyes of 260 patients undergoing cataract surgery: preoperative simulated keratometry, mean keratometry of posterior surface, axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and white-to-white diameter; model and power of implanted IOL; and subjective refraction at 3 months post surgery. These data were used to train different machine learning models (k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, etc). Implanted lens characteristics and biometric data were used as input to predict IOL power and refractive outcomes. For external validation, a dataset of 52 eyes was used.

However, the effect of MIST on breathing effort is poorly studied. OBJECTIVES To describe the effect of MIST on neural breathing effort assessed with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG) in preterm infants with RDS. METHODS Preterm infants with a gestational age < 37 weeks treated with MIST for RDS were included. dEMG measurements were done from 15 min before to 1 h after MIST. The percentage change in dEMG activity after MIST and the clinical response were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty preterm infants (mean gestational age 29.3 [SD 2.1] weeks; mean birth weight 1,230 [SD 391] g) were included. Seventeen infants did complete the 1-h measurement. Eleven (65%) infants had a decrease in their peakdEMG activity (median change -11.8% [IQR -26.8 to 5.8, p = 0.08]) 1 h after MIST. TonicdEMG activity decreased in 12 (71%) infants, with a median reduction of 6.3% (IQR -29.2 to 9.0, p = 0.07). FiO2 showed a rapid decrease following MIST (before, 0.47 [IQR 0.38-0.84]; 1 h after, 0.25 [IQR 0.21-0.30], p < 0.001).

Zeaxanthin, a crucial carotenoid, positively regulates plant abiotic stress responses. Therefore, this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of zeaxanthin-induced chilling tolerance in peppers. The results indicated that the pretreatment with zeaxanthin effectively alleviated chilling damage in pepper leaves and increased the plant fresh weight and photosynthetic pigment content under chilling stress. Additionally, alterations in photosynthetic chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves after zeaxanthin treatment highlighted the participation of zeaxanthin in improving the photosystem response to chilling stress by heightening the quenching of excess excitation energy and protection of the photosynthetic electron transport system. In chill-stressed plants, zeaxanthin treatment also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and transcript expression, and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2•-) content, resulting in a decrease in biological membrane damage. Additionally, exogenous zeaxanthin upregulated the expression levels of key genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylase (CaCA1, CaCA2), zeaxanthin epoxidase (CaZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (CaVDE), and promoted the synthesis of endogenous zeaxanthin during chilling stress. Collectively, exogenous zeaxanthin pretreatment enhances plant tolerance to chilling by improving the photosystem process, increasing oxidation resistance, and inducing alterations in endogenous zeaxanthin metabolism.","Tang, Chaonan; Xie, Jianming; Lv, Jian; Li, Jing; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Cheng; Liang, Guoping",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740679/,307

The existing nonhuman primate (NHP) model for RVF utilizes an intravenous (i.v.) exposure route in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Severe disease in these animals is infrequent, and large cohorts are needed to observe significant morbidity and mortality. To overcome these drawbacks, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of RVFV in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) by i.v., subcutaneous (s.c.), and intranasal exposure routes to more closely mimic natural exposure. Marmosets were more susceptible to RVFV than rhesus macaques and experienced higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and viremia and marked aberrations in hematological and chemistry values. An overwhelming infection of hepatocytes was a major consequence of infection of marmosets by the i.v. and s.c. exposure routes. Additionally, these animals displayed signs of hemorrhagic manifestations and neurological impairment. Based on our results, the common marmoset model more closely resembles severe human RVF disease and is therefore an ideal model for the evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics.","Smith, Darci R; Bird, Brian H; Lewis, Bridget; Johnston, Sara C; McCarthy, Sarah; Keeney, Ashley; Botto, Miriam; Donnelly, Ginger; Shamblin, Joshua; Albariño, César G; Nichol, Stuart T; Hensley, Lisa E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06190-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22156530/,307

Boron nitride nanosheets (BNS), which lack magnetic field and light responsiveness, were used as a model nonfunctional nanomaterial. Among various catechol derivatives tested (i.e., dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, gallic acid, and tannic acid), a coating of tannic acid-Fe3+ coordination complex provided the highest magnetic field relaxivity and near infrared (NIR) laser light responsiveness. An in vitro study showed that KB tumor cells treated with tannic acid-Fe3+ coordination complex adsorbed on BNS (TA-Fe/BNS) exhibited higher T1-weighted magnetic resonance contrast compared with plain BNS, and BNS coated with tannic acid or Fe alone. NIR irradiation at 808 nm caused a significant increase in KB tumor cell death after treatment with TA-Fe/BNS compared with other treatments. In vivo MRI imaging revealed tumor accumulation of intravenously administered TA-Fe/BNS. Guided by MRI information, application of focused laser irradiation onto tumor tissues resulted in complete tumor ablation. These results support the potential of TA-Fe/BNS for MRI theranostics. Moreover, this study suggests the wide applicability of TA-Fe noncovalent coating as biocompatible and facile tool for converting nonfunctional early-generation nanomaterials into functional new nanomaterials, opening new opportunities for their use in translational biomedical applications such as MRI theranostics.","Shim, Gayong; Ko, Seungbeom; Park, Joo Yeon; Suh, Ju Han; Le, Quoc-Viet; Kim, Dongyoon; Kim, Young Bong; Im, Geun Ho; Kim, Hun Nyun; Choe, Yearn Seong; Cho, Jihee; Kim, Sanghee; Oh, Yu-Kyoung",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916228/,307

138134,The Time is NOW.,2021-03-01,"One in four women suffers from uterine leiomyomas (ULs)-benign tumours of the uterine wall, also known as uterine fibroids-at some point in premenopausal life. ULs can cause excessive bleeding, pain and infertility1, and are a common cause of hysterectomy2. They emerge through at least three distinct genetic drivers: mutations in MED12 or FH, or genomic rearrangement of HMGA23. Here we created genome-wide datasets, using DNA, RNA, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and HiC chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) sequencing of primary tissues to profoundly understand the genesis of UL. We identified somatic mutations in genes encoding six members of the SRCAP histone-loading complex4, and found that germline mutations in the SRCAP members YEATS4 and ZNHIT1 predispose women to UL. Tumours bearing these mutations showed defective deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. In ULs, H2A.Z occupancy correlated positively with chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and negatively with DNA methylation, but these correlations were weak in tumours bearing SRCAP complex mutations. In these tumours, open chromatin emerged at transcription start sites where H2A.Z was lost, which was associated with upregulation of genes. Furthermore, YEATS4 defects were associated with abnormal upregulation of bivalent embryonic stem cell genes, as previously shown in mice5. Our work describes a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis-epigenetic instability caused by deficient H2A.Z deposition-and suggests that ULs arise through an aberrant differentiation program driven by deranged chromatin, emanating from a small number of mutually exclusive driver mutations.","Berta, Davide G; Kuisma, Heli; Välimäki, Niko; Räisänen, Maritta; Jäntti, Maija; Pasanen, Annukka; Karhu, Auli; Kaukomaa, Jaana; Taira, Aurora; Cajuso, Tatiana; Nieminen, Sanna; Penttinen, Rosa-Maria; Ahonen, Saija; Lehtonen, Rainer; Mehine, Miika; Vahteristo, Pia; Jalkanen, Jyrki; Sahu, Biswajyoti; Ravantti, Janne; Mäkinen, Netta; Rajamäki, Kristiina; Palin, Kimmo; Taipale, Jussi; Heikinheimo, Oskari; Bützow, Ralf; Kaasinen, Eevi; Aaltonen, Lauri A",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03747-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349258/,307
138478,Cost-effectiveness of 'screen-and-treat' interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder following major incidents.,2021-10-07,"There is a tendency to accept anxiety as an inevitable part of living in a stressful modern world. However, simple dietary changes can help attenuate the stress response. While there are several approaches to treating anxiety, research by Peter Roy-Byrne in 2015 has shown that only 50% to 60% of people respond to medication and psychotherapy, and only a quarter of patients have complete resolution of their symptoms. According to statistics from the National Institute of Mental health, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety disorders were the most common mental health disorder in the United States, about 3 times more common than depression (18.1% vs 6.7%). A recent Express Scripts survey showed the percent increase in the number of new prescriptions for antianxiety medications by the middle March 2020 for antianxiety medications was 37.7%, underscoring the likely rise in anxiety associated with the pandemic. While traditional medications and therapies are well needed, to beat stress during times of a pandemic, it is important to think more broadly about how we can best affect our mental well-being. One of those ways is through our nutrition and dietary habits, and research by Opie et al in 2015 demonstrates that our dietary choices are more crucial than ever. This column reviews foods and substances that are important to consider in managing anxiety.","Naidoo, Uma",American journal of lifestyle medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1559827620973936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456419/,307

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has been shown to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to explore the various hematological variables in COVID-19 positive patients with T2DM, so as to act early and improve patient outcomes.Methods: Medical e-records of seventy adult patients with T2DM who were COVID-19 positive have been analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters for these patients were examined.Results: Of the seventy patients with T2DM, 48.88% had poorly controlled diabetes. 70.69% were pyrexial, 56.25% were tachycardic and 38.58% were asymptomatic on presentation. Amongst the hematological parameters, anemia was seen in 10% of males and 15.38% of females. 20% had a high red-blood-cell-distribution-width (RDW). 7.27% had thrombocytosis and 3.64% had thrombocytopenia. 73.3% had a high platelet-distribution-width (PDW) and 44.44% had an increased mean-platelet-volume (MPV). 16.36% were neutropenic and 16.67% had lymphocytopenia.Conclusion: Diabetic COVID-19 positive patients have been shown to have prominent manifestations of the hemopoietic-system with varied hematological profiles.

139074,The role of sleep disturbances in cognitive function and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling elderly with sleep complaints.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Several options exist for induction agents during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in trauma patients, including etomidate, ketamine, and propofol. These drugs have reported variable hemodynamic effects (hypotension with propofol and sympathomimetic effects with ketamine) that could affect trauma resuscitations. The purpose of this study was to compare the hemodynamic effects of these three induction agents during emergency department RSI in adult trauma. We hypothesized that these drugs would display a differing hemodynamic profile during RSI. METHODS We performed a retrospective (2014-2019), multicenter trial of adult (>/=18 years) trauma patients admitted to eight ACS-verified Level 1 trauma centers who underwent emergency department RSI. Variables collected included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse before and after RSI. The primary outcomes were change in heart rate and SBP before and after RSI. RESULTS There were 2,092 patients who met criteria, 85% received etomidate (E), 8% ketamine (K), and 7% propofol (P). Before RSI the ketamine group had a lower SBP (E:135 vs. K:125 vs. P:135 mmHg, p=0.04) but there was no difference in pulse (E:104 vs. K:107 vs. P:105 bpm, p=0.45). After RSI, there were no differences in SBP (E:135 vs. K:130 vs. P:133 mmHg, p=0.34) or pulse (E:106 vs. K:110 vs. P:104 bpm, p=0.08). There was no difference in the average change of SBP (E:0.2 vs. K:5.2 vs. P:-1.8 mmHg, p=0.4) or pulse (E:1.7 vs. K:3.5 bpm vs. P:-0.96, p=0.24) during RSI. CONCLUSION Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no difference in the hemodynamic effect for etomidate vs. ketamine vs. propofol during RSI in trauma patients.

Patterned stimulation of sacral afferent pathways can reduce abnormal EUS reflexes after acute spinal cord injury (SCI); however, effectiveness following chronic SCI is unknown. METHODS Four adult male cats were implanted with bilateral extradural sacral root electrodes to allow bladder activation and underwent subsequent spinal transection (T10-12). Nine weeks after SCI urethral and bladder pressures were recorded with and without sacral afferent stimulation. Surface electrodes were applied to sacral and lumbar dermatomes and stimulus amplitude set below the muscle fasciculation threshold. The stimulation pattern was varied by on/off times of fixed frequency at each location. RESULTS Reflexive EUS contractions were observed in all animals after chronic SCI. Patterned sacral dermatome stimulation reduced EUS reflex rate and amplitude in two of four cats. Suppression was dependent on both the stimulus location and pattern. Sacral locations and a stimulation pattern of (0.75 sec on, 0.25 sec off, 20 Hz) were effective in both responder animals. CONCLUSIONS Patterned sacral dermatome stimulation can reduce abnormal urethral reflexes following chronic SCI. Reflex suppression is dependent on both the stimulation location and stimulus pattern. Reduction of reflexive EUS activity after chronic SCI with this non-destructive and non-invasive approach may provide an advance for the treatment of detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia.","McCoin, Jaime L; Bhadra, Narendra; Gustafson, Kenneth J",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.22276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674730/,307

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed an unusual number of graft arterial anomalies following kidney transplant (KTx) in children. Nine children received a KTx at our center between February and July 2020, eight boys and one girl, of median age 10 years. Seven presented Doppler features suggesting arterial stenosis, with an unusual extensive pattern. For comparison, over the previous five-year period, persistent spectral Doppler arterial anomalies (focal anastomotic stenoses) following KTx were seen in 5% of children at our center. We retrospectively evidenced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 5/7 children with arterial stenosis. The remaining two patients had received a graft from a deceased adolescent donor with a positive serology at D0. These data led us to suspect immune post-viral graft vasculitis, triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Because the diagnosis of COVID-19 is challenging in children, we recommend pre-transplant monitoring of graft recipients and their parents by monthly RT-PCR and serology. We suggest balancing the risk of post-viral graft vasculitis against the risk of prolonged dialysis when considering transplantation in a child during the pandemic.","Berteloot, Laureline; Berthaud, Romain; Temmam, Sarah; Lozach, Cécile; Zanelli, Elisa; Blanc, Thomas; Heloury, Yves; Capito, Carmen; Chardot, Christophe; Sarnacki, Sabine; Garcelon, Nicolas; Lacaille, Florence; Charbit, Marina; Pastural, Myriam; Rabant, Marion; Boddaert, Nathalie; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Eloit, Marc; Sermet-Gaudelus, Isabelle; Dehoux, Laurène; Boyer, Olivia",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346946/,307

Malnutrition can affect duration of hospitalisation and impede recovery, and therefore it is important to monitor this condition, especially in at-risk groups, such as older adults and those with chronic disease. Underlying malnutrition impairs the immune system, potentially making people more vulnerable to infections such as COVID-19 and impacting recovery. Patients recovering from severe illness are likely to have muscle wasting or feel weak and may have increased protein needs. In addition individuals who have been discharged from hospital may need ongoing nutritional rehabilitation. This article explores the range of symptoms of COVID-19 that can interfere with dietary intake, such as respiratory issues, loss of taste and smell and fatigue and weakness. It goes on to describe how community nurses can identify risk of malnutrition and dietary issues when working remotely. Additionally, it signposts to a range of resources developed to assist patients and carers in accessing appropriate dietary advice.","Holdoway, Anne",British journal of community nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjcn.2020.25.sup8.s6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936703/,307

The treatments for OAB include first line (lifestyle modification, pelvic floor muscle training), second line (anticholinergic or beta-3 agonist medications), and third line therapies (intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection, sacral neurostimulation [SNM], or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS]). For those with urinary incontinence secondary to OAB, complete continence is the goal of therapy, though cure rates are only 5% to 40%. The use of combination therapies can be employed in refractory OAB, however, the efficacy of pooled modalities is relatively unknown. Our objective was to determine the volume of data supporting combination therapy in treating OAB. METHODS We systematically reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles published before October 2018. Each was independently reviewed by two reviewers and examined in detail if they met inclusion criteria. RESULTS A total of 32 studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Most large prospective studies evaluated combinations of medications with behavioral therapy or medications together. Combination therapy studies of third-line treatments were rare and centered on medication with PTNS. No studies examined intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections in combination with another therapy and only one retrospective study briefly examined SNM therapy in combination with medication. CONCLUSION Combination therapy, with certain first, second, and third-line OAB therapies, appears to be efficacious.

The recent release of the da Vinci SP robotic system (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) continues to advance the minimally invasive nature of robotic surgical technology. We now report our institution's initial experience performing RASP using the da Vinci SP robotic system. An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review was performed of all patients undergoing robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy using the da Vinci SP surgical system in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement by a single surgeon from March to June 2019. Pre-operative, intraoperative, and post-operative data were collected for descriptive analysis. A total of 10 men, mean age of 69 ± 4 years, with mean prostate volume of 104 ± 11 g underwent surgery. The robotic cannula and a single assistant port were utilized in all cases. No cases required conversion to a multi-port robotic platform or open approach, nor required the placement of additional assistant ports. No intraoperative or immediate post-operative complications were noted. Mean estimated blood loss was 141 ± 98 mL and operative time was 172 ± 19 min. Mean catheter time was 1.9 ± 1.8 days. One patient reported transient de novo stress urinary incontinence. Single-port RASP is a safe and effective intervention for BPE. The smaller surgical footprint from the device appears to make earlier catheter removal possible. Comparative evaluation with multi-port RASP and other modalities is warranted.","Steinberg, Ryan L; Passoni, Niccolo; Garbens, Alaina; Johnson, Brett A; Gahan, Jeffrey C",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-019-01029-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560124/,307

Here, we take a macroecological approach to investigate factors influencing why some parasites show a tendency to infect species widely distributed in the host phylogeny (phylogenetic generalism) while others infect only closely related hosts. Using a database on over 1400 parasite species that have been documented to infect up to 69 terrestrial mammal host species, we characterize the phylogenetic generalism of parasites using standard effect sizes for three metrics: mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (PD), maximum PD and phylogenetic aggregation. We identify a trend towards phylogenetic specialism, though statistically host relatedness is most often equivalent to that expected from a random sample of host species. Bacteria and arthropod parasites are typically the most generalist, viruses and helminths exhibit intermediate generalism, and protozoa are on average the most specialist. While viruses and helminths have similar mean pairwise PD on average, the viruses exhibit higher variation as a group. Close-contact transmission is the transmission mode most associated with specialism. Most parasites exhibiting phylogenetic aggregation (associating with discrete groups of species dispersed across the host phylogeny) are helminths and viruses.","Park, A W; Farrell, M J; Schmidt, J P; Huang, S; Dallas, T A; Pappalardo, P; Drake, J M; Stephens, P R; Poulin, R; Nunn, C L; Davies, T J",Proceedings.

The effect of different anesthetics on core body temperature in children during these procedures remains controversial. We examined the effect of propofol and ketofol on core body temperatures in a pediatric population during MRI. Our hypothesis was that the increase in body temperature will be more prominent in pediatric patients receiving ketofol than in those receiving propofol. METHODS This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind study in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 10 years. The patients were American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical class I-II who had undergone MRI under anesthesia at the Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, MRI Area, between August 2014 and February 2016. Patients were assigned to one of two groups: Group I (propofol group) and Group II (ketofol group). MRIs were performed with a 1.5 Tesla (T) device. Bilateral tympanic membrane temperature measurements before and after the procedure were performed. RESULTS Body temperature decreased in both groups after MRI. Clinically significant hypothermia or hyperthermia was not observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION Temperature monitoring is not necessary for every patient being imaged.

148801,Health Equity in Artificial Intelligence and Primary Care Research: Protocol for a Scoping Review.,2021-09-17,"Cryptosporidiosis of neonatal dairy calves causes diarrhea, resulting in important economic losses. In Argentina, prevalence values of Cryptosporidium spp. and other enteropathogens such as group A rotavirus (RVA), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC, endotoxin STa+), have been independently studied in different regions. However, an integrative epidemiological investigation on large-scale farms has not been carried out. In this study, fecal samples (n = 908) were randomly collected from diarrheic and healthy calves from 42 dairy farms, and analyzed for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp., RVA, BCoV, ETEC (STa+) and Salmonella spp. In all sampled dairy farms, dams had been vaccinated against rotavirus and gram-negative bacteria to protect calves against neonatal diarrhea. The proportion of calves shedding Cryptosporidium spp., RVA, and BCoV in animals younger than 20 days of age were 29.8%, 12.4% and 6.4%, and in calves aged between 21 and 90 days, 5.6%, 3.9%, and 1.8%, respectively. ETEC was absent in the younger, and occurred only sporadically in the older group (0.9%), whereas Salmonella spp. was absent in both. The observed sporadic finding or even absence of bacterial pathogens might be explained by the frequent use of parenteral antibiotics in 25.3% and 6.5% of the younger and the older group of calves, respectively, within 2 days prior to sampling and/or vaccination of dams against gram-negative bacteria. Diarrhea was observed in 28.8% (95% CI, 24.7-32.8%) of the younger calves and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.1-15.5%) of the older calves. Importantly, Cryptosporidium spp. (odds ratio (OR) = 5.7; 95% CI, 3.3-9.9; p < 0.0001) and RVA (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1; p < 0.05) were both found to be risk factors for diarrhea in calves younger than 20 days old. Based on its high prevalence and OR, our results strongly suggest that Cryptosporidium spp. is the principal causative factor for diarrhea in the group of neonatal calves, whereas RVA seems to play a secondary role in the etiology of diarrhea in the studied farms, with about three-times lower prevalence and a half as high OR. Furthermore, a coinfection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. and RVA of 3.7% was observed in the group of younger calves, which strengthens the assumption that these events are independent. In contrast, due to a low infection rate of enteropathogens in older calves, mixed infection (<< 1%) was virtually absent in this group.","Garro, Carlos J; Morici, Gabriel E; Tomazic, Mariela L; Vilte, Daniel; Encinas, Micaela; Vega, Celina; Bok, Marina; Parreño, Viviana; Schnittger, Leonhard","Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2021.100567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024383/,307

AIM To determine prevalence of CPE in hospital drains exposed to in-patients with CPE, relatedness of drain and patient CPE, and risk factors for drain contamination. METHODS We cultured sink and shower drains in patient rooms and communal shower rooms exposed to 310 in-patients with CPE colonization/infection at 10 hospitals. Using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing, in-patient and corresponding drain CPE were compared. Risk factors for drain contamination were assessed using multi-level modelling. FINDINGS Of 1,209 exposed patient room and communal shower room drains, 53 (4%) yielded 62 CPE isolates in 7 (70%) hospitals. Of 49 CPE isolates in patient room drains, 4 (8%) were linked to prior room occupants. Linked drain/room occupant pairs included Citrobacter freundii ST18 isolates separated by 8 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), related blaKPC-containing IncN3-type plasmids (different species), related blaKPC-3-containing IncN-type plasmids (different species), and related blaOXA-48-containing IncL/M-type plasmids (different species). In one hospital, drain isolates from 8 rooms on 2 units were Enterobacter hormaechei separated by 0-6 SNVs. Shower drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than hand hygiene (OR 3.45, 95%CI 1.66-7.16) or patient use (OR 13.0, 95%CI 4.29-39.1) sink drains. Hand hygiene sink drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than patient use sink drains (OR 3.75, 95%CI 1.17-12.0). CONCLUSION Drain contamination was uncommon but widely dispersed. Drain CPE unrelated to patient exposure suggests contamination by undetected colonized patients or retrograde (drain-to-drain) contamination.

151529,Association between parent and child physical activity: a systematic review.,2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVE The present study was aimed at demonstrating the beneficial effect of minimally invasive radiofrequency surgical ablation on left atrial remodeling using 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. METHODS The study population consisted of 33 patients (mean age, 64.6 ± 6.9 years; 84.8% men) with paroxysmal lone atrial fibrillation undergoing minimally invasive radiofrequency surgical ablation at our institution (University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands) from 2007 to 2011. The control group included 20 age- and gender-matched healthy adults. The left atrial peak systolic strain, peak strain rate, peak early diastolic strain rate, and peak negative strain rate were measured. Left atrial reverse remodeling was defined as a reduction in the left atrial volume index of 15% or greater. RESULTS The peak systolic strain was lower in patients with atrial fibrillation than in the controls (P < .001). It had increased significantly at 3 months (P < .001) and 12 months (P = .01) after surgery. Similarly, the peak strain rate (P < .001) was lower in patients with atrial fibrillation but had increased 3 months (P = .004) and 12 months (P = .001) after surgery. Finally, the peak early diastolic strain rate (P < .001) and peak negative strain rate (P < .001) were less negative at baseline compared with the rates in the controls. Both indexes had improved significantly at the follow-up examinations (3 months, P = .008 and P = .02; 12 months, both P = .01). Left atrial reverse remodeling occurred in 60.6% of patients at 3 months and 72.7% at 12 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation resulted in significant left atrial reverse remodeling and significant improvement in left atrial compliance and function after restoration of sinus rhythm, as demonstrated by 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography analysis. Our findings need to be confirmed by additional and larger prospective studies.","La Meir, Mark; Gelsomino, Sandro; Lucà, Fabiana; Pison, Laurant; Rao, Carmelo Massimiliano; Wellens, Francis; Maessen, Jos G",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.05.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22713302/,307

However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.","Grifoni, Alba; Sidney, John; Zhang, Yun; Scheuermann, Richard H; Peters, Bjoern; Sette, Alessandro",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3541361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714104/,307

The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. RESULTS The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002). DISCUSSION SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak. The pattern of IgM/IgG reactivity was influenced by age: IgM was more frequently detected in participants aged >45 years.

153275,Distance Learning and Spaced Review to Complement Dermoscopy Training for Primary Care.,2021-03-01,"With increasing age, individuals are more vulnerable to viral infections such as with influenza or the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One age-associated defect in human T cells is the reduced expression of miR-181a. miR-181ab1 deficiency in peripheral murine T cells causes delayed viral clearance after infection, resembling human immune aging. Here we show that naive T cells from older individuals as well as miR-181ab1-deficient murine T cells develop excessive replication stress after activation, due to reduced histone expression and delayed S-phase cell cycle progression. Reduced histone expression was caused by the miR-181a target SIRT1 that directly repressed transcription of histone genes by binding to their promoters and reducing histone acetylation. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity or SIRT1 silencing increased histone expression, restored cell cycle progression, diminished the replication-stress response, and reduced the production of inflammatory mediators in replicating T cells from old individuals. Correspondingly, treatment with SIRT1 inhibitors improved viral clearance in mice with miR-181a-deficient T cells after LCMV infection. In conclusion, SIRT1 inhibition may be beneficial to treat systemic viral infection in older individuals by targeting antigen-specific T cells that develop replication stress due to miR-181a deficiency.","Kim, Chulwoo; Jin, Jun; Ye, Zhongde; Jadhav, Rohit R; Gustafson, Claire E; Hu, Bin; Cao, Wenqiang; Tian, Lu; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci143632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060486/,307

METHODS A total of 52 trans-radial diagnostic angiograms were evaluated in a tertiary care stroke center from December 2019 until March 2020. We analyzed a number of anatomical variables to evaluate for correlation to outcome measures of angiography difficulty. RESULTS The presence of a proximal radial loop had a higher conversion to femoral access (p<0.03). The presence of a large diameter aortic arch (p<0.01), double subclavian innominate curve (p<0.01), left proximal common carotid artery (CCA) loop (p<0.001), acute subclavian vertebral angle (p<0.01), and absence of bovine aortic arch anatomy (p=0.03) were associated with more difficult trans-radial cerebral angiography and increased fluoroscopy time-per-vessel.

In particular, according to the serum cytokine profiling, pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) were observed to be considerably higher in patients experiencing respiratory distress, septic shock and/or multi-organ failure, namely ""critical cases"" requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, very often resulting in death. Interestingly, the production of these cytokines from human lymphocytes was found to be modulated by exposure of 24 h to a 554.2-553.8 mT inhomogeneous static magnetic field (SMF), which elicits IL-10 and suppresses IL-6. Thus, herein, with the aim of restoring lymphocyte count and physiological serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10, the infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched and SMF-exposed allogenic lymphocytes is proposed for the first time as an easy and affordable treatment option for COVID-19 patients. Even if the count of lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients is very low, SMF exposure may be a valuable tool for reprogramming autologous lymphocytes towards physiological conditions. Furthermore, the same procedure could be extended to include the whole autologous or allogenic white blood cells (WBCs).

Fusions involving the neuregulin-1 gene (NRG1) result in ErbB-mediated pathway activation and therefore present a rational candidate for targeted treatment. The most frequently reported NRG1 fusion is CD74-NRG1, which most commonly occurs in patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (IMA) of the lung, although several other NRG1 fusion partners have been identified in patients with lung cancer, including ATP1B1, SDC4, and RBPMS. NRG1 fusions are also present in patients with other solid tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In general, NRG1 fusions are rare across different types of cancer, with a reported incidence of <1%, with the notable exception of IMA, which represents ≈2‒10% of lung adenocarcinomas and has a reported incidence of ≈10‒30% for NRG1 fusions. A substantial proportion (≈20%) of NRG1 fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases are non-mucinous adenocarcinomas.

157065,Poor sleep behavior burden and risk of COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization.,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic suprapubic hernia repair (LSHR) is frequently a technically difficult procedure. This is often due to extensive adhesions from multiple previous operations, the necessary wide pelvic dissection, and adequate mesh coverage with transfascial suture fixation. The aim of the current study was to document the complications and morbidity associated with the repair of suprapubic hernias. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with complex suprapubic ventral hernias undergoing laparoscopic repair between 2003 and 2007 at 2 university-based practices by 1 surgeon at each facility was conducted. The operative techniques were similar and included dissection into the space of Retzius to mobilize the dome of the bladder, intraperitoneal onlay of mesh using a barrier mesh, careful tack fixation to the pubic bone and Cooper's ligaments, and extensive transfascial suture fixation of the mesh. RESULTS A total of 47 patients were reviewed, 29 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 54 years. Patients averaged 3.5 previous abdominal surgeries (SD +/-2.3) and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 35.1 (SD +/-7.5). Previous ventral hernia repairs had been performed in 57% of patients. Average defect size was 139.8 cm(2) (SD +/-126) and average mesh size was 453.8 (SD +/-329.0), with an average hernia-to-mesh ratio of 3.2. Median length of stay was 3 days with a mean follow-up of 2.6 months (SD +/-3.1). There were 18 complications (38%): symptomatic seroma (n = 4), prolonged ileus (n = 2), chronic pain (n = 2), postoperative urinary retention (n = 2), enterotomy (n = 1), intraoperative bladder injury (n = 1), postoperative urinary tract infection (n = 1), mesh infection (n = 1), rapid ventricular rate (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 1), pulmonary embolism (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). One patient required conversion to open ventral hernia repair, no injury was identified. Recurrence occurred in 3 patients (6.3%). The mechanisms of recurrence included reherniation at the level of the pubic tubercle, a lateral mesh recurrence in a patient with a high BMI and small abdominal excursion, and in a pregnant patient who developed a fixation suture hernia. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic suprapubic hernia repair is safe and effective with a relatively low recurrence rate, considering the complexity of the repair.","Varnell, Brandon; Bachman, Sharon; Quick, Jacob; Vitamvas, Michelle; Ramshaw, Bruce; Oleynikov, Dmitry",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2008.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19095119/,307

In recent times, various commercial immunochromatographic (IC) test kits are available for rapid diagnosis, which require an assessment of their accuracy. Therefore, precision of a point-of-care IC combination test kit for canine coronavirus (CCoV)/CPV faecal antigen detection was evaluated in this study. Multicentred random faecal samples from 115 dogs with gastroenteritis were checked for the presence of CPV antigens using the SensPERT® IC combination test kit and the result was compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a reference test. Parvovirus was detected in 105 (91.3%) and 108 (93.9%) faecal samples by the point-of-care test kit and PCR, respectively. The point-of-care IC test kit showed 95.4% relative sensitivity, 71.4% specificity, 98.1% positive predictive value, 50.0% negative predictive value, and 93.9% accuracy comparable to conventional PCR in the samples tested. This point-of-care test kit also demonstrated a fair positive likelihood ratio (3.34), a very low negative likelihood ratio (0.07) and a moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.6) compared with conventional PCR. This test kit has shown to be very useful in the screening of dogs for CPV infection, and is a reliable alternative for diagnosing CPV both in conventional laboratories and remote areas without laboratories. Negative results in the IC testing with high suspicion of CPV infection should be further confirmed using superior test such as PCR.","Shima, Felix K; Gberindyer, Fidelis A; Tion, Matthew T; Fagbohun, Olusegun A; Omobowale, Temidayo O; Nottidge, Helen O",Topics in companion animal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2021.100551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34119705/,307

RECENT FINDINGS The efficacy of NIV is variable depending on the cause of the episode of ARF. In community-acquired pneumonia, NIV is often associated with poor response, with better response in patients with preexisting cardiac or respiratory disease. In patients with pandemic influenza H1N1 and severe ARF, NIV has been associated with high failure rates but relatively favorable mortality. In acute respiratory distress syndrome, NIV should be used very cautiously and restricted to patients with mild-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome without shock or metabolic acidosis due to the high failure rate observed in several reports. Despite limited evidence, NIV may improve the outcomes of patients with chest trauma and severe ARF. In postoperative ARF, both continuous positive airway pressure and NIV are effective to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in those with abdominal, cardiac, and thoracic surgery. SUMMARY Although patients with severe hypoxemic ARF are, in general, less likely to be intubated when NIV is used, the efficacy is different among these heterogeneous populations. Therefore, NIV is not routinely recommended in all patients with severe hypoxemic ARF.","Ferrer, Miquel; Torres, Antoni",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486576/,307

However, because CRP is a marker for systemic inflammation, this test is not specific to PJI. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES Our purpose was to assess whether synovial fluid and serum assays alone could differentiate between infected and uninfected revision knee arthroplasties and to determine which of these methods had the greatest diagnostic accuracy. METHODS We collected synovial fluid specimens from 66 patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty. Patients were judged uninfected or infected by standardized criteria. Synovial CRP levels were measured using an individual CRP assay (15 samples; 10 infected, five uninfected) and a multiplex immunoassay platform (59 samples; 25 infected, 34 uninfected). Results from preoperative standard serum CRP assays conducted were also collected (55 samples; 25 infected, 30 uninfected). Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed for each assay with a diagnosis of infection based on previously established criteria. RESULTS Synovial CRP concentrations differed between infected and uninfected joints in the multiplex and serum analyses. The area under the curve was 0.84 for the individual assay, 0.91 for the multiplex assay, and 0.88 for the serum CRP assay. Sensitivity and specificity were 70.0% and 100.0% for the individual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 84.0% and 97.1% for the multiplex assay, and 76.0% and 93.3% for the serum CRP assay. CONCLUSIONS An assay measuring CRP in synovial fluid may be more accurate in diagnosing PJI than the standard serum CRP assay. We believe such an assay holds promise as a new diagnostic marker for PJI.","Parvizi, Javad; Jacovides, Christina; Adeli, Bahar; Jung, Kwang Am; Hozack, William J",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-011-1991-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21786056/,307
163552,PRINCIPLE trial demonstrates scope for in-pandemic improvement in primary care antibiotic stewardship,2021-02-04,"Background In a tertiary respiratory centre, large cohorts of patients are managed in an outpatient setting and require blood tests to monitor disease activity and organ toxicity. This requires either visits to tertiary centres for phlebotomy and physician review or utilisation of primary care services. Objectives This study aims to validate remote capillary blood testing in an outpatient setting and analyse impact on clinical pathways. Methods A single-centre prospective cross-sectional validation and parallel observational study was performed. Remote finger prick capillary blood testing was validated compared to local standard venesection using comparative statistical analysis: paired t-test, correlation and Bland-Altman. Capillary was considered interchangeable with venous samples if all 3 criteria were met: non-significant paired t-test (i.e. p>0.05), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) >0.8 and 95% of tests within 10% difference through Bland-Altman (Limits of agreement). In parallel, current clinical pathways including phlebotomy practice was analysed over 4 weeks to review test predictability. A subsequent pilot cohort study analysed potential impact of remote capillary blood sampling on shared decision making and outpatient clinical pathways. Results 117 paired capillary and venous blood samples were prospectively analysed. Interchangeability with venous blood was seen with HbA1c (%), total protein and CRP. Further tests, although not interchangeable, are likely useful to enable longitudinal remote monitoring (e.g. liver function, total IgE, and vitamin D). 65% of outpatient clinic blood tests were predictable with 16% of patients requiring further contact due to actions required. Pilot implementation of remote capillary sampling showed patient and clinician-reported improvement in shared decision-making given contemporaneous blood test results. Conclusions Remote capillary blood sampling can be used accurately for specific tests to monitor chronic disease, and when incorporated into an outpatient clinical pathway can improve shared decision making and patient experience. Further research is required to determine health-economic impact and applicability within telemedicine-based outpatient care.","Nwankwo, L.; McLaren, K.; Donovan, J.; Ni, M.

The research sample consists of ten high market capitalization stocks representing five price fractions of the population listed stocks on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1 to May 31, 2020. The results show that there are four stocks that are included in the portfolio formation, namely CASA with a proportion of 50%, BNLI with a proportion of 26 %, UNVR with a proportion of 15%, and HMSP with a proportion of 9%. Based on portfolio performance testing using the Sharpe single index model, it is known that the portfolio during the COVID-19 has a negative Sharpe ratio, meaning that portfolio performance is underperforming. The findings provide evidence that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the stock market so that many investors have suffered losses on their portfolios.

Biodegradable film mulching (BFM) in various crops is a good alternative to plastic film mulching (PFM). However, the difference in field water consumption between BFM and PFM has not been fully investigated. A four-year experiment with an improved evapotranspiration (ET) model (BSW) was performed to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of BFM, PFM, and no film mulching (NFM) on ET dynamics.

The results of multi-year verification illustrated that the model accuracy was well-supported during 2016-2019 with mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.0%-16.9% and 13.1%-19.1% for ET and evaporation (E), respectively. The average cumulative ET (CET) under FM (i.e., BFM and PFM) was 443.5 mm each year and decreased by 13.4% compared to NFM. However, there was an obvious difference in CET during the different hydrological years, especially in the early crop growth stages. In the wet years (2016 and 2018), the average CET under FM increased by 6.2%-7.0% compared to NFM but decreased by 7.1%-11.8% in the dry years (2017 and 2019). The transpiration (T) difference between FM and NFM primarily appeared in the early crop growth stages, and T / ET under FM was significantly higher than with NFM by 46.9%-50.2%. An obvious E difference between BFM and PFM was observed in the later crop growing stages due to a greater area of the disintegrated biodegradable film. Additionally, crop yield under PFM and BFM increased by 35.4% and 28.3% compared with NFM, respectively, and water use efficiency (WUE) increased by 47.1% and 35.8%, respectively. Thus, biodegradable film is recommended to replace plastic film to effectively promote the development of sustainable agriculture.

The current literature overlooks the influence of these important events on the inflation spillover of the G7 countries. This study fulfills this gap and investigates the nature of inflation spillover in the short, medium, and long term. Using the monthly data from 1956:6 to 2020:12, the study finds that Japan and the United States are the main transmitters of inflation. International trade, purchasing power parity, low-cost technology, and the Abenomics policy were found to be responsible for the inflation spillover. We suggest that the central banks of these countries collaborate to achieve the targeted inflation rate.","Khandokar, Istiak Tiwari Aviral Kumar Husain Humaira Sohag Kazi",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14080392,307

The model capability is demonstrated for the case of the COVID-19 attack at the NATO flagship USS Theodore Roosevelt in early 2020. Computational intelligence is a reasonable approach for dealing with uncertainties such as low reliability of information and source credibility. The proposed EMC causal models enable the development of countermeasures for epidemiological attacks using the notion of gaps in the four EMC phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, the EMC problem can be formulated and formalized as bridging the identified technology?society gap, e.g., mitigation of risks and biases;and machine reasoning can be incorporated at any level of the EMC decision-making. Using available real-world data on the USS Theodore Roosevelt outbreak, we show how machine reasoning mechanisms can help the captain to make more reliable decisions in critical epidemiological situations.","Lai, Kenneth Yanushkevich Svetlana N.; Shmerko, Vlad P.",The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,https://doi.org/10.1177/15485129211028659,307

All the countries faced this pandemic challenge but most of the underdeveloped countries are facing more dangerous situations due to limited financial and health infrastructure to respond against it. Overall, more than 100 million people are affected by the Novel Virus which results in 2.15 million people dying within a small interval of time. The current pandemic has brought unpredicted challenges to societies and also threatened humanity and global resilience. According to the National Command Operation Center, Pakistan, more than 0.534 million people are suffering with COVID-19 with more than 11 thousand deaths across the country. The Government of Pakistan has taken different initiatives like complete and smart lockdown to control the pandemic as much as possible. After the removal of the first lockdown, the high peak was observed across the country and created a panic situation among people and the government again closed all the educational and religious institutions with immediate effect to tackle the second wave of pandemic. Further, the interconnected nature of COVID-19 crises demands an integrated approach and coordination between all stakeholders to handle the pandemic in a significant way. Identifying the best set of policies and guidelines to handle COVID-19 challenges, and align them for the sustainable recovery from pandemic. The basic challenge facing the policy makers of underdeveloped countries is how to utilize limited resources to achieve interconnected goals for managing health recovery, economic crises, and creating environmental sustainability. We present a framework for identifying and prioritizing policy action to address COVID-19 and ensure sustainable recovery. The framework outlines principles and criteria, and shared policy goals, identifying smart strategies, accessing policy compatibility, aligning policy instruments and improving sustainability in short and long term policy decisions. This framework can be helpful for policy makers in the short and long run for mapping policy options and accessing cross-sectoral implementation. This framework is also helpful for policy makers to prioritize policy choice and allocate limited resources in such a way that they are directed toward actions and achieve interconnected solutions of health, economy, and environment.","Sohil, F.; Sohail, M.

Blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro) share over 80% homology at the three-dimensional protein level. Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards Mpro, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Augusto Chaves, Otávio; Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Temerozo, Jairo Ramos; Pereira-Dutra, Filipe; Mizurini, Daniella M.; Monteiro, Robson Q.; Vazquez, Leonardo; Bozza, Patricia T.; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.461605,307

This situation is caused by the specifics of the international epidemiological situation with the widespread incidence of COVID-19, which leads to the adoption of extraordinary measures to counteract the further aggravation of this situation. Additional factors in the formation of food crises are the complication of the full functioning of natural-artificial aggregates of elements that make up the system of agro-industrial production, formed within the framework of national socio-economic systems, as well as in the structure of international food production and consumer relations. The main means of overcoming these crises consist in the development and further implementation of rational resource-saving technologies for the functioning of the agro-industrial complex with the extraction of various components from the environment, subject to the minimum possible negative impact on it. Thus, the most important ways to overcome the food crises, which are aggravated by the spread of COVID-19, are the sustainable partnership of state management structures and representatives of the private sector of the economy through modern electronic and digital communications in the development of advanced resource-saving technologies for the production of high-quality food, providing comprehensive public-private financial support for the production of high-quality food, as well as comprehensive compliance with epidemiological safety standards.","Slozhenkina, M.

Super spread events (SSEs) potentiate early outbreak of the disease and its constant spread in later stages. Viral recombination events within species and across hosts lead to natural selection based on advanced infectivity and resistance. In this review, the importance of containment of SSEs was investigated with emphasis on stopping COVID-19 spread and its socio-economic consequences. A comprehensive search was conducted among literature available in multiple electronic sources to find articles that addressed the “potential role of SSEs on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic” and were published before 20(th) of August 2020. Overall, ninety-eight articles were found eligible and reviewed. Specific screening strategies within potential super spreading host groups can also help to efficiently manage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) epidemics, in contrast to the partially effective general restriction measures. The effect of SSEs on previous SARS epidemics has been documented in detail. However, the respective potential impact of SSEs on SARS-COV-2 outbreak is composed and presented in the current review, thereby implying the warranted effort required for effective SSE preventive strategies, which may lead to overt global community health benefits. This is crucial for SARS-COV-2 pandemic containment as the vaccine(s) development process will take considerable time to safely establish its potential usefulness for future clinical usage.","Kyriakopoulos, Anthony M.; Papaefthymiou, Apostolis; Georgilas, Nikolaos; Doulberis, Michael; Kountouras, Jannis",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587986/,307

This study aimed to examine stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Sarawak General Hospital (SGH), Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional observational study conducted in SGH during the pandemic with an online self-administered questionnaire composed of two parts, the socio-demographic characteristics, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). RESULTS A total of 105 healthcare workers responded to this study. A questionnaire in both Bahasa Melayu and English was used. The findings showed that all healthcare workers had mild anxiety, with the majority experiencing mild stress (57.1%), and almost half of the respondents experiencing mild depression (41%). Female subjects had a significant higher mean score in anxiety level and stress level compared to male subjects (10.0±3.20 vs. 8.6±2.93, p<0.05; 14.1±4.76 vs. 10.7±3.70, p<0.05, respectively). Staff who were transferred from other units to handle COVID-19 cases experienced more psychological symptoms.

We postulated that a respiratory virus infection increases exhaled NO levels in asthma, and examined the relationship between the virus-induced changes in exhaled NO and in airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine. In a parallel study, seven patients underwent experimental rhinovirus 16 (RV16) inoculation at days 0 and 1, whilst seven patients received placebo. Exhaled NO was measured at baseline (day 0) and at days 1, 2 and 3 after inoculation. Histamine challenges were performed prior to (day -7) and after inoculation (day 3), and were expressed as provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (PC20). Following RV16 infection there was a significant increase in NO at days 2 and 3 as compared to baseline (median change (range): 4.2 (7.5) parts per billion (ppb), p=0.03, and 3.0 (10.1) ppb, p=0.02, respectively). Furthermore, PC20 decreased significantly following RV16 infection (mean+/-SD change in doubling dose: -0.65+/-0.54, p=0.02), whereas PC20 did not change in the placebo group (p=0.1). There was a significant correlation between the RV16-induced changes in exhaled NO levels at day 2 and the accompanying changes in PC20 at day 3 (rank correlation coefficient (rs): 0.86, p=0.01). Hence, the greater the increase in exhaled NO, the smaller the decrease in PC20. We conclude that rhinovirus infection increases exhaled nitric oxide levels in asthmatics, and that this increase is inversely associated with worsening of airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine. These results suggest that viral induction of nitric oxide synthase within the airways may play a protective role in exacerbations of asthma.","de Gouw, H W; Grünberg, K; Schot, R; Kroes, A C; Dick, E C; Sterk, P J",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9543281/,307

There are many MHV strains that vary in virulence, organotropism and cell tropism, and are constantly evolving by naturally occurring mutation and recombination. Based on pathogenesis studies MHV strains are usually grouped according to their primary tissue tropism into two biotypes: polytropic and enterotropic. Enterotropic strains of MHV replicate in the intestinal mucosa and only rarely spread to other tissues. No morphological structure of the virion has as yet been identified that is responsible for enterotropism. The course of an MHV infection is dependent on the virus strain and host factors. Generally, MHV causes an acute, self-limiting infection which is inapparent in adult mice. Neonates are highly susceptible to disease and show high mortality. In an enzootically infected colony, however, they are protected by maternally derived passive immunity. Detection of MHV infections depends on serological screening of colonies. MHV is controlled by culling and rederivation of the affected colony using hysterectomy or embryo transfer or by elimination through cessation of breeding.","Homberger, F R",Laboratory animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9175007/,307
193650,Occupational health and infection control practices related to severe acute respiratory syndrome: health care worker perceptions.,2005,"Acute maxillary sinusitis is a common condition requiring broad-spectrum therapy to prevent development of chronic disease. A randomised, double-blind, multicentre study was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (n = 185) and clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily (n = 185), both administered for 10 days, in the treatment of patients with acute sinusitis. Efficacy was determined by assessment of clinical response at post-treatment and follow-up, and by radiological assessment at pre-treatment and follow-up. Assessment of days absent from work due to illness was also made. In the cefuroxime axetil group, 169/185 (91%) patients were cured/improved at post-treatment, as were 172/185 (93%) patients receiving clarithromycin and, of these, 137/169 (81%) and 143/172 (83%) maintained their response at follow-up. Follow-up radiography showed a reduction in incidence of air fluid level and/or opacification from 96% to 15% (cefuroxime axetil) and from 96% to 11% (clarithromycin), and a decrease in frequency of mucosal thickening from 58% to 28% (cefuroxime axetil) and from 56% to 29% (clarithromycin). Only 10% of patients in either group experienced adverse events and days absent from work were comparable. This study demonstrated clinical equivalence between twice-daily cefuroxime axetil and clarithromycin, both treatments being effective and well tolerated.","Stefansson, P; Jacovides, A; Jablonicky, P; Sedani, S; Staley, H",Rhinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9923060/,307

We have humanized this antibody to generate MAb hu206 by complementarity determining region grafting. MAb hu206 retained binding and in vitro neutralizing activity, as well as cross-reactivity with ten different VZV strains. Single-chain antibody fragments (scAb) derived from MAb hu206 were produced in Escherichia coli. These scAb retained the binding properties of the whole antibody. However, monomeric scAb exhibited markedly reduced neutralizing activity compared to the bivalent parental MAb hu206. Shortening the peptide linker joining the V(H) to the V(kappa) domain from 14 to 5 or even 0 residues encouraged multimerization and increased neutralizing efficacy. The fact that Fab fragments enzymatically generated from whole MAb hu206 lost their neutralizing potency lent support to the proposal that valency is important for VZV neutralization at this epitope.","Drew, P D; Moss, M T; Pasieka, T J; Grose, C; Harris, W J; Porter, A J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11458003/,307
196138,The use of faecal haemoglobin in deciding which patients presenting to primary care require further investigation (and how quickly) - the FIT approach.,2021-02-01,INTRODUCTION Activation of renal sympathetic nerves is associated with the development of hypertension. Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation with radiofrequency energy ablation is a new promising treatment option for resistant hypertension. We here report the first Danish experiences and results with this technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS Nine patients with resistant hypertension and a day-time 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) of 152/89 mmHg ± 10/10 (standard deviation) mmHg despite treatment with 5.4 ± 1.4 anti-hypertensive drugs underwent catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation with the Symplicity catheter. RESULTS No periprocedural complications or adverse events during follow-up were observed. Seven patients received complete ablation and two patients only partial ablation. Five patients responded to the treatment with a reduction in day-time 24-hour ambulatory BP from 158/94 ± 13/9 mmHg to 139/82 ± 10/8 mmHg (p < 0.05) at the one month follow-up and a reduction in the number of anti-hypertensive drugs from 5.4 ± 1.6 to 3.4 ± 0.9 (p < 0.05). BP in the remaining four patients was not significantly changed and antihypertensive therapy was not changed. CONCLUSION Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation is a feasible and in several cases also effective treatment option for patients with resistant hypertension. Adequately designed controlled trials are needed to assess the long-term safety and the full potential of this treatment.,"Vase, Henrik; Mathiassen, Ole Norling; Kaltoft, Anne; Pedersen, Erling Bjerregaard; Christensen, Kent Lodberg; Buus, Niels Henrik; Lederballe, Ole; Lassen, Jens Flensted; Bøtker, Hans Erik; Thuesen, Leif",Danish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22677237/,307

In attempting to improve occupational health and infection control procedures to prevent occupationally acquired infections in health care workers, it is important to examine the perceptions of those workers who are expected to adhere to specific policies. The authors conducted 15 focus groups of health care workers representing seven different job classifications in two Canadian provinces where SARS outbreaks occurred in 2003 using a theoretical framework which divided factors associated with self-protective behaviour at work into organizational, environmental, and individual factors. Content analysis of these discussions revealed that workers placed more importance on organizational factors than environmental and individual factors. The results are similar to those of a recently completed literature review of this subject, and should be considered when developing new occupational health initiatives to protect health care workers from existing or emerging respiratory tract infections.","Moore, David M; Gilbert, Mark; Saunders, Sharon; Bryce, Elizabeth; Yassi, Annalee",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16018538/,307

198118,"Ready, aye ready? Support mechanisms for healthcare workers in emergency planning: a critical gap analysis of three hospital emergency plans.",2007,"Many microbial pathogens and toxins recognize animal cells via cell surface sialic acids (Sias) that are alpha 2-3- or alpha 2-8-linked to the underlying glycan chain. Human influenza A/B viruses are unusual in preferring alpha 2-6-linked Sias, undergoing a switch from alpha 2-3 linkage preference during adaptation from animals to humans. This correlates with the expression of alpha 2-6-linked Sias on ciliated human airway epithelial target cells and of alpha 2-3-linked Sias on secreted soluble airway mucins, which are unable to inhibit virus binding. Given several known differences in Sia biology between humans and apes, we asked whether this pattern of airway epithelial Sia linkages is also human-specific. Indeed, we show that since the last common ancestor with apes, humans underwent a concerted bidirectional switch in alpha 2-6-linked Sia expression between airway epithelial cell surfaces and secreted mucins. This can explain why the chimpanzee appears relatively resistant to experimental infection with human Influenza viruses. Other tissues showed additional examples of human-specific increases or decreases in alpha 2-6-linked Sia expression and only one example of a change specific to certain great apes. Furthermore, while human and great ape leukocytes both express alpha 2-6-linked Sias, only human erythrocytes have markedly up-regulated expression. These cell type-specific changes in alpha 2-6-Sia expression during human evolution represent another example of a human-specific change in Sia biology. Because the data set involves multiple great apes, we can also conclude that Sia linkage expression patterns can be conserved during millions of years of evolution within some vertebrate taxa while undergoing sudden major changes in other closely related ones.","Gagneux, Pascal; Cheriyan, Monica; Hurtado-Ziola, Nancy; van der Linden, Els C M Brinkman; Anderson, Dan; McClure, Harold; Varki, Ajit; Varki, Nissi M",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14500706/,307

In this study we investigated the ability of the bovine coronavirus (BCV) N protein to interact with RNA. Histidine-tagged BCV N (his-N) protein was expressed in bacteria. A filter binding assay was established to quantitatively measure the binding efficiency of purified his-N to different RNAs. The results indicate that bacterially expressed N bound both BCV and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) RNAs. Binding to in vitro generated BCV and MHV RNA transcripts was significantly higher than binding to a non-coronavirus RNA. Similar binding efficiencies were measured for a BCV defective genome, pDrep, and a transcript that contained the MHV packaging signal. Interestingly, the entire MHV DI, pMIDI-C, was bound at a higher efficiency than the packaging signal alone. This is one of the first reports to show that N interacts with the MHV packaging signal.","Cologna, R; Hogue, B G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782303/,307

Among these are the simplicity of administration, the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic immunity, and the advantage of permitting genetic manipulation for optimal antigen presentation. In this study, the benefit of having a heterologous antigen expressed on the surface of a live vector rather than intracellularly was evaluated. Accordingly, the immune response of mice immunized with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the Escherichia coli 987P fimbrial antigen on its surface (Fas(+)) was compared with the expression in the periplasmic compartment (Fas(-)). Orally immunized BALB/c mice showed that 987P fimbriated Salmonella serovar Typhimurium CS3263 (aroA asd) with pCS151 (fas(+) asd(+)) elicited a significantly higher level of 987P-specific systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA than serovar Typhimurium CS3263 with pCS152 (fasD mutant, asd(+)) expressing 987P periplasmic antigen. Further studies were aimed at determining whether the 987P fimbriae expressed by serovar Typhimurium chi4550 (cya crp asd) could be used as carriers of foreign epitopes. For this, the vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express chimeric fimbriae carrying the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) C (379-388) and A (521-531) epitopes of the spike protein inserted into the 987P major fimbrial subunit FasA. BALB/c mice administered orally serovar Typhimurium chi4550 expressing the chimeric fimbriae from the tet promoter in pCS154 (fas(+) asd(+)) produced systemic antibodies against both fimbria and the TGEV C epitope but not against the TGEV A epitope. To improve the immunogenicity of the chimeric fimbriae, the in vivo inducible nirB promoter was inserted into pCS154, upstream of the fas genes, to create pCS155. In comparison with the previously used vaccine, BALB/c mice immunized orally with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155 demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA against 987P fimbria. Moreover, mucosal IgA against the TGEV C epitope was only detected with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155. The induced antibodies also recognized the epitopes in the context of the full-length TGEV spike protein. Hence, immune responses to heterologous chimeric fimbriae on Salmonella vaccine vectors can be optimized by using promoters known to be activated in vivo.","Chen, H; Schifferli, D M",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10816454/,307

AIMS To analyse intestinal immunoglobulin production in HIV infection in comparison with that in saliva and serum. PATIENTS AND METHODS Immunoglobulin G (IgG), A (IgA), and M (IgM) concentrations were determined in supernatants of short term cultured duodenal biopsy samples, serum, and saliva from HIV infected patients (n = 28) and controls (n = 14) by radial immunodiffusion. RESULTS IgG was increased in the supernatants of short term cultured biopsy samples and saliva from HIV infected patients compared with controls (p < 0.01), but IgA and IgM levels were normal. In contrast, both IgG and IgA concentrations in serum were higher in HIV infected patients than in controls (p < 0.002). No correlation was found between IgA produced by duodenal biopsy specimens and serum IgA. CONCLUSION Abnormalities in mucosal immunoglobulin production in HIV infection were surprisingly small, indicating that specific secretory immunity rather than quantitative immunoglobulin production may be impaired. However, increased production of IgG could contribute to mucosal inflammation by complement activation. Our findings of normal mucosal IgA production and the lack of correlation between serum and mucosal IgA argues against an intestinal origin for the increased serum IgA levels in HIV infected patients.","Schneider, T; Zippel, T; Schmidt, W; Pauli, G; Wahnschaffe, U; Chakravarti, S; Heise, W; Riecken, E O; Zeitz, M; Ullrich, R",Gut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9577341/,307

Kids Helpline, Australia's national youth helpline, provides children and young people with free 24/7 information and counseling through telephone, WebChat, and e-mail. We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18 years. The number of contacts about mental health, suicide/self-harm, and family relationships increased, with mental health contacts also increasing as a proportion of total contacts. COVID-19-related concerns were the most common reason for contact in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic saw a rapid increase in demand for Kids Helpline, mainly by WebChat, with the virus itself, mental health, suicide/self-harm, and relationships common reasons for contact. Responding to rapid changes in demand for particular modalities is challenging and understanding of the use and effectiveness of different modalities is needed.","Batchelor, Samantha; Stoyanov, Stoyan; Pirkis, Jane; Kõlves, Kairi",J Adolesc Health,,307
206867,PMH24 Demographic and Clinical Factors Associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"This study investigates the types of misinformation spread on Twitter that evokes scientific authority or evidence when making false claims about the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Specifically, we examined tweets generated after former U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted misinformation about the drug using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model that is used to cluster tweets into misinformation topics based on textual similarity. The top 10 tweets from each topic cluster were content coded for three types of misinformation categories related to scientific authority: medical endorsements of hydroxychloroquine, scientific information used to support hydroxychloroquine’s use, and a comparison group that included scientific evidence opposing hydroxychloroquine’s use. Results show a much higher volume of tweets featuring medical endorsements and use of supportive scientific information compared to accurate and updated scientific evidence, that misinformation-related tweets propagated for a longer time frame, and the majority of hydroxychloroquine Twitter discourse expressed positive views about the drug. Metadata from Twitter accounts found that prominent users within misinformation discourse were more likely to have media or political affiliation and explicitly expressed support for President Trump. Conversely, prominent accounts within the scientific opposition discourse primarily consisted of medical doctors or scientists but had far less influence in the Twitter discourse. Implications of these findings and connections to related social media research are discussed, as well as cognitive mechanisms for understanding susceptibility to misinformation and strategies to combat misinformation spread via online platforms. © The Author(s) 2021.","Haupt, M.

207201,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep medicine practices,2020,"AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health. Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","Liao, Y H; Fan, B F; Zhang, H M; Guo, L; Lee, Y; Wang, W X; Li, W Y; Gong, M Q; Lui, L M W; Li, L J; Lu, C Y; McIntyre, R S",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,307
208580,Utility of a webinar to educate trainees on UK core surgical training (CST) selection – A cross sectional study and future implications amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The classical Langevin Monte Carlo method looks for samples from a target distribution by descending the samples along the gradient of the target distribution. The method enjoys a fast convergence rate. However, the numerical cost is sometimes high because each iteration requires the computation of a gradient. One approach to eliminate the gradient computation is to employ the concept of""ensemble"". A large number of particles are evolved together so the neighboring particles provide gradient information to each other. In this article, we discuss two algorithms that integrate the ensemble feature into LMC and the associated properties. In particular, we find that if one directly surrogates the gradient using the ensemble approximation, the algorithm, termed Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo, is unstable due to a high variance term. If the gradients are replaced by the ensemble approximations only in a constrained manner, to protect from the unstable points, the algorithm, termed Constrained Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo, resembles the classical LMC up to an ensemble error but removes most of the gradient computation.","Ding, Zhiyan; Li, Qin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04279v3.pdf,307

210587,Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder Among Commercially Insured Patients in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has seen a widespread use of personal protective equipment, especially face masks. This has created the need to develop better and reusable protective masks with built-in antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and aerosol filtration properties to prevent the transmission of air-borne pathogens such as the coronaviruses. Herein, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets are used to prepare modified polycotton fabrics having excellent antibacterial activity and photothermal properties. Upon sunlight irradiation, the nanosheet-modified fabrics rapidly increased the surface temperature to â¼77 °C, making them ideal for sunlight-mediated self-disinfection. Complete self-disinfection of the nanosheet-modified fabric was achieved within 3 min of irradiation, making the fabrics favorably reusable upon self-disinfection. The nanosheet-modified fabrics maintained the antibacterial efficiency even after 60 washing cycles. Furthermore, the particle filtration efficiency of three-layered surgical masks was found to be significantly improved through incorporation of the MoS2-modified fabric as an additional layer of protective clothing, without compromising the breathability of the masks. The repurposed surgical masks could filter out around 97% of 200 nm particles and 96% of 100 nm particles, thus making them potentially useful for preventing the spread of coronaviruses (120 nm) by trapping them along with antibacterial protection against other airborne pathogens.","Kumar, Praveen; Roy, Shounak; Sarkar, Ankita; Jaiswal, Amit",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,307

211976,"Valuing out-of-pocket expenditure and health related quality of life of COVID-19 patients from Gujarat, India",2021,"In this paper, we study how different categories of crucial COVID-19 information influence price dynamics in stock and option markets during the period from 01/21/20 to 01/31/21. We present a theoretical model in which the behavioral traders make perceptual errors based on the intensity of sentiment arising from different types of news. In addition to the magnitude and direction of the news and its payoff relevance to security prices, other factors such as fear, emotion, and social media can influence the sentiment level. Using Google search data, we construct novel proxies for the sentiment levels induced by five categories of news, COVID, Market, Lockdown, Banking, and Government relief efforts. If the relative presence of behavioral traders in the stock market exceeds that in the option market, different predictions obtain for the effect of sentiment indices on jump volatility of the VIX index, the S&P 500 index, and the S&P 500 Banks index. We find that the jump component in the VIX index is increasing significantly with COVID index, Market index, Lockdown index, and Banking index. However, only COVID index and Market index increase the jump component of realized volatility of the stock indices (S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index). The Government relief efforts index decreases this jump component. Banking and Lockdown index reduce jump volatility in the S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index, but only with a delay of 5 days. These results are consistent with the predictions of our model.","John, Kose Li Jingrui",Journal of Banking &amp; Finance,,307

AIM: To assess potential reuse via autoclaving of NRMs worn daily in a major urban Canadian hospital. METHODS: NRM reusability was assessed following collection from volunteer staff after 2-8 h use, sterilization by autoclaving and PortaCount fit testing. A workflow was developed for reprocessing hundreds of NRMs daily. FINDINGS: Used NRMs passed fit testing after autoclaving once, with 86% passing a second reuse/autoclave cycle. A separate cohort of used masks pre-warmed before autoclaving passed fit testing. To recycle 200-1000 NRMs daily, procedures for collection, sterilization and re-distribution were developed to minimize particle aerosolization risk during NRM handling, to reject NRM showing obvious wear, and to promote adoption by staff. NRM recovery ranged from 49% to 80% across 12 collection cycles. CONCLUSION: Reuse of NRMs is feasible in major hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In sharp contrast to studies of unused NRMs passing fit testing after 10 autoclave cycles, we show that daily wear substantially reduces NRM fit, limiting reuse to a single cycle, but still increasing NRM stocks by â¼66%. Such reuse requires development of a comprehensive plan that includes communication across staffing levels, from front-line workers to hospital administration, to increase the collection, acceptance of and adherence to sterilization processes for NRM recovery.","Czubryt, M P; Stecy, T; Popke, E; Aitken, R; Jabusch, K; Pound, R; Lawes, P; Ramjiawan, B; Pierce, G N",J Hosp Infect,,307

METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of the GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR designs. The GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE-IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CE-IVD GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared.","Martínez-Murcia, A; Bru, G; Navarro, A; Ros-Tárraga, P; García-Sirera, A; Pérez, L",J. appl. microbiol,,307

Exposures were performed through diet using environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs over 4 months. No modification of classical biomarkers, lipid peroxidation, genotoxicity or F0 behaviour was observed. A significant decrease in growth was reported after at least two months of exposure. This decrease was similar between species, independent from the type of MPs polymer and the presence or not of spiked chemicals, but was much stronger in females. The reproduction was evaluated and it revealed a significant decrease in the reproductive output for both species and in far more serious numbers in medaka. PVC appeared more reprotoxic than PE as were MPs spiked with PFOS and benzophenone-3 compared to MPs spiked with benzo[a]pyrene. Further, PVC-benzophenone-3 produced behavioural disruption in offspring larvae. These results obtained with two species representing different aquatic environments suggest that microplastics exert toxic effects, slightly different according to polymers and the presence or not of sorbed chemicals, which may lead in all cases to serious ecological disruptions.","Cormier, Bettie; Le Bihanic, Florane; Cabar, Mathieu; Crebassa, Jean-Claude; Blanc, Mélanie; Larsson, Maria; Dubocq, Florian; Yeung, Leo; Clérandeau, Christelle; Keiter, Steffen H; Cachot, Jérôme; Bégout, Marie-Laure; Cousin, Xavier",J Hazard Mater,,307

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively expanded from China, involving several countries throughout the world, leading to the classification of the disease as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to published reports, COVID-19 severity and mortality are higher in elderly patients and those with active comorbidities. In particular, lung cancer patients were reported to be at high risk of pulmonary complications related to SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, the management of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a crucial issue, to which national and international oncology organizations have replied with recommendations concerning patients receiving anticancer treatments, delaying follow-up visits and limiting caregiver admission to the hospitals. In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation. Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment. In this study, we report the results of proactive measures including social media, telemedicine, and telephone triage for screening patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy). Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.","de Marinis, Filippo; Attili, Ilaria; Morganti, Stefania; Stati, Valeria; Spitaleri, Gianluca; Gianoncelli, Letizia; Del Signore, Ester; Catania, Chiara; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Omodeo Salè, Emanuela; Spaggiari, Lorenzo; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Passaro, Antonio",Front.

215444,Association of Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder With Posttraumatic Psychological Growth Among US Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the continuing surge of COVID-19, many patients have delayed or missed routine screening and preventive services. Medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease, mental health issues, and substance use disorder, may be identified later, leading to increases in patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data were used to assess 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) activations during 2018-2020. For specific activation types, the percentage of total activations was calculated per week and joinpoint analysis was used to identify changes over time. RESULTS: Since March 2020, the number of 911 emergency medical services (EMS) activations has decreased, while the percentages of on-scene death, cardiac arrest, and opioid use/overdose EMS activations were higher than pre-pandemic levels. During the early pandemic period, percentages of total EMS activations increased for on-scene death (from 1.3% to 2.4% during weeks 11-15), cardiac arrest (from 1.3% to 2.2% during weeks 11-15), and opioid use/overdose (from 0.6% to 1.1% during weeks 8-18); the percentages then declined, but remained above pre-pandemic levels through calendar week 52. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has indirect consequences, such as relative increases in EMS activations for cardiac events and opioid use/overdose, possibly linked to disruptions is healthcare access and health-seeking behaviors. Increasing telehealth visits or other opportunities for patient-provider touch points for chronic disease and substance use disorders that emphasize counseling, preventive care, and expanded access to medications can disrupt delayed care-seeking during the pandemic and potentially prevent premature death.","Handberry, Maya; Bull-Otterson, Lara; Dai, Mengtao; Mann, Clay N; Chaney, Eric; Ratto, Jeff; Horiuchi, Kalanthe; Siza, Charlene; Kulkarni, Aniket; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Boehmer, Tegan K",Clin. infect. dis,,307

It also investigates the degree to which knowledge management affects such a relationship in the context of Saudi Arabia. The study includes developing a survey as a data collection method. The responses from 136 SMEs were used to make an analysis and, consequently, draw a conclusion. It has been found that IT capabilities positively influence SMEs' responsiveness to changes brought by coronavirus, through supporting work flexibility and providing a wide range of options in the supply chain, processes, and sales.

The time for change is now. Providers of healthcare services must remain vigilant to the needs of the underserved, be aware of their own implicit biases, and take concerted efforts to break the cycle of disparate healthcare. Health science programs must be intentional in the recruitment of underrepresented minorities in their programs and incorporating core concepts related to health equity in the classroom and practicum experiences. The programmatic change can be accomplished using a variety of innovative methodologies, such as tailoring case studies and pathways to address inequities, mentoring in practicum settings, involving students in research exploring healthcare disparities and devising ways to promote patient centered care that results in better outcomes. Even ensuring students are linguistically correct when caring for patients can go a long way toward creating positive change.","Battle, Leslee EdD",Journal of Best Practices in Health Professions Diversity,,307

225250,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of young people and adults: a systematic review protocol of observational studies,2020,"This paper examines the role of interprofessional collaboration in the identification and reporting of a child in need. Such collaboration is especially important in the context of the global pandemic caused by the novel Coronavirus disease of 2019, known as COVID-19. The child protection system must have the capacity and resources to respond to increased demands during this time, and early childhood educators serve as an essential link for child protective services in identifying and reporting a child in need. As an effective system to accomplish these two aims requires a working collaboration among its participants, Bronstein's interdisciplinary collaboration model was used as a framework to interpret this practice. A small-scale qualitative study was conducted that included principals of nursery schools and child protection workers from one region in Estonia. Findings indicate that effective collaboration was believed to require communication and ongoing systematic relationship building. Collaboration in practice varied, as principals reported a high turnover rate for the child protection workers, which hindered the development of a working relationship and support for the process of noticing and thereby identifying a child in need. In contrast, child protection workers assessed collaboration more positively, recognizing the need to have a supportive system in place for nursery schools. Both groups of collaborators acknowledged the need to train teachers, particularly to conduct joint training exercises to foster a common understanding of the child in need and of the intervention process itself.","Toros, Karmen; Tart, Keidy; Falch-Eriksen, Asgeir",Early Child Educ J,,307
226122,The National Emergency Medical Service Role During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sierra Leone,2020,"BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) have discordance in severity by mean gradient/peak velocity and aortic valve area. Low gradient aortic stenosis (LG-AS) is defined when the aortic valve area is < 1 cm2 consistent with severe AS and mean aortic gradient is < 40 mmHg consistent with non-severe AS. LG-AS represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the different categories, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of LG-AS. LG-AS is classified as classical (ejection fraction (EF) < 50%, indexed stroke volume (SVi) < 35 ml/m2), paradoxical (EF > 50%, SVi < 35 ml/m2), pseudo-severe (moderate AS with reduced EF), or normal flow low gradient AS. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings emphasize the importance of low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography and CT calcium score in the assessment of aortic valve. In addition, flow reserve (increase in SV > 50%) can be evaluated during dobutamine stress echocardiography and helps predict perioperative prognosis. Patients with LG-AS have better survival with aortic valve replacement (AVR) compared to medical therapy, irrespective of presence or absence of flow reserve. Some recent studies suggest that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be superior to surgical AVR for patients with a lack of contractile flow reserve or those with paradoxical LG-AS, but further investigation is needed to clarify optimal treatment. The role of TAVR in patients with moderate AS and reduced EF is also under investigation.","Anand, Vidhu; Mankad, Sunil V; Eleid, Mackram",Curr Cardiol Rep,,307

To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients. In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission. In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge. Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital). These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management. Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow. We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken. These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers.","Wong, Jolin; Goh, Qing Yuan; Tan, Zihui; Lie, Sui An; Tay, Yoong Chuan; Ng, Shin Yi; Soh, Chai Rick",Can J Anaesth,,307
227706,Infant sleep during COVID-19: longitudinal analysis of infants of US mothers in home confinement vs working as usual,2020,"This essay challenges generalizations since the late enlightenment about the effects of epidemics and pandemics on collective mentalities: that from antiquity to the present, epidemics, regardless of the disease, have sparked distrust, social violence, and the blaming of others. By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe. The essay then explores the variety of charitable reactions and abnegation that cut across social divisions in communities from theatres of war in Europe to nations thousands of miles from the direct military encounters. Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths. I end with a reflection on the unfolding socio-psychological reactions to Covid-19 from the perspective of 1918-20.","Cohn, Samuel Kline",Med Confl Surviv,,307

This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries. An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population &#8805;1 million. Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the final cumulative infection incidence was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.","Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Makhoul, Monia; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",PLoS One,,307

233449,The relationship between sexual function and mental health in Iranian pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"In the unfortunate event of the current ongoing pandemic COVID-19, where vaccination development is still in the trial phase, several preventive control measures such as social distancing, hand-hygiene, and personal protective equipment have been recommended by health professionals and organizations. Among them, the safe wearing of facemasks has played a vital role in reducing the likelihood and severity of infectious respiratory disease transmission. The reported research in facemasks has covered many of their material types, fabrication techniques, mechanism characterization, and application aspects. However, in more recent times, the focus has shifted toward the theoretical investigations of fluid flow mechanisms involved in the virus-laden particles' prevention by using facemasks. This exciting research domain aims to address the complex fluid transport that led to designing a facemask with a better performance. This Review discusses the recent updates on fluid flow dynamics through the facemasks. Key design aspects such as thermal comfort and flow resistance are discussed. Furthermore, the recent progress in the investigations on the efficacy of facemasks for the prevention of COVID-19 spread and the impact of wearing facemasks is presented.","Kumar, Sanjay; Lee, Heow Pueh",Phys Fluids (1994),,307

235611,"A call for strengthened evidence on targeted, non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 for the protection of vulnerable individuals in sub-Saharan Africa",2020,"Background: To contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, public life was reduced through contact restriction measures (referred to as ""lockdown"" in the further course for reading simplicity), among other things to make health system resources available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In parallel, a decrease in emergency patients was observed in the public health system. Methods: For two 10-week periods before and during the lockdown, ambulance service deployment rates were analysed in 6 ambulance service areas for 6 tracer diagnoses. Random effects were minimised by comparing the results with the corresponding 2018 and 2019 time periods and a calculated expected value. Results: For emergency ambulance service calls, there was a reduction in call numbers (-16%) during the lockdown. A 20% reduction for the categories cardiac and cerebral ischaemia was found. In the urban area, the reduction in cardiac ischaemia was less pronounced at 14% than in the surrounding area at 23%. The deployment figures for intoxications decreased by 27% and for psychiatric emergencies by 16%. Conclusion: The public ambulance service was not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic; there was a decrease in depolyments during the lockdown. For the reduction in cerebral or cardiac ischaemias, the explanatory models for the influence of the lockdown are missing. Further studies on the utilisation behaviour of the ambulance service during a lockdown appear necessary in order to detect potentially fatal reductions in utilisation for the patient outcome and to be able to counteract them through education.","Naujoks, Frank; Schweigkofler, Uwe; Lenz, Wolfgang; Blau, Jörg; Brune, Ingo; Lischke, Volker; Adler, Holger; Schindelin, Ina; Rouchi, Hasti; Chobotsky, Holger; Gottschalk, René",Notf Rett Med,,307

Forty nine early-stage critically-ill COVID-19 patients residing in Respiratory Care Units (RCU) of three hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq, were included: 21 received convalescent plasma while 28, namely control group, did not receive it. Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and improvement in the clinical course of the disease were monitored clinically along with laboratory monitoring through SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM serological monitoring. Patients who received convalescent plasma showed reduced duration of infection in about 4 days and showed less death rate [1/21 versus 8/28 in control group]. In addition, all the patients who were given convalescent plasma showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM three days after plasma transfusion. Plasma from donors with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and donors with positive SRAS-CoV-2 IgM showed better therapeutic results than other donors. Convalescent plasma therapy is an effective therapy if donors with high level of SARS-Cov2 antibodies are selected and if recipients are at their early stage of critical illness, being no more than three days in RCUs.","Rasheed, Anwar M; Fatak, Dhurgham F; Hashim, Hashim A; Maulood, Mohammed F; Kabah, Khulood K; Almusawi, Yaqoob A; Abdulamir, Ahmed S",Infez Med,,307

240413,Evaluating the motivation of Red Cross Health volunteers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study protocol,2021,"BACKGROUND: National governments worldwide have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth-the percentage change in total cumulative cases-across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. METHODS: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods-in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation-for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R2 values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with nonpharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions as metrics to predict the national growth of confirmed COVID-19 infections.","Yeung, Arnold Ys; Roewer-Despres, Francois; Rosella, Laura; Rudzicz, Frank",J Med Internet Res,,307

Using COVID-19 patient data from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Healthcare database, we developed and internally validated models using patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) between March-April 2020 (n = 3597) and further validated them using temporally distinct individuals who presented to the ED between May-August 2020 (n = 1711). We show that ensemble-based models perform better than other model types at predicting both 5-day ICU admission and 28-day mortality from COVID-19. CRP, LDH, and O2 saturation were important for ICU admission models whereas eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were the most important variables for predicting mortality. Implementing such models could help in clinical decision-making for future infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19.","Subudhi, Sonu; Verma, Ashish; Patel, Ankit B; Hardin, C Corey; Khandekar, Melin J; Lee, Hang; McEvoy, Dustin; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Munn, Lance L; Dutta, Sayon; Jain, Rakesh K",NPJ Digit Med,,307
241380,Commentary: Time to Improve Access to Psychotherapies - A Family Medicine Perspective,2021,"PURPOSE: To determine if the stress of normal eye movements results in gaze-induced globe deformations, vitreous chamber axial length and vitreous chamber axial volume (VCAV) change in highly myopic eyes. METHODS: A prospective imaging study was performed on 82 eyes of 43 patients with high myopia (>27 mm of axial length) with a clinical diagnosis of staphyloma. Three-dimensional MRI scans were acquired while subjects gazed in five directions (primary, nasal, temporal, superior and inferior). Surface renderings were generated, and a processing pipeline was created to automate alignment of the eye and to measure VCAV within 5.5 mm of the visual axis for each eye in every gaze. The degree of gaze-induced globe deformation was determined by calculating the Dice coefficient to assess the degree of overlap of the sclera at each eccentric gaze with that found in primary gaze. Each eccentric gaze VCAV was compared to VCAV in primary gaze using a fixed-effects regression allowing for subject-specific and eye-specific effects. RESULTS: The Dice coefficient showed significant gaze-induced eye shape changes in all gazes (all p<0.0001). There were no statistically significant gaze-induced VCAV changes when comparing primary gaze to nasal, temporal or upgaze. However, when changing from primary to downgaze, VCAV was increased by +4.79 mm3 (p=0.002, 95% CI 1.71 to 7.86). CONCLUSION: Significant gaze-induced globe deformation was noted in all gazes, but a reversible, instantaneous VCAV increase occurred only in downgaze, which is consistent with studies supporting the association of environmental factors such as near work with myopia development and progression.","Hoang, Quan V; Chang, Stanley; Yu, Daryle Jason Go; Yannuzzi, Lawrence A; Freund, K Bailey; Grinband, Jack",Br. j. ophthalmol,,307

242329,Evaluation of perceived fears of COVID-19 virus infection and its relationship to health-related quality of life among patients with diabetes mellitus in Egypt during pandemic: a developing country single-center study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and dystonia is associated with the possibility of both minor and major complications. One possible side effect is the depletion of implantable pulse generator (IPG) battery and the associated sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms, which can be potentially life-threatening. Delayed or postponed outpatient visits due to COVID -19 may be a risk factor of battery end-of-life consequences. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical outcomes in reported PD and dystonia patients treated with DBS, who, as a result of the sudden depletion of the neurostimulator battery, developed life-threatening symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched using pre-established criteria. RESULTS: A total of 244 articles was found, of which 12 met the adopted criteria. Selected papers presented a total of 17 case reports of DBS-treated patients - 11 with PD, and six with dystonia - who had depleted IPG batteries and due to rapid worsening of PD/dystonia symptoms required urgent hospital admission. IPG battery replacement was the only effective treatment in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: IPG battery depletion can result in fatal outcomes. Sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms in patients treated by DBS can be potentially life-threatening, so scheduling the replacement of a discharged IPG battery should not be postponed. The COVID-19 pandemic should alert staff at emergency, neurology and movement disorders wards not to postpone the visits of patients with an implanted DBS system.","Przytula, Filip; Dulski, Jaroslaw; Sobstyl, Michal; Slawek, Jaroslaw",Neurol. neurochir. pol,,307

243491,Convicted drinking and driving offenders: Comparing alcohol use before and after the pandemic outbreak,2021,"In-vehicle crowding on public transportation is a serious problem that transportation planners must address. Recent studies have emphasized that in-vehicle crowding impacts travelers' stress and health, while other studies have investigated how daily travel affects subjective well-being (SWB). Based on the findings of these studies, we provide useful insights into the value of a reduction in crowding in terms of SWB. The other factor we should consider is adaptation, as the effects of travel discomfort disappear after travelers become accustomed to them. In this paper, we analyzed the direct and stress-related indirect effects of dissatisfaction with in-vehicle crowding on life satisfaction, focusing on whether these effects differ by the length of time commuters have been using trains. Using a sample of 8296 train commuters in Tokyo, we found that (1) dissatisfaction with in-vehicle crowding directly lowers life satisfaction among some groups of short-term train commuters and (2) dissatisfaction with in-vehicle crowding indirectly lowers life satisfaction through stress and health, regardless of whether commuters have used trains for more or less than one year. These results revealed the importance of focusing on the stress-related indirect effects of dissatisfaction with crowding, while direct effects on SWB exist only among some commuters. Our results demonstrated the possibility of adaptation to direct effects.","Kumagai, Junya; Wakamatsu, Mihoko; Managi, Shunsuke",Transportation (Amst),,307

To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co-infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS-CoV-2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co-infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19. Also, the antibiotic-resistant as a result of overusing must be considered.

The increasing rate of coronavirus infection in a developing country such as Bangladesh caused the highest death rate of doctors among frontline service providers and resulted in fear and anxiety among healthcare workers. Even with the preliminary measures of hospitals and clinics to protect healthcare workers, the growing casualties are alarming. This research uses case study approach to explore the issues doctors and nurses face in 'priority intervention areas' (PIA) in order to improve the health system quality. Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted from 12 May to 4 June 2020 among doctors and nurses from two different private hospitals in Dhaka city. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. The two significant areas that required immediate attention were identified from the PIA framework as 'patient and staff safety, infection control' and 'cultural aspects and community engagement'. Each area of the PIA framework showed previously ignored issues in the current health system. The adaptation of the PIA framework helped identify critical health system issues.

249867,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Care Workers During the Pandemic Surge in New York City,2021,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are emerging contaminants that are increasingly detected in the environment worldwide. Certain classes of pharmaceuticals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are a major environmental concern due to their widespread use and the fact that these compounds are designed to have biological effects at low doses. A complication in predicting toxic effects of SSRIs in nontarget organisms is that their mechanism of action is not fully understood. To better understand the potential toxic effects of SSRIs, we employed an ultra-low input RNA-sequencing method to identify potential pathways that are affected by early exposure to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine). We exposed wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 100 µg/L of either fluoxetine or paroxetine for 6 days before extracting and sequencing mRNA from individual larval brains. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1550 genes that were significantly affected by SSRI exposure with a core set of 138 genes altered by both SSRIs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 7 modules of genes whose expression patterns were significantly correlated with SSRI exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes as well as network module genes repeatedly identified various terms associated with mitochondrial and neuronal structures, mitochondrial respiration, and neurodevelopmental processes. The enrichment of these terms indicates that toxic effects of SSRI exposure are likely caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to study the tissue-specific transcriptomic effects of SSRIs in developing zebrafish, providing specific, high resolution molecular data regarding the sublethal effects of SSRI exposure.","Huang, Irvin J; Dheilly, Nolwenn M; Sirotkin, Howard I; McElroy, Anne E",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,307

In this paper, we describe an approach leveraging the phenomenal progress in Machine Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to design a model that is low-resource, multilingual, and a preliminary first-point-of-contact medical assistant. Our contribution includes defining the NLP pipeline required for named-entity-recognition, language-agnostic sentence embedding, natural language translation, information retrieval, question answering, and generative pre-training for final query processing. We obtain promising results for this pipeline and preliminary results for EHR (Electronic Health Record) analysis with text summarization for medical practitioners to peruse for their diagnosis. Through this NLP pipeline, we aim to provide preliminary medical information to the user and do not claim to supplant diagnosis from qualified medical practitioners. Using the input from subject matter experts, we have compiled a large corpus to pre-train and fine-tune our BioBERT based NLP model for the specific tasks. We expect recent advances in NLP architectures, several of which are efficient and privacy-preserving models, to further the impact of our solution and improve on individual task performance.","Vinod, Vishal; Agrawal, Susmit; Gaurav, Vipul; Pallavi, R; Choudhary, Savita",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01251v1.pdf,307
254009,Immune cell puzzle COVID-19: how do SARS-CoV infections contribute to psychiatric diseases?,2020,"Background: Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the pathophysiology underlying this increased morbidity and its potential effect on the developing fetus is not well understood. Methods: We assessed placental histology, ACE2 expression, and viral and immune dynamics at the term placenta in pregnant women with and without respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Findings: The majority (13 of 15) of placentas analyzed had no detectable viral RNA. ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term, suggesting that low ACE2 expression may protect the term placenta from viral infection. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we found that cytotrophoblasts, the trophoblast stem cells and precursors to syncytiotrophoblasts, rather than syncytiotrophoblasts or Hofbauer cells, are most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. To better understand potential immune mechanisms shielding placental cells from infection in vivo, we performed bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses and found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited robust immune responses, including increased activation of natural killer (NK) and T cells, increased expression of interferon-related genes, as well as markers associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in late pregnancy is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of detectable local viral invasion.

In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of the epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we analysed clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, assembled from 112 high-quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) dataset, showed a stable evolution and suggested that there were two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon hospital admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age and lymphocytopenia (and its associated cytokine storm), whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect outcomes.","Zhang, Xiaonan; Tan, Yun; Ling, Yun; Lu, Gang; Liu, Feng; Yi, Zhigang; Jia, Xiaofang; Wu, Min; Shi, Bisheng; Xu, Shuibao; Chen, Jun; Wang, Wei; Chen, Bing; Jiang, Lu; Yu, Shuting; Lu, Jing; Wang, Jinzeng; Xu, Mingzhu; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Qin; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhao, Guoping; Wang, Shengyue; Chen, Saijuan; Lu, Hongzhou",Nature,,307

The viral main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro), known to control coronavirus replication and essential for viral life cycle, has been established as an essential drug discovery target for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employed computationally screening of Druglib database containing FDA approved drugs against active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using MTiopen screen web server, yields a total of 1051 FDA approved drugs with docking energy >-7 kcal/mol. The top 10 screened potential compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were then studied by re-docking, binding affinity, intermolecular interaction, and complex stability via 100 ns all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation followed by post-simulation analysis, including end point binding free energy, essential dynamics, and residual correlation analysis against native crystal structure ligand N3 inhibitor. Based on comparative molecular simulation and interaction profiling of the screened drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro revealed R428 (-10.5 kcal/mol), Teniposide (-9.8 kcal/mol), VS-5584 (-9.4 kcal/mol), and Setileuton (-8.5 kcal/mol) with stronger stability and affinity than other drugs and N3 inhibitor; and hence, these drugs are advocated for further validation using in vitro enzyme inhibition and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We introduce a reparametrized version of the popular spatio-temporal interaction models, based on Kronecker product intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Fields, that we name variance partitioning (VP) model. The VP model includes a mixing parameter that balances the contribution of the main and interaction effects to the total (generalized) variance and enhances interpretability. The use of a penalized complexity prior on the mixing parameter aids in coding any prior information in a intuitive way. We illustrate the advantages of the VP model on two case studies.","Franco-Villoria, M.; Ventrucci, M.; Rue, H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13374v1.pdf,307

Some staff of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna (BDTH) were infected with COVID-19 during the initial period of the pandemic. Most of the infected staff were from the General Out-Patient Clinic (GOPC), as it was the only Department with up to 11 staff infected during this initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This had led to the temporary closure of the Department. The aim of this paper is to characterize the GOPC Staff that tested positive to COVID-19 following previous contact with COVID-19 patients that were seen at the GOPC during the first wave of the pandemic. This is with the view to consider GOPC staff as high risk and frontline health workers for COVID 19. It was a retrospective study, and data were collected from the record of all the staff of the GOPC who were traced to have had contact with the COVID-19 positive patients and were also tested positive. Eleven (34%) out of the 32 staff were infected with COVID-19 at the GOPC. Only 1 staff was above 50 years. Most of them had mild symptoms and had side effects from the antiviral drugs.

METHODS: Data of 50 COVID-19 patients were collected in two hospitals. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and chest CT imaging features were analyzed, and a stratification analysis was performed according to gender and age [younger group: <50 years old, elderly group &#8805;50 years old]. RESULTS: Most patients had a history of epidemic exposure within 2 weeks (96%). The main clinical complaints are fever (54%) and cough (46%). In chest CT images, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is the most common feature (37/38, 97%) in abnormal CT findings, with the remaining 12 patients (12/50, 24%) presenting normal CT images. Other concomitant abnormalities include dilatation of vessels in lesion (76%), interlobular thickening (47%), adjacent pleural thickening (37%), focal consolidation (26%), nodules (16%) and honeycomb pattern (13%). The lesions were distributed in the periphery (50%) or mixed (50%). Subgroup analysis showed that there was no difference in the gender distribution of all the clinical and imaging features. Laboratory findings, interlobular thickening, honeycomb pattern and nodules demonstrated remarkable difference between younger group and elderly group. The average CT score for pulmonary involvement degree was 5.0±4.7. Correlation analysis revealed that CT score was significantly correlated with age, body temperature and days from illness onset (pâ<â0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has various clinical and imaging appearances. However, it has certain characteristics that can be stratified. CT plays an important role in disease diagnosis and early intervention.","Gu, Qianbiao; Ouyang, Xin; Xie, An; Tan, Xianzheng; Liu, Jianbin; Huang, Feng; Liu, Peng",J Xray Sci Technol,,307

The intra-individual reliability and interindividual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR were assessed in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS to evaluate the stability of the qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours. We report that the use of PBS as a transport medium allows high intra-individual and interindividual reliability, maintains viral stability, and compares with VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage. This study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2.

We must first ensure the safety of our patients and surgical staff. It must be a priority to monitor the availability of supplies for the continued care of patients suffering from COVID-19. As we resume elective orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty, we must begin to reduce expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts, use ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments in a safe and effective manner, adhere to strict evidence-based and COVID-19-adjusted practices, and incorporate telemedicine and other technology platforms when feasible for health care systems and orthopedic groups to survive economically. RESULTS: The return to normalcy will be slow and may be different than what we are accustomed to, but we must work together to plan a transition to a more sustainable health care reality which accommodates a COVID-19 world. CONCLUSION: Our goal should be using these lessons to achieve a healthy and successful 2021 fiscal year.","O039,; Connor, Casey M; Anoushiravani, Afshin A; DiCaprio, Matthew R; Healy, William L; Iorio, Richard",J Arthroplasty,,307

279740,Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic,2020,"Abstract Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the main risk factors associated with the progression to severe disease or death have been typically advanced age, diabetes mellitus, obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and chronic pneumopathy. Because of their immunosuppression status, persons with HIV were also expected to have a higher susceptibility to infection or a poor clinical evolution. So far, this has not been confirmed to happen, giving way to hypotheses about the role of immunosuppression or the use of antiretrovirals, which could explain this paradox. In this article we present the existing data on the epidemiology and characteristics of HIV-COVID-19 co-infection, discuss the available evidence on the possible factors involved in the evolution of individuals affected by both viruses, analyze other determinants that may negatively affect persons with HIV during the pandemic, and present recommendations for the prevention and care of COVID-19 infection in the context of HIV.","Posada-Vergara, María Paulina; Alzate-Ángel, Juan Carlos; Martínez-Buitrago, Ernesto",Colomb. med,,307

METHODS: A retrospective review of outcomes among women diagnosed with VaIN after vaginal punch biopsy conducted due to an abnormal Papanicolaou smear or positive test for hrHPV at a hospital in Seoul, Korea, from 2013 to 2018. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with abnormal pathologic outcomes. RESULTS: Among 389 women included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with high-grade VaIN, including VaIN stage 2 (n = 37), VaIN stage 3 (n = 16), carcinoma in situ of the vagina (n = 3), and squamous carcinoma of the vagina (n = 2). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk of high-grade VaIN and cancer was higher among women with abnormal cytology (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.47), any hrHPV infection (OR, 8.75; 95% CI, 1.14-67.31), HPV16 infection (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 2.57-12.68), or HPV31 infection (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.45-13.11). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that infection with hrHPV, especially HPV16 and HPV31, is significantly associated with high-grade VaIN. Regarding treatment modalities, ablative or excisional treatments showed good efficacy against pathologic regression of high-grade VaIN.","Cho, Hyun-Woong; Hong, Jin-Hwa; Lee, Jae Kwan",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,307

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to understand how people living with MS in the United States experienced distress and perceived their COVID-19-related risk during the first surge of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a web-based, self-report survey of people with MS who were living in the United States during the early stage of COVID-19. Primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and positive-affect and well-being. Participants (N = 491) also provided data on demographics, MS-related factors, COVID-19 factors, and psychological coping. RESULTS: Psychological distress was associated with age, psychological coping strategies, and having had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but not with MS disease-related variables and COVID-19 risk factors. Perception of COVID-19-related risk was associated with age, MS disease severity, COVID-19-related factors, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that even during COVID-19, distress and risk perception are primarily driven by psychological factors, experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and age, with minimal contribution from individual differences in health status, providing an impetus for continued efforts to optimize psychological interventions for people living with MS.","Alschuler, Kevin N; Roberts, Michelle K; Herring, Tracy E; Ehde, Dawn M",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,307

Our rationale for targeting RNA viral infections by pro-oxidants is routed on the mechanistic hypothesis that ROS based treatment paradigm could impair RNA integrity faster than the other macromolecules. Though antiviral drugs with antioxidant properties confer potential abilities for preventing viral entry, those with pro-oxidant properties could induce the degradation of nascent viral RNA within the host cells, as RNAs are highly prone to ROS mediated degradation than DNA/proteins. We have previously established that Plumbagin is a highly potent ROS inducer, which acts through shifting of the host redox potential. Besides, it has been reported that Plumbagin treatment has the potential for interrupting viral RNA replication within the host cells. Since the on-going Corona Virus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic mediated by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits high infectivity, the development of appropriate antiviral therapeutic strategies remains to be an urgent unmet race against time. Therefore, additional experimental validation is warranted to determine the appropriateness of repurposable drug candidates, possibly ROS inducers, for fighting the pandemic which could lead to saving many lives from being lost to COVID-19.","Nadhan, Revathy; Patra, Dipyaman; Krishnan, Neethu; Rajan, Arathi; Gopala, Srinivas; Ravi, Dashnamoorthy; Srinivas, Priya",Eur J Pharmacol,,307

Our study addresses whether lack of communication affects the psychological status of medical team members supporting Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. We used general symptom index (GSI) scores of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) to evaluate participants' psychological status. We adopted a stratified sampling method and selected the fourth team, with a total of 137 members, as participants. In total 76.6% and 69.7% of female and male participants, respectively, had bachelor's degrees; 41.6% and 21.2% of female and male participants, respectively, were unmarried. Regarding communication, 14.29% and 6.06% of female and male participants, respectively, reported a lack of communication with the team (LCWT). Additionally, 13.0% and 6.1% of female and male participants, respectively, experienced fear of being infected (FoBI). LCWT and FoBI were positively correlated with GSI score (estimated change = 0.2, 95% CI [0.1-0.3]). When adjusted for gender, age, and FoBI, LCWT was positively correlated with GSI score (P < .05).

The aim of our study is to evaluate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions with speckle tracking echocardiography in preeclamptic patients. Fifty-five preeclamptic (mean age: 30.7 ± 5.9 years) and 35 healthy pregnant women (mean age: 28.8 ± 5.7 years) of the same race, similar age and gestational week were consecutively included. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was based on the criteria proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. LV and RV functions were assessed by both conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography after the 30th gestational week and at the postpartum 6th months. The preeclamptic patients had significantly larger left atrium, thicker interventricular septum, higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure and mitral E/e' ratio compared to controls during pregnancy while LV ejection fraction was similar. Preeclamptic patients had significantly lower LV and RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) during pregnancy compared to controls (- 18.0 ± 2.6% vs. - 19.8 ± 2.1% p = 0.001 and - 26.7 ± 3.3% vs. 28.9 ± 3.3% p = 0.002, respectively). In the postpartum period, while LVGLS values of preeclamptic patients increased significantly (- 18.0 ± 2.6% vs. - 20.4 ± 2.4% p < 0.001) and became similar to those of controls at the sixth month, the RVGLS decreased significantly (- 26.7 ± 3.3% vs. - 25.8 ± 2.7% p = 0.003) making the difference in RVGLS between the preeclamptic patients and controls more prominent. Preeclampsia may impair LV and RV function. Long-term follow up with larger sample is needed to determine the clinical relevance of the observed changes in strain.","Paudel, Ashok; Tigen, Kursat; Yoldemir, Tevfik; Guclu, Mehmet; Yildiz, Ipek; Cincin, Altug; Sunbul, Murat; Gurel, Emre; Sayar, Nurten; Ozben, Beste",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,,307

COVID-19 pneumonia PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the purpose of identifying clinical manifestations and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, we reviewed all cases of COVID-19 pneumonia which were published by the homepage of the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases from Feb 5 2020 until April 30 2020, including our cases. All patients were diagnosed based on positive results of the novel coronavirus-real-time RT-PCR with chest computed tomography (CT) findings. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 66 years (range 16-92 years). For all, 50 (54%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hypertension in 32 (36%). Any comorbidity was seen in 60 (67%). The mortality rate was 4 (6%). In terms of clinical symptoms on an initial visit, fever and cough were confirmed in 66 (72%) and 37 (40%). Forty-three (47%) had no respiratory symptoms. As for radiological findings by chest CT scan, ground-glass opacities (GGO)s, peripheral distribution, bilateral lung involvements were seen in 88 (96%), 76 (83%) and 78 (85%), respectively. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 pneumonia due to poor respiratory symptoms. Chest CT findings typically show GGO, peripheral and bilateral shadows. Patients should have chest CT performed if suspected for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, resulting in a favorable outcome and prevention of secondary nosocomial transmitted infection.","Asai, Nobuhiro; Sakanashi, Daisuke; Nakamura, Akiko; Kishino, Takaaki; Kato, Hideo; Hagihara, Mao; Shiota, Arufumi; Koizumi, Yusuke; Yamagishi, Yuka; Mikamo, Hiroshige",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,307

During the five days of Hajj, a total of 185 pilgrims were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of 126/185 patients (68.11%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses by PCR. Among the 126 pilgrims whose NPS were PCR positive: (a) there were 93/126 (74%) with a single virus infection, (b) 33/126 (26%) with coinfection with more than one virus (up to four viruses): of these, 25/33 cases had coinfection with two viruses; 6/33 were infected with three viruses, while the remaining 2/33 patients had infection with four viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common detected viruses with 53 cases (42.06%), followed by 27 (21.43%) cases of influenza A (H1N1), and 23 (18.25%) cases of influenza A other than H1N1. Twenty-five cases of CoV-229E (19.84%) were detected more than other coronavirus members (5 CoV-OC43 (3.97%), 4 CoV-HKU1 (3.17%), and 1 CoV-NL63 (0.79%)). PIV-3 was detected in 8 cases (6.35%). A single case (0.79%) of PIV-1 and PIV-4 were found. HMPV represented 5 (3.97%), RSV and influenza B 4 (3.17%) for each, and Parechovirus 1 (0.79%). Enterovirus, Bocavirus, and M. pneumoniae were not detected. Whether identification of viral nucleic acid represents nasopharyngeal carriage or specific causal etiology of RTI remains to be defined. Large controlled cohort studies (pre-Hajj, during Hajj, and post-Hajj) are required to define the carriage rates and the specific etiology and causal roles of specific individual viruses or combination of viruses in the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections in pilgrims participating in the annual Hajj.

METHODS: In total, 210 positive-test and 630 negative-test healthcare workers in the Central Denmark Region were followed for up to 90 days after testing, between April and June, 2020. Their daily reported COVID-19-related symptoms were compared graphically and by logistic regression. RESULTS: Thirty per cent of the positive-test and close to 0% of the negative-test participants reported a reduced sense of taste and smell during all 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 86.07, 95% CI 22.86-323).

Cough, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, and fever were temporarily more prevalent among the positive-test participants; after 30 days, no increases were seen. Women and older participants were more susceptible to long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of long-lasting reduced sense of taste and smell is highly increased in mild COVID-19 patients.

This allowed the first evaluation of state-of-the-art local hybrids with ""calibrated"" exchange-energy densities for nuclear shieldings. Compared to previously evaluated simpler local hybrids without a CF, appreciable improvements are found for proton shieldings. Furthermore, the recent LH20t functional is still competitive with the outstanding performance of the uncalibrated LH12ct-SsirSVWN and LH12ct-SsifSVWN LHs for heavier nuclei, suggesting that LH20t is possibly the most robust choice of any rung-four functional for computing the nuclear shieldings of main-group nuclei so far. Interestingly, the presence of a CF in the functional significantly reduces the number of artifacts introduced by the widely used Maximoff-Scuseria framework to treat the local kinetic energy &#964;. The latter occurs in so-called t-LMFs used in many of the present local hybrids.

Rapid government changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic are resulting in significant and sustained hardship on this already vulnerable group. This discursive paper is both an explainer and a resource for mental health nurses and health professionals with scope of practice in primary care and emergency departments responding to this population. The aim of this paper is to alert clinicians to the drivers of mental and suicide related distress and to provide recommendations as to how to therapeutically engage and support this group. Drivers include complex intersections between legal uncertainty, economic, social and mental health stress as drivers of entrapment, acute mental distress and suicidal ideation. Information about the COVID-19 related factors as drivers contributing to worsening states of distress may help guide clinicians to consider protective factors designed to mitigate the onset or worsening of mental distress, plus aid in the development of health policy and service-delivery arrangements of support and therapeutic engagement.","Kenny, Mary Anne Grech Carol Procter Nicholas",International Journal of Mental Health Nursing,,307

299329,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the core functions of primary care: will the cure be worse than the disease? A qualitative interview study in Flemish GPs,2020,"Introduction: Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy has forced the health care system to undergo profound rearrangements in its services and facilities, especially in the worst-hit areas in Northern Italy. In this setting, inpatient and outpatient services had to rethink and reorganize their activities to meet the needs of patients during the ""lockdown"". The Italian Association of Myology developed a survey to estimate the impact of these changes on patients affected by neuromuscular disorders and on specialized neuromuscular centers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed an electronic survey that was sent to neuromuscular centers affiliated with the Italian Association of Myology, assessing changes in pharmacological therapies provision, outpatient clinical and instrumental services, support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) and clinical trials. Results: 40% of surveyed neuromuscular centers reported a reduction in outpatient visit and examinations (44.5% of centers in Northern regions; 25% of centers in Central regions; 50% of centers in Southern regions). Twenty-two% of centers postponed in-hospital administration of therapies for neuromuscular diseases (23.4% in Northern regions; 13.0% in Central regions; 20% in Southern regions). Diagnostic and support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) were suspended in 57% of centers (66/43/44% in Northern, Central and Southern centers respectively) Overall, the most affected services were rehabilitative services and on-site outpatient visits, which were suspended in 93% of centers. Strategies adopted by neuromuscular centers to overcome these changes included maintaining urgent on-site visits, addressing patients to available services and promoting remote contact and telemedicine. Conclusions: Overall, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant disruption of clinical and support services for patients with neuromuscular diseases. Despite the efforts to provide telemedicine consults to patients, this option could be promoted and improved further. A close collaboration between the different neuromuscular centers and service providers as well as further implementation of telehealth platforms are necessary to ensure quality care to NMD patients in the near future and in case of recurrent pandemic waves.","Mauri, Eleonora; Abati, Elena; Musumeci, Olimpia; Rodolico, Carmelo; D039,; Angelo, Maria Grazia; Mirabella, Massimiliano; Lucchini, Matteo; Bello, Luca; Pegoraro, Elena; Maggi, Lorenzo; Manneschi, Letizia; Gemelli, Chiara; Grandis, Marina; Zuppa, Angela; Massucco, Sara; Benedetti, Luana; Caponnetto, Claudia; Schenone, Angelo; Prelle, Alessandro; Previtali, Stefano C; Scarlato, Marina; Amico, Adele; Bertini, Enrico; Pennisi, Elena M; De Giglio, Laura; Pane, Marika; Mercuri, Eugenio; Mongini, Tiziana; Ricci, Federica; Berardinelli, Angela; Astrea, Guja; Lenzi, Sara; Battini, Roberta; Ricci, Giulia; Torri, Francesca; Siciliano, Gabriele; Santorelli, Filippo M; Ariatti, Alessandra; Filosto, Massimiliano; Passamano, Luigia; Politano, Luisa; Scutifero, Marianna; Tonin, Paola; Fossati, Barbara; Panicucci, Chiara; Bruno, Claudio; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Monforte, Mauro; Tasca, Giorgio; Ricci, Enzo",Acta Myol,,307

Combatting the stigmatization surrounding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic",2021,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease have had an unprecedented spread and continue to cause an increasing number of fatalities worldwide. While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that""on-off""policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at""flattening""the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.","Tsay, Calvin; Lejarza, Fernando; Stadtherr, Mark A.; Baldea, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06291v2.pdf,307

Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases of Cryptosporidium are probably involved in the regulation of invasion and egress process during the infection of the host cells. The previous study reported that after the Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 1 gene, Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 6 of Cryptosporidium parvum is expressed in all stages of the parasite (merozoites/schizonts as well as sexual stages) at a comparable level and makes it as a valid drug target. In this study, an attempt is made to address the similarity in sequences and phylogenetic study of Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 6 (CDPK6) among Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases of Apicomplexans. Further, the three-dimensional structure determination of CDPK6 of C. parvum was performed through a molecular modeling approach followed by virtual screening of small-molecule inhibitors from different datasets. The best inhibitor from Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set with ID 11730 reported a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol against CDPK6 of C. parvum. Furthermore, the reliability of the binding mode of the inhibitor is validated through a complex molecular dynamics simulation study for a time interval of 100 ns. The simulation study advocates that the inhibitor Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set_11730 formed a stable interaction with the predicted active site residues and can be considered for industrial pharmaceutical research in future.

This allowed us to infer the presence or absence of super-spreading events during the early phase of these outbreaks. The relatively large values of k implied that large cluster sizes, compatible with super-spreading, were unlikely.","Kwok, K O; Chan, H H H; Huang, Y; Hui, D S C; Tambyah, P A; Wei, W I; Chau, P Y K; Wong, S Y S; Tang, J W T",J Hosp Infect,,307

However, the tone and content of communication varies across and within countries and led to conflicting results in terms of collective sensemaking. To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less. Furthermore, these effects were particularly experienced by women and left-leaning participants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the leader's communication strategies on influencing the public's emotional reactions, as well as the perceptions of government effectiveness in dealing with the crisis.","Sobral, Filipe; Carvalho, Juliana; amp,; 321,; agowska, Urszula; Furtado, Liliane Magalhães Girardin Pimentel; Grobman, Miriam",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,307

Today it is relatively easy to isolate Covid-19 symptomatic cases, while remains problematic to control the disease spread by infected but symptom-free individuals. The control of this possible path of contagion requires drastic measures of social distancing, which imply the suspension of most activities and generate economic and social issues. This study is aimed at estimating the percentage of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a geographic area with relatively low incidence of Covid-19. METHODS: Blood serum samples from 388 healthy volunteers were analyzed for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by using an ELISA assay based on recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS: We found that 7 out of 388 healthy volunteers, who declared no symptoms of Covid-19, like fever, cough, fatigue etc., in the preceding 5 months, have bona fide serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, that is 1.8% of the asymptomatic population (95% confidence interval: 0.69-2.91%). CONCLUSIONS: The estimated range of asymptomatic individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG should be between 26,565 and 112, 350.

308254,Protecting our healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus is a large virus family consisting of diverse viruses, some of which disseminate among mammals and others cause sickness among humans. COVID-19 is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading, rendering its early diagnosis of preeminent status. Researchers, medical specialists and organizations all over the globe have been working tirelessly to combat this virus and help in its containment. In this paper, a novel neural network called WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. The WisdomNet uses the concept of 'Wisdom of Crowds' as its founding idea. It is a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients. The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia.","Kumar, Peeyush; Gangal, Ayushe; Kumari, Sunita",J.

310958,Weather Parameters and COVID-19: A Correlational Analysis,2020,"Herein, we discuss the potential role of folic acid-based radiopharmaceuticals for macrophage imaging to support clinical decision-making in patients with COVID-19. Activated macrophages play an important role during coronavirus infections. Exuberant host responses, i.e., a cytokine storm with increase of macrophage-related cytokines, such as TNF&#945;, IL-1ß, and IL-6 can lead to life-threatening complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in approximately 20% of the patients. Diverse immune modulating therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study in experimental interstitial lung disease, we showed the potential of 18F-AzaFol, an 18F-labeled folic acid-based radiotracer, as a specific novel imaging tool for the visualization and monitoring of macrophage-driven lung diseases. 18F-AzaFol binds to the folate receptor-beta (FRß) that is expressed on activated macrophages involved in inflammatory conditions. In a recent multicenter cancer trial, 18F-AzaFol was successfully and safely applied (NCT03242993). It is supposed that the visualization of activated macrophage-related disease processes by folate radiotracer-based nuclear imaging can support clinical decision-making by identifying COVID-19 patients at risk of a severe disease progression with a potentially lethal outcome.","Müller, Cristina; Schibli, Roger; Maurer, Britta",,,307

311396,Transmission of infection from non-isolated patients with COVID-19 to health care workers,2020,"The impacts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on cancer care are multiple, entailing a high risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with cancer treated by chemotherapy. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines represent an opportunity to decrease the rate of severe COVID-19 cases in patients with cancer and also to restore normal cancer care. Patients with cancer to be targeted for vaccination are difficult to define owing to the limited contribution of these patients in the phase III trials testing the different vaccines. It seems appropriate to vaccinate not only patients with cancer with ongoing treatment or with a treatment having been completed less than 3 years ago but also household and close contacts. High-risk patients with cancer who are candidates for priority access to vaccination are those treated by chemotherapy. The very high-priority population includes patients with curative treatment and palliative first- or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring surgery or radiotherapy involving a large volume of lung, lymph node and/or haematopoietic tissue. When possible, vaccination should be carried out before cancer treatment begins. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be performed during chemotherapy while avoiding periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. For organisational reasons, vaccination should be performed in cancer care centres with messenger RNA vaccines (or non-replicating adenoviral vaccines in non-immunocompromised patients). Considering the current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly favours SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of all patients with cancer. To obtain more data concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to implement cohorts of vaccinated patients with cancer.","Tougeron, David; Hentzien, Maxime; Seitz-Polski, Barbara; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Bourhis, Jean; Ducreux, Michel; Gaujoux, Sébastien; Gorphe, Philippe; Guiu, Boris; Hoang-Xuan, Khê; Huguet, Florence; Lecomte, Thierry; Lièvre, Astrid; Louvet, Christophe; Maggiori, Léon; Mansi, Laura; Mariani, Pascale; Michel, Pierre; Servettaz, Amélie; Thariat, Juliette; Westeel, Virgine; Aparicio, Thomas; Blay, Jean-Yves; Bouché, Olivier",Eur J Cancer,,307
311423,Balancing Protection from COVID-19 and the Need for Human Touch in Nursing Homes,2020,"BACKGROUND: A sharp rise in COVID-19 infections threatened to lead to a local overload of intensive care units in autumn 2020. To prevent this scenario a nationwide relocation concept was developed. METHODS: For the development of the concept publicly available infection rates of the leading infection authority in Germany were used. Within this concept six medical care regions (clusters) were designed around a center of maximum intensive care (ECMO option) based on the number of intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants. The concept describes the management structure including a structural chart, the individual tasks, the organization and the cluster assignment of the clinics. The transfers of intensive care patients within and between the clusters were recorded from 11 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. RESULT: In Germany and Baden-Württemberg, 1.5% of patients newly infected with SARS-CoV­2 required intensive care treatment in mid-December 2020. With a 7-day incidence of 192 new infections in Germany, the hospitalization rate was 10% and 28-35% of the intensive care beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. Only 16.8% of the intensive care beds were still available, in contrast to 35% in June 2020. The developed relocation concept has been in use in Baden-Württemberg starting from 10 December 2020. From then until 7 February 2021, a median of 24â¯± 5/54 intensive care patients were transferred within the individual clusters, in total 154 intensive care patients. Between the clusters, a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 (median 12.5) patients were transferred, 21 intensive care patients were transferred to other federal states and 21 intensive care patients were admitted from these states. The total number of intensive care patients transferred was 261. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections with SARS-CoV­2 increases, a nationwide relocation concept for COVID-19 intensive care patients and non-COVID-19 intensive care patients should be installed at an early stage in order not to overwhelm the capacities of hospitals. Supply regions around a leading clinic with maximum intensive care options are to be defined with a central management that organizes the necessary relocations in cooperation with regional and superregional rescue service control centers. With this concept and the intensive care transports carried out, it was possible to effectively prevent the overload of individual clinics with COVID-19 patients in Baden-Württemberg. Due to that an almost unchanged number of patients requiring regular intensive care could be treated.","Pfenninger, Ernst G; Naser, J; Träger, K; Dennler, U; Jungwirth, B; Schindler, S; Henn-Beilharz, A; Geldner, G; Bürkle, H",Anaesthesist,,307

This included codes for loss of multimodal engagement and social elements with virtual pivoting Lastly, anatomists shared reflections on how the pandemic highlighted the importance of anatomy outreach, and the increased ?duty? felt for anatomists to generate scientific and anatomical literacy Conclusion Most anatomy outreach halted as a result of COVID-19, and anatomists are divided on the possibilities of virtual pivoting, or their ability to sustain outreach work in the current climate Yet, ?outreachers? believe the general public of the world could arguably benefit from better anatomical literacy now more than ever Significance If anatomists are to continue to support outreach goals, there needs to be more generalizable, evidence-based understanding of such activities In the midst of a pandemic, it is especially important to understand facilitator views and how such outreach work can be sustained in a post-COVID world, with likely fewer resources and more social distancing","Dueñas, Angelique Tiffin Paul Finn Gabrielle",The FASEB Journal,,307

314900,Editorial: A COVID-19 Support Platform for Long Term Care Facilities,2020,"The disruption of 'normal' academic studies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was embodied mainly in a rapid transition from in-class teaching to online synchronous instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine the lecturer's emotions towards the change they experienced with the sudden shift to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of those emotions on their willingness to teach online in the future. In the present study, 239 academic lecturers answered an online questionnaire. Four groups of emotions were examined: Success, opportunity, failure, and threat. The findings indicated that the emotions lecturers experienced most strongly was that of success, followed by opportunity. The predictors of lecturer's willingness to teach online in the future were emotions related to 'opportunity' and 'failure'. Surprisingly, the dramatic event of COVID-19 lockdown evoked more positive than negative emotions among lecturers during the first semester of the crisis. The emotions of threat that might characterize this period did not affect the willingness to teach online in the future as may be expected. This study demonstrates how tracing the emotional response toward adopting technology may contribute to understanding technology acceptance. It also contributes to understanding the differences in experiencing change in the normal process of technology adoption as opposed to emergency times.","Meishar-Tal, Hagit; Levenberg, Ariella",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,307

Numerous case reports and retrospective cohort studies have been published with mixed characteristics of COVID-19 patients with stroke regarding age, comorbidities, treatment, and outcome. We aimed to depict the frequency and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with stroke. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched on June 10, 2020, to investigate COVID-19 and stroke through retrospective cross-sectional studies, case series/reports according to PRISMA guidelines. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. RESULTS: 10 retrospective cohort studies and 16 case series/reports were identified including 183 patients with COVID-19 and stroke. The frequency of detected stroke in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 1.1% ([95% confidential interval (CI)]: [0.6-1.6], I2 = 62.9%). Mean age was 66.6 ([58.4-74.9], I2 = 95.1%), 65.6% was male (61/93 patients). Mean days from symptom onset of COVID-19 to stroke was 8.0 ([4.1-11.9], p< 0.001, I2 = 93.1%). D-dimer was 3.3 µg/mL ([1.7-4.9], I2 = 86.3%), and cryptogenic stroke was most common as etiology at 50.7% ([31.0-70.4] I2 = 64.1%, 39/71patients). Case fatality rate was 44.2% ([27.9-60.5], I2 = 66.7%, 40/100 patients). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review assessed the frequency and clinical characteristics of stroke in COVID-19 patients. The frequency of detected stroke in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 1.1% and associated with older age and stroke risk factors. Frequent cryptogenic stroke and elevated d-dimer level support increased risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 associated with high mortality. Further study is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology and prognosis of stroke in COVID-19 to achieve most effective care for this population.","Yamakawa, Mai; Kuno, Toshiki; Mikami, Takahisa; Takagi, Hisato; Gronseth, Gary",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,307

In this perspective, we will address the inherent immunological perturbations and alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with obesity and COVID-19, and discuss how these impairments may underlie the increased susceptibility and more detrimental outcomes of COVID-19 in people with obesity. Clearly, this has important implications for preventive measures, vaccination, and future therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19. Furthermore, we will highlight important knowledge gaps and provide suggestions for future research and recommendations for policy actions.

To account for unobserved heterogeneity in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 25 contiguous districts within Seoul, we adopt a full Bayesian hierarchical approach for the generalized linear mixed models. A formal statistical analysis suggests that there exists a positive correlation between a 7-day lagged effect of PM2.5 concentration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which implies an elevated risk of the infectious disease. Conversely, temperature has shown a negative correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases, leading to reduction in relative risks. In addition, we clarify that the random fluctuation in the relative risks of COVID-19 mainly originates from temporal aspects, whereas no significant evidence of variability in relative risks is observed in terms of spatial alignment of the 25 districts. Nevertheless, this study provides empirical evidence using model-based formal assessments regarding COVID-19 infection risks in 25 districts of Seoul from a different perspective.","Lym, Youngbin; Kim, Ki-Jung",Environ Res,,307

The numerical methods for the prediction of outbreak of 2019-nCoV and parameter identification are provided, and the numerical results show that the novel dynamic system can well predict the outbreak trend so far.

Potential donors were screened with a lateral flow assay (LFA) for IgM and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Volunteers that were LFA positive were tested with an ELISA to measure IgG titers against the RBD. Subjects with titers of at least 1:1024 were selected to donate. Most donors with positive LFA had acceptable titers and were eligible to donate. Out of 171 volunteers, only 65 tested positive in the LFA (38.0%), and 55 (32.2%) had titers of at least 1:1024.

These cases were telephonically interviewed and clinical data was analyzed. A total of 511 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were recovered with genome coverage of higher than 98% from both the cases. Analysis of both the cases determined that 86.69% (n=443) of them belonged to the Delta variant along with Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into 4 distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage-I had mutations: ORF1ab-A1306S, P2046L, P2287S, V2930L, T3255I, T3446A, G5063S, P5401L, A6319V and N-G215C; Sub-lineage -II : ORF1ab- P309L, A3209V, V3718A, G5063S, P5401L and ORF7a-L116F; Sub-lineage -III : ORF1ab- A3209V, V3718A, T3750I, G5063S, P5401L and Spike-A222V; Sub-lineage -IV ORF1ab- P309L, D2980N, F3138S and spike - K77T.

326063,Burnout among Primary Care Healthcare Workers during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral syndrome currently threatening millions of people worldwide. It is widely recognized as a disease of the pulmonary system, presenting with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, a number of extrapulmonary manifestations have been described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the hematologic, gastroenterological, renal, dermatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Hematological presentations of COVID-19 include laboratory abnormalities such as decreased total lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Several of these findings are associated with increased mortality among infected patients. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, presence of viral RNA in patient stool suggests the possibility of additional testing modalities for COVID-19. Nephrological findings such as proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels have been observed. Additionally, several studies demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) had a greater risk of mortality. The virus can also present with cutaneous symptoms such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like lesions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in the literature, and patients can exhibit findings consistent with viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral nerve disorders, and psychosis. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 does usually present primarily with respiratory symptoms, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus are unpredictable and varied. Better understanding and awareness of these symptoms can lead to more efficient diagnosis, rapid treatment, isolation, and decreased spread of the disease.","AlSamman, Marya; Caggiula, Amy; Ganguli, Sangrag; Misak, Monika; Pourmand, Ali",Am. j. emerg. med,,307
326527,Perception and Psychological Help Seeking Behaviour Among Hematology Healthcare Workers during the COVID19 Pandemic in India,2020,"To address the global mental health crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, an urgent need has emerged to transform the accessibility, efficiency, and quality of mental health care. The next suite of efforts to transform mental health care must foster the implementation of ""learning organizations,"" that is, organizations that continuously improve patient-centered care through ongoing data collection. The concept of learning organizations is highly regarded, but the key features of such organizations, particularly those providing mental health care, are less well defined. Using telepsychiatry care as an example, the authors of this Open Forum concretely describe the key building blocks for operationalizing a learning organization in mental health care to set a research agenda for services transformation.","Beidas, Rinad S; Wiltsey Stirman, Shannon",Psychiatr Serv,,307

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has obligated physicians to recur to additional resources and make drastic changes regarding the standard physician-patient encounter. In the last century, there has been a substantial improvement in technology, which over the years has opened the door to a new form of medical practicing known as telemedicine. METHODS: Healthcare workers from three hospitals involved in the care for COVID-19 patients in the united states were invited to share their experience using telemedicine to deliver clinical care to their patients. RESULTS: Since the appearance of this worldwide outbreak, social distancing has been a key factor in preventing the spread of the virus, for which measures have been taken to limit physical contact. Because of the ongoing situation, telemedicine has been progressively incorporated into the physician-patient encounters and quickly has become an essential component in the day-today medical practice. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to deliver viable spine practice with the use of telemedicine. A proper patient selection of patients requiring virtual treatment versus those requiring in-person visits should be considered.","Franco, Daniel; Montenegro, Thiago; Gonzalez, Glenn A; Hines, Kevin; Mahtabfar, Aria; Helgeson, Melvin D; Patel, Rakesh; Harrop, James",Global Spine J,,307

This outbreak can be controlled only by the diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection in early stages. It is found that the radiographic images are ideal for the fastest diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. This paper proposes an ensemble model which detects the COVID-19 infection in the early stage with the use of chest X-ray images. The transfer learning enables to reuse the pretrained models. The ensemble learning integrates various transfer learning models, i.e., EfficientNet, GoogLeNet, and XceptionNet, to design the proposed model. These models can categorize patients as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia (+), tuberculosis (+), or healthy. The proposed model enhances the classifier's generalization ability for both binary and multiclass COVID-19 datasets. Two popular datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model. The comparative analysis validates that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art models in terms of various performance metrics.","Kumar, N; Gupta, M; Gupta, D; Tiwari, S",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,307

DESIGN: Data of 39 208 Brazilian adults from a Behaviour Web Survey were used. Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables for <5 d/week and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) for &#8805;5 d/week. For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without unhealthy behaviour before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4 h/d for each behaviour (1 - consistently low, 2 - become low during the quarantine, 3 - become high during the quarantine or 4 - consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine. SETTING: Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative). RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·37, 2·12; computer/tablet: OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·31, 2·27) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·23; computer/tablet: OR 1·53; 95 % CI 1·08, 2·17) incidence. Consistent high computer/tablet use also presented higher odds for incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption.

Identifying how and where people seek information during the COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors-age, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic level-on sources of information. Subject and methods: An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less. Conclusion: In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors.

344064,COVID-19: Global Health Equity in Pandemic Response,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to develop a multiparametric prognostic model for death in COVID-19 patients and to assess the incremental value of CT disease extension over clinical parameters. METHODS: Consecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study. Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems. CT disease extension was visually graded as < 20%, 20-39%, 40-59%, or &#8805; 60%. The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC). RESULTS: Of the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died. Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level. CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for &#8805; 60% extension). cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.899-0.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.912-0.953) when adding CT extension. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic model based on clinical variables is highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients. Adding CT disease extension to the model scarcely improves its accuracy. KEY POINTS: â¢ Early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of disease progression and death is crucial; the role of CT scan in defining prognosis is unclear. â¢ A clinical model based on age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory results was highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency room. â¢ Disease extension assessed with CT was independently associated with death when added to the model but did not produce a valuable increase in accuracy.","Besutti, Giulia; Ottone, Marta; Fasano, Tommaso; Pattacini, Pierpaolo; Iotti, Valentina; Spaggiari, Lucia; Bonacini, Riccardo; Nitrosi, Andrea; Bonelli, Efrem; Canovi, Simone; Colla, Rossana; Zerbini, Alessandro; Massari, Marco; Lattuada, Ivana; Ferrari, Anna Maria; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo",Eur. radiol,,307

344630,"Impact of lockdown measures implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic on the burden of trauma presentations to a regional emergency department in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest public health crisis of the last 100 years. Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","Altmann, Samuel; Milsom, Luke; Zillessen, Hannah; Blasone, Raffaele; Gerdon, Frederic; Bach, Ruben; Kreuter, Frauke; Nosenzo, Daniele; Toussaert, Séverine; Abeler, Johannes",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,307

We aimed to determine if the use of integrated laboratory data can discriminate COVID-19 patients from other pulmonary infection patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kunming Third People's Hospital in China from January 20 to February 28, 2020. Medical records and laboratory data were extracted and combined for COVID-19 and other pulmonary infection patients on admission. A partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was constructed and calibrated to discriminate COVID-19 from other pulmonary infection patients. Results: COVID-19 patients diagnosed and treated in Kunming were balanced in terms of sex and covered all age groups. Most of them were mild cases; only five were severe cases. The first two dimensions of the PLS-DA model could classify COVID-19 and other pulmonary infection patients with an accuracy of 96.6% (95.1% in the cross-validation model). Basophil count, the proportion of basophils, prothrombin time, prothrombin time activity, and international normalized ratio were the five most discriminant biomarkers.

CASE REPORTS: Four post-laryngectomy patients with laboratory-proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection were admitted to our institution from 1 March to 1 May 2020. All patients displayed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 and underwent investigations, including swab and serum sampling, and chest X-ray where indicated. All were managed conservatively on dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 wards and were discharged without the requirement of higher level care. CONCLUSION: It is hypothesised that laryngectomy may offer a protective effect against severe or critical disease in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. We hope sharing our experience will aid all practitioners in the management of this, often intimidating, cohort of patients.","Coleman, H; Sutherland, J; Calder, N",J Laryngol Otol,,307
349029,"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Dental Interns in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Survey",2020,"Highly reactive carbenes are usually produced by photolysis of ketenes, diazoalkanes, or diazirines. Sequential kinetic pathways for deactivation of nascent carbenes usually involve bimolecular reactions in competition with isomerization producing stable products such as alkenes. However, the direct photolytic production of stable products, effectively bypassing formation of free carbenes, has been postulated for over 50 years but remains very poorly understood. Often termed ""rearrangement in the excited state"" (RIES), examples include 1,2-hydrogen migration within photoexcited carbene precursors yielding alkenes and the Wolff rearrangement in photogenerated carbonyl-substituted carbenes producing ketenes. In this study, the two competing CO elimination channels from photoexcited gaseous dimethylketene, producing dimethylcarbene and propene, were studied as a function of electronic excitation energy, under collision-free conditions, by using photofragment translational energy spectroscopy with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization of the products. A significant fraction of the dimethylcarbene â propene isomerization exothermicity (â¼300 kJ/mol) was released as propene + CO translational energy, indicating that propene is formed prior to or concurrent with CO elimination. An increase in the propene yield with increasing excitation energy suggests that the effective potential energy barrier for this channel lies â¼24 kJ/mol above the energetic threshold for dimethylcarbene formation via CâC bond fission. Possible mechanisms for direct propene elimination are discussed in light of the observed energy dependence for the competing pathways.","Datta, Sagnik; Davis, H Floyd",J. phys. chem. A,,307

A cross-sectional study,2021,"The traffic microenvironment accounts for a significant fraction of the total daily dose of inhaled air pollutants. The adverse effects of air pollution may be intensified in high altitudes (HA) due to increased minute ventilation (MV), which may result in higher deposition doses compared to that at sea level. Despite this, air quality studies in regions with combined high pollution levels and enhanced inhalation are limited. The main goals of this study are to investigate how the choice of travel mode (walking, microbus, and cable car ride) determines (i) the personal exposure to equivalent black carbon (eBC) and (ii) the corresponding potential respiratory deposited dose (RDD) in HA. For this investigation, we chose La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia as HA representative cities. The highest eBC exposure occurred in microbus commutes (13 μg m-3), while the highest RDD per trip was recorded while walking (6.3 μg) due to increased MV. On the other hand, the lowest eBC exposure and RDD were observed in cable car commute. Compared with similar studies done at sea level, our results revealed that a HA city should reduce exposure by 1.4 to 1.8-fold to achieve similar RDD at sea level, implying that HA cities require doubly aggressive and stringent road emission policies compared to those at sea level.","Madueño, Leizel; Kecorius, Simonas; Andrade, Marcos; Wiedensohler, Alfred",Atmosphere,,307

It argues that dealing with the twin threats is difficult enough in the best of circumstances, and is so little understood in war zones that surgeons and water engineers now question if their practice does more harm than good. Experience suggests that the known transmission routes are complicated by a great number of factors, including the entry of heavy metals through bullets in patients' wounds, hospital over-crowding, mutation in treated water or wastewater, and other threats which endure long after the bombing has stopped.

353682,Correlation between emotional intelligence and negative emotions of front-line nurses during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. METHODS: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.","Sturgill, Ronda; Martinasek, Mary; Schmidt, Trine; Goyal, Raj",JMIR Form Res,,307

358224,"Nurses' Role in Providing Comprehensive Communication, Prognostication, and Palliative Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"Social distancing, a non-pharmaceutical tactic aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19, can arise because individuals voluntarily distance from others to avoid contracting the disease. Alternatively, it can arise because of jurisdictional restrictions imposed by local authorities. We run reduced form models of social distancing as a function of county-level exogenous demographic variables and jurisdictional fixed effects for 49 states to assess the relative contributions of demographic and jurisdictional effects in explaining social distancing behavior. To allow for possible spatial aspects of a contagious disease, we also model the spillovers associated with demographic variables in surrounding counties as well as allow for disturbances that depend upon those in surrounding counties. We run our models weekly and examine the evolution of the estimated coefficients over time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These estimated coefficients express the revealed preferences of individuals who were able to and chose to stay at home to avoid the disease. Stay-at-home behavior measured using cell phone tracking data exhibits considerable cross-sectional variation, increasing over nine-fold from the end of January 2020 to the end of March 2020, and then decreasing by about 50% through mid-June 2020. Our estimation results show that demographic exogenous variables explain substantially more of this variation than predictions from jurisdictional fixed effects. Moreover, the explanations from demographic exogenous variables and jurisdictional fixed effects show an evolving correlation over the sample period, initially partially offsetting, and eventually reinforcing each other. Furthermore, the predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables shows substantial spatial autoregressive dependence, indicating clustering in social distancing behavior. The increased variance of stay-at-home behavior coupled with the high level of spatial dependence can result in relatively intense hotspots and coldspots of social distance, which has implications for disease spread and mitigation.","Narayanan, Rajesh P; Nordlund, James; Pace, R Kelley; Ratnadiwakara, Dimuthu",PLoS One,,307

As this demand fell elective operating subsequently increased. This saw the introduction of the ?Cold Pathway? at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in line with Public Health England guidelines;the first urology patients being admitted on 14 May 2020. This requires patients to undergo a 14-day self-isolation period, which many find difficult, with a negative COVID-19 swab 48 h prior to their operation.Aims:This article examines whether any differences exist in patient outcomes related to COVID-19 since implementation of the Cold Pathway and the significance of this to the 14-day self-isolation rule.Methods:Urology patients electively operated on between 23 March 2020?3 July 2020 were included. A combination of electronic records and telephone consultations were used to obtain data regarding a pre-selected set of questions.Results:One hundred and ninety-six patients were included. Seventy-eight patients were admitted prior to the introduction of the Cold Pathway and 118 after this point. Of patients analysed prior to the implementation of the Cold Pathway, one required ongoing hospital treatment as a result of potentially obtaining COVID-19 from in-patient admission. Of the 78 patients, 14 isolated prior to their procedure. Post-implementation, 118 patients were examined. Despite claiming to have complied with self-isolation instructions at admission, 45 patients admitted retrospectively to not complying at all or only partially. One patient developed COVID-19 3 weeks post-operatively.Discussion:We have shown no difference in outcomes, in relation to COVID-19, when comparing those admitted pre- and post-Cold Pathway implementation. Many patients describe difficulty in following this isolation period. In conjunction with falling national and local levels of COVID-19 positive cases, we have therefore adopted a more pragmatic approach to patient isolation with the ability to perform operations based on clinical need and individual patient circumstances.Level of evidence:This is a cohort study of patients undergoing elective urological surgery at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.","Smith, Rhys O.; Desai, Roshni S.; Jones, Adam",Journal of Clinical Urology,,307

PURPOSE: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

363663,Sleep extension: an explanation for increased pandemic dream recall?,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a redesign of healthcare services. Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Combination therapy is well established in hypertension. Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago. This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes. Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought. Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD. Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.","Floyd, Christopher N; Wierzbicki, Anthony S",Curr Opin Cardiol,,307

365887,From the Editor,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and ultimately death. A feature of patients with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the abundance of inflammatory cytokines in the blood. Elevated levels of cytokines are predictive of infection severity and clinical outcome. In contrast, studies aimed at defining the driving forces behind the inflammation in lungs of subjects with severe COVID-19 remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze and compare the plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 45) for the presence of cytokines and lipid mediators of inflammation (LMIs). METHODS: Cytokines were measured by using Luminex multiplex assay, and LMIs were measured by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We revealed high concentrations of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and LMIs in the BAL fluid of patients with severe COVID-19. Of the 13 most abundant mediators in BAL fluid, 11 were chemokines, with CXCL1 and CXCL8 being 200 times more abundant than IL-6 and TNF-&#945;. Eicosanoid levels were also elevated in the lungs of subjects with severe COVID-19. Consistent with the presence chemotactic molecules, BAL fluid samples were enriched for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Inflammatory cytokines and LMIs in plasma showed limited correlations with those present in BAL fluid, arguing that circulating inflammatory molecules may not be a reliable proxy of the inflammation occurring in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that hyperinflammation of the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 is fueled by excessive production of chemokines and eicosanoids. Therapeutic strategies to dampen inflammation in patients with COVID-19 should be tailored accordingly.","Zaid, Younes; Doré, Étienne; Dubuc, Isabelle; Archambault, Anne-Sophie; Flamand, Olivier; Laviolette, Michel; Flamand, Nicolas; Boilard, Éric; Flamand, Louis",J. allergy clin. immunol,,307
366168,Coronavirus Environment vs Socio-Economic and Demographic Problems Followed: A Sociological Appraisal,2020,"Rapidly assessing how ill a patient is based on their immediate presentation-colloquially termed 'eyeballing' in practice-serves a vital role in acute care settings. Yet surprisingly little is known about how this diagnostic skill is learned or how it should be taught. Some authors have pointed to a dual-process model, suggesting that assessments of illness severity are driven by two distinct types of processing: an intuitive, fast, pattern recognition-like process (Type 1) that depends on many prior patient encounters and outcomes being stored in memory; and a deliberate, slow, analytic process (Type 2) characterized by additional data gathering, data scrutiny, or recollection of rules. But prior studies have supported a dual-process model for the assessment of illness severity only insofar as experienced clinicians chiefly displayed what was presumed to be Type 1 processing. Here we further explored a dual-process model by examining whether less experienced clinicians displayed both types of processing when assessing illness severity across a series of cases. Consistent with the model, a dissociation between Type 1 and Type 2 processing was observed through resident reports of deliberation, response times, and three eye tracking metrics associated with diagnostic expertise.

By utilizing convalescent plasma derived exosomes (CPExo) from COVID-19 recovered persistence could accelerate the treatment strategies in the current state of affairs. Adequate literature has shown that administering the exosome to the in vivo system could be beneficial and could target the pathogens in an effective and precise manner. In this hypothesis we highlight the CPExo instead of convalescent plasma (CP), perhaps to dispense of exosomes are gratified and it's more effectively acquired immune response conferral through antibodies. COVID-19 convalescent plasma has billions of exosomes and it has aptitudes to carry molecular constituents like proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, etc. Moreover, exosomes are capable of recognizing antigens with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Many of these derivatives could trigger an immune modulation into the cells and act as an epigenetic inheritor response to target pathogens through RNAs. COIVID-19 resistance activated plasma-derived exosomes are either responsible for the effects of plasma beyond the contained immune antibodies or could be inhibitory. The proposed hypothesis suggests that preselecting the plasma-derived antibodies and RNAs merged exosomes would be an optimized therapeutic tactic for COVID-19 patients. We suggest that, the CPExo has a multi-potential effect for treatment efficacy by acting as immunotherapeutic, drug carrier, and diagnostic target with noncoding genetic materials as a biomarker.","Anand, Krishnan; Vadivalagan, Chithravel; Joseph, Jitcy Saji; Singh, Sachin Kumar; Gulati, Monica; Shahbaaz, Mohd; Abdellattif, Magda H; Prasher, Parteek; Gupta, Gaurav; Chellappan, Dinesh Kumar; Dua, Kamal",Chem Biol Interact,,307
368240,Assessment of Respiratory Function in Infants and Young Children Wearing Face Masks During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for public health control efforts. Social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with changes in SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the relationship between the change in reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county. RESULTS: 1023/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66·3%) had increasing, and 345 (33·7%) had non-increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In bivariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had significantly higher Social Deprivation Index (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0·009). Counties with increasing case counts were significantly more likely to be metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population (p&0·001), to have a higher percentage of Black residents (9% vs. 6%, p=0·013), and to have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2016 by a 10-point or greater margin (p=0·044). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US during June 2020 were associated with a combination of sociodemographic and political factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will play a critical role in pandemic control.","Mourad, Ahmad; Turner, Nicholas A; Baker, Arthur W; Okeke, Nwora Lance; Narayanasamy, Shanti; Rolfe, Robert; Engemann, John J; Cox, Gary M; Stout, Jason E",Clin. infect. dis,,307

370595,Safe abortion amid the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Italy,2020,"Pseudotyped viruses are valuable tools for studying virulent or lethal viral pathogens that need to be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) or higher facilities. With the explosive spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the establishment of a BSL-2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay is needed to facilitate the development of countermeasures. Here we describe an approach to generate a single-round lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which produced a signal more than 2 logs above background. Specifically, a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant with a cytoplasmic tail deletion of 13 amino acids, termed S&#916;CT13, conferred enhanced spike incorporation into pseudovirions and increased viral entry into cells as compared with full-length spike (S). We further compared S and S&#916;CT13 in terms of their sensitivity to vaccine sera, purified convalescent IgG, hACE2-mIgG, and the virus entry inhibitor BafA1. We developed a S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay and defined key assay characteristics, including linearity, limit of detection, and intra- and intermediate-assay precision. Our data demonstrate that the S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus shows enhanced infectivity in target cells, which will facilitate the assessment of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody therapeutics, and vaccination. This pseudovirus neutralization assay can also be readily adapted to SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerge.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a high throughput pseudovirus neutralization assay is critical for the development of vaccines and immune-based therapeutics. In this study, we show that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to pseudoviruses with enhanced infectivity. This S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay should be broadly useful for the field.","Yu, Jingyou; Li, Zhenfeng; He, Xuan; Gebre, Makda S; Bondzie, Esther A; Wan, Huahua; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Martinez, David R; Nkolola, Joseph P; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,,307

METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization included by 62 Spanish emergency departments in the SIESTA cohort. We collected the demographic characteristics and comorbidities, determined both individually and estimated globally by the Charlson index (ChI). Independent factors related to ICU admission were identified and different analyses of sensitivity were performed to contrast the consistency of the findings of the principal analysis. RESULTS: We included the 338 patients from the SIESTA cohort that died during hospitalization. Of these, 77 (22.8%) were admitted to an ICU before dying. After multivariate adjustment, 3 out of the 20 basal characteristics analyzed in the present study were independently associated with ICU admission: dementia (no patients with dementia who died were admitted to the ICU: OR = 0, 95%CI = not calculable), active cancer (OR = 0.07; 95%CI = 0.02-0.21) and age (< 70 years: OR = 1, reference; 70-74 years: OR = 0.21; 95%CI = 0.08-0.54; 75-79 years: OR = 0.21; 95%CI = 0.08-0.54; &#8805; 80 years: OR = 0.02; 95%CI = 0.01-0.05). The probability of ICU admission significantly increased in parallel to the ChI, even after adjustment for age (ChI 0 points: OR = 0, reference; ChI 1 point: OR = 0.36; 95%CI = 0.16-0.83; ChI 2 points: OR = 0.36; 95%CI = 0.16-0.83; ChI >2 points: OR = 0.09; 95%CI = 0.04-0.23). The sensitivity analyses showed no gross differences compared to the principal analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of COVID-19 patients who died without ICU admission is similar to that observed in the usual medical practice before the pandemic. The basal characteristics limiting their admission were age and global burden due to comorbidity, especially dementia and active cancer.","Miró, Ò; Alquézar-Arbé, A; Llorens, P; Martín-Sánchez, F J; Jiménez, S; Martín, A; Burillo-Putze, G; Jacob, J; García-Lamberechts, E J; Piñera, P; Del Castillo, J González","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,307

Here we show in mouse tumor models that tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are enriched for tumor-specific PD-1+ T cells which closely associate with PD-L1+ cDCs. TDLN-targeted PD-L1-blockade induces enhanced anti-tumor T cell immunity by seeding the tumor site with progenitor-exhausted T cells, resulting in improved tumor control. Moreover, we show that abundant PD-1/PD-L1-interactions in TDLNs of nonmetastatic melanoma patients, but not those in corresponding tumors, associate with early distant disease recurrence. These findings point at a critical role for PD-L1 expression in TDLNs in governing systemic anti-tumor immunity, identifying high-risk patient groups amendable to adjuvant PD-1/PD-L1-blockade therapy.","Dammeijer, Floris; van Gulijk, Mandy; Mulder, Evalyn E; Lukkes, Melanie; Klaase, Larissa; van den Bosch, Thierry; van Nimwegen, Menno; Lau, Sai Ping; Latupeirissa, Kitty; Schetters, Sjoerd; van Kooyk, Yvette; Boon, Louis; Moyaart, Antien; Mueller, Yvonne M; Katsikis, Peter D; Eggermont, Alexander M; Vroman, Heleen; Stadhouders, Ralph; Hendriks, Rudi W; Thüsen, Jan von der; Grünhagen, Dirk J; Verhoef, Cornelis; van Hall, Thorbald; Aerts, Joachim G",Cancer cell,,307

376214,Strengths and Struggles for Families Involved in Hospice Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Clinical trials of treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) draw intense public attention. More than ever, valid, transparent, and intuitive summaries of the treatment effects, including efficacy and harm, are needed. In recently published and ongoing randomized comparative trials evaluating treatments for COVID-19, time to a positive outcome, such as recovery or improvement, has repeatedly been used as either the primary or key secondary end point. Because patients may die before recovery or improvement, data analysis of this end point faces a competing risk problem. Commonly used survival analysis techniques, such as the Kaplan-Meier method, often are not appropriate for such situations. Moreover, almost all trials have quantified treatment effects by using the hazard ratio, which is difficult to interpret for a positive event, especially in the presence of competing risks. Using 2 recent trials evaluating treatments (remdesivir and convalescent plasma) for COVID-19 as examples, a valid, well-established yet underused procedure is presented for estimating the cumulative recovery or improvement rate curve across the study period. Furthermore, an intuitive and clinically interpretable summary of treatment efficacy based on this curve is also proposed. Clinical investigators are encouraged to consider applying these methods for quantifying treatment effects in future studies of COVID-19.","McCaw, Zachary R; Tian, Lu; Vassy, Jason L; Ritchie, Christine Seel; Lee, Chien-Chang; Kim, Dae Hyun; Wei, Lee-Jen",Ann. intern. med,,307

In the present article we have tried to predict the number of active, recovered, death and total cases of COVID19 in India using generalized SEIR model. In our prediction, the occurrence of peak in the active cases curve has a very close match with the peak in the real data (difference of only one week). Although the number of predicted cases differs with the real number of cases (due to unlocking the movement restrictions gradually from June 2020 onwards), the close resemblance in the actual and predicted time (in the peak of active cases curve) makes this model relatively suitable for analysis of COVID19 outbreak in India.","Kishore, Raj; Sahoo, Bijaylaxmi; Swain, Debadatta; Sahu, Kisor Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13610v1.pdf,307

Additionally, the output of the ADRIANA can be used by healthcare administration to predict peak demand time for resources needed to treat infected individuals. ABM is suited for our research experiment, but to prevent the computational constraints of using ABM-based framework for this research, we develop an SEIR compartmental model, a discrete event simulator, and an optimized surrogate model to form a system named ADRIANA. We also ensure that the surrogate's findings are accurate enough to provide optimal solutions. We use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the optimization by estimating the optimal hyperparameter configuration for the surrogate. We concluded this study by discussing the solutions presented by the ADRIANA system, which aligns with the primary goal of our study to present an optimal guide to lockdown policy by the government and resource management by the hospital administrators.","Ogundare, Timilehin; Zyl, Terence Van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04207v1.pdf,307

Lack of definitive vaccine/drugs against this highly contagious virus has accelerated exploratory research on novel natural and synthetic inhibitors. Tea is a rich source of bioactives and known to have antiviral properties. In this study, an in silico strategy involving ADMET property screening, receptor-ligand docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was employed to screen potential tea bio-active inhibitors against three selected targets (RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 70 tea bioactives screened, theaflavin 3,3'-di-gallate (TF3), Procyanidin B2 and Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2a) exhibited highest binding affinities towards RdRp, 3CLpro/Mpro and PLpro targets of SARS-CoV-2 with low docking scores of -14.92, -11.68 and -10.90 kcal/mol, respectively. All of them showed a substantial number of hydrogen bonds along with other interactions in and around the active sites. Interestingly, the top bioactives in our study showed higher binding affinities compared with known antiviral drugs. Further, the top protein-ligand complexes showed less conformational changes during binding when subjected to MD simulation for 100 nanoseconds. The MMPBSA results revealed that RdRp-TF3, 3CLpro-Procyanidin B2 and PLpro-TF2a complexes were stable with binding free energies of -93.59 ± 43.97, -139.78 ± 16.51 and -96.88 ± 25.39 kJ/mol, respectively. Our results suggest that theaflavin 3,3'-digallate, Theaflavin 3-gallate and Procyanidin B2 found in black tea have the potential to act as inhibitors for selected targets of SARS-CoV-2 and can be considered as drug candidates in future studies against COVID-19.","Gogoi, Madhurjya; Borkotoky, Meghali; Borchetia, Sangeeta; Chowdhury, Pritom; Mahanta, Saurov; Barooah, Anoop Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,307

383440,Video intervention to increase treatment-seeking by healthcare workers during the covid-19 pandemic: Randomised controlled trial,2021,"BACKGROUND: This report describes a new strategy for the care of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, based on an interdisciplinary team working. Thereby, we aim at fulfilling three main goals: offering thorough coordinated management for all, and improving physical activity and quality of life of the patients. AIM: With rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), patients and their family often suffer from inadequate recognition of their disease, poor care coordination and incomplete information. A coordinated interdisciplinary approach is one possible solution for providing both comprehensive and cost-effective care, with benefits for patient satisfaction. Poor physical activity and impaired quality of life represent a considerable burden for these patients. To better address these issues, in 2012 we created an interdisciplinary team for the management of OI patients in our University Hospital Centre (CHUV, Lausanne University Hospital,). In this article we describe the implementation of this interdisciplinary care strategy for patients suffering from OI, and its impact on their physical activity and quality of life. METHODS: All patients from the French part of Switzerland were invited to join us. We proposed two complementary evaluations: the initial interdisciplinary evaluation and a yearly follow-up during a special day &ndash; the &ldquo;OI day&rdquo;. This day features specialised medical appointments adapted to each patient&rsquo;s needs, as well as lectures and/or workshops dedicated to patients&rsquo; and families&rsquo; education. Our first aim was to propose for each patient the same management, from diagnosis to the bone health evaluation and physical therapy advice. Our second aim was to evaluate the evolution of physical activity, quality of life (measured by EQ-5D, SF-36 and a dedicated questionnaire) and satisfaction of patients and their families. Here we report both the initial and the long-term results. RESULTS: Since 2012, 50 patients from the French part of Switzerland received the personalised medical evaluation. All of the patients included in this study had the same initial evaluation and at least one participation in an OI Day. All patients had an adaptation of their bone acting drugs. Over a 7-year period, 62% of inactive patients started some physical activity, and 44% of patients who were not involved in any athletic activity started participating in sports. The mean EQ-5D increased from 0.73 to 0.75 (p = 0.59). The mean physical SF36 (musculoskeletal function) score was 59.09 &plusmn; 22.72 and improved to 65.79 &plusmn; 21.51 (p = 0.08), whereas it was 68.06 &plusmn; 20.05 for the mental SF36 without alteration during follow-up. The OI day was revealed to be useful, it contributed to improvement in continuity of care and helped families to better understand the OI patients&rsquo; health. CONCLUSIONS: Our interdisciplinary approach aimed at offering the same thorough management for all patients from the French part of Switzerland, and at improving both the physical activity and the satisfaction of the patients and their family. This report is a basis for future work focusing on the effect of bone fragility and the impact of OI on patients&rsquo; social relations.","Aubry-Rozier, Bérengère; Richard, Céline; Unger, Sheila; Hans, Didier; Campos-Xavier, Belinda; Schneider, Patrick; Paquier, Célia; Pasche, Jennifer; Bonafé, Luisa; Bregou, Aline",Swiss Med Wkly,,307

383932,Violence against women in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is a major health threat across the globe, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it is highly contagious with significant mortality. In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.","Salman, Amer M; Ahmed, Issam; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Jamiluddin, Mohammad Subhi; Dheyab, Mohammed Ali",Comput Biol Med,,307

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, patients with RT-PCR test positive in the first nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were accepted as true positive, and patients with negative 3 consecutive swab results were considered true negative. Those who had a negative initial swab were considered false negatives if they subsequently tested positive on the second or third swab. Demographic data of the patients, the onset of the disease, presence of nasal septal deviation, presence of epistaxis, the clinician (otolaryngologist/other physicians [OP]) who collected the samples, and medical treatments for laryngopharyngeal reflux, allergic respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis, which include proton pump inhibitors and nasal steroids (NS), were documented. The analysis of dependent variables was performed with the chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was performed for significant variables. RESULTS: A total of 399 patients were included in the study, and 357 (89.5%) patients were detected as positive after 2 or 3 consecutive RT-PCR tests. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, and collecting the samples within 7 days following the onset of symptoms were determined as significant factors for positive RT-PCR results (P = <.001; odds ratio [OR] = 6.2, 5.8, 11.6, respectively). The profession of the clinician (OP), NS use, and the presence of epistaxis were detected as significant factors for the false-negative RT-PCR results (P < .001; OR = 2.3, 3.1, 8.7, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patient- and/or sample-related factors can affect RT-PCR results of possible COVID-19 cases. The presence of these factors can easily be determined in cases with high clinical suspicion and negative RT-PCR results. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, early sampling (<7days), and appropriate collection of swabs decrease false-negative RT-PCR results.","Islek, Akif; Balci, Mustafa Koray",Ear Nose Throat J,,307

387814,Examining the effects of modified recreational activities on the mental health of nursing home residents during covid-19,2021,"Alcohol's impact on global health is substantial and of a similar order of magnitude to that from COVID-19. Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health-care services and provide much-needed revenues for governments at this critical time.","Stockwell, Tim; Andreasson, Sven; Cherpitel, Cheryl; Chikritzhs, Tanya; Dangardt, Frida; Holder, Harold; Naimi, Timothy; Sherk, Adam",Drug alcohol rev,,307

This study aimed to develop and validate a novel prediction model of COVID-19 progression. METHODS: In total, 814 patients in the training set were included to develop a novel scoring system; and 420 patients in the validation set were included to validate the model. RESULTS: A prediction score, called ACCCDL, was developed on the basis of six risk factors associated with COVID-19 progression: age, comorbidity, CD4+ T cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For predicting COVID-19 progression, the ACCCDL score yielded a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) compared with the CALL score, CoLACD score, PH-COVID-19 score, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio both in the training set (0.92, 0.84, 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.65, respectively) and in the validation set (0.97, 0.83, 0.83, 0.78, 0.74, and 0.60, respectively). Over 99% of patients with the ACCCDL score < 12 points will not progress to severe cases, and over 30% of patients with the ACCCDL score > 20 points will progress to severe cases. CONCLUSION: The ACCCDL score could stratify patients with at risk of COVID-19 progression, and was useful in regulating the large flow of patients with COVID-19 between primary health care and tertiary centers.","Xu, Wei; Huang, ChenLu; Fei, Ling; Li, WeiXia; Xie, XuDong; Li, Qiang; Chen, Liang",Infect Dis Ther,,307

This study was conducted to investigate the geographical distribution of probable COVID- 19 patients who were transferred to destination hospitals by emergency medical services (EMS) in the first wave of the epidemic, in Tehran, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed based on recorded missions during the first 3-month period of the pandemic in Tehran, Iran. All probable cases of COVID-19 who were transferred to the hospitals following contact with Tehran EMS during the study period were enrolled. Arc-GIS software was utilized to draw the distribution map of the contact places of the cases. Results: In this study, the data of 4018 patients were analyzed (60.9% male). The mean age of the patients was 54.1 ± 20.7 years;and the mean age of the patients had increased with time during the studied 3 months (p = 0.003). The average incidence rate of this disease in Tehran during the study period was 4.6 per 10,000 population. Generally, the lowest and highest raw frequencies of Tehran COVID-19 contamination were seen in municipal districts 21 and 4, respectively. The raw frequency of cases during the 3-month study period also showed that the highest number of cases in Tehran occurred in municipal districts 5 and 4, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, using geographic information systems (GIS), geographical distribution map of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran, during the first 3 months of the pandemic was drawn.","Saberian, P.; Rafiemanesh, H.; Sadeghi, M.; Hasani-Sharamin, P.; Dadashi, F.; Baratloo, A.",Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine,,307

However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic pandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in sub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when designing an effective solution.","Pej'o, Bal'azs; Bicz'ok, Gergely",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12329v1.pdf,307

However, questions remain about the role of the injectable agent, particularly in the context of regimens using new and repurposed drugs. We compared the effectiveness of an injectable-containing regimen to that of an all-oral regimen among patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who received bedaquiline- and/or delamanid as part of their multidrug regimen. METHODS: Patients with a positive baseline culture were included. Six-month culture conversion was defined as two consecutive negative cultures collected >15â days apart. We derived predicted probabilities of culture conversion and relative risk using marginal standardisation methods. RESULTS: Culture conversion was observed in 83.8% (526/628) of patients receiving an all-oral regimen and 85.5% (425/497) of those receiving an injectable-containing regimen. The adjusted relative risk comparing injectable-containing regimens to all-oral regimens was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.88-1.04). We found very weak evidence of effect modification by HIV status: among patients living with HIV, there was a small increase in the frequency of conversion among those receiving an injectable-containing regimen, relative to an all-oral regimen, which was not apparent in HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals receiving bedaquiline and/or delamanid as part of a multidrug regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis, there was no significant difference between those who received an injectable and those who did not regarding culture conversion within 6â months. The potential contribution of injectable agents in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis among those who were HIV positive requires further study.","Khan, Palwasha Y; Franke, Molly F; Hewison, Catherine; Seung, Kwonjune J; Huerga, Helena; Atwood, Sidney; Ahmed, Saman; Khan, Munira; Sultana, Tanha; Manzur-Ul-Alam, Mohammad; Vo, Luan N Q; Lecca, Leonid; Yae, Kalkidan; Kozhabekov, Serik; Tamirat, Meseret; Gelin, Alain; Vilbrun, Stalz C; Kikvidze, Marina; Faqirzai, Jamil; Kadyrov, Abdullaat; Skrahina, Alena; Mesic, Anita; Avagyan, Nana; Bastard, Mathieu; Rich, Michael L; Khan, Uzma; Mitnick, Carole D",Eur. respir. j,,307

Inappropriate disposal of wasted face masks has already caused the pollution of the environment. As made from plastic nonwoven fabrics, disposable face masks could be a potential source of microplastics for the environment. In this study, we evaluated the ability of new and used disposable face masks of different types to release microplastics into the water. The microplastic release capacity of the used masks increased significantly from 183.00 ± 78.42 particles/piece for the new masks to 1246.62 ± 403.50 particles/piece. Most microplastics released from the face masks were medium size transparent polypropylene fibers originated from the nonwoven fabrics. The abrasion and aging during the using of face masks enhanced the releasing of microplastics since the increasing of medium size and blue microplastics. The face masks could also accumulate airborne microplastics during use. Our results indicated that used disposable masks without effective disposal could be a critical source of microplastics in the environment. The efficient allocation of mask resources and the proper disposal of wasted masks are not only beneficial to pandemic control but also to environmental safety.","Chen, Xianchuan; Chen, Xiaofei; Liu, Qian; Zhao, Qichao; Xiong, Xiong; Wu, Chenxi",Environ Pollut,,307

406037,Assessment of Eating Habits and Lifestyle during Coronavirus Pandemic in the MENA region: A Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the routine surveillance system for infectious diseases had to be adapted. The disease was unknown before the first cases were reported under a catch-all notification requirement for new and threatening pathogens and diseases, but specific notification requirements for SARS-CoV­2 detection by laboratories as well as for suspect cases of COVID-19 diagnosed by physicians were soon integrated in the infectious diseases protection act. This article describes how the notification system for infectious diseases was adapted in 2020 to meet the requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to the notification requirements, the list of data that is collected through the notification system was also amended. To facilitate the work of laboratories and local health authorities we have established the possibility for electronic reporting.Additionally, the software used for case and contact management within the local health authorities had to be adapted accordingly.COVID-19 notification data is important for the assessment of the current epidemiological situation and daily updated data was published by the Robert Koch Institute. To ensure timely data and good data quality, the IT infrastructure within the public health system has to be further modernized and the electronic notification system should be further strengthened.","Diercke, Michaela; Claus, Hermann; Rexroth, Ute; Hamouda, Osamah",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,307

406915,Interprofessional primary care during COVID-19: a survey of the provider perspective,2021,"Epidemic spreading can be suppressed by the introduction of containment measures such as social distancing and lock downs. Yet, when such measures are relaxed, new epidemic waves and infection cycles may occur. Here we explore this issue in compartmentalized epidemic models on graphs in presence of a feedback between the infection state of the population and the structure of its social network for the case of discontinuous control. We show that in random graphs the effect of containment measures is simply captured by a renormalization of the effective infection rate that accounts for the change in the branching ratio of the network. In our simple setting, a piece-wise mean-field approximations can be used to derive analytical formulae for the number of epidemic waves and their length. A variant of the model with imperfect information is used to model data of the recent covid-19 epidemics in the Basque Country and Lombardy, where we estimate the extent of social network disruption during lock downs and characterize the dynamical attractors.","Caccioli, Fabio; Martino, Daniele De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02552v1.pdf,307

It is demonstrated that the present model system exhibits phase transitions, or crossovers, among ice VII and two plastic ices with face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice structures. The phase diagram derived from the ReaxFF potential is different from those of the rigid water models in that the bcc plastic phase lies on the high-pressure side of ice VII and does the fcc plastic phase on the low-pressure side of ice VII. The phase boundary between the fcc and bcc plastic phases on the pressure, temperature plane extends to the high-temperature region from the triple point of ice VII, fcc plastic, and bcc plastic phases. Proton hopping, i.e., delocalization of a proton, along between two neighboring oxygen atoms in dense ice is observed for the ReaxFF potential but only at pressures and temperatures both much higher than those at which ice VII-plastic ice transitions are observed.","Adachi, Yuji; Koga, Kenichiro",J Chem Phys,,307

The problem with this practice, is that there exists no credible scientific evidence that (a) generations exist, (b) that people can be reliably classified into generational groups, and (c) that there are demonstrable differences between such groups. We have already noted an emerging generationalized rhetoric that has characterized how people of different ages have been affected by and reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. These narratives have been especially present in discussions of how work and careers will be affected by this crisis. In this essay, we outline problems with applying the concept of generations, especially for researchers seeking explanations for how COVID-19 will affect careers and career development. We urge researchers to eschew the notion of generations and generational differences and consider alternative lifespan development theoretical frameworks that better capture age-graded processes.","Rudolph, Cort W; Zacher, Hannes",J Vocat Behav,,307
408456,Psychological effects of Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) on children of Health Care Workers,2020,"Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 virus? routes of infection, virus?host?protein interactions, and mechanisms of virus-induced cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the discovery and design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose-limiting toxicities in patients. To identify an alternative lysosome-based drug repurposing opportunity we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds . We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 ?M and selectivity indices (SIs;SI = CC50/EC50) ranging from 1.5- to &gt;10-fold. We demonstrate how the compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) that ROC-325 reduced viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV-NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support targeting the lysosome to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and inhibitors of lysosomal function could become an important component of drug combination therapies aimed at improving treatment and outcomes for COVID-19.","Gorshkov, Kirill Chen Catherine Bostwick Robert Rasmussen Lynn Tran Bruce Cheng Yu-Shan Xu Miao Pradhan Manisha Henderson Mark Zhu Wei Oh Eunkeu Susumu Kimihiro Wolak Mason Shamim Khalida Huang Wenwei Hu Xin Shen Min Klumpp-Thomas Carleen Itkin Zina Shinn Paul de la Torre Juan Carlos Simeonov Anton Michael Samuel Hall Matthew Lo Donald Zheng Wei",The FASEB Journal,,307

411870,What led to upsurge of COVID-19 cases in Malawi? Public health perspective,2021,"We conducted an internet survey using Survey Monkey over six weeks to evaluate the impact of the government interventions on social contact patterns in Luxembourg. Participants were recruited via the science.lu website on March 25, April 2, April 16, May 1 during lockdown, and June 12 and June 25 after the lockdown to provide an estimate of their number of contacts within the previous 24 hours. During the lockdown, a total of 5,644 survey participants with a mean age of 44.2 years reported 18,118 contacts (mean = 3.2, IQR 1-4). The average number of contacts per day increased by 24% from 2.9 to 3.6 over the lockdown period. The average number of contacts decreased with age: 4.2 (IQR 2-5) for participants below 25 years and 1.7 (IQR 1-2) for participants above 64 years. Residents of Portuguese nationality reported a higher number of contacts (mean = 4.3, IQR 2-5) than Luxembourgish (mean = 3.5, IQR 2-4) or other foreign residents, respectively. After lockdown, 1,119 participants reported 7,974 contacts with 7.1 (IQR 3-9) contacts per day on average, of which 61.7% (4,917/7,974) occurred without a facemask (mean = 4.9, IQR 2-6). While the number of social contacts was substantially lower during the lockdown by more than 80% compared to the pre-pandemic period, we observed a more recent 121% increase during the post lockdown period showing an increased potential for COVID-19 spread. Monitoring social contacts is an important indicator to estimate the possible impact of government interventions on social contacts and the COVID-19 spread in the coming months.","Latsuzbaia, Ardashel; Herold, Malte; Bertemes, Jean-Paul; Mossong, Joël",PLoS One,,307

Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14-24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing. Sustained public health efforts should focus on maintaining youth engagement with accurate public information and youth-centered messaging promoting prevention measures to protect the health and well-being of youth and their friends and family.","Waselewski, Eric; Waselewski, Marika; Harper, Chloe; Dickey, Sarah; Bell, Sue Anne; Chang, Tammy",Ann Fam Med,,307

Citizens of most countries are suffering major physical, psychological and economic distress. At this stage, a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the most sustainable option to manage the current pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy by even a small subset of the population can undermine the success of this strategy. The objective of this research is to investigate the vaccine characteristics that matter the most to Australian citizens and to explore the potential uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. Through a stated preference experiment, preferences towards a COVID-19 vaccine of 2136 residents of the Australian states and territories were collected and analysed via a latent class model. Results show that preferences for mild adverse cases, mode of administration, location of administration, price and effectiveness are heterogeneous. Conversely, preferences for immediacy and severe reactions are homogeneous, with respondents preferring a shorter period until vaccine is available and lower instances of severe side effects. The expected uptake of the vaccine is estimated under three different scenarios, with the value of 86% obtained for an average scenario. By calculating individual preferences, the willingness to pay is estimated for immediacy, effectiveness, mild and severe side effects.","Borriello, Antonio; Master, Daniel; Pellegrini, Andrea; Rose, John M",Vaccine,,307

We sought to identify incidence, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and outcomes associated with bacterial/fungal secondary infections in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We evaluated adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 2 March and 31 May 2020 and hospitalized &gt;24 hours. Data extracted from medical records included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratory results, microbiological data, and antibiotic use. Microbiologically confirmed bacterial and fungal pathogens from clinical cultures were evaluated to characterize community- and health care-associated infections, including describing temporal changes in predominant organisms on presentation and throughout hospitalization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for HAIs. Results: A total of 3028 patients were included and accounted for 899 positive clinical cultures. Overall, 516 (17%) patients with positive cultures met criteria for infection. Community-associated coinfections were identified in 183 (6%) patients, whereas HAIs occurred in 350 (12%) patients. Fifty-seven percent of HAIs were caused by gram-negative bacteria and 19% by fungi. Antibiotic resistance increased with longer hospital stays, with incremental increases in the proportion of vancomycin resistance among enterococci and ceftriaxone and carbapenem resistance among Enterobacterales. Intensive care unit stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, and steroids were associated with HAIs. Conclusions: HAIs occur in a small proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and are most often caused by gram-negative and fungal pathogens. Antibiotic resistance is more prevalent with prolonged hospital stays. Antimicrobial stewardship is imperative in this population to minimize unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use.","Kubin, C.

METHODS: Serum samples (n = 114) from 34 COVID-19 patients with mild to critical clinical manifestations were examined. The presence and titers of IgG antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were determined by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) using Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and by an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test. RESULTS: IgG was detected by the CMIA in 40%, 88%, and 100% of samples collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and 2 weeks after symptom onset in severe and critical cases, and 0%, 38%, and 100% in mild/moderate cases, respectively. In severe and critical cases, the positive IgG detection rate with the IC assay was 60% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks. In mild/moderate cases, the positive IgG rate was 17% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks; IgM was positive in 80% and 75% of severe and critical cases, and 42% and 88% of mild/moderate cases, respectively. On the CMIA, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in COVID-19 outpatients with mild symptoms within 10 days from onset, whereas 50% of samples from severe inpatients were IgG-positive in the same period. The IC assay detected higher IgM positivity earlier from symptom onset in severe and critical cases than in mild/moderate cases.

Additionally, we discuss possible adverse consequences of ASP attention diversion on COVID-19 response efforts and overall implications for future pandemic planning. We also discuss ASP in collaboration with other groups within health systems and how COVID-19 may affect these relationships long term. Despite the paucity of literature on Antimicrobial Stewardship and COVID-19, the potential contributions of ASPs during a pandemic are numerous. ASPs can develop strategies to identify patients with COVID-19-like-illness; this is particularly useful when these patients are missed at the time of health system entry. ASPs can also play a critical role in the management of potential drug shortages, developing local treatment guidelines, optimizing the use of antibiotics, and in the diagnostic stewardship of COVID-19 testing, among other roles. Importantly, it is often difficult to ascertain whether critically ill patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have concurrent or secondary bacterial infections—ASPs are ideally situated to help optimize antimicrobial use for these patients via a variety of mechanisms. ASPs are uniquely positioned to aid in pandemic response planning and relief efforts. ASPs are already integrated into health systems and play a key role in optimizing antimicrobial prescribing. As ASPs assist in COVID-19 response, understanding the role of ASPs in pandemic relief efforts may mitigate damage from future outbreaks.","Mazdeyasna, Hasti; Nori, Priya; Patel, Payal; Doll, Michelle; Godbout, Emily; Lee, Kimberly; Noda, Andrew J.; Bearman, Gonzalo; Stevens, Michael P.",Curr.

The changes as a proportion of national population were compared, adjusting by the beginning of test-positive cases increase (BPI) or deaths increase (BDI). Remarkable regional differences of more than 100-fold in NPDP and NPDD were observed. The trajectories of NPDD after BDI increased exponentially within 20 days in most countries. Machine learning analysis suggested that NPDD on 30 days after BDI was the highest in developed Western countries (1180 persons per hundred million), followed by countries in the Middle East (128), Latin America (97), and Asia (7). Furthermore, in Western countries with positive rates of the PCR test of less than 7.0%, the increase in NPDP was slowing-down two weeks after BPI, and subsequent NPDD was only 15% compared with those with higher positive rates, which suggested that the situation of testing might have affected the velocity of COVID-19 spread.

426449,Determining Goals of Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Virtual Course for Emergency Medicine Residents,2021,"PurposeResilience is critical for organizations in today's volatile business environment, yet some will survive (and even thrive) despite adversity, while others will perish. Why do some organizations handle adversity better than others? The past literature confirms the importance of specific resources, capabilities and structures in dealing with adversity. However, empirical research on organizational resilience remains highly diverse, and the available results have not yet been presented succinctly.Design/methodology/approachA literature review of empirical research on organizational resilience was conducted to summarize the diverse findings of 69 studies, focusing on the factors that lead to resilience.FindingsSeveral building blocks affect how organizations successfully anticipate, cope with and adapt to adversity. Anticipation entails environmental scanning, resilience plans, specific leadership behavior and resources. Coping necessitates particular leadership qualities, a certain organizational culture and innovation. Adaptation requires an organization to learn from adversity and initiate change processes, which influences its ability to anticipate adversity in the long run.Originality/valueBy exclusively analyzing empirical research on organizational resilience, this study summarizes and assembles the results into building blocks for organizational resilience. The findings elaborate on the composition of a concept that is known for its complexity.","Vakilzadeh, Kijan Haase Alexander",Continuity &amp; Resilience Review,,307

428579,"Association Between Proportion of Workday Treating COVID-19 and Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD Outcomes in U.S. Physicians",2020,"PURPOSE: Among patients receiving chemotherapy, symptom monitoring with electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) is associated with improved clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and compliance with therapy. Standard approaches for ePRO implementation are not established, warranting evaluation in community cancer practices. We present implementation findings of ePRO symptom monitoring across a large multisite community oncology practice network. METHODS: Patients initiating a new systemic therapy at one of the 210 practice sites at Texas Oncology were invited to use the Navigating Cancer ePRO platform, with stepped-wedge implementation from July to December 2020. Participating patients received a weekly prompt by text message or e-mail to self-report common symptoms and well-being. Severe self-reported symptoms triggered a real-time notification to nursing triage to address the symptom. Enrollment and compliance were systematically tracked weekly with evaluation of barriers and facilitators to adoption and sustainability. RESULTS: Four thousand three hundred seventy-five patients planning systemic treatment were enrolled and participated. Seventy-three percent (1,841 of 2,522) of enrolled patients completed at least one ePRO assessment. Among these individuals, 64% (16,299 of 25,061) of available weekly ePRO assessments were completed. Over a 10-week period, compliance declined from 72% to 52%. Barriers currently being addressed include lack of a second reminder text or e-mail prompt, inconsistent discussion of reported ePROs by clinicians at visits, and COVID-related changes in workflow. Facilitators included ease of use and patient and staff engagement on the importance of PROs for symptom management. CONCLUSION: ePROs can be effectively implemented in community oncology practice. Utilization of ePROs is high but diminishes over time without attention to barriers. Ongoing work to address barriers and optimize compliance are underway.","Patt, Debra; Wilfong, Lalan; Hudson, Kathryn Elizabeth; Patel, Amila; Books, Holly; Pearson, Ben; Boren, Rhonda; Patil, Shrutika; Olson-Celli, Kristin; Basch, Ethan",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,307
430656,Distress and resilience of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic (DARVID): study protocol for a mixed-methods research project,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Great interest has been raised by the possible protective role of vitamin D in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but objective data on 25(OH)vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are not conclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of 25(OH)vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian referral hospital and explore its association with clinical outcomes and the markers of disease severity. METHODS: In this single-center cohort study, 129 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an Italian referral center were enrolled from March to April 2020. 25(OH)Vitamin D serum levels were assessed 48 h since hospital admission and categorized into: normal (&#8805;30 ng/mL), insufficient (<30 - &#8805;20 ng/mL), moderately deficient (<20 - &#8805;10 ng/mL), severely deficient (<10 ng/mL). RESULTS: The prevalence of 25(OH)vitamin D insufficiency, moderate deficiency and severe deficiency was 13.2%, 22.5% and 54.3%, respectively. 25(OH)Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was not associated with COVID-19 clinical features and outcomes. Unexpectedly, after adjusting for major confounders, a significant positive association between increasing 25(OH)vitamin D levels and in-hospital mortality (on a continuous logarithmic scale, odds ratio = 1.73 [95% CI, 1.11 to 2.69]; P = .016) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Very low 25(OH)vitamin D levels were highly prevalent and suggestive of deficiency among our hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients, but low 25(OH)vitamin D levels were not associated with outcome variables. Whether 25(OH)vitamin D adequacy may influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 and the unexpected correlation between higher 25(OH)vitamin D levels and mortality require further investigations by large intervention trials.","Cereda, Emanuele; Bogliolo, Laura; Klersy, Catherine; Lobascio, Federica; Masi, Sara; Crotti, Silvia; De Stefano, Ludovico; Bruno, Raffaele; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Perlini, Stefano; Montecucco, Carlomaurizio; Caccialanza, Riccardo",Clin. nutr.

As more establishments open, there is an expectation that people will follow physical distancing guidelines. The implementation, however, is poor;just putting up warning signs appealing the general public to keep a distance of 6 feet from others is hardly enough. In this paper we consider the design of a wearable device that raises an alarm if another similar device is detected within a set distance. It uses off-the-shelf ultra-wideband radio technology for real-time, accurate distance estimation from others in the vicinity. We design an one-to-all ranging protocol that is able to accurately estimate distance to neighboring devices and warn the user if the distance falls below a certain established threshold within a short time. The device must compensate for human occlusions and avoid unnecessary warnings when physical barriers exist between devices. We implement and evaluate our protocol in a small testbed with custom prototype hardware as well as in simulation. Our ranging protocol is capable of performing up to 10 distance measurements per second, while avoiding packet collisions. The overall percentage of rangings completed is around 65% in a 10-node network, and the distance accuracy is around 20cm even with frequent human occlusions. We believe this prototype will provide the first steps to ensure physical distancing in various real-world settings.","Cao, Y.

437977,"Comparing knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 amongst Cameroonians living in urban versus rural areas",2021,"In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new data on the number of new infections and disease related death become available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures.","Calvetti, Daniela; Hoover, Alexander; Rose, Johnie; Somersalo, Erkki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04365v2.pdf,307

Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal CoVs (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, United Kingdom. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70 000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently, and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.","Nickbakhsh, Sema; Ho, Antonia; Marques, Diogo F P; McMenamin, Jim; Gunson, Rory N; Murcia, Pablo R",J Infect Dis,,307

More than ever, national immunization programs must be equipped to contextualize global guidance and make choices that are best suited to their setting. The CAPACITI decision-support tool has been developed in collaboration with national immunization program decision makers in LMICs to structure and document an evidence-based, context-specific process for prioritizing or selecting among multiple vaccination products, services, or strategies. METHODS: The CAPACITI decision-support tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis, as a structured way to incorporate multiple sources of evidence and stakeholder perspectives. The tool has been developed iteratively in consultation with 12 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. RESULTS: The tool is flexible to existing country processes and can follow any type of multi-criteria decision analysis or a hybrid approach. It is structured into 5 sections: decision question, criteria for decision making, evidence assessment, appraisal, and recommendation.

The most common cause is traumatic, due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve between the orotracheal tube cuff and the thyroid cartilage. Other possible causes are direct damage to the vocal cords during intubation, dislocation of the arytenoid cartilages, or infections, especially viral infections. It is usually due to a recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropraxia, and the course is benign in most patients. We present the case of a man who developed late bilateral vocal cord paralysis after pneumonia complicated with respiratory distress due to SARS-CoV-2 that required orotracheal intubation for 11 days. He presented symptoms of dyspnea 20 days after discharge from hospital with subsequent development of stridor, requiring a tracheostomy. Due to the temporal evolution, a possible contribution of the SARS-CoV- 2 infection to the picture is pointed out.","Curros Mata, N; Alvarado de la Torre, S; Carballo Fernández, J; Martínez Morán, A; Álvarez Refojo, F; Rama-Maceiras, P",Rev. esp. anestesiol. reanim,,307

However, there has been no substantive discussion of potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on patient health or their financial and policy implications. After recovery, patients remain at risk for lung disease, heart disease, frailty, and mental health disorders. There may also be long-term sequelae of adverse events that develop in the course of COVID-19 and its treatment. These complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable. Thus, there needs to be a comprehensive plan for preventing and managing post-COVID-19 complications to quell their clinical, economic, and public health consequences and to support patients experiencing delayed morbidity and disability as a result.","Jiang, David H; McCoy, Rozalina G",J Gen Intern Med,,307

The conserved nature of the fusion domain and mechanism across the CoV family make it a valuable target to elucidate and develop pan-CoV therapeutics. In this article, we review the role of the CoV spike protein in mediating fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, summarizing the results of research on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and recent peer-reviewed studies of SARS-CoV-2, and suggest that the fusion mechanism be investigated as a potential antiviral target. We also provide a supplemental file containing background information on the biology, epidemiology, and clinical features of all human-infecting coronaviruses, along with a phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses.","Tang, Tiffany; Bidon, Miya; Jaimes, Javier A; Whittaker, Gary R; Daniel, Susan",Antiviral Res,,307

449110,COVID-19 Fatality: A Cross-Sectional Study using Adaptive Lasso Penalized Sliced Inverse Regression,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in a tremendous increase in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions all over the world. Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warranting ICU treatment usually have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are expected to be prone to develop psychological impairments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, which negatively impact quality of life. To date, no effective treatment strategy is available. In the current trial, we aim to assess the effect of an ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life after COVID-19 ICU treatment. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine whether COVID-19-specific ICU-VR, offered 3 months after hospital discharge, improves psychological well-being and quality of life. Secondary objectives are, firstly, to examine the intra-group changes in psychological well-being and quality of life and the inter-group differences in psychological well-being and quality of life during follow-up, up to 12 months after hospital discharge, and secondly, to examine patients' satisfaction with and rating of ICU care and aftercare and patients' perspectives on ICU-VR. Eighty adult patients treated for COVID-19 in the mixed-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be included and randomized (1:1) to either early or late ICU-VR between June 29 and December 31, 2020. Patients randomized to early ICU-VR will receive the ICU-VR intervention during an outpatient clinic visit 3 months after hospital discharge, whereas patients randomized to late ICU-VR will receive ICU-VR 6 months after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes of this study are psychological well-being, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life, assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and RAND-36 questionnaires, up to 6 months after hospital discharge. DISCUSSION: Currently, an effective treatment for psychological sequelae after ICU treatment for specific illnesses is unavailable. Results from this study will provide insight whether virtual reality is a modality that can be used in ICU aftercare to improve psychological well-being and quality of life, or satisfaction, after ICU treatment for specific illnesses such as COVID-19.

Currently, there are many COVID-19 survivors with psychological sequelae as COVID-19 has widely spread all over the world. However, there is no critically appraised evidence of the benefit of herbal medicine for COVID-19 survivors with psychological sequelae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will search 11 electronic databases from inception to December, 2022: 4 English databases, MEDLINE, PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 3 Chinese databases, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Scientific Journal database, and the Wan Fang database; and 4 Korean databases, the Oriental Medical Advanced Searching Integrated System, the Korean Studies Information Service System, the National Digital Science Links, and the Research Information Sharing Service. We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, and quasi-RCTs for all formations of TRADITIONAL herbal medicine versus conventional drug, placebo, and no treatment for COVID-19 survivors. We will only include the COVID-19 survivors with psychiatric symptoms lasting at least 1âmonth, regardless of their race, sex, and age. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings will provide evidence and treatment directions for clinicians.

451471,High-Yield Adolescent Topics for the Primary Care Pediatrician,2021,"Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strict national policies regarding social distancing behavior in Europe, America and Australia, people became reliant on social media as a means for gathering information and as a tool for staying connected to family, friends and work. This is the first trans-national study exploring the qualitative experiences and challenges of using social media while in lockdown or shelter-in-place during the current pandemic. Methods: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional online survey conducted in Norway, the UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. The manuscript reports on the qualitative free-text component of the study asking about the challenges of social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, USA and Australia. A total of 1991 responses were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. Results: Three overarching themes identified were: Emotional/Mental Health, Information and Being Connected. Participants experienced that using social media during the pandemic amplified anxiety, depression, fear, panic, anger, frustration and loneliness. They felt that there was information overload and social media was full of misleading or polarized opinions which were difficult to switch off. Nonetheless, participants also thought that there was an urge for connection and learning, which was positive and stressful at the same time. Conclusion: Using social media while in a shelter-in-place or lockdown could have a negative impact on the emotional and mental health of some of the population. To support policy and practice in strengthening mental health care in the community, social media could be used to deliver practical advice on coping and stress management. Communication with the public should be strengthened by unambiguous and clear messages and clear communication pathways. We should be looking at alternative ways of staying connected.","Mariyana, Schoultz Janni Leung Tore Bonsaksen Mary Ruffolo Hilde Thygesen Daicia Price Amy Geirdal Østertun",Healthcare,,307

The present review assesses requirements for implementation of COVID-19 RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was &#8804; 30°C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.","Jacobs, Jan; Kühne, Vera; Lunguya, Octavie; Affolabi, Dissou; Hardy, Liselotte; Vandenberg, Olivier",Front Med (Lausanne),,307

However, an exact mathematical analysis of their dynamics and thermodynamics is available for linear models only. We introduce a class of nonlinear stochastic delay processes that obey fluctuation theorems and converge to a Boltzmann equilibrium at long times. From the point of view of control theory, such""equilibrium stochastic delay processes""are stable and passive, by construction. Computationally, they serve as a starting point for the perturbative analysis of general nonlinear stochastic delay problems. Physically, they admit an interpretation in terms of an underdamped Brownian particle that is either subjected to a time-local force in a non-Markovian thermal bath or to a delayed feedback force in a Markovian thermal bath. We illustrate these properties numerically for a setup familiar from feedback cooling and point out experimental implications.","Holubec, Viktor; Ryabov, Artem; Loos, Sarah A.M.; Kroy, Klaus",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07136v2.pdf,307

METHODS: This study adopted a repeated cross-sectional design and surveyed unionized nurses in British Columbia (BC), Canada on three occasions: September 2019 (Time 1, prepandemic), April 2020 (Time 2, early-pandemic) and June 2020 (Time 3). RESULTS: A total of 10,117 responses were collected across three timepoints. This study found a significant increase of 10% to 15% in anxiety and depression between Time 1 and 2, and relative stability between Time 2 and 3, with Time 3 levels still higher than Time 1 levels. Cross-sector analyses showed similar patterns of findings for acute care and community nurses. Long-term care nurses showed a two-fold increase in the prevalence of anxiety early pandemic, followed by a sharper decline mid pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had short- and mid-term mental health implications for BC nurses particularly among those in the long-term care sector. Future research should evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of health workers in different contexts, such as jurisdictional analyses, and better understand the long-term health and labor market consequences of elevated mental health symptoms over an extended time period.","Havaei, Farinaz; Smith, Peter; Oudyk, John; Potter, Guy G",Ann Epidemiol,,307

In an observational, propensity-matched study, outcomes after ECMO support were compared between 19 COVID-19 patients suffering from ARDS (COVID group) and 34 matched non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (NCOVID group) from our historical cohort. A 1:2 propensity matching was performed based on respiratory ECMO survival prediction (RESP) score, age, gender, bilirubin, and creatinine levels. Patients’ characteristics, laboratory parameters, adverse events, and 90-day survival were analyzed. Patients’ characteristics in COVID and NCOVID groups were similar. Before ECMO initiation, fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the COVID group (median: 493 vs. 364 mg/dL, p &lt;0.001). Median ECMO support duration was similar (16 vs. 13 days, p = 0.714, respectively). During ECMO therapy, patients in the COVID group developed significantly more thromboembolic events (TEE) than did those in the NCOVID group (42% vs. 12%, p = 0.031), which were mainly pulmonary artery embolism (PAE) (26% vs. 0%, p = 0.008). The rate of major bleeding events (42% vs. 62%, p = 0.263) was similar. Fibrinogen decreased significantly more in the COVID group than in the NCOVID group (p &lt;0.001), whereas D-dimer increased in the COVID group (p = 0.011). Additionally, 90-day mortality did not differ (47% vs. 74%;p = 0.064) between COVID and NCOVID groups. Compared with that in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients, ECMO support in COVID-19 patients was associated with comparable in-hospital mortality and similar bleeding rates but a higher incidence of TEE, especially PAE. In contrast, coagulation parameters differed between COVID and NCOVID patients.","Autschbach, Teresa Hatam Nima Durak Koray Grottke Oliver Dreher Michael Nubbemeyer Katharina Rossaint Rolf Marx Gernot Marx Nikolaus Spillner Jan Zayat Rashad Kalverkamp Sebastian Kersten Alex",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,307

However, genetic differences have emerged among SARS-CoV-2 lineages, and it is possible that these differences may affect environmental stability and the potential for aerosol transmission. METHODS: The influence of temperature, relative humidity, and simulated sunlight on the decay of four SARS-CoV-2 isolates in aerosols, including one belonging to the recently emerged B.1.1.7 lineage, were compared in a rotating drum chamber. Aerosols were generated from simulated respiratory tract lining fluid to represent aerosols originating from the deep lung. RESULTS: No differences in the stability of the isolates were observed in the absence of simulated sunlight at either 20°C or 40°C. However, a small but statistically significant difference in the stability was observed between some isolates in simulated sunlight at 20°C and 20% relative humidity. . CONCLUSIONS: The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols does not vary greatly among currently circulating lineages, including B.1.1.7, suggesting that the increased transmissibility associated with recent SARS-CoV-2 lineages is not due to enhanced survival in the environment.","Schuit, Michael; Biryukov, Jennifer; Beck, Katie; Yolitz, Jason; Bohannon, Jordan; Weaver, Wade; Miller, David; Holland, Brian; Krause, Melissa; Freeburger, Denise; Williams, Gregory; Wood, Stewart; Graham, Amanda; Rosovitz, M J; Bazinet, Adam; Phillips, Aaron; Lovett, Sean; Garcia, Karla; Abbott, Elyse; Wahl, Victoria; Ratnesar-Shumate, Shanna; Dabisch, Paul",J. infect. dis,,307

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public health crisis including almost 5 million cases and 323,256 deaths as of May 21, 2020. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected FFPE cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross-detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by IHC and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex FISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. It is hoped that these reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.","Liu, Jun; Babka, April M; Kearney, Brian J; Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Kuhn, Jens H; Zeng, Xiankun",JCI insight,,307

473516,Barriers to telehealth access among homebound older adults,2021,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and its risk factors in an elderly Iranian population METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019. The target population was the subjects aged 60 and over living in Tehran. Multistage cluster sampling was done to select the subjects from all Tehran districts. After an initial interview, all subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including the measurement of visual acuity and refraction as well as slit lamp biomicroscopy to evaluate Meibomian glands. RESULTS: Of 3791 selected subjects, 3310 participated in the study. The data of 3284 participants were analyzed. The mean age of the subjects was 68.24 ± 6.53 years (range: 60-97 years) and 57.8% of them were female. The total prevalence of MGD was 71.2% (68.3-74.1), and 38.1% (8.35-40.4), 30.3% (27.4-33.2), and 2.8% (2-3.6) of the subjects had MGD stage 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The prevalence of MGD was significantly higher in men (p < 0.001) and increased with age from 64.4% in the age group 60-64 years to 82.4% in subjects aged 80 years and over. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of MGD between smokers and nonsmokers; however, severe MGD was more common in smokers. The prevalence of MGD was 76.3% and 68.52% in subjects with and without a history of ocular surgery, respectively. The prevalence of MGD stage 3 and 4 was higher in subjects with a history of ocular surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In line with the results of other studies in Asian countries, this study found a high prevalence of MGD in an elderly population of Iran. It was found that male gender and advanced age were risk factors of MGD and smoking and history of ocular surgery might worsen this disease in MGD patients.","Hashemi, Hassan; Asharlous, Amir; Aghamirsalim, Mohamadreza; Yekta, Abbasali; Pourmatin, Rama; Sajjadi, Masoome; Pakbin, Mojgan; Asadollahi, Mohammadreza; Khabazkhoob, Mehdi",Int. ophthalmol,,307
473672,Assessment of the preparedness of obstetrics and gynecology healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya,2020,"PURPOSE: The current COVID-19 pandemic is transforming our urologic practice and most urologic societies recommend to defer any surgical treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) patients. It is unclear whether a delay between diagnosis and surgical management (i.e., surgical delay) may have a detrimental effect on oncologic outcomes of PCa patients. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of surgical delay on oncologic outcomes. METHODS: Data of 926 men undergoing radical prostatectomy across Europe for intermediate and high-risk PCa according to EAU classification were identified. Multivariable analysis using binary logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model tested association between surgical delay and upgrading on final pathology, lymph-node invasion (LNI), pathological locally advanced disease (pT3-4 and/or pN1), need for adjuvant therapy, and biochemical recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate BCR-free survival after surgery as a function of surgical delay using a 3 month cut-off. RESULTS: Median follow-up and surgical delay were 26 months (IQR 10-40) and 3 months (IQR 2-5), respectively. We did not find any significant association between surgical delay and oncologic outcomes when adjusted to pre- and post-operative variables. The lack of such association was observed across EAU risk categories. CONCLUSION: Delay of several months did not appear to adversely impact oncologic results for intermediate and high-risk PCa, and support an attitude of deferring surgery in line with the current recommendation of urologic societies.","Diamand, Romain; Ploussard, Guillaume; Roumiguié, Mathieu; Oderda, Marco; Benamran, Daniel; Fiard, Gaelle; Peltier, Alexandre; Simone, Giuseppe; Van Damme, Julien; Malavaud, Bernard; Iselin, Christophe; Descotes, Jean-Luc; Roche, Jean-Baptiste; Quackels, Thierry; Roumeguère, Thierry; Albisinni, Simone",World j. urol,,307

A Cross-sectional Study on Risk Perception and Preventive Practice,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain may be an early indicator of cognitive decline, but previous studies have not systematically examined the population-level associations between widespread pain and adverse cognitive outcomes and stroke. This study was designed to determine the association between widespread pain, a common subtype of chronic pain, and subsequent dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the US community-based Framingham Heart Study. Pain status was assessed at a single time point between 1990 and 1994. Widespread pain was determined based on the Framingham Heart Study pain homunculus. Dementia follow-up occurred across a median of 10 years (IQR, 6-13 years) for persons who were dementia free at baseline. Proportional hazard models examined associations between widespread pain and incident dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke. RESULTS: A total of 347 (14.1%) subjects fulfilled the criteria for widespread pain, whereas 2117 (85.9%) subjects did not. Of 188 cases of incident all-cause dementia, 128 were Alzheimer's disease dementia. In addition, 139 patients suffered stroke during the follow-up period. After multivariate adjustment including age and sex, widespread pain was associated with 43% increase in all-cause dementia risk (HR: 1.43; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.92), 47% increase in Alzheimer's disease dementia risk (HR: 1.47; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.20) and 29% increase in stroke risk (HR: 1.29; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.54). Comparable results were shown in the subgroup of individuals over 65 years old. CONCLUSION: Widespread pain was associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke.

477429,Use and Content of Primary Care Office-Based vs Telemedicine Care Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US,2020,"Allogeneic immune responses underlie the graft-versus-leukaemia effect of stem cell transplantation, but disease relapse occurs in many patients. Minor histocompatibility antigen (mHAg) peptides mediate alloreactive T cell responses and induce graft-versus-leukaemia responses when expressed on patient haematopoietic tissue. We vaccinated nine HA-1-negative donors against HA-1 with a 'prime-boost' protocol of either two or three DNA 'priming' vaccinations prior to 'boost' with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). HA-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses were observed in seven donors with magnitude up to 1·5% of total CD8+ T cell repertoire. HA-1-specific responses peaked two weeks post-MVA challenge and were measurable in most donors after 12 months. HA-1-specific T cells demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity and lysed target cells with endogenous HA-1 protein expression. The pattern of T cell receptor (TCR) usage by HA-1-specific T cells revealed strong conservation of T cell receptor beta variable 7-9 (TRBV7-9) usage between donors. These findings describe one of the strongest primary peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses yet recorded to a DNA-MVA prime-boost regimen and this may reflect the strong immunogenicity of mHAg peptides. Prime-boost vaccination in donors or patients may prove of substantial benefit in boosting graft-versus-leukaemia responses.","Eldershaw, Suzy A; Pearce, Hayden; Inman, Charlotte F; Piper, Karen P; Abbotts, Ben; Stephens, Christine; Nicol, Samantha; Croft, Wayne; Powell, Richard; Begum, Jusnara; Taylor, Graham; Nunnick, Jane; Walsh, Donna; Sirovica, Mirjana; Saddique, Shamyla; Nagra, Sandeep; Ferguson, Paul; Moss, Paul; Malladi, Ram",Br. j. haematol,,307

A total of 200 serially collected nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from 38 COVID-19 patients and 122 specimens from negative controls were analyzed. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed in comparison to molecular test results and subdivided according to targeted genes (E, RdRP, and N) and days post-symptom onset (PSO). For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO. Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3â100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) < 25. The specificity of AFIAS was 98.7â98.9% and that of ichromaTM was 100.0%. The kappa values of AFIAS and ichromaTM for the molecular testing of specimens with Ct < 25 (RdRP) were 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity of AFIAS and ichromaTM for all genes was lower for specimens collected at 8â14 PSO than for those collected before 7-days PSO. The kinetics profiles showed that antigen levels gradually decreased from &#8804; 7-days PSO to > 22-days PSO. Both RATs showed excellent specificity and acceptable sensitivity for NP specimens with higher viral loads and for specimens collected within 7-days PSO. Hence, they have the potential to become useful tools for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, because of concerns about false negativity, RATs should be used in conjunction with molecular tests.","Kweon, Oh Joo; Lim, Yong Kwan; Kim, Hye Ryoun; Choi, Yoojeong; Kim, Min-Chul; Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Lee, Mi-Kyung",PLoS One,,307

In this study, the comparative sensitivity of different respiratory specimens were retrospectively analyzed using 3552 clinical samples from 410 Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) confirmed COVID-19 patients. Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (73.4%â¼87.5%), followed by nasal swabs (53.1%â¼85.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). Viral RNA could be detected in all BALF from the severe group collected as early as 4 days after illness onset (d.a.o) and lasted up to 46 d.a.o., while none of BALF samples from mild group. Moreover, although viral RNA was negative in the upper respiratory samples, it was also positive in BALF samples in most cases from severe group during treatment. Despite of typical ground-glass opacity observed via computed tomographic (CT) scans, no viral RNA was detected in the first 3 or all upper respiratory tract specimens from some COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, sputum is most sensitive for routine laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, followed by nasal swabs.

Interestingly, mRNA vaccines may also be useful for preventing non-infectious diseases such as diabetes and cancer. This review summarises the current progresses of mRNA vaccines designed for a range of diseases including COVID-19. As epitope study is a primary component in the in silico design of mRNA vaccines, we also survey on advanced bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms which have been used for epitope prediction, and review on user-friendly software tools available for this purpose.

To prevent severe infection, mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns with several vaccine types are currently underway. We report pathological and immunological findings in 8 patients who developed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) after administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. We analyzed patient material using enzyme immune assays, flow cytometry and heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay and performed autopsies on two fatal cases. Eight patients (5 female, 3 male) with a median age of 41.5 years (range, 24 to 53) were referred to us with suspected thrombotic complications 6 to 20 days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. All patients had thrombocytopenia at admission. Patients had a median platelet count of 46.5 x109/L (range, 8 to 92). Three had a fatal outcome and 5 were successfully treated. Autopsies showed arterial and venous thromboses in various organs and the occlusion of glomerular capillaries by hyaline thrombi. Sera from VITT patients contain high titer antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) (OD 2.59±0.64). PF4 antibodies in VITT patients induced significant increase in procoagulant markers (P-selectin and phosphatidylserine externalization) compared to healthy volunteers and healthy vaccinated volunteers. The generation of procoagulant platelets was PF4 and heparin dependent.

It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage. This review paper aims to synthesize the impact of the virus on a global, micro to macro scale.","Mallah, Saad I; Ghorab, Omar K; Al-Salmi, Sabrina; Abdellatif, Omar S; Tharmaratnam, Tharmegan; Iskandar, Mina Amin; Sefen, Jessica Atef Nassef; Sidhu, Pardeep; Atallah, Bassam; El-Lababidi, Rania; Al-Qahtani, Manaf",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,307

Cases were COVID-19 infected Afghans, and controls were Iranian patients. Demographic data, Self-reported symptoms, disease history, and initial symptom to referral length were extracted from medical records. CT scans being conducted and receiving ICU treatment were assessed for evaluation of racial inequality in health care. In this study, 132 Afghan refugees were compared to 266 Iranian controls. There were multiple self-reported symptoms being statistically differently manifested in Afghan refugees in comparison to Iranian COVID-19 patients. There was no difference in probability of being evaluated by HRCT or receiving ICU treatment (P=0.173, 1, respectively) even after being adjusted for symptoms or co-morbidities that were manifesting differently between Afghan vs. Iranian patients (P=0.476, 0.881, respectively). Ten (7.57%) subjects died in the case group and 18 (6.76) in the control group. There wasn’t any significant difference in the death rate between the groups (P=0.766). Our study revealed huge differences in symptoms of Afghan vs. Iranian COVID-19 patients, while these differences did not affect the probability of receiving proper health care.

We tried to determine if TB has any impact on course and prognosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. Design & Setting: In this retrospective analytical study, data of 7774 patients were collected from various state government owned hospitals of India. Chest CT scans were reviewed for present or past stigmata of pulmonary TB, CORADS and CT severity score. Statistical analysis was done for class wise frequency distribution and association of attributes were calculated. Results: 95.01% Patients with Covid- 19 pneumonia didn’t have CT signs of history of active or old healed pulmonary TB, while 4.99% had it. In first group 44.85 % mild, 36.17 % moderate and 13.98 % had severe disease, while in second group figure is 3.39 % 1.21 % and 0.40 % respectively. Probability of TB providing immunity against developing moderate or severe form of Covid-19 pneumonia is 0.6778. Conclusions: Patients with active or past history of TB are less prone to develop moderate or severe form of Covid-19 pneumonia.

But to a surprising degree, there were systematic variations in the governors' decisions, and these variations were embedded in a subtle but growing pattern of differences among the states in a host of policy areas, ranging from decisions about embracing the Affordable Care Act to improving their infrastructure. These patterns raise fundamental questions about the role of the federal government's leadership in an issue that was truly national in scope, and whether such varied state reactions were in the public interest.

It consists of enzyme-catalyzed biotin tags ubiquitously apposed on proteins located in close proximity of the labeling enzyme, followed by affinity purification and identification of biotinylated proteins by mass spectrometry. Here we outline the methods by which the molecular microenvironment of the coronavirus replicase/transcriptase complex (RTC), i.e., proteins located within a close perimeter of the RTC, can be determined by different proximity labeling approaches using BirAR118G (BioID), TurboID, and APEX2. These factors represent a molecular signature of coronavirus RTCs and likely contribute to the viral life cycle, thereby constituting attractive targets for the development of antiviral intervention strategies.","V039,; kovski, Philip; Steiner, Silvio; Thiel, Volker",Methods Mol Biol,,307
503616,Commentary: special care considerations in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19,2021,"Vaginal self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing can potentially increase cervical screening coverage. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing and factors which might influence a woman's preference for this as a cervical screening method. This was a cross-sectional study which recruited 725 women from the urban and suburban areas of Selangor, Malaysia. All study participants were instructed to self-collect vaginal sample using a dry flocked swab before responding to a detailed questionnaire documenting their experience and preference for self-sampling. Most of the study participants (>80%) perceived vaginal self-sampling as easy, convenient, not embarrassing, comfortable and were confident in performing the test. This suggests high acceptability towards vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing. Out of the 725 women, 83% preferred self-sampling HPV testing over healthcare personnel sampling HPV testing and Pap test. Women with higher household income and full-time employment status were more likely to prefer self-sampling. Those who had not undergone Pap test also expressed preference for self-sampling HPV testing. Convenience and women's confidence in performing a vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing were the independent key factors that influenced the preference for self-sampling method. Vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing is highly acceptable among Malaysian women. It is the preferred choice as a primary cervical screening method and serves as an alternative to healthcare acquired sample for Pap test.","Khoo, Su Pei; Lim, Wen Tzien; Rajasuriar, Reena; Nasir, Nazrila Hairizan; Gravitt, Patti E; Woo, Yin Ling",Cancer prev. res.

504490,"NHS's plan to abolish CCGs must not dilute primary care's influence, say leaders",2020,"Resumen Objetivo: Los informes iniciales de la COVID-19 describieron diversas presentaciones clínicas, pero las anomalías de las vías respiratorias bajas son las más frecuentes y los hallazgos de la tomografía computarizada (TC) de tórax difieren entre pacientes adultos y pediátricos. Nuestro objetivo es resumir los hallazgos tempranos de la TC para informar a los profesionales sanitarios sobre la frecuencia de manifestaciones específicas de la COVID-19 en los pacientes adultos o pediátricos, y determinar si la sensibilidad de la TC justifica su uso en estas poblaciones. Métodos: Se buscó en PubMed la presencia de las palabras “TC”, “técnicas de imagen”, “COVID-19” en el título o en el resumen y se seleccionaron para la síntesis de datos 17 estudios a gran escala de PubMed y/o Scopus y casos clínicos publicados entre el 1 de enero de 2020 y el 15 de abril de 2020. Resultados: Las TC iniciales identificaron que las opacidades en vidrio esmerilado (OVE) y las anomalías bilaterales eran más frecuentes en los adultos (74%, n = 698 y 89%, n = 378, respectivamente) que en los niños (60%, n = 25 y 37%, n = 46). A partir de los 14 días, las TC evidenciaron diversos grados de mejoría en los adultos, pero no se observó resolución hasta al menos 26 días después del inicio de los síntomas seudogripales. En los pacientes pediátricos, un tercio (n = 9) mostró pequeñas OVE nodulares adicionales limitadas a un solo lóbulo 3-5 días después de una TC inicial. Conclusión: Los primeros hallazgos de la TC en adultos sugieren el uso limitado de la TC como herramienta complementaria en el diagnóstico de la COVID-19 en pacientes adultos sintomáticos, con especial atención a la identificación de las anomalías de los lóbulos inferiores derecho e izquierdo, las OVE y el engrosamiento del tabique interlobulillar. Los primeros hallazgos de la TC pediátrica desaconsejan el uso de la TC si se dispone de RT-PCR, debido a su sensibilidad significativamente menor en esta población y a la exposición a radiación. Objective: Initial COVID-19 reports described a variety of clinical presentations, but lower respiratory abnormalities are most common and chest CT findings differ between adult and pediatric patients. We aim to summarize early CT findings to inform healthcare providers on the frequency of COVID-19 manifestations specific to adult or pediatric patients, and to determine if the sensitivity of CT justifies its use in these populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for the presence of the words “CT, imaging, COVID-19” in the title or abstract, and 17 large-scale PubMed and/or Scopus studies and case reports published between January 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were selected for data synthesis. Results: Initial CT scans identified ground-glass opacities and bilateral abnormalities as more frequent in adults (74%, n=698, and 89%, n=378, respectively) than children (60%, n=25, and 37%, n=46). At 14+ days, CT scans evidenced varied degrees of improvement in adults but no resolution until at least 26 days after the onset of flu-like symptoms. In pediatric patients, a third (n=9) showed additional small nodular GGOs limited to a single lobe 3-5 days after an initial CT scan. Conclusión: Early adult CT findings suggest the limited use of CT as a supplemental tool in diagnosing COVID-19 in symptomatic adult patients, with a particular focus on identifying right and left lower lobe abnormalities, GGOs, and interlobular septal thickening. Early pediatric CT findings suggest against the use of CT if RT-PCR is available given its significantly lower sensitivity in this population and radiation exposure.","Waller, J. V.; Lin, K.

This analysis provides a critical update and expansion of previously published data, to include trends after fall school reopenings, and adds preschool-aged children (0-4 years) and college-aged young adults (18-24 years) (1). Among children, adolescents, and young adults, weekly incidence (cases per 100,000 persons) increased with age and was highest during the final week of the review period (the week of December 6) among all age groups. Time trends in weekly reported incidence for children and adolescents aged 0-17 years tracked consistently with trends observed among adults since June, with both incidence and positive test results tending to increase since September after summer declines. Reported incidence and positive test results among children aged 0-10 years were consistently lower than those in older age groups. To reduce community transmission, which will support schools in operating more safely for in-person learning, communities and schools should fully implement and strictly adhere to recommended mitigation strategies, especially universal and proper masking, to reduce COVID-19 incidence.","Leidman, Eva; Duca, Lindsey M; Omura, John D; Proia, Krista; Stephens, James W; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,307

We aimed to determine how trends in neurology service admissions during the pandemic may aid in departmental planning by predicting future clinician staffing and other needs. We examined all admissions to the general neurology, stroke, and neurocritical care services from January 31 to May 16, 2020 at our tertiary-care hospital using an electronic health record query, comparing these to analogous data in 2019. We trended admission rates and projected future censuses using logarithmic regression, tracked changes in length of stay (LOS), and quantified shifts in presentations of specific diagnoses. Daily rates of admissions declined sharply during the week of March 13, 2020 (the week after pandemic status was declared by the World Health Organization). On the censoring date, we projected a return to pre-pandemic censuses in the week of June 21 and used this information to make decisions regarding neurology resident schedules. There was a trend toward increased LOS for general neurology and stroke patients between March 27 and April 9, 2020 compared to in 2019, with subsequent decline coinciding with early hospital initiatives. Since March 13, 2020, there has been a trend toward reduced presentations of ischemic stroke, suggesting a need for community education on stroke awareness. Characterizing early trends in neurology admissions may allow physician administrators to plan local and community-level responses to the pandemic.","Lau, K. H.

There is major divergence among nations, however, between a ""privacy-first"" approach which protects citizens' data at the cost of extremely limited access for public health authorities and researchers, and a ""data-first"" approach which stores large amounts of data which, while of immeasurable value to epidemiologists and other researchers, may significantly intrude upon citizens' privacy. The lack of a consensus on privacy protection in the contact tracing process creates risks of non-compliance or deliberate obfuscation from citizens who fear revealing private aspects of their lives - a factor greatly exacerbated by recent major scandals over online privacy and the illicit use of citizens' digital information, which have heightened public consciousness of these issues and created significant new challenges for any collection of large-scale public data. While digital contact tracing for COVID-19 remains in its infancy, the lack of consensus around best practices for its implementation and for reassuring citizens of the protection of their privacy may already have impeded its capacity to contribute to the pandemic response.","Fahey, Robert A; Hino, Airo",Int J Inf Manage,,307

521822,Perspective of COVID-19 pandemic in Middle East countries,2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high fatality rates, especially for patients who suffer from underlying health issues. One of the more serious symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid debris that have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy and stiff lungs. In this paper, we propose the use of micro-bubbles filled with exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as possible rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have suffered from viral infection. We have conducted simulations to show the efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of tissues reaching the alveoli that contain the micro-bubbles. Our results have shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our proposed system can be used for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where the micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until they are exposed to the ultrasound signals.","Fonseca, Bruna; Fonseca, Caio; Barros, Michael; White, Mark; Abhyankar, Vinay; Borkholder, David A.; Balasubramaniam, Sasitharan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09709v1.pdf,307
521903,The pervasive relevance of COVID-19 within routine paediatric palliative care consultations during the pandemic: A conversation analytic study,2020,"Pregnant women and neonates are often categorised as being at high risk during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low. Outcomes of neonates born to women positive for COVID-19 are generally very good, though iatrogenic preterm birth is more common. Findings from these studies highlight the need for further monitoring of the outcomes of pregnant and post-partum women according to trimester during this pandemic.","Elsaddig, Maab; Khalil, Asma","Best pract. res., Clin. obstet. gynaecol",,307
522036,Factors Influencing Nurse Assistants' Job Satisfaction in Nursing Homes in Canada and Spain: A Comparison of Two Cross-Sectional Observational Studies,2020,"Background: With the rapid growth of massively parallel sequencing technologies, still more laboratories are utilizing sequenced DNA fragments for genomic analyses. Interpretation of sequencing data is, however, strongly dependent on bioinformatics processing, which is often too demanding for clinicians and researchers without a computational background. Another problem represents the reproducibility of computational analyses across separated computational centers with inconsistent versions of installed libraries and bioinformatics tools. Results: We propose an easily extensible set of computational pipelines, called SnakeLines, for processing sequencing reads; including mapping, assembly, variant calling, viral identification, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and methylation analysis. Individual steps of an analysis, along with methods and their parameters can be readily modified in a single configuration file. Provided pipelines are embedded in virtual environments that ensure isolation of required resources from the host operating system, rapid deployment, and reproducibility of analysis across different Unix-based platforms. Conclusion: SnakeLines is a powerful framework for the automation of bioinformatics analyses, with emphasis on a simple set-up, modifications, extensibility, and reproducibility.

523639,Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Emergency Visits and Emergency Consultations: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"It is unclear whether individuals with enormous diversity in B cell receptor repertoires are consistently able to mount effective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed antibody responses in a cohort of 55 convalescent patients and isolated 54 potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). While most of the mAbs target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding surface on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mAb 47D1 binds only to one side of the receptor binding surface on the RBD. Neutralization by 47D1 is achieved independent of interfering RBD-ACE2 binding. A crystal structure of the mAb-RBD complex shows that the IF motif at the tip of 47D1 CDR H2 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the RBD. Diverse immunoglobulin gene usage and convergent epitope targeting characterize neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that vaccines that effectively present the receptor binding site on the RBD will likely elicit neutralizing antibody responses in a large fraction of the population.","Zhou, Xiaojuan; Ma, Fengge; Xie, Jun; Yuan, Meng; Li, Yunqiao; Shaabani, Namir; Zhao, Fangzhu; Huang, Deli; Wu, Nicholas C; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Liu, Hejun; Li, Jiali; Chen, Zhonghui; Hong, Yazhen; Liu, Wen-Hsien; Xiao, Nengming; Burton, Dennis R; Tu, Haijian; Li, Hang; Chen, Xin; Teijaro, John R; Wilson, Ian A; Xiao, Changchun; Huang, Zhe",Cell Rep,,307

Because of the particularity of COVID-19, people are at a high risk of pressure injuries during the prevention and treatment process of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to summarize the pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 and the corresponding preventive measures and treatments. METHODS: This systematic review was according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of science and CNKI (Chinese) were searched for studies on pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 published up to August 4, 2020. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and the CARE guidelines. RESULTS: The data were extracted from 16 studies involving 7,696 participants in 7 countries. All studies were published in 2020. There are two main types of pressure injuries caused by the COVID-19: 1) Pressure injuries that caused by protective equipment (masks, goggles and face shield, etc.) in the prevention process; 2) pressure injuries caused by prolonged prone position in the therapy process. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, the included studies showed that wearing protective equipment for a long time and long-term prone positioning with mechanical ventilation will cause pressure injuries in the oppressed area. Foam dressing may need to be prioritized in the prevention of medical device related pressure injuries. The prevention of pressure injuries should be our particular attention in the course of clinical treatment and nursing.","Yu, Jia-Ning; Wu, Bing-Bing; Feng, Li-Ping; Chen, Hong-Lin",,,307

Up to one-half of all older adults regularly feel lonely, negatively impacting physical and mental health. In light of population aging, family dispersal, and in the aftermath of COVID-19, it is vital that we grow the evidence base around the lived experience of older people, knowing what they want and why, and ensuring community services and supports are meaningful to them. Method: Three focus groups were held with community-dwelling older adults in Ireland. Results: Loneliness is associated with the loss of familiarity and connection to community. Conclusions: Understanding loneliness in later life is increasingly important with population aging.

Cancer care providers (CCPs) are under immense mental burden due to the unpredictable pandemic and compromised cancer care amongst patients. Pandemic has taken a toll on the caregivers, be it physically, mentally, or psychosocially. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted from May 2020 to September 2020 to assess the pandemic's impact on mental health amongst the CCP. DASS 21 & PCL5 instruments were used to identify the temporal change with pandemic evolution on mental health. An online survey was administered at three different periods with 6-week intervals through email. Collected data is analyzed using the SPSS 26. Independent variables are presented as categorical data and analyzed using chi-square. Temporal change in the mean scores analyzed using independent t-tests. Various demographic factors were correlated with the DASS 21 scores and PCL 5 scores using logistic regression. Results: The questionnaire was emailed to 240 CCP's;115 responses were valid. Mean age is 29.9 +/- 5.86, 62.6% were male and 27.4% were female respondents. 41.7% were nursing staff, and 58.3% were doctors;67% had less than five years of medical experience. Respondents who stayed with family had significant depression levels in the first and third surveys (OR: 0.37, CI- 0.15-0.91, P=0.03), (OR: 0.17, CI-0.026-1.1, P=0.04). Stress levels were significantly high in the caregivers staying with family in the first survey (OR: 4.38, CI: 1.2-15.7, P=0.02). On analyzing three surveys, 55 respondents in both the first and second survey 21,8,17 respondents persisted in having depression, stress, and anxiety. There was an increase in the stress levels in the third survey when compared to the second survey. Conclusions: In any disaster or an unnatural event, time helps the human mind to adapt to the new conditions;it is similar to our initial results that show improvement in the depression, stress, and anxiety levels with the second survey.

Participants in the experimental (inoculation) condition watched a video that explained common rhetorical markers of radical-Islamist and Islamophobic disinformation that had been identified in an analysis of YouTube content. The information was presented in a neutral context not involving Islam and focused on analysis of the misleading argumentation. The control group watched a video about an unrelated topic. Participants were then exposed to target videos with “gateway” content that constituted an entry point to potential Islamist or Islamophobic radicalization. Both videos contained numerous items of disinformation. Participants then answered a variety of questions such as how likely they were to share the video, their level of agreement, and their perceived accuracy of the video. Participants who had received the inoculation displayed less agreement with the video content, perceived the video as less reliable, and were less likely to share it in comparison with participants in the control group.

591773,The Hidden Costs of National Lockdowns,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being incorporated into public health surveillance and disease control systems worldwide and has the potential to make significant contributions to infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and infection prevention and control. However, to date, there are limited data regarding (i) the optimal models for integration of genomic data into epidemiological investigations and (ii) how to quantify and evaluate public health impacts resulting from genomic epidemiological investigations. METHODS: We developed the Pathogen Genomics in Public HeAlth Surveillance Evaluation (PG-PHASE) Framework to guide examination of the use of WGS in public health surveillance and disease control. We illustrate the use of this framework with three pathogens as case studies: Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The framework utilises an adaptable whole-of-system approach towards understanding how interconnected elements in the public health application of pathogen genomics contribute to public health processes and outcomes. The three phases of the PG-PHASE Framework are designed to support understanding of WGS laboratory processes, analysis, reporting and data sharing, and how genomic data are utilised in public health practice across all stages, from the decision to send an isolate or sample for sequencing to the use of sequence data in public health surveillance, investigation and decision-making. Importantly, the phases can be used separately or in conjunction, depending on the need of the evaluator. Subsequent to conducting evaluation underpinned by the framework, avenues may be developed for strategic investment or interventions to improve utilisation of whole genome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive evaluation is critical to support health departments, public health laboratories and other stakeholders to successfully incorporate microbial genomics into public health practice. The PG-PHASE Framework aims to assist public health laboratories, health departments and authorities who are either considering transitioning to whole genome sequencing or intending to assess the integration of WGS in public health practice, including the capacity to detect and respond to outbreaks and associated costs, challenges and facilitators in the utilisation of microbial genomics and public health impacts.

Kilian (Am Econ Rev 99(3): 1053–1069, 2009) proposes to decompose the oil price into three types of oil price shocks by using a structural vector autoregression model. This paper investigates the dynamic, nonlinear dependence and risk spillover effects between BRICS stock returns and the different types of oil price shocks using an appropriate multivariate and dynamic copula model. Risk is measured using the conditional value at risk, conditioning on one or more simultaneous oil and stock market shocks. For this purpose, a D-vine-based quantile regression model and the GAS copula model are combined.

Molecular factors controlling these mechanisms represent potential therapeutic targets. CD73 is the major enzyme that dephosphorylates extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to form the anti-inflammatory adenosine. CD73 is expressed on pericentral hepatocytes, which are important for long-term liver homeostasis. We aimed to determine if CD73 has nonredundant hepatoprotective functions. METHODS: Liver-specific CD73 knockout (CD73-LKO) mice were generated by targeting the Nt5e gene in hepatocytes. The CD73-LKO mice and hepatocytes were characterized using multiple approaches. RESULTS: Deletion of hepatocyte Nt5e resulted in an approximately 70% reduction in total liver CD73 protein (P < .0001). Male and female CD73-LKO mice developed normally during the first 21 weeks without significant liver phenotypes. Between 21 and 42 weeks, the CD73-LKO mice developed spontaneous-onset liver disease, with significant severity in male mice. Middle-aged male CD73-LKO mice showed hepatocyte swelling and ballooning (P < .05), inflammation (P < .01), and variable steatosis. Female CD73-LKO mice had lower serum albumin levels (P < .05) and increased inflammatory genes (P < .01), but did not show the spectrum of histopathologic changes in male mice, potentially owing to compensatory induction of adenosine receptors. Serum analysis and proteomic profiling of hepatocytes from male CD73-LKO mice showed significant metabolic imbalance, with increased blood urea nitrogen (P < .0001) and impairments in major metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. There was significant hypophosphorylation of AMPK substrates in CD73-LKO livers (P < .0001), while in isolated hepatocytes treated with AMP, soluble CD73 induced AMPK activation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocyte CD73 supports long-term metabolic liver homeostasis through AMPK in a sex-dependent manner. These findings have implications for human liver diseases marked by CD73 dysregulation.","Alcedo, Karel P.; Rouse, Morgan A.; Jung, Gloria S.; Fu, Dong; Minor, Marquet; Willcockson, Helen H.; Greene, Kevin G.; Snider, Natasha T.",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516905/,307

Epidemiologically it is characterized by sporadic community cases, which are amplified by hospital-based outbreaks. Healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have experienced imported cases, with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in Korea. The mortality internationally is 36% and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed. Most facilities and healthcare providers outside of the Middle East receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical management of MERS. When a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical appraisal of the literature and putative pharmacological options. We identified published literature on the management of both MERS-CoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through searches of PubMed and WHO and the US CDC websites up to 30 April 2016. A total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical appraisal. Most published literature on therapeutics for MERS are in vitro experiments, animal studies and case reports. Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized as: immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically modified animals; and antiviral agents. The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational. The therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warranting further investigation include convalescent plasma, interferon-β/ribavirin combination therapy and lopinavir.

Depending on the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, the NLRP3 inflammasome can play a crucial role during innate immunity activation. To date, studies describing the NLRP3 response during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients are lacking. We prospectively monitored caspase-1 activation levels in peripheral myeloid cells from healthy donors and patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The caspase-1 activation potential in response to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation was opposed between nonclassical monocytes and CD66b(+)CD16(dim) granulocytes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the CD66b(+)CD16(dim) granulocytes had decreased nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential associated with an increased percentage of NLRP3 inflammasome impaired immature neutrophils and a loss of eosinophils in the blood. In patients who recovered from COVID-19, nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential in CD66b(+)CD16(dim) cells was restored and the proportion of immature neutrophils was similar to control. Here, we reveal that NLRP3 inflammasome activation potential differs among myeloid cells and could be used as a biomarker of a COVID-19 patient’s evolution.

This study identified genetic networks containing major immune-checkpoint inhibitors CD27, PD1, and PDL1, and their associated prognostic genes and proliferation genes in lung cancer tumors. A 5-gene prognostic model was developed and validated in extensive cohorts to select patients at a high risk for developing metastasis. CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference screening data were used in the selection of proliferation genes. These genes were associated with chemoresponse and radiotherapy response in lung cancer cell lines and patient tumors. This immune-omics network led to the discovery of repositioning drugs for improving lung cancer treatment. ABSTRACT: To date, there are no prognostic/predictive biomarkers to select chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy in individual non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Major immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have more DNA copy number variations (CNV) than mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) NSCLC tumors. Nevertheless, CNV-mediated dysregulated gene expression in NSCLC is not well understood. Integrated CNV and transcriptional profiles in NSCLC tumors (n = 371) were analyzed using Boolean implication networks for the identification of a multi-omics CD27, PD1, and PDL1 network, containing novel prognostic genes and proliferation genes. A 5-gene (EIF2AK3, F2RL3, FOSL1, SLC25A26, and SPP1) prognostic model was developed and validated for patient stratification (p < 0.02, Kaplan–Meier analyses) in NSCLC tumors (n = 1163). A total of 13 genes (COPA, CSE1L, EIF2B3, LSM3, MCM5, PMPCB, POLR1B, POLR2F, PSMC3, PSMD11, RPL32, RPS18, and SNRPE) had a significant impact on proliferation in 100% of the NSCLC cell lines in both CRISPR-Cas9 (n = 78) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays (n = 92). Multiple identified genes were associated with chemoresponse and radiotherapy response in NSCLC cell lines (n = 117) and patient tumors (n = 966). Repurposing drugs were discovered based on this immune-omics network to improve NSCLC treatment.","Ye, Qing; Singh, Salvi; Qian, Peter R.; Guo, Nancy Lan",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13174296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503105/,307

Therefore, the pandemic has mobilized experts, industry, and governments to evaluate alternative trajectories to promote a more efficient dialogue between ST&I and public health. This article presents a critical thinking about the contemporary asymmetries in the technical and political infrastructures available for particular approaches in ST&I in health, such as precision medicine, and for public health systems worldwide, uncovering a persistent gap in the translation of knowledge and technologies to adequately coordinated responses to the pandemic. We stimulate the understanding of this process as a matter of translation between platforms of knowledge and policy rationales shaped by different institutionalized frames of organizational practices and agendas. We draw attention to the need to strengthen governance tools for the promotion of ST&I as a strategic component of the post-pandemic agenda in public health, to prepare societies to respond efficiently to future emergencies.","da Silva, Renan Gonçalves Leonel; Chammas, Roger; Novaes, Hillegonda Maria Dutilh",Health Res Policy Syst,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00760-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34289860/,307

Absent an established theoretical diffusion model, we apply machine learning to isolate, among 77 potential predictors, those that minimize the out-of-sample prediction error. We first estimate the model considering cumulative cases registered before the containment measures displayed their effects (i.e. at the peak of the epidemic in March 2020), then cases registered between the peak date and when containment measures were relaxed in early June. In the first estimate, the results highlight the dominance of factors related to the intensity and interactions of economic activities. In the second, the relevance of these variables is highly reduced, suggesting mitigation of the pandemic following the lockdown of the economy. Finally, by considering cases at onset of the “second wave”, we confirm that the territorial distribution of the epidemic is associated with economic factors.","Bloise, Francesco; Tancioni, Massimiliano",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X21000011?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954349X21000011,307

Children, although important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefits of identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. EXPOSURES: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. RESULTS: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number R(e) = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (≥81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden. These findings suggest that without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","Moghadas, Seyed M.; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Shoukat, Affan; Zhang, Kevin; Galvani, Alison P.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33890990/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.7097,307

The new virus strain designated as SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the coronavirus family. Although the current medical research directed towards the development of a novel therapeutic agent, no anti-viral drug approved until now. On the medical scale, the development of an approved drug is a time-consuming process, so research is directed towards screening of ligands and drugs multimodal structure-based-design and then docked to the main viral protease to investigate the active binding sites. The bioinformatic approaches used to evaluate the competence of a comprehensive range of ligands and drugs before their clinical implementation. In this study, a computational approach through molecular docking simulation is conducted for screening the antiviral activity of drugs, natural sources, and inhibitory compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The main virus protease was collected from a Protein Data Bank (PDB# 6YB7) and docked with a sequence of 19 approved antiviral drugs, 10 natural inhibitory ligands against COVID-19 downloaded from PubChem, in addition to 10 natural sources optimized for Escherichia coli BL(21) (DE(3)) to identify the antiviral activity of these candidates against COVID-19.

However, the long-term impact of SARS on hospital performance needs to be further discussed. METHODS: A municipal hospital in Taipei City was shut down for a month due to SARS and then became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. This study collected the outpatient, inpatient and emergency service volumes for every year from April to March over four years. Average monthly service amount ± standard deviation were used to compare patient volume for the whole hospital, as well as the outpatient numbers accessing different departments. The ARIMA model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. RESULTS: The average monthly service volume of outpatient visits for the base year 2002 was 52317 ± 4204 visits per month, and number for 2003 and the following two years were 55%, 82% and 84% of the base year respectively. The average emergency service volume was 4382 ± 356 visits per month at the base year and this became 45%, 77% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Average inpatient service volume was 8520 ± 909 inpatient days per month at the base year becoming 43%, 81% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Only the emergency service volume had recovered to the level of a non-significant difference at the second year after SARS. In addition, the departments of family medicine, metabolism and nephrology reached the 2002 patient number in 2003. The ARIMA (2,1,0) model was the most suitable for outpatient volume in pre-SARS year. The MAPE of the ARIMA (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.9%, and 43.2%, 10.6%, 6.2% for following 3 years. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that if a hospital is completely shut down due to SARS or a similar disease, the impact is longer than previous reported and different departments may experience different recover periods. The findings of this study identify subspecialties that are particularly vulnerable in an infectious disease designated hospital and such hospitals need to consider which subspecialties should be included in their medical structure.","Chu, Dachen; Chen, Ran-Chou; Ku, Chia-Yu; Chou, Pesus",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-8-228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990210/,307

OBJECTIVE: To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included “COVID-19,” “SARS-Cov-2,” and/or “novel coronavirus.” STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I(2)). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I(2) = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that that 12% of patients with COVID-19 will manifest GI symptoms; however, SAR-CoV-2 shedding was observed in 40.5% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the need to better understand what measures are needed to prevent further spread of this highly contagious pathogen.","Parasa, Sravanthi; Desai, Madhav; Thoguluva Chandrasekar, Viveksandeep; Patel, Harsh K.; Kennedy, Kevin F.; Roesch, Thomas; Spadaccini, Marco; Colombo, Matteo; Gabbiadini, Roberto; Artifon, Everson L.

RNA of the defective interfering virus was not observed in the persistently infected cells by Northern blot analysis. SARS-CoV diluted to 2 PFU failed to establish persistence, suggesting that some particular viruses in the seed virus did not induce persistent infection. Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with SARS-CoV, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Previous studies also showed that the activation of p38 MAPK by viral infection-induced apoptosis, and a weak activation of Akt was not sufficient to protect from apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that the inhibitors of JNK and PI3K/Akt inhibited the establishment of persistence, but those of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; as an inhibitor for ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK did not. These results indicated that two signaling pathways of JNK and PI3K/Akt were important for the establishment of persistence in Vero E6 cells.","Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15916886/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443905000529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443905000529,307

New roles of ARF and ARL proteins are emerging, including novel functions at the Golgi complex and in cilia formation. Their function is under tight spatial control, which is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyse GTP exchange and hydrolysis, respectively.

602851,Supporting bereavement and complicated grief in primary care: a realist review,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND: During the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Mexico implemented a national lockdown followed by post-lockdown mitigation. METHODS: We used daily number of SARS-CoV-2-confirmed hospitalizations (by date of symptom onset) to assess the changes in the incidence of individuals between the age of 10–59 years during the epidemic in Mexico. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in that age group among all cases aged 10–59y during the early lockdown period (April 20–May 3, 2020), and the corresponding proportion L(g) during the late lockdown period (May 18–31, 2020) and post-lockdown mitigation (June 15–28, 2020). For each later period (late lockdown or post-lockdown), we computed the proportion ratios relative to the early lockdown period PR(g)=L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)> PR(g2) is interpreted as a relative increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the late lockdown and post-lockdown periods vs. the early lockdown period. RESULTS: For the late lockdown period, the highest PR estimates belong to persons aged 15–19y (PR=1.69(95%CI(1.05, 2.72))) and 20–24y (PR=1.43(1.10,1.86)). For the post-lockdown period, the highest PR estimates were also in age groups 15–19y (PR=2.05(1.30, 3.24)) and 20–24y (PR=1.49(1.15,1.93)). These estimates were higher in persons 15–24y compared to those ≥30y. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adolescents and younger adults had an increased relative incidence during late lockdown and the post-lockdown mitigation periods.

Children, however, often present with milder manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Associations have been found between COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Patients with the latter condition present more severe involvement. Adults with comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more severely affected. This narrative review aimed to look into whether CKD contributed to more severe involvement in pediatric patients with COVID-19. The studies included in this review did not report severe cases or deaths, and indicated that pediatric patients with CKD and previously healthy children recovered quickly from infection. However, some patients with MIS-C required hospitalization in intensive care units and a few died, although it was not possible to correlate MIS-C and CKD. Conversely, adults with CKD reportedly had increased risk of severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 and higher death rates. The discrepancies seen between age groups may be due to immune system and renin-angiotensin system differences, with more pronounced expression of ACE2 in children. Immunosuppressant therapy has not been related with positive or negative effects in individuals with COVID-19, although current recommendations establish decreases in the dosage of some medications. To sum up with, CKD was not associated with more severe involvement in children diagnosed with COVID-19.

Street harassment describes unwanted interactions in public spaces between strangers or customers and is often motivated by a person’s gender, sexual orientation, or gender expression. To date, marketers have overlooked the occurrence of street harassment in retail establishments and consumer service domains, such as in theaters, public markets, recreational areas, and shopping malls. This work empirically demonstrates the extent to which young women in Nepal experience harassment from men in the marketplace and the various tactics they employ to lessen it. Furthermore, this research exposes the extent to which Nepali men admit to participating in verbal, physical, or visual harassment of women in various retailing and service settings. The article concludes with a discussion of theoretical, managerial, and societal implications and encourages public policy officials to treat street harassment as a criminal offense.","Rosenbaum, Mark S.; Edwards, Karen L.; Malla, Binayak; Adhikary, Jyoti Regmi; Ramírez, Germán Contreras",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698920310997; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969698920310997,307
609410,Impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease: a multi-ethnic Asian study,2020-12-14,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a wide spectrum of neurologic dysfunction that emerges weeks after the acute respiratory infection. To better understand this pathology, we prospectively analyzed of a cohort of cancer patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, including a targeted proteomics analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. We find that cancer patients with neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 harbor leptomeningeal inflammatory cytokines in the absence of viral neuroinvasion. The majority of these inflammatory mediators are driven by type II interferon and are known to induce neuronal injury in other disease states. In these patients, levels of matrix metalloproteinase-10 within the spinal fluid correlate with the degree of neurologic dysfunction. Furthermore, this neuroinflammatory process persists weeks after convalescence from acute respiratory infection. These prolonged neurologic sequelae following systemic cytokine release syndrome lead to long-term neurocognitive dysfunction. Our findings suggest a role for anti-inflammatory treatment(s) in the management of neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection.","Remsik, Jan; Wilcox, Jessica A.; Babady, N.

609751,Has COVID-19 changed the workload for primary care physicians? The case of Spain,2021-09-21,"The incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is increasing worldwide, with over three quarters of cases now diagnosed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with resource-constraints. Loco-regional recurrence remains the predominant pattern of failure mandating adequate local therapy for acceptable loco-regional control and survival. There is high-quality evidence that intensification of treatment by either by adding concurrent chemotherapy or by altering radiotherapy (RT) fractionation improves outcomes in the curative-intent management of loco-regionally advanced HNSCC. Even conservative estimates indicate that >50% of patients in LMIC are unlikely to get access to timely RT, which will only get compounded with the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. The radiation oncology community has been systematically testing altered fractionation schedules in several solid cancers (breast, lung, and head-neck), given the cost-effectiveness, convenience, and compliance to short-course RT regimens. Radiobiological modelling suggests that standard fractionation of 6–7 weeks in HNSCC can be compressed safely into a 4-week schedule to counter accelerated repopulation by increasing the dose per fraction and delivering 5 fractions per week which is currently being tested in the ongoing multicentric trial of hypo- vs normo-fractionated accelerated RT (HYPNO study). Herein, we discuss the radiobiological basis of curative-intent hypofractionated-accelerated RT schedule delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks in HNSCC followed by critical appraisal of the published literature on such regimens with concurrent systemic therapy and its inherent resource-sparing potential applicable across large parts of the world particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Tejpal; Ghosh-Laskar, Sarbani; Agarwal, Jai Prakash",Oral Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091846/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1368837520304814; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.105045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520304814,307
609753,Adapting coordinated specialty care in the post-COVID-19 era: study protocol for an integrative mixed-methods study,2021-07-05,"Since the first cases, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread around the world, with hundred−thousand cases and thousands of deaths. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of major disasters. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza, the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to promote PTSD. Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). With a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms, the evocation of SARS is generating a great anxiety contributing to promote PTSD. Quarantine of infected patients evolved to quarantine of ‘infected’ towns or popular districts, and then of entire countries. In the families of cases, the brutal death of family members involved a spread of fear and a loss of certainty, promoting PTSD. In the context of disaster medicine with a lack of human and technical resources, healthcare workers could also develop acute stress disorders, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD. Globally, WHO estimates 30–50% of the population affected by a disaster suffered from diverse psychological distress. PTSD individuals are more at-risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and deaths by suicide – considering that healthcare workers are already at-risk occupations. We draw attention towards PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, both for general population, patients, and healthcare workers. Healthcare policies need to take into account preventive strategy of PTSD, and the related risk of suicide, in forthcoming months.","Dutheil, Frédéric; Mondillon, Laurie; Navel, Valentin",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720001336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326997/,307
610337,The World Has Changed,2020-06-24,"AIM: To evaluate corneal and crystalline lens densitometry in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). METHODS: This is a case–control study. Patients with VKC and age–gender-matched healthy controls underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination with corneal and crystalline lens densitometry measurements. Additionally, the anterior chamber parameters comprise anterior and posterior K(mean) and astigmatism, anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV), anterior chamber angle (ACA), pachymeter, and corneal volume (CV). Patients who had clinically grade 0 or grade 1 VKC and with only tarsal conjunctiva involvement during the conductance of the study were included. The variables were compared statistically. RESULTS: One hundred and nine eyes were included in the study, in which fifty-one were in the VKC group. There were 25 males in the VKC group (26 female) and 22 males in the control group (36 female). A statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of posterior corneal astigmatism (p = 0.02). The mean corneal pachymeter, CV, ACD, ACA, and ACV were similar in both groups (p = 0.63, p = 0.26, p = 0.60, p = 0.41, and p = 0.32, respectively). The total mean corneal densitometry in the zones extending from 6 to 10 mm and 10 to 12 mm was increased in the VKC group compared to the control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.012, respectively). The mean crystalline lens was found to be denser in the VKC group compared to the control group (8.96 ± 1.6 vs. 8.5 ± 0.57, respectively, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Posterior corneal astigmatism is increased in VKC cases in comparison with age- and gender-matched controls. The peripheral anterior 6–12 mm annular corneal zone showed increased corneal densitometry in VKC cases compared to the healthy subjects. Additionally, the lens clarity is found to be decreased subclinically in VKC cases compared to control cases.","Yılmaz, Yusuf Cem; Ipek, Sefik Can; Ozer, Muhammet Derda",Int Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-01822-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754236/,307

The virus has also been reported of causing sensorineural hearing loss. The objective of this study was to determine the possible effect of maternal SARS-COV-2 infection on neonatal hearing as identified during universal hearing screening. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in two tertiary referral centers including all neonates born from November 2020 through April 1st, 2021 and undergoing the universal hearing screening program. Maternal Covid-19 infection was recorded (timing and severity) and the results of hearing screening of their neonates compared to the incidence of neonatal hearing loss results of the national universal screening program during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 984 neonates were included (508 males and 476 females). Sixty-three neonates were excluded due to comorbidities which could cause hearing loss. The incidence of failed responses in the community at large was 2.3%. Twenty-seven failed both steps of screening (2.9%; p < 0.2). There were 34 Covid-19 positive mothers (17 in the first trimester, 8 in the second and 9 in the third). Twenty-nine neonates failed the first screening (p < 0.00001) but on further testing only one neonate failed (2.9%). CONCLUSION: In this study, neonates born to Covid-19 positive mothers do not seem to have an increased risk of hearing loss. However longer follow-up of these neonates is mandatory to detect any possible delayed effects of the virus.","Mostafa, Badr Eldin; Mostafa, Ahmed; Fiky, Lobna M.

SETTING: Participants were recruited from a clinic in Kampala, Uganda set up for women at high risk of HIV infection. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent girls and young women engaged in sex for money and/or commodities are at particular risk in countries with high HIV prevalence and high fertility rates. High mobility increases exposure to HIV risk. Women participants were eligible for the parent study if aged 15–24 years, HIV negative and engaged in sex work. For this substudy, 34 qualitative interviews were held with 14 sex workers (6 HIV positive, 8 HIV negative), 6 health worker/policy makers, 3 peer educators, 5 ‘queen mothers’ and 6 male partners MEASURES: Participants used Google Maps to identify work venues at 12-month and 18-month study visits. We also conducted 34 interviews on mobility with: high-risk women, male partners, health workers and sex-worker managers. Topics included: distance, frequency and reasons for mobility. We used Python software to analyse mapping data. RESULTS: Interviews found in depth narratives describing lack of education and employment opportunities, violence, lack of agency, social, sexual and familial support networks and poverty as a complex web of reasons for high mobility among young sex workers. CONCLUSIONS: Young women at high risk are highly mobile. Reasons for mobility impact access and retention to health services and research activities. Strategies to improve retention in care should be cognisant and tailored to suit mobility patterns.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based online study was carried out among Polish adults in order to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reproductive plans of the Polish society. A total of 984 participants correctly completed the survey. RESULTS The pandemic has affected the reproductive intentions of 22% (n = 216) of the respondents, most of them want to have a child later than they previously planned (74.1%). The relationship between the change in reproductive intentions and the concerns about the pandemic was found. Most of those who changed their plans were afraid that the access to prenatal care and delivery services could be limited (86.6%) or were afraid about giving birth at the hospital (81%). More than half (51.9%) of those who changed reproductive plans were afraid of losing their income and 40.3% had already experienced a decrease in their income. The change in partner's emotional relationships was also observed. More than half of respondents (56.7%) admitted that during the pandemic they had developed a deeper emotional relationship with their partners or felt more emotionally supported (56.6%). Most participants responded that the frequency of their sexual intercourses was not affected (66.7%) and that they had not experienced limited access to contraceptives (95.1%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has affected Polish people's reproductive intentions.

This may be thought-provoking for healthy people, but particularly challenging for individuals with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Au fait research on reading covered faces reveals that: 1) wearing masks hampers facial affect recognition, though it leaves reliable inferring basic emotional expressions; 2) by buffering facial affect, masks lead to narrowing of emotional spectrum and dampen veridical evaluation of counterparts; 3) masks may affect perceived face attractiveness; 4) covered (either by masks or other veils) faces have a certain signal function introducing perceptual biases and prejudices; 5) reading covered faces is gender- and age-specific, being more challenging for males and more variable even in healthy aging; 6) the hampering effects of masks on social cognition occur over the globe; and 7) reading covered faces is likely to be supported by the large-scale assemblies of the neural circuits far beyond the social brain.

A Cross-Sectional Study of Telehealth Inequity in the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Urban Academic Pediatric Primary Care Clinic.,2021-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Older children have higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates than younger children. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in staff and students following the full reopening of all secondary schools in England. METHODS: Public Health England (PHE) invited secondary schools in six regions (East and West London, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire, Manchester and Birmingham) to participate in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance during the 2020/21 academic year. Participants had nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent risk factors for seropositivity and seroconversion. FINDINGS: Eighteen schools in six regions enrolled 2,209 participants, including 1,189 (53.8%) students and 1,020 (46.2%) staff. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were not significantly different between students and staff in round one (5/948; [0.53%] vs. 2/876 [0.23%]; p = 0.46) or round two (10/948 [1.05%] vs. 7/886 [0.79%]; p = 0.63), and similar to national prevalence. None of four and 7/15 (47%) sequenced strains in rounds 1 and 2 were the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. In round 1, antibody seropositivity was higher in students than staff (114/893 [12.8%] vs. 79/861 [9.2%]; p = 0.016), but similar in round 2 (117/893 [13.1%] vs.117/872 [13.3%]; p = 0.85), comparable to local community seroprevalence. Between the two rounds, 8.7% (57/652) staff and 6.6% (36/549) students seroconverted (p = 0.16). INTERPRETATION: In secondary schools, SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity and seroconversion rates were similar in staff and students, and comparable to local community rates. Ongoing surveillance will be important for monitoring the impact of new variants in educational settings.","Ladhani, Shamez N.; Ireland, Georgina; Baawuah, Frances; Beckmann, Joanne; Okike, Ifeanyichukwu O.; Ahmad, Shazaad; Garstang, Joanna; Brent, Andrew J.; Brent, Bernadette; Walker, Jemma; Aiano, Felicity; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Letley, Louise; Flood, Jessica; Jones, Samuel E.I.; Kall, Meaghan; Borrow, Ray; Linley, Ezra; Zambon, Maria; Poh, John; Lackenby, Angie; Ellis, Joanna; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Brown, Kevin E.; Ramsay, Mary E.",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386740/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100948,307

METHODS: We reviewed all available data (demographics, medical history, comorbidities, therapeutic interventions, and outcome) on our KTx with COVID-19 during the first wave (March–September 2020, n = 33) and the second wave (October 2020–February 2021, n = 149) of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two out of our 1,503 KTx in active follow-up got COVID-19 during 12-month period, corresponding to a prevalence of 12.1%. No difference was found in age, gender distribution, comorbidities, body mass index, or baseline immunosuppression between the 2 COVID-19 waves. Bilateral COVID pneumonia was more frequent during the first wave. More KTx were managed as outpatients during the second wave (15 vs. 39%, p < 0.01). Calcineurin inhibitors were more sparingly reduced during the second wave, whereas antimetabolites were similarly reduced (91 vs. 86, p = ns). Admission to intensive care units was comparable between the first (27%) and second waves (23%). During the first wave, 8 out of 9 patients (89%) requiring intensive care died, whereas the mortality of the ICU patients in the second wave was 68% (23 deaths) (p = 0.2).

Previous histopathological studies are limited to autopsy reports. We studied lung specimens from COVID-19 survivors who underwent elective lung resections to determine whether post-acute histopathological changes are present. Methods In this multicenter observational study, we included adult COVID-19 survivors (n=11) who had recovered but subsequently underwent unrelated elective lung resection for indeterminate lung nodules or lung cancer. We compared these to an age- and procedure-matched control group who never contracted COVID-19 (n=5), and an end-stage COVID-19 group (n=3). A blinded pulmonary pathologist examined the lung parenchyma focusing on four compartments: airways, alveoli, interstitium, and vasculature. Results Eleven COVID-19 survivors with asymptomatic (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=3) COVID-19 infections underwent elective lung resection at a median 68.5 days (range 24-142) after COVID-19 diagnosis. The most common operation was lobectomy (75%). On histopathological examination, no differences were identified between the lung parenchyma of COVID-19 survivors and controls across all compartments examined. Conversely, patients in the end-stage COVID-19 group showed fibrotic diffuse alveolar damage with intra-alveolar macrophages, organizing pneumonia, and focal interstitial emphysema. Conclusions In this first study to examine the lung parenchyma of COVID-19 survivors, we did not find distinct post-acute histopathological changes to suggest permanent pulmonary damage. These results are reassuring for COVID-19 survivors who recover and become asymptomatic.","Diaz, Ashley; Bujnowski, Daniel; McMullen, Phillip; Lysandrou, Maria; Ananthanarayanan, Vijayalakshmi; Husain, Aliya N.; Freeman, Richard; Vigneswaran, Wickii T.; Ferguson, Mark K.; Donington, Jessica; Madariaga, Maria Lucia; Abdelsattar, Zaid M.",Ann Thorac Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497521013072?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003497521013072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343471/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2021.06.076,307

The SAG1 virus-like particles (SAG1-VLPs) were expressed by Sf9 cells, and their expression was confirmed through cloning, RT-PCR analysis, and western blot method. The immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of SAG1-VLPs were assessed by the antibody response, cytokine analysis, neutralization activity, splenocyte assay, and survival rates through a mouse model. In particular, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA were markedly increased after immunization, and the survival rates of T. gondii were strongly inhibited by the immunized sera. Furthermore, the immunization of SAG1-VLPs effectively decreased the production of specific cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, after parasite infection. In particular, the immunized group showed strong activity and viability compared with the non-immunized infection group, and their survival rate was 75%. These results demonstrate that SAG1-VLP not only has the immunogenicity to block T. gondii infection by effectively inducing the generation of specific antibodies against T. gondii, but is also an effective antigen delivery system for preventing toxoplasmosis. This study indicates that SAG1-VLP can be effectively utilized as a promising vaccine candidate for preventing or inhibiting T. gondii infection.","Choi, Won Hyung; Park, Ji Sun",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325746/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8040091,307

This is the only way to set the right course for an economic policy of the 21st century.","Ehnst, Dirk; Paetz, Michael",Wirtschaftsdienst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746304/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10273-021-2874-9,307

However, CPFs can be inefficient or difficult to apply with diffuse initial distributions, which are common in statistical applications. We propose a simple but generally applicable auxiliary variable method, which can be used together with the CPF in order to perform efficient inference with diffuse initial distributions. The method only requires simulatable Markov transitions that are reversible with respect to the initial distribution, which can be improper. We focus in particular on random walk type transitions which are reversible with respect to a uniform initial distribution (on some domain), and autoregressive kernels for Gaussian initial distributions. We propose to use online adaptations within the methods. In the case of random walk transition, our adaptations use the estimated covariance and acceptance rate adaptation, and we detail their theoretical validity. We tested our methods with a linear Gaussian random walk model, a stochastic volatility model, and a stochastic epidemic compartment model with time-varying transmission rate. The experimental findings demonstrate that our method works reliably with little user specification and can be substantially better mixing than a direct particle Gibbs algorithm that treats initial states as parameters.

617980,Medicare APMs at a crossroads.,2021-09-01,"Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in immunity and inflammation, including antiviral actions. Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2 activating composition PB125® downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-Cov-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL1-beta, IL6, TNF-α the cell adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-γ-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the “cytokine storm” observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm.","McCord, Joe M.; Hybertson, Brooks M.; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Gao, Bifeng",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511372/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.099788,307

The pathogenesis involves interactions between bacteria, viruses, environment and management factors. Primary viral infection can increase the risk of secondary fatal bacterial infection. The objective of this study was to use metagenomic sequencing to characterize the respiratory viromes of paired nasal swabs and tracheal washes from western Canadian feedlot cattle, with or without BRD. A total of 116 cattle (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) were analysed. The presence of influenza D virus (IDV), bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV), bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was associated with BRD. Agreement between identification of viruses in nasal swabs and tracheal washes was generally weak, indicating that sampling location may affect detection of infection. This study reported several viruses for the first time in Canada and provides a basis for further studies investigating candidate viruses important to the prevention of BRD.","Zhang, Maodong; Hill, Janet E.; Fernando, Champika; Alexander, Trevor W.; Timsit, Edouard; van der Meer, Frank; Huang, Yanyun",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873724/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13172,307

Delay in diagnosis has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/μL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 0.25–2.5 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid. We evaluated 37 nasopharyngeal samples using CDC’s N3, N1 and N2 RT-real-time PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 as reference test. We found a 100 % concordance between RPA-LF and RT-qPCR reference test as determined by 18/18 positive and 19/19 negative samples. All positive samples had Ct values between 19–37 by RT-qPCR. The RPA-LF primers and probe did not cross react with other relevant betacoronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. This is the first isothermal amplification test paired with lateral flow developed for qualitative detection of COVID-19 allowing rapid viral detection and with prospective applicability in resource limited and decentralized laboratories.","Shelite, Thomas R.; Uscanga-Palomeque, Ashanti C.; Castellanos-Gonzalez, Alejandro; Melby, Peter C.; Travi, Bruno L.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609342100166X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609342100166X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224752/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114227,307

623220,Letter to the Editor: COVID-19 & Neurosurgical Training in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2020-09-23,"Accumulating evidence emphasizes the relevance of oscillatory synchrony in memory consolidation during sleep. Sleep spindles promote memory retention, especially when occurring in the depolarized upstate of slow oscillation (SO). A less studied topic is the inter-spindle synchrony, i.e. the temporal overlap and phasic coherence between spindles perceived in different electroencephalography channels. In this study, we examined how synchrony between SOs and spindles, as well as between simultaneous spindles, is associated with the retention of novel verbal metaphors. Moreover, we combined the encoding of the metaphors with respiratory phase (inhalation/exhalation) with the aim of modulating the strength of memorized items, as previous studies have shown that inhalation entrains neural activity, thereby benefiting memory in a waking condition. In the current study, 27 young adults underwent a two-night mixed-design study with a 12-h delayed memory task during both sleep and waking conditions. As expected, we found better retention over the delay containing sleep, and this outcome was strongly associated with the timing of SO–spindle coupling. However, no associations were observed regarding inter-spindle synchrony or respiratory phase. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the importance of SO–spindle coupling for memory. In contrast, the observed lack of association with inter-spindle synchrony may emphasize the local nature of spindle-related plasticity.","Halonen, Risto; Kuula, Liisa; Antila, Minea; Pesonen, Anu-Katriina",Front Behav Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531730/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.712774,307
623653,Circulation of Non-MERS Coronaviruses in Imported Camels In Saudi Arabia,2019-02-28,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed unprecedented pressure on various healthcare systems, including departments that use immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and immunosuppression therapy in organ transplantation units. The true impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on immunocompromised CAR T-cell therapy recipients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) has not yet been established. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we compare two patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in either the humoral or cell-mediated immunodeficient states. The first patient was a man in his early 30s who was diagnosed with refractory multiple myeloma. He received fully humanized, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, CAR T-cell therapy before 4 months and achieved strict complete remission. He was infected with SARS-CoV-2 starting on January 26, 2019 and gradually progressed to severe pneumonia. Throughout the clinical progression of the disease, SARS-CoV-2 could not be cleared due to his humoral immunodeficient state. During this period of his severe COVID-19 pneumonia, elevated cytotoxic T-cells were observed in this patient’s peripheral blood while elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and ferritin were observed in his cytokine profiles. This patient eventually progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome and recieved non-invasive ventilatory support. He failed to generate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and died of respiratory failure on day 33 (d33). The second patient was a 52-year-old kidney transplant recipient (KTR) who took ciclosporin after renal transplantation for more than 7 years. He confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on January 20, 2019 and gradually progressed into severe pneumonia on d16 with a slightly elevated B-cell percentage and normal T-lymphocyte subsets. Viral clearance occurred together with the generation of specific anti-immunoglobulin G-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 2 weeks of treatment. He was symptom-free and discharged from the hospital on d42. CONCLUSION: We report a CAR T-cell therapy recipient diagnosed with COVID-19 for the first time. His virus clearance failure and life-threating cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that any decision to proceed CAR T-cell therapy during COVID-19 pandemics will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Immunosuppressant treatment based on ciclosporin could be relatively safe for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.

The withdrawal of primatologists and conservation staff from field research can lead to a number of detrimental effects not just on conservation but also on local communities in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Inequalities in access to health and financial insecurities may be drivers for the illegal wildlife trade and the lack of tourism and research activity may allow poachers to work with greater ease. The paper also looks at how conservation organizations and research bodies should modify their field protocols by developing robust occupational health policies that will not only make field work safer but also support local staff as they are likely to face the greatest threats to their physical health, psychological health, and economic loss from COVID‐19.

Los pacientes en tratamiento renal sustitutivo (TRS) no han sido ajenos a esta situación y por sus características resultan especialmente vulnerables. Presentamos los resultados del análisis del Registro COVID-19 de la S.E.N. Material y métodos: EL Registro comenzó a funcionar el 18 de marzo de 2020. Recoge variables epidemiológicas, datos del contagio y diagnóstico, clínica acompañante, tratamientos y desenlace. Se trata de un registro “on line”. Los pacientes fueron diagnosticados de infección por SARS-Cov-2 en base a los resultados de la PCR del virus, realizada tanto en pacientes que habían manifestado clínica compatible o tenían signos sospechosos como en aquellos a los que se había hecho como cribado tras algún contacto conocido con otro enfermo. Resultados: A fecha 11 de abril el Registro disponía de datos de 868 pacientes, procedentes de todas las Comunidades Autónomas. La modalidad de TRS más representada es la hemodiálisis en centro (HDC) seguida de los pacientes trasplantados. La clínica de presentación es similar a la población general. Un porcentaje muy elevado (85%) requirió ingreso hospitalario, un 8% en unidades de cuidados intensivos. Los tratamientos más utilizados fueron hidroxicloroquina, lopinavir-ritonavir y esteroides. La mortalidad es elevada y alcanza el 23%: los pacientes fallecidos estaban con más frecuencia en HDC, desarrollaban más frecuentemente neumonía y recibían en menos ocasiones lopinavir-ritonavir y esteroides. La edad y la neumonía se asociaban de forma independiente al riesgo de fallecer. Conclusiones: La infección por SARS-CoV-2 afecta ya a un número importante de pacientes españoles en TRS, fundamentalmente aquellos que están en HDC, las tasas de hospitalización son muy elevadas y la mortalidad es elevada; la edad y el desarrollo de neumonía son factores asociados a mortalidad. SUMMARY The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population. Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an ""online"" registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","Emilio Sánchez-Álvarez, J.; Fontán, Miguel Pérez; Martín, Carlos Jiménez; Pelícano, Miquel Blasco; Reina, Carlos Jesús Cabezas; Prieto, Ángel M.

METHODS: We searched the database of Clalit Health Services, the largest health care organization (HCO) in Israel, for diagnoses of myocarditis in patients who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). The diagnosis of myocarditis was adjudicated by cardiologists using the case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We abstracted the presentation, clinical course, and outcome from the patient's electronic health record. We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis of the incidence of myocarditis up to 42 days after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: Among more than 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members who were 16 years of age or older, 54 cases met the criteria for myocarditis. The estimated incidence per 100,000 persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine was 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 2.70). The highest incidence of myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 to 14.46) was reported in male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years. A total of 76% of cases of myocarditis were described as mild and 22% as intermediate; 1 case was associated with cardiogenic shock. After a median follow-up of 83 days after the onset of myocarditis, 1 patient had been readmitted to the hospital, and 1 had died of an unknown cause after discharge. Of 14 patients who had left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography during admission, 10 still had such dysfunction at the time of hospital discharge. Of these patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing that revealed normal heart function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients in a large Israeli health care system who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons; the highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years. Most cases of myocarditis were mild or moderate in severity.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1–specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","alam, Intikhab; Kamau, Allan; Kulmanov, Maxat; Arold, Stefan T.; Pain, Arnab; Gojobori, Takashi; Duarte, Carlos M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895,307

Italy is a country which has been heavily affected. Cancer patients are at a higher risk owing to their intrinsic fragility related to their underlying disease and oncologic treatment. Against this backdrop, we conducted a survey to investigate how patients perceived their condition, clinical management and availability of information during the pandemic. METHODS: Between 15 April and 1 May 2020 a survey was submitted to cancer patients at oncology departments in the Marche region. Questions regarding the perception of personal safety, continuity of cancer care, information quality and psychological distress. RESULTS: Seven hundred patients participated in the survey; 59% were female and 40% were aged between 46 and 65. The majority of the participants perceived compliance with appropriate safety standards by cancer care providers and 80% were reassured about their concerns during the medical interview. 40% were worried of being at a higher risk of infection and 71% felt they were at a greater risk because of chemotherapy. 55% felt that postponing cancer treatment could reduce its efficacy, however 76% declared they did not feel abandoned at the time of treatment postponement. Patients between 46 and 65 years declared a significant reduction in sleep (p < 0.01) and in concentration (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The emergency care offered to cancer patients has been deemed satisfactory in terms of both safety standards and care management.

626694,Enhancing Healthcare Access–Smartphone Apps in Arrhythmia Screening: Viewpoint,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: The act of worshipping in mosque is often not only considered to be one of the factors causing the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but also a contributing factor to health protocol violations. Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to examine the application of the Islamic principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs (protection of life) in the practice of worshipping at the Nurul Iman mosque as it relates to the prevention of transmission of covid-19. METHODS: This research uses a sociology of law perspective to the connection and the dynamics between the adoption of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs and the implementation of worship at the Nurul Iman mosque. As a case study, the data collection technique used includes interviews, observation, documentation reviews, and triangulation techniques, while the analysis technique used content analysis techniques. RESULTS: The application of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs (protection of life) in the practices of worship at the Nurul Iman mosque have proven to be in accordance with health protocols and at the same time all members of the mosque congregation have been free from the transmission of covid-19. From an Islamic needs framework perspective, in the context of Covid-19 pandemic, the application of the ḥifẓ al-nafs principle at this mosque is a considered primary necessity (ḍarūriyyāt) in that it protects life while providing spiritual continuity of collective religious worshipping, hence integrating the community together within a health and sanctity of life paradigm during this challenging time. Equally important, this research also challenges the thesis of the direct linkage between worshipping in mosque and Covid-19 transmission. CONCLUSION: the application of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs in the practices of worship in mosque has demonstrably shown that the congragants levels of health consciousness has increased and that they have also been kept safe. In essence, the effective contextualization of Islamic principle is able to provide the twin benefits of health and spirituality.","Dahlan, Moh; Bustami, Mohammad Reevany; Makmur; Mas'ulah, Siti",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368475/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07541,307

The coronavirus pandemic has a significant impact on digitalization and customer experience and well-being in mobile commerce. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, online sales and the number of online shoppers using wireless internet-enabled devices have increased tremendously. The article develops, an experimental study that captures COVID-19 and digital commerce’s impact in terms of customers’ experience and well-being during the pandemic period. The study explores the synergy between technology evolution and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on customers’ behavior based on survey data collection and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The results reveal that, for millennials, digital commerce seems to be the typical way of shopping and paying in the pandemic period since the oldest generations adopted in a smaller proportion the use of mobile devices for shopping and payments. Besides, retailers are confronted with great challenges raised by millennials’ expectations. The result confirms four of the six hypotheses based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). As a result, it shows that the easiness of use, trust, mobility, and customer involvement influences the behavioral intention of the customer to use mobile commerce, and that usefulness and customization does not influence the behavioral intention.","Akram, Umair; Fülöp, Melinda Timea; Tiron-Tudor, Adriana; Topor, Dan Ioan; Căpușneanu, Sorinel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299984/,307

We report the results of a rapidly-implemented COVID-19 online interdisciplinary CPD webinar series. We aimed to determine if this virtual approach for large-scale CPD was relevant, appreciated, and effective for specialist physicians in Quebec. Methods and Analysis: This was a retrospective descriptive online survey-based study. The weekly virtual educational webinars took place between March 3, 2020 to June 15, 2020, resulting in a total of 26 webinars over 16 weeks. The study included all individuals who attended any of the webinar sessions, namely specialist physicians and department chiefs. Number of participants and overall appreciation of webinar sessions were data points collected. Results: Across all webinars, there were 8,500 unique specialist physicians which comprises 80.7% of the entire specialist practicing population in Quebec. Of note, every medical and surgical specialty was represented by attendance in at least one session. In total, 27,504 evaluation forms were completed out of all the sessions, meaning a 78.4% response rate. In post-webinar surveys, 97.6% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the webinars were pertinent to their practice and 94.6% agreed or strongly agreed that the presentation met their continuing professional needs. Conclusions: This novel interdisciplinary COVID-19 webinar series is a successful and appreciated strategy to maintain CPD amidst a global pandemic. One year later, it has become a mainstay in our toolbox and we trust this unique model of large-scale interdisciplinary CPD via webinar sessions is useful in normal times as well as in times of crisis.","Turkdogan, Sena; Chen, Tanya; McHugh, Tobial; Tremblay, Martin; Francoeur, Diane; Daniel, Sam J.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.728715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568386/,307
630087,Knowledge about COVID-19 and patients beliefs about and use of herbal products during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: At least two genetically different porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains have been identified in the United States (U.S. PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains). The current serological assays offered at veterinary diagnostic laboratories for detection of PEDV-specific antibody are based on the U.S. PEDV prototype strain. The objectives of this study were: 1) isolate the U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain in cell culture; 2) generate antisera against the U.S. PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains by experimentally infecting weaned pigs; 3) determine if the various PEDV serological assays could detect antibodies against the U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain and vice versa. RESULTS: A U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain was isolated in cell culture in this study. Three groups of PEDV-negative, 3-week-old pigs (five pigs per group) were inoculated orally with a U.S. PEDV prototype isolate (previously isolated in our lab), an S-INDEL-variant isolate or virus-negative culture medium. Serum samples collected at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post inoculation were evaluated by the following PEDV serological assays: 1) indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays using the prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains as indicator viruses; 2) virus neutralization (VN) tests against the prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses; 3) PEDV prototype strain whole virus based ELISA; 4) PEDV prototype strain S1-based ELISA; and 5) PEDV S-INDEL-variant strain S1-based ELISA. The positive antisera against the prototype strain reacted to and neutralized both prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses, and the positive antisera against the S-INDEL-variant strain also reacted to and neutralized both prototype and S-INDEL-variant viruses, as examined by IFA antibody assays and VN tests. Antibodies against the two PEDV strains could be detected by all three ELISAs although detection rates varied to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the antibodies against U.S. PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains cross-reacted and cross-neutralized both strains in vitro. The current serological assays based on U.S. PEDV prototype strain can detect antibodies against both U.S. PEDV strains.","Chen, Qi; Thomas, Joseph T.; Giménez-Lirola, Luis G.; Hardham, John M.; Gao, Qinshan; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Opriessnig, Tanja; Zheng, Ying; Li, Ganwu; Gauger, Phillip C.; Madson, Darin M.; Magstadt, Drew R.; Zhang, Jianqiang",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0697-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044253/,307

To date, four vaccines have already been approved by European and American authorities for preventing COVID-19 but the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistics profiles remains a pressing need. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle, a technology previously utilized for cancer vaccines. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models. Among them, COVID-eVax – a DNA plasmid encoding a secreted monomeric form of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD – induced the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses (including against the current most common variants of concern) and a robust T cell response. Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function and significantly lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In summary, this study identifies COVID-eVax as an ideal COVID-19 vaccine candidate suitable for clinical development. Accordingly, a combined phase I-II trial has recently started in Italy.","Conforti, Antonella; Marra, Emanuele; Palombo, Fabio; Roscilli, Giuseppe; Ravà, Micol; Fumagalli, Valeria; Muzi, Alessia; Maffei, Mariano; Luberto, Laura; Lione, Lucia; Salvatori, Erika; Compagnone, Mirco; Pinto, Eleonora; Pavoni, Emiliano; Bucci, Federica; Vitagliano, Grazia; Stoppoloni, Daniela; Pacello, Maria Lucrezia; Cappelletti, Manuela; Ferrara, Fabiana Fosca; D’Acunto, Emanuela; Chiarini, Valerio; Arriga, Roberto; Nyska, Abraham; Lucia, Pietro Di; Marotta, Davide; Bono, Elisa; Giustini, Leonardo; Sala, Eleonora; Perucchini, Chiara; Paterson, Jemma; Ryan, Kathryn Ann; Challis, Amy-Rose; Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Caselli, Gianfranco; Criscuolo, Elena; Clementi, Nicola; Mancini, Nicasio; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Wettstein, Lukas; Münch, Jan; Donnici, Lorena; Conti, Matteo; Francesco, Raffaele De; Kuka, Mirela; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Castilletti, Concetta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Guidotti, Luca G.; Rovati, Lucio; Iannacone, Matteo; Aurisicchio, Luigi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.14.448343,307

The aim of this study was to determine the association between acute deterioration risk, care complexity factors and unfavourable outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentre cohort study was conducted from 1 to 31 March 2020 at seven hospitals in Catalonia. All adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals and with a complete minimum data set were recruited retrospectively. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of a composite unfavourable outcome (in-hospital mortality and adverse events). The main measures included risk of acute deterioration (as measured using the VIDA early warning system) and care complexity factors. All data were obtained blinded from electronic health records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify the VIDA score and complexity factors associated with unfavourable outcomes. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1176 patients with COVID-19, 506 (43%) experienced an unfavourable outcome during hospitalisation. The frequency of unfavourable outcomes rose with increasing risk of acute deterioration as measured by the VIDA score. Risk factors independently associated with unfavourable outcomes were chronic underlying disease (OR: 1.90, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.72; p<0.001), mental status impairment (OR: 2.31, 95% CI 1.45 to 23.66; p<0.001), length of hospital stay (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.21; p<0.001) and high risk of acute deterioration (OR: 4.32, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.60; p<0.001). High-tech hospital admission was a protective factor against unfavourable outcomes (OR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89; p=0.01).

632296,A Primary Care Response to COVID‐19 for Patients with an Opioid Use Disorder,2020-04-11,"BACKGROUND: In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice. VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.","Deming, Damon; Sheahan, Timothy; Heise, Mark; Yount, Boyd; Davis, Nancy; Sims, Amy; Suthar, Mehul; Harkema, Jack; Whitmore, Alan; Pickles, Raymond; West, Ande; Donaldson, Eric; Curtis, Kristopher; Johnston, Robert; Baric, Ralph",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17194199/,307

During this study, the effect of monochromatic UV-C (λ—250 nm) radiation on transparent wood was evaluated. Samples of basswood were treated using a lignin modification method, to preserve most of the lignin, and subsequently impregnated with refractive-index-matched types of acrylic polymers (methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Optical (transmittance, colour) and mechanical (shore D hardness) properties were measured to describe the degradation process over 35 days. The transmittance of the samples was significantly decreased during the first seven days (12% EMA, 15% MMA). The average lightness of both materials decreased by 10% (EMA) and 17% (MMA), and the colour shifted towards a red and yellow area of CIE L*a*b* space coordinates. The influence of UV-C radiation on the hardness of the samples was statistically insignificant (W+MMA 84.98 ± 2.05; W+EMA 84.89 ± 2.46), therefore the hardness mainly depends on the hardness of used acrylic polymer. The obtained results can be used to assess the effect of disinfection of transparent wood surfaces with UV-C radiation (e.g., due to inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus) on the change of its aesthetic and mechanical properties.","Wachter, Igor; Štefko, Tomáš; Rantuch, Peter; Martinka, Jozef; Pastierová, Alica",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201886/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13132067,307

Recently, the notion that positive selection during epidemics or longer periods of exposure to common infectious diseases may have had a major effect in modifying the constitution of the human genome is being interrogated at a large scale in many populations around the world. This positive selection from infectious diseases increases power to detect associations in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has transformed both the management of infectious diseases and continues to enable large-scale functional characterization of host resistance/susceptibility alleles and loci; a paradigm shift from single candidate gene studies. Application of genome sequencing technologies and genomics has enabled us to interrogate the host-pathogen interface for improving human health. Human populations are constantly locked in evolutionary arms races with pathogens; therefore, identification of common infectious disease-associated genomic variants/markers is important in therapeutic, vaccine development, and screening susceptible individuals in a population. This review describes a range of host-pathogen genomic loci that have been associated with disease susceptibility and resistant patterns in the era of HTS.

For the study, questionnaires were prepared and data from 50 faculties were collected and analyzed. The study focused on the challenges of remote assessment in general and academic dishonesty in particular. The main challenges identified in remote assessment were academic dishonesty, infrastructure, coverage of learning outcomes, and commitment of students to submit assessments. To minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to each student was found to be the best approach. Online presentation was also found to be good option to control academic integrity violations. Combining various assessment methods, for instance report submission with online presentation, helps to minimize academic dishonesty since the examiner would have a chance to confirm whether the submitted work is the work of the student.","Guangul, Fiseha M.; Suhail, Adeel H.; Khalit, Muhammad I.; Khidhir, Basim A.",Educ Assess Eval Account,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101539/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11092-020-09340-w,307

The segmental myocardial T2 value of COVID‐19 patients (49.20 [46.1, 54.6] msec) was significantly higher than HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7] msec) (P < 0.001), while the myocardial native T1 value showed no significant difference between COVID‐19 patients and HC. The myocardial T2 value of serious COVID‐19 patients (52.5 [48.1, 57.1] msec) was significantly higher than unserious COVID‐19 patients (48.8 [45.9, 53.8] msec) and HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7]) (P < 0.001). COVID‐19 patients with abnormally elevated D‐dimer, C‐reactive protein, or lymphopenia showed higher myocardial T2 values than without (all P < 0.05).

The same evolutionary strategies that drive HIV-1 evolution are at play in SARS-CoV-2. Single nucleotide mutations, multi-base insertions and deletions, recombination, and variation in surface glycans all generate the variability that, guided by natural selection, enables both HIV-1’s extraordinary diversity and SARS-CoV-2’s slower pace of mutation accumulation. Even though SARS-CoV-2 diversity is more limited, recently emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants carry Spike mutations that have important phenotypic consequences, in terms of both antibody resistance and enhanced infectivity. We review and compare how these mutational patterns manifest in these two distinct viruses to provide the variability that fuels their evolution by natural selection.","Fischer, Will; Giorgi, Elena E.; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Nguyen, Kien; Bhattarcharya, Tanmoy; Theiler, James; Goloboff, Pablo A.; Yoon, Hyejin; Abfalterer, Werner; Foley, Brian T.; Tegally, Houriiyah; San, James Emmanuel; de Oliveira, Tulio; Gnanakaran, S.; Korber, Bette",Cell Host Microbe,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.05.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312821002407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242582/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821002407?v=s5,307

Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible infection pathways makes this difficult, and epidemiological contact tracing either uncertain, logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technology allows the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even down to the host-to-host scale. We review recent examples of the use of pathogen whole-genome sequencing for the purpose of forensic tracing of transmission pathways, focusing on the particular problems where evolutionary dynamics must be supplemented by epidemiological information on the most likely timing of events as well as possible transmission pathways. We also discuss potential pitfalls in the over-interpretation of these data, and highlight the manner in which a confluence of this technology with sophisticated mathematical and statistical approaches has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of infectious disease transmission and control.","Kao, Rowland R.; Haydon, Daniel T.; Lycett, Samantha J.; Murcia, Pablo R.",Trends Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X14000468; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X14000468; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661923/,307

Recent studies show upregulation of innate immuno-regulatory microRNA-146a and -155 in oral fluids of patients with type 2 diabetes as well as of patients with periodontitis. The aim was to investigate whether upregulation of these microRNAs may relate to patient susceptibility to the infection via modulation of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors expression. METHODS: Due to limited experimental feasibility and health risks in Coronavirus Disease 2019, bioinformatic analyses combining with system biology were used as initial investigation of interaction between microRNA-146 and -155 and genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors are expressed in salivary glands and masticatory mucosa (tongue) at different expression levels, comparable with those measured in lungs and tonsil. MicroRNA-146 and -155 are widely involved in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 oral cellular entry factors and may enhance expression of ACE2 and modulate genes involved in host immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes- and periodontitis-induced increase in microRNA-146a and -155 in oral cavity is predicted to upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression, essential SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, and modulate host antiviral response. As it could suggest increased infectivity of diabetes and periodontitis patients, additional protective measures for periodontists are recommended.","Roganovic, Jelena R",J Periodontol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336412/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jper.20-0623,307

Highly variable in its presentation, spread and clinical outcome, novel point-of-care diagnostic classifiers are urgently required. Here, we describe a set of COVID-19 clinical classifiers discovered using a newly designed low-cost high-throughput mass spectrometry-based platform. Introducing a new sample preparation pipeline coupled with short-gradient high-flow liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, our methodology facilitates clinical implementation and increases sample throughput and quantification precision. Providing a rapid assessment of serum or plasma samples at scale, we report 27 biomarkers that distinguish mild and severe forms of COVID-19, of which some may have potential as therapeutic targets. These proteins highlight the role of complement factors, the coagulation system, inflammation modulators as well as pro-inflammatory signalling upstream and downstream of Interleukin 6. Application of novel methodologies hence transforms proteomics from a research tool into a rapid-response, clinically actionable technology adaptable to infectious outbreaks.","Messner, C.

Digital communication platforms (DCP; e.g., Zoom) were widely used to facilitate content delivery, yet little is known about DCP's capacity or effectiveness, especially for simulation. Objective The objective was to compare the experience, outcomes, and resources required to implement a simulation-based communication skill curriculum on death notification to a cohort of learners using in-person versus DCP delivery of the same content. Methods We used the GRIEV_ING mnemonic to train students in death notification techniques either in person or utilizing a DCP. For all learners, three measures were collected: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Individual learners completed knowledge and confidence assessments pre- and postintervention. All performance assessments were completed by standardized patients (SPs) in real time. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify differences in individual and between-group performances. Results Thirty-four learners participated (N = 34), 22 in person and 12 via DCP. There was a statistically significant improvement in both groups for all three measures: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Between-group comparisons revealed a difference in pretest confidence but no differences between groups in knowledge or performance. More preparation and prior planning were required to set up the DCP environment than the in-person event. Conclusions The in-person and DCP delivery of death notification training were comparable in their ability to improve individual knowledge, confidence, and performance. Additional preparation time, training, and practice with DCPs may be required for SPs, faculty, and learners less familiar with this technology.","Hughes, Mary; Gerstner, Brett; Bona, Anna; Falvo, Lauren; Schroedle, Karen; Cooper, Dylan; Sarmiento, Elisa; Hobgood, Cherri; Ahmed, Rami; Runde, Daniel",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268463/,307

This paper quantitatively assesses the potential of government investments in eco-friendly construction projects to boost the economy and simultaneously realise environmental gains through reduced energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO(2) equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities. Finally, this paper describes how the net effect on the government budget is positive through the indirect gains of the economic uptake.","Lahcen, B.; Brusselaers, J.; Vrancken, K.; Dams, Y.; Da Silva Paes, C.; Eyckmans, J.; Rousseau, S.",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00454-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836839/,307

This study aims to investigate the self-reported physical activity (PA) and eating habits related to the consumption of Mediterranean foods in a sample of adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown enrolled into the DIMENU study. A web survey was launched for 91 adolescents (aged 15–17 years) to assess their adherence to the Mediterranean Diet using the KIDMED test and lifestyle habits using a questionnaire designed following recommendations by Italian National Institute of Health (ISS score). Our results indicate that most of the sample declared no changes in eating habits and PA without sex differences. After dividing the sample into active and sedentary groups based on the self-perceived PA, we found that KIDMED and ISS scores were significantly higher (p = 0.0028 and p = 0.0001, respectively) in active adolescents. Moreover, KIDMED was positively correlated with ISS only in active adolescents (r = 0.311, p = 0.0185). In conclusion, our data underline the impact of the PA on the Mediterranean diet adherence in adolescents during the lockdown, suggesting the usefulness of promoting wellness programs directed towards inactive individuals to increase their awareness on the importance of healthy lifestyles.","Galluccio, Angelo; Caparello, Giovanna; Avolio, Ennio; Manes, Emanuele; Ferraro, Simona; Giordano, Cinzia; Sisci, Diego; Bonofiglio, Daniela",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070999/,307

In some parts of sub‐Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions. Per excursion, individuals touched their faces an average of 125.84 ± 34.45 times and touched large tree trunks or branches (which chimpanzees might subsequently touch) an average of 230.14 ± 108.66 times. These results show that many pathways exist by which pathogens might move from humans to chimpanzees in the context of tourism. Guidelines for minimizing the risk of such transmission should consider tourist behavior and the full range of modes by which pathogen transmission might occur between tourists and chimpanzees.","Glasser, Darcey B.; Goldberg, Tony L.; Guma, Nelson; Balyesiima, Godfrey; Agaba, Hillary; Gessa, Simplicious J.; Rothman, Jessica M.",Am J Primatol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400317/,307

With the rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such assays must be able to distinguish vaccine from natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and related human coronaviruses. Here, we developed and implemented multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay strategies for COVD-19 antibody studies that incorporates spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV), enabling high throughout measurement of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We varied SARS-CoV-2 antigen compositions within the multiplex assay, allowing direct comparisons of the effects of spike protein, receptor-binding domain protein (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) based SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. Multiplex immunoassay performance characteristics are antigen-dependent, and sensitivities and specificities range 92–99% and 94–100%, respectively, for human subject samples collected as early as 7–10 days from symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD had a strong correlative relationship for the detection of IgG. Correlation between detectable IgG reactive with spike and NP also had strong relationship, however, several PCR-positive and spike IgG-positive serum samples were NP IgG-negative. This spike and NP multiplex immunoassay has the potential to be useful for differentiation between vaccination and natural infection induced antibody responses. We also assessed the induction of de novo SARS-CoV-2 IgG cross reactions with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike proteins. Furthermore, multiplex immunoassays that incorporate spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs will permit investigations into the influence of HCoV antibodies on COVID-19 clinical outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability.","Laing, Eric D.; Sterling, Spencer L.; Richard, Stephanie A.; Epsi, Nusrat J.; Coggins, Si’Ana; Samuels, Emily C.; Phogat, Shreshta; Yan, Lianying; Moreno, Nicole; Coles, Christian L.; Drew, Matthew; Mehalko, Jennifer; English, Caroline E.; Merritt, Scott; Mende, Katrin; Munster, Vincent J.; de Wit, Emmie; Chung, Kevin K.; Millar, Eugene V.; Tribble, David R.; Simons, Mark P.; Pollett, Simon D.; Agan, Brian K.; Esposito, Dominic; Lanteri, Charlotte; Clifton, G.

Notably, cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are molecules that are implicated in these quorum sensing behaviors in both settings. Bacteria coordinate their collective behavior by producing CDPs (quorum sensing inducers) that enhance the capacity of individual members of the community to detect these signals and thus amplify the community-level response.

This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Emil; Clayton, Ashley; Huh-Yoo, Jina",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180739/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24021,307

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in 31 consecutive adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. TEG with and without heparinase and anti-factor Xa analysis were performed. Standard thromboprophylaxis was given with dalteparin (75–100 IU/kg subcutaneously). RESULTS: Five patients (16%) had symptomatic thromboembolic events. All patients had a maximum amplitude (MA) > 65 mm and 13 (42%) had MA > 72 mm at some point during ICU stay. Anti-factor Xa activity were below the target range in 23% of the patients and above target range in 46% of patients. There was no significant correlation between dalteparin dose and anti-factor Xa activity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have hypercoagulability with high MA on TEG. The effect of LMWH on thromboembolic disease, anti-factor Xa activity and TEG was variable and could not be reliably predicted. This indicates that standard prophylactic doses of LMWH may be insufficient. Monitoring coagulation and the LMWH effect is important in patients with COVID-19 but interpreting the results in relation to risk of thromboembolic disease poses difficulties.","Stattin, K.; Lipcsey, M.; Andersson, H.; Pontén, E.; Bülow Anderberg, S.; Gradin, A.; Larsson, A.; Lubenow, N.; von Seth, M.; Rubertsson, S.; Hultström, M.; Frithiof, R.",J Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920503/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944120306766; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.08.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120306766?v=s5,307

As a means of preventing burnout among future practitioners, school psychology training programs are frequently encouraged to teach and model self-care to students. This is particularly important as the current generation of graduate students experience high levels of anxiety and depression, but there have been very few examples in the research literature of how training programs should teach self-care and whether it is actually effective. The current study presents results from an exploratory case study, which integrated self-care instruction into graduate school psychology curriculum with a small sample (N = 22) of first-year school psychology students across two separate cohorts. Students created written plans with self-care strategies that they attempted to implement over the course of their first semester in graduate school. A qualitative review of their plans and written reflections revealed that students described many sources of stress upon entry into training, and most needed to revise their strategies for coping as stresses changed during the semester. Overall, student reflections revealed that the self-care activities were helpful to meet the demands of their graduate education.","Daly, Bradford D.; Gardner, Rachel A.",Contemp Sch Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133766/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40688-020-00328-3,307

Such outbreaks increase economic and infection control burdens. We studied the infection control influence of MERS-CoV using a hospital-based analysis. METHODS: Our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of MERS-CoV between April 1, 2013, and June 3, 2013. The study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves, surgical masks, N95 respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap, as well as hand hygiene compliance rates. RESULTS: During the study, the use of personal protective equipment during MERS-CoV compared with theperiod before MERS-CoV increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P<.0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient-days (P <.0000001) for N95 masks. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount (P<.0000001). Hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 73% just before the occurrence of the first MERS case to 88% during MERS cases (P = .0001). The monthly added cost was $16,400 for included infection control items. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks, respirators, soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

Several typical characteristics are present in this infection, in particular pneumonia with possible lung failure, but atypical clinical presentations are being described daily by physicians around the world. Ground-glass opacities with pneumonia are the most common and dangerous presentations of the COVID-19 disease, and they are usually associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to the general population, hospital workers have been at a greater risk of infection ever since the first patients were hospitalized. However, hospital workers have also been reported as having COVID-like symptoms despite repeated negative swab tests but having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with serological tests. We can postulate that a COVID-like syndrome is possible, in particular in hospital workers, that is characterized by symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs. These repeated negative NSPs make the difference in daily clinical management with people that experienced a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab; furthermore, a clear clinical differentiation of these situations is still lacking in the literature. For this reason, here, we report our main findings from a cohort of patients with a COVID-like syndrome compared to a similar group affected by typical COVID-19.","Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Camporese, Giuseppe; Russo, Vincenzo; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Imbalzano, Egidio; Tufano, Antonella; Bernardi, Enrico; Fontanella, Andrea",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200168/,307

On the other hand, research groups around the world are still studying novel drug prophylaxis and treatment using repurposing approaches, as well as vaccination options, which are in different pre-clinical and clinical testing phases. This systematic review evaluated 1,228 articles from the PubMed and Scopus indexing databases, following the Kitchenham bibliographic searching protocol, with the aim to list drug candidates, potentially approved to be used as new options for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis clinical trials and medical protocols. In searching protocol, we used the following keywords: “Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2” or “Coronavirus or 2019 nCoV,” “prophylaxis,” “prophylactic,” “pre-exposure,” “COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 Chemoprophylaxis,” “repurposed,” “strategies,” “clinical,” “trials,” “anti-SARS-CoV-2,” “anti-covid-19,” “Antiviral,” “Therapy prevention in vitro,” in cells “and” human testing.

In a KRS, semantic structures or statements about the world of interest to medicine are analogous to natural language sentences seen as formed from noun phrases separated by verbs, prepositions and other descriptions of relationships. A convenient method of testing and better curating these elements of knowledge is by having the computer use them to take the test of a multiple choice medical licensing examination.

654610,Pain Assessment Tool With Electrodermal Activity for Postoperative Patients: Method Validation Study,2021-05-05,"Certain disulfide bonds present in leucocyte membrane proteins are labile and can be reduced in inflammation. This can cause structural changes that result in downstream functional effects, for example, in integrin activation. Recent studies have shown that a wide range of membrane proteins have labile disulfide bonds including CD132, the common gamma chain of the receptors for several cytokines including interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 (IL-2 and IL-4). The Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond in mouse CD132 is susceptible to reduction by enzymes such as thioredoxin (TRX), gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase and protein disulfide isomerase, which are commonly secreted during immune activation. The Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond is also reduced in an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute model of inflammation. Conditions that lead to the reduction of the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond in CD132 inhibit proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell clone and concomitant inhibition of the STAT-5 signalling pathway. The same reducing conditions had no effect on the proliferation of an IL-2-independent T cell clone, nor did they reduce disulfide bonds in IL-2 itself. We postulate that reduction of the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide in CD132 inhibits IL-2 binding to the receptor complex. Published data show that the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond is exposed at the surface of CD132 and in close contact with IL-2 and IL-4 in their respective receptor complexes. In addition, mutants in these Cys residues in human CD132 lead to immunodeficiency and loss of IL-2 binding. These results have wider implications for the regulation of cytokine receptors in general, as their activity can be modulated by a ‘redox regulator’ mechanism caused by the changes in the redox environment that occur during inflammation and activation of the immune system.","Metcalfe, Clive; Cresswell, Peter; Barclay, A.

Objective: To assess the characteristics of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. Data sources: Articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza indexed in PubMed (Medline) during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Study selection: Any article published in the respective study periods that included any terminology related to COVID-19 or H1N1 in the title, abstract or full-text was eligible for inclusion. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two operators conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. The article is reported following STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of primary and secondary articles. Prevalence of reporting of limitations in the abstracts. Results: Of the 2482 articles retrieved, 1165 were included. Approximately half of them were secondary articles (575, 49.4%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The second largest category was guidelines or guidance articles, including 193 articles (32.7%), of which 169 were indications for specific departments, patients or procedures. Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations. In a similar timeframe in 2009 there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic. As compared to that pandemic, during COVID-19 there were higher chances to publish reviews and guidance articles and lower chances to publish in vitro and animal research studies. Conclusions and Relevance: As compared to the most recent pandemic, there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. However, the majority of the articles published do not add significant information, possibly diluting the original information published. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.","Di Girolamo, Nicola; Meursinge Reynders, Reint",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073130; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073130v1?rss=1,307

The pandemic is likely to trigger permanent long-term impacts on the transport sector in the post-COVID world. While a post-COVID “new normal” will be likely to incur negative consequences, it may provide an opportunity to move toward a more sustainable transport sector. This paper is aimed at developing an urban economic model with an energy focus to depict the dynamics of travel demand, energy consumption, and emissions in the post-COVID world. A set of scenarios was created according to model assumptions regarding lifestyle changes and policy interventions accompanied by the expected post-COVID new normal, to explore long-term pathways toward a deep decarbonization of the transport sector. Scenario simulations demonstrated that working from home, online shopping, and a bike-friendly infrastructure will contribute to a reduction in energy consumption and CO(2) emissions, whereas a significant shift from bus to car transport and the decreasing use of car-sharing services will adversely affect CO(2) emission reductions. The arrival of the post-COVID world may contribute to an 11% reduction in CO(2) emissions by 2060, while the maximum reduction potential could be as high as 44%. Supporting policies and strategies for encouraging remote work and online shopping as well as for promoting safe public transport, active transport, and carpooling services are needed to strongly decarbonize the transport sector in the post-COVID world. Moreover, population distribution and urban structure may also be influenced by the arrival of the post-COVID new normal, which warrant further attention for urban planning.","Zhang, Runsen; Zhang, Junyi",Transp Policy (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092939/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21001621?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.05.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X21001621,307

Rotavirus replication intermediates cleaved by Csy4 is edited through the formation of precise deletions in the targeted genome segments in a single replication cycle. Using CRISPR-Csy4-mediated editing of rotavirus genome, we label the products of rotavirus secondary transcription made by newly assembled viral particles during rotavirus replication, demonstrating that this step largely contributes to the overall production of viral proteins. We anticipate that the nuclease-mediated cleavage of dsRNA virus genomes will promote an advanced level of understanding of viral replication and host-pathogen interactions, also offering opportunities to develop therapeutics.","Papa, Guido; Venditti, Luca; Braga, Luca; Schneider, Edoardo; Giacca, Mauro; Petris, Gianluca; Burrone, Oscar R.",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720311943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997981/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720311943; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108205,307

660508,Patients’ experiences of pharmacists in general practice: an exploratory qualitative study,2021-03-05,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes a papain-like protease (PLpro) with both deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities that are proposed to counteract the post-translational modification of signaling molecules that activate the innate immune response. Here we examine the structural basis for PLpro's ubiquitin chain and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) specificity. We present the X-ray crystal structure of PLpro in complex with ubiquitin-aldehyde and model the interaction of PLpro with other ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 substrates. We show that PLpro greatly prefers K48- to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and ISG15-based substrates to those that are mono-ubiquitinated. We propose that PLpro's higher affinity for K48-linked ubiquitin chains and ISG15 stems from a bivalent mechanism of binding, where two ubiquitin-like domains prefer to bind in the palm domain of PLpro with the most distal ubiquitin domain interacting with a “ridge” region of the thumb domain. Mutagenesis of residues within this ridge region revealed that these mutants retain viral protease activity and the ability to catalyze hydrolysis of mono-ubiquitin. However, a select number of these mutants have a significantly reduced ability to hydrolyze the substrate ISG15-AMC, or be inhibited by K48-linked diubuiquitin. For these latter residues, we found that PLpro antagonism of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NFκB) signaling pathway is abrogated. This identification of key and unique sites in PLpro required for recognition and processing of diubiquitin and ISG15 versus mono-ubiquitin and protease activity provides new insight into ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 recognition and highlights a role for PLpro DUB and deISGylase activity in antagonism of the innate immune response.","Ratia, Kiira; Kilianski, Andrew; Baez-Santos, Yahira M.; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854014/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004113,307

Using three measures of SES, the socioeconomic ranking of localities, individual income, and individual education, Politzer and colleagues estimate welfare loss due to higher mortality, productivity loss due to poorer health, excess health care treatment costs, and excess disability payments for individuals with below median SES relative to those with above median SES. They find the economic costs of health disparities are substantial, adding up to between 1.1 and 3.1 billion USD annually—between 0.7 and 1.6% of Israel’s GDP. This paper is useful and informative. It is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive quantification of the economic costs stemming from health disparities in Israel. In spite of many social policies designed to level economic opportunity and social welfare generally, by most measures, Israel is among the most unequal in the distribution of income among all OECD countries (Cornfeld and Danieli, Isr Econ Rev 12:51–95, 2015). Politzer and colleagues expose the magnitude and sources of health-related loss that Israel faces because of such inequality and shows how the costs of inequality are borne to some degree by all members of society. This short commentary discusses the complicated relationship between SES and health and puts the findings from Politzer and colleagues in the context of the international literature on the subject.","Donahoe, J.

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy who received tocilizumab in seven centers across Poland. We assessed on-treatment changes in clinical status and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included (19 male), with a mean age of 61.7 ± 12.4 years. The mean time from symptom onset to the first tocilizumab dose was 10.5 ± 5.7 days. Clinical status improved within 24 hours in 11 (39%) patients, within one week in 23 (82%) patients, and within two weeks in 25 (89%); one (4%) patient showed no change and two (7%) patients died. Sixteen patients (57%) no longer needed oxygen therapy within a week (p < 0.001). The serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.001).

661984,"Over-the-counter medicines, economic conditions, and citizens most in need in Greece: Is it a challenge for primary care research?",2020-07-28,"Fasting in the Islamic month of Ramadan is obligatory for all sane, healthy adult Muslims. The length of the day varies significantly in temperate regions—typically lasting ≥ 18 h during peak summer in the UK. The synodic nature of the Islamic calendar means that Ramadan migrates across all four seasons over an approximately 33-year cycle. Despite valid exemptions, there is an intense desire to fast during this month, even among those who are considered to be at high risk, including many individuals with diabetes mellitus. In this review we explore the current scientific and clinical evidence on fasting in patients with diabetes mellitus, focussing on type 2 diabetes mellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with brief reviews on pregnancy, pancreatic diabetes, bariatric surgery, the elderly population and current practice guidelines. We also make recommendations on the management of diabetes patients during the month of Ramadan. Many patients admit to a do-it-yourself approach to diabetes mellitus management during Ramadan, largely due to an under-appreciation of the risks and implications of the rigors of fasting on their health. Part of the issue may also lie with a healthcare professional’s perceived inability to grasp the religious sensitivities of Muslims in relation to disease management. Thus, the pre-Ramadan assessment is crucial to ensure a safe Ramadan experience. Diabetes patients can be risk-stratified from low, medium to high or very high risk during the pre-Ramadan assessment and counselled accordingly. Those who are assessed to be at high to very high risk are advised not to fast. The current COVID-19 pandemic upgrades those in the high-risk category to very high risk; hence a significant number of diabetes patients may fall under the penumbra of the ‘not to fast’ advisory. We recognize that fasting is a personal choice and if a person chooses to fast despite advice to the contrary, he/she should be adequately supported and monitored closely during Ramadan and for a brief period thereafter. Current advancements in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring technologies are useful adjuncts to strategies for supporting type 1 diabetes patients considered to be high risk as well as ‘high-risk’ type 2 patients manage their diabetes during Ramadan. Although there is a lack of formal trial data, there is sufficient evidence across the different classes of therapeutic hypoglycaemic agents in terms of safety and efficacy to enable informed decision-making and provide a breadth of therapeutic options for the patient and the healthcare professional, even if the professional advice is to abstain. Thus, Ramadan provides an excellent opportunity for patient engagement to discuss important aspects of management, to improve control in the short term during Ramadan and to help the observants understand that the metabolic gains achieved during Ramadan are also sustainable in the other months of the year by maintaining a dietary and behavioural discipline. The application of this understanding can potentially prevent long-term complications.

Moreover, not only the underlying NAFLD may influence the progression of COVID-19, but the COVID-19 may affect the clinical course of NAFLD as well. However, comprehensive evidence on clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD is not well characterized. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and meta-analysis the evidence on clinical outcomes in NAFLD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were searched from inception through November 2020. Epidemiological studies assessing the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with NAFLD were included. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess study quality. Generic inverse variance method using RevMan was used to determine the pooled estimates using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Fourteen studies consisting of 1851 NAFLD patients, were included. Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies, and studies were of moderate to high quality [mean, (range):8 (6, 8)]. For NAFLD patients, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the severe COVID-19 was 2.60 (95%CI:2.24–3.02; p < 0.001) (studies,n:8), aOR for admission to ICD due to COVID-19 was 1.66 (95%CI:1.26–2.20; p < 0.001) (studies,n:2), and aOR for mortality for was 1.01 (95%CI:0.65–1.58; p = 0.96) (studies,n:2). CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and admission to ICU due to COVID-19 with no difference in mortality was observed between NAFLD and non-NAFLD patients.

OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011–2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.","Cebey-López, Miriam; Herberg, Jethro; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Martinón-Torres, Nazareth; Salas, Antonio; Martinón-Sánchez, José María; Justicia, Antonio; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Sumner, Edward; Fink, Colin; Martinón-Torres, Federico",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096199/,307

The low level of knowledge and negative attitudes toward COVID-19 among HCWs can lead to inappropriate responding, wrong diagnoses, and poor practices for prevention. This research aims to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 prevention and factors influencing the practices among HCWs in Daklak province, Vietnam. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 963 HCWs working at district health centers and commune health stations through an online survey. RESULTS: Overall, HCWs have good knowledge (91.3%), a positive attitude (71.5%), and appropriate practice (83.1%) regarding COVID-19 prevention. There was 89.6% of HCWs facing difficulties in practicing preventive measures such as felt difficult to change their habits (56.4%), insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40.0%), and inconvenience to practice preventive measures (14.4%). The factors associated with implementing good practices are age group, residence, and knowledge about COVID-19.

668818,106 Self-Reported Sleep and Resilience,2021-05-03,"Abstract The etiologic basis for the vast majority of cases of congenital heart disease remains largely undefined. Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.","Overall, James C.",American Heart Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4361535/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002870372900774; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002870372900774,307

The peptide is derived from the SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein positions 362–370 (SNP(362–370)). It is conserved in all known isolates of SARS‐CoV and has been verified by in vitro peptide‐binding studies to be a good to intermediate binder to HLA‐A*0301 and HLA‐A*1101, with IC(50) values of 70 and 186 nM, respectively [Sylvester‐Hvid et al.

In terms of the residues lining the peptide‐binding groove, the HLA‐A*1101–SNP(362–370) complex is very similar to other known structures of HLA‐­A*1101 and HLA‐A*6801. The SNP(362–370) peptide is held in place by 17 hydrogen bonds to the α‐chain residues and by nine water molecules which are also tightly bound in the peptide‐binding groove.

The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications. SUBJECT AND METHOD: SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” “antivirals,” “therapy”), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide.

670180,How to evaluate digital leadership: a cross-sectional study,2021-10-01,"Background: Due to its high infectivity and concealment, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that occurred in Wuhan attracted global attention. A special nursing group of transdisciplinary nurses (TNs) who had not worked in respiratory medicine, infection departments, or emergency and intensive medicine but who accounted for a large proportion of all nurses also drew our attention. Few studies have examined this special group of TNs. Therefore, this study collected the experiences and views of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak to investigate their potential problems. Results: Twenty-five TNs and 19 nurses with experience in infectious diseases (non-TNs) were enrolled in the study. Compared with non-TNs, TNs showed higher levels of perceived stress and relatively less perceived social support. For TNs, the ambiguous roles, transition of operating mode, unfamiliar work content, and reversal of their daily schedule were the most common vocational problems. Additionally, most TNs had psychological problems such as anxiety, pain and insomnia. The incomprehension of parents, concern for family members and long-term isolation were the most common causes of psychological stress. Conclusion: This survey is the first to focus on the group of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate their experiences, vocational issues and psychological stresses qualitatively and quantificationally. We found that TNs had more perceived stress and less perceived social support than non-TNs. The vocational and psychological issues of TNs should be highlighted. These findings identify important issues and offer insights into the underlying issues to help TNs ultimately win the battle against novel coronavirus epidemics. Methods: Semi-structured and face-to-face individual interviews and quantitative assessments were conducted. The Braun Clarke Thematic Analysis method and the strategy outlined by Miles and Huberman were used in the data analysis process of the qualitative study. The perceived stress scale and perceived social support scale were utilized to quantificationally evaluate the perceived stress level and the amount of perceived social support. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted to assess the vocational and psychological perceptions and issues.","Fan, Jing; Hu, Kaihui; Li, Xueqin; Jiang, Ying; Zhou, Xiang; Gou, Xin; Li, Xinyuan",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620713/,307
670238,Clinical impact of COVID-19 on people with substance use disorders,2020-10-26,"One of the many sources of information easily available to children is the internet and the millions of websites providing accurate, and sometimes inaccurate, information. In the current investigation, we examined children’s ability to use credibility information about websites when learning about environmental sustainability. In two studies, children studied two different websites and were tested on what they had learned a week later using a multiple-choice test containing both website items and new distracters. Children were given either no information about the websites or were told that one of the websites (the noncredible website) contained errors and they should not use any information from that website to answer the test. In both studies, children aged 7- to 9-years reported information from the noncredible website even when instructed not to, whereas the 10- to 12-year-olds used the credibility warning to ‘edit out’ information that they had learned from the noncredible website. In Study 2, there was an indication that the older children spontaneously assessed the credibility of the website if credibility markers were made explicit. A plausible explanation is that, although children remembered information from the websites, they needed explicit instruction to bind the website content with the relevant source (the individual websites). The results have implications for children’s learning in an open-access, digital age where information comes from many sources, credible and noncredible. Education in credibility evaluation may enable children to be critical consumers of information thereby resisting misinformation provided through public sources.","Roberts, Kim P.; Wood, Katherine R.; Wylie, Breanne E.",Cogn Res Princ Implic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050824/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-021-00305-1,307

The virus primarily affects the lungs where it induces respiratory distress syndrome ranging from mild to acute, however, there is a growing body of evidence supporting its negative effects on other system organs that also carry the ACE2 receptor, such as the placenta. The majority of newborns delivered from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers test negative following delivery, suggesting that there are protective mechanisms within the placenta. There appears to be a higher incidence of pregnancy-related complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, such as miscarriage, restricted fetal growth, or still-birth.

Consistent with general framework of adaptation, the advantages of exercise training are indiscriminate—benefitting even the most susceptible clinical populations. Still, the benefit of exercise training presupposes healthy adaptation wherein progressive overload matches sufficient recovery. Indeed, a difference exists between healthy adaptation and non-functional over-reaching (ie, when internal/external load exceeds recovery capacity)—a difference that may be blurred by cancer treatment and/or comorbidity. Recent advances in smartwatches make them ideally suited to non-invasively monitor the physiological stresses to exercise training. Resolving whether individuals are successfully adapting to exercise training via load monitoring bears clinical and practical relevance. While behaviour-change research aims to identify positive constructs of exercise adherence, further attention is needed to uncover how to optimise exercise prescription among cancer populations. Herein, we briefly discuss the constituents of exercise load monitoring, present examples of internal and external load and consider how such practices can be applied to cancer populations.","Carter, Stephen J; Baranauskas, Marissa N; Ballinger, Tarah J; Rogers, Laura Q; Miller, Kathy D; Nabhan, Dustin C",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540269/,307

METHODS: The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used to evaluate telehealth physical therapy implementation. Patient-level data were extracted from electronic medical records between the dates of March 16 and May 16, 2020 (implementation phase). Reach was defined as the proportion of physical therapy sessions completed via telehealth. Effectiveness was assessed using a patient-reported satisfaction survey with a 5-point Likert scale. Adoption was defined as the proportion of physical therapists who used telehealth. Implementation was assessed through qualitative analysis of patient and clinician perspectives to identify emergent themes, retrospectively classify strategies used during the implementation phase, and prospectively identify evidence-based strategies to increase telehealth maintenance and scale-up. Maintenance of telehealth was defined as the proportion of patients who indicated they would attend another telehealth session. RESULTS: There were 4548 physical therapy sessions provided by 40 therapists from date to date, of which 3883 (85%) were telehealth. Ninety-four percent of patients were satisfied. All physical therapists (100%) used telehealth technology at least once. Retrospectively classified and prospectively identified evidence-based strategies were organized into five qualitative themes that supported implementation: organizational factors (policies, pre-existing partnerships), engaging external stakeholders (satisfaction survey), champions (clinician leaders), clinician education (dynamic, ongoing training), and process (promote adaptability, small tests of change). Ninety-two percent of patients reported they would attend another telehealth session. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that implementation of telehealth physical therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was feasible and acceptable in this setting. IMPACT: These results can be used to guide future health policy, quality improvement, and implementation science initiatives to expand the use and study of telehealth for physical therapy.","Miller, Matthew J; Pak, Sang S; Keller, Daniel R; Barnes, Deborah E",Phys Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284318/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa193,307

A Cross-Sectional Survey among U.S. Adults in May-June 2020,2021-07-14,"Virus mutations have the potential to impact the accuracy of diagnostic tests. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage is defined by a large number of mutations in the spike gene and four in the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Most commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid tests (Ag-RDTs) target the viral N-protein, encoded by the N-gene. We conducted a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of three SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that are currently under review by the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure (Espline - Fujirebio Inc.; Sure Status - Premier Medical Corporation Private Limited; Mologic - Mologic Ltd.) and report here on an additional sub-analysis regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage. During the study, in Berlin and Heidelberg, Germany, from 20 January to 15 April 2021, B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage at the testing sites and was detected in 220 (62%) of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients. All three Ag-RDTs yielded comparable sensitivities irrespective of an infection with the B.1.1.7 lineage or not. There is only limited data on how N-gene mutations in variants of concern may impact Ag-RDTs. Currently, no major changes to test performance are anticipated. However, test developers and health authorities should assess and monitor the impact of emerging variants on the accuracy of Ag-RDTs.","Lindner, A. K.; KruÌger, L. J.; Nikolai, O.; Klein, J. A.

671943,Baduanjin exercise can alleviate anxiety and depression of patients with COVID-19 in Square cabin hospital: A cross-sectional survey,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The impact of different classes of microbial pathogens on mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia is not well elucidated. Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30–151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are common organisms isolated in severe community-acquired pneumonia. Mixed viral-bacterial infections may be associated with an increased risk of mortality.","Quah, Jessica; Jiang, Boran; Tan, Poh Choo; Siau, Chuin; Tan, Thean Yen",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3366-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180811/,307

The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). Assignment of the isolated virus to MRV-3 was confirmed by type-specific RT-PCR assays, targeting the S1 gene, and by subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product. By phylogeny based on the S1 gene of several MRVs, the isolate fell into lineage E, along with the murine strain T3C9/61 and the bovine strains T3C18/61 and T3C31/59. Conversely, L1 sequences were found to segregate regardless of the viral type. A total of 110 fecal samples, 56 nasal and 31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were tested by a nested-PCR assay specific for reoviruses, and no sample was found to contain MRV RNA, a finding that is apparently in contrast with the seroprevalence (25.77%) observed in dogs.","Decaro, Nicola; Campolo, Marco; Desario, Costantina; Ricci, Dominga; Camero, Michele; Lorusso, Eleonora; Elia, Gabriella; Lavazza, Antonio; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15964158/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113505001781; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113505001781,307

The key steps of virus life cycle have been recently clarified, highlighting the role of host type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 serine protease in virus‐cell binding and entry, respectively. Importantly, major concerns derive from the androgen‐dependent tissue‐expression of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2, suggesting a differential clinical course of the infection between genders. In agreement with this model, available epidemiological data show that the disease in males has an higher risk to display an heavier pattern and associates with both an increased access to critical care unit and higher mortality rate. In this opinion article, available evidence linking the androgen activity with the gender differences observed in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are discussed, hypothesizing possible therapeutic approaches in male based on the disruption of androgen signaling. On these bases, gender‐specific recommendations for the management of male patients affected by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are warmly suggested, in order to improve the clinical course of the disease.","De Toni, Luca; Garolla, Andrea; Di Nisio, Andrea; Rocca, Maria Santa; Foresta, Carlo",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452644/,307

Authorities increased the number of tests performed, including the identification of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgA, and IgM). There was an overflooding of the market with several tests, and the presence of possible false-positive results became a challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the seroprevalence and immunoglobulin blood levels in a group of asymptomatic individuals using the reference levels provided by the manufacturer. METHODS: Levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were determined in blood serum by the same ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. Patients must be free of symptoms. RESULTS: From 20 to 22 May 2020, 938 individuals were tested. There were 441 (47%) men, age 53 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 39-63.2). The sample included 335 (35.7%) subjects aged ≥60 years old. Subjects with a positive test were 54 (5.8%) for IgG and 96 (10.2%) for IgA and 42 (4.5%) for both IgG and IgA. The prevalence of IgG and IgA positive test was not different in men and women and not different in individuals under 60 and over 60 years of age. Conversely, analysing only individuals with positive tests, the levels of IgG in positive subjects were significantly higher than those with an IgA positive test, 3.00 (IQR = 1.68-5.65), and 1.95 (IQR = 1.40-3.38), respectively; P = 0.017. Additionally, individuals with isolated IgA positive tests had significantly lower levels of IgA than those with both IgA and IgG positive tests: 1.95 (IQR = 1.60-2.40) and 3.15 (IQR = 2.20-3.90), respectively, P = 0.005. These latter data suggest that IgA shows a deviation of the distribution to the left in comparison to IgG distribution data. Indeed, many subjects reported as IgA positive had immunoglobulin levels slightly elevated. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we strongly suggest caution in the interpretation of IgA test results. This recommendation is more important for those with positive IgA just above the reference level.","Caramelli, Bruno; Escalante-Rojas, Maria C; Chauhan, Hiteshi K C; Siciliano, Rinaldo F; Bittencourt, Marcio S; Micelli, Antonio C",Journal of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604032/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.05001,307

Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study using secondary data retrieved from the electronic information system of a Baby-Friendly Hospital in the municipality of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Data was retrieved for all hospitalizations at the obstetric center between January 1st 2017 and December 31st 2020. Data on COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the municipal government website. Annual and monthly cesarean prevalence rates were calculated in comparison to the same periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Differences in prevalence rates were tested using a chi-square test, taking a significance level of less than 5%. Prevalence ratios were estimated for 2018/2017, 2019/2018, and 2020/2019. Results: 7,294 childbirths were included. Cesarean prevalence was 42.6% in 2017, 44.3% in 2018, 40.2% in 2019, and 51.0% in 2020. In 2018/2017, there was no statistically significant difference in cesarean prevalence (95%CI: 0.90-1.20). Between 2019/2018, there was a reduction of approximately 20% in prevalence (95%CI: 0.69-0.93). The scenario changes between 2020/2019 with a 40% increase in cesareans (95%CI: 1.20-1.62). The period comprising July to December 2020 was the only period in which over half the deliveries were done by cesarean section, exceeding 60% in July.

In the absence of any specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19., the role of efficient testing and reporting has been uncontested so far as the number of cases is rising daily. In order to strengthen the screening activities and to prevent nosocomial infection, facility-based screening centres have been designed and operated at various level of healthcare, including tertiary care institutions. Methods: The present study has been planned with an objective to understand the patient profile and evaluate the functioning of COVID-19 screening OPD(CS-OPD) at a tertiary care hospital. In this hospital-based retrospective study, data from individuals visiting the COVID-19 screening OPD during the period from 17th March 2020 to 31st July 2020 were collected. We documented and analysed relevant demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients. Results: A total of 10,735 patients visited the COVID-19 screening OPD during the defined study period out of which 3652 individuals were tested. Majority of the patients, i.e. 65.67% (7050) were male and in 15-59 years age group (84.68%). Most common symptoms among patients visiting CS-OPD was Cough (9.86%). Out of the total, 17.17% (1843) of patient reported to the CS-OPD with contact history of COVID-19 positive patient. On the other hand, 13.49% (1448) of patients were with either domestic or international travel history. The overall testing rate and positivity rate for CS-OPD during this period were found to be 34.02% and 7.94% respectively. Conclusion: The clinical, demographic and epidemiological characteristics of patients visiting CS-OPD varied across the study period depending upon the containment and testing strategy. The CS-OPD played a crucial role in preventing nosocomial infection and maintaining non-COVID care at the tertiary care hospital.

The analysis focuses on cumulated COVID-19 mortality at the sub-regional level, following the territorial subdivision of countries adopted by the European Union. The paper builds upon a dataset with highly granular information on COVID-19 deaths assembled from various sources. The analysis shows remarkable differences in territorial patterns of COVID-19 mortality, both within and across the four countries reviewed. Results somewhat differ depending on the aspect considered (concentration of deaths or mortality rates) but, in general, Italy, France and Spain display significant territorial disparities, with selected sub-regions being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Instead, the picture is more uniform in the UK, with comparatively lower differences across the various sub-regions.

678587,Assessing the Impact of Patient-Facing Mobile Health Technology on Patient Outcomes: Retrospective Observational Cohort Study,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: : Since the beginning of the pandemic, Covid-19 has been regarded as an exceptional disease. Control measures have exclusively focused on “the virus”, failing to account for other biological and social factors that determine severe forms of the disease. AIM: : We argue that if it is understandable that Covid-19 was initially considered a form of exceptionalism, justifying extraordinary response measures, this situation has changed – and so should our response. MAIN ARGUMENTS: : We now know that Covid-19 shares many features of common infectious respiratory diseases, and better understand that SARS-CoV-2 has not invented new problems out of the blue. Instead, it has unveiled and exacerbated existing problems in health systems and underlying population health. Of course, Covid-19 is not an extra-terrestrial disease. It is a complex zoonotic disease, and it needs to be managed as such, following long proven principles of medicine and public health. CONCLUSION: : A complex disease cannot be solved through a simple, magic bullet cure or vaccine. The heterogeneity of population profiles susceptible to develop a severe form of Covid-19 suggests adopting varying, targeted measures, enabled to reach risk profiles in an appropriate way. The critical role of comorbidities in disease severity calls for complementing short-term virus-targeted interventions with medium-term policies aimed at reducing the burden of comorbidities, as well as mitigating the risk of “transition” from infection to disease. Complementary strategies are needed including upstream prevention, early treatment, and the consolidation of the health system.","Paul, Elisabeth; Brown, Garrett W.; Dechamps, Mélanie; Kalk, Andreas; Laterre, Pierre-François; Rentier, Bernard; Ridde, Valéry; Zizi, Martin",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.07.051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221006093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221006093?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325044/,307

However, clinical trials targeting IL-17A in uveitis were not successful. Here, we report that Th17 cells were regulated by their own signature cytokine, IL-17A. Loss of IL-17A in autopathogenic Th17 cells did not reduce their pathogenicity and instead elevated their expression of the Th17 cytokines GM-CSF and IL-17F. Mechanistic in vitro studies revealed a Th17 cell-intrinsic autocrine loop triggered by binding of IL-17A to its receptor, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and induction of IL-24, which repressed the Th17 cytokine program. In vivo, IL-24 treatment ameliorated Th17-induced EAU, whereas silencing of IL-24 in Th17 cells enhanced disease. This regulatory pathway also operated in human Th17 cells. Thus, IL-17A limits pathogenicity of Th17 cells by inducing IL-24. These findings may explain the disappointing therapeutic effect of targeting IL-17A in uveitis.","Chong, Wai Po; Mattapallil, Mary J.; Raychaudhuri, Kumarkrishna; Bing, So Jin; Wu, Sihan; Zhong, Yajie; Wang, WeiWei; Chen, Zilin; Silver, Phyllis B.; Jittayasothorn, Yingyos; Chan, Chi-Chao; Chen, Jun; Horai, Reiko; Caspi, Rachel R.",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320302776; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320302776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673565/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.06.022,307

A systematic review of SBRT was conducted for previously untreated HNCs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medline (PubMed), excerpta medica database, and Cochrane Library databases were queried from inception until July 2020. Comparative outcome data were extracted where available up to 5 years. Results from random-effect models were presented in forest plots, with between-study heterogeneity evaluated by I(2) statistics and Q-tests. RESULTS: Nine studies met inclusion criteria, representing 157 patients. Local control rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were as follows: 90.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.6%-95.6%), 81.8% (67.2%-90.7%), and 73.5% (40.4%-90.5%), respectively. Overall survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 75.9% (75.1%-76.6%), 61.1% (60.3%-61.9%), and 50.0% (48.8%-51.4%), respectively. Late grade 3 to 4 toxicity rate was 3.3% (0.2%-10.2%), and late grade 5 toxicity rate was 0.1% (0.0%-1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT for de novo HNC is safe and effective in providing locoregional control, with acceptable toxicities in most subsites.

Each VHI item was answered twice in a row; the first answer referred to the condition of not wearing a facemask (henceforth, the Without condition) and the second to the condition of using a facemask (henceforth, the With condition). VHI scores were collected via Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, California), targeting 2 groups of speakers of different nationalities, Portuguese (n = 261) and Spanish (n = 297). A Wilcoxon test was carried out to compare VHI scores between With and Without conditions for each group of speakers; a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups within each condition. Results suggested that VHI overall scores and scores for all dimensions were higher for the With condition, for both Portuguese and Spanish speakers. When comparing groups of speakers, Spanish speakers presented higher scores for functional and emotional dimensions, for both With and Without conditions. In addition, the overall score for the Without condition was higher for Spanish speakers. No differences between groups were found for the total VHI score for the With condition. When comparing overall VHI(diff) between speakers, that is, the difference in the VHI total score between With and Without conditions, no significant differences could be found. Thus, a multiple regression analysis was carried out between the VHI(diff) and the independent variables of interest: age, sex, smoking habits, professional occupation, nationality, facemask type and its hours of use. The resulting model providing the highest association suggested that 2.5% of the variation in overall VHI(diff) total score could be associated with sex, smoking habits, and professional level. Female smokers who use their voices during prolonged hours at work (e.g., teachers, lawyers, sales people) presented a higher VHI total score when wearing a mask. Future voice-related health interventions should address preventive strategies towards speaking behaviors leading to vocal fatigue and vocal effort as a consequence of compulsory facemask use, especially with respect to female professional voice users who smoke.","Polo, Nuria; Lã, Filipa M.B.",J Voice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199721002642; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199721002642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465480/,307

A post hoc analysis of data published in the preliminary report of the RECOVERY study was performed to calculate the person-based number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) of 6 mg dexamethasone once daily for up to 10 days vs. usual care with respect to mortality. At day 28, the NNT of dexamethasone vs. usual care was 36.0 (95%CI 24.9–65.1, p < 0.05) in all patients, 8.3 (95%CI 6.0–13.1, p < 0.05) in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, and 34.6 (95%CI 22.1–79.0, p < 0.05) in patients receiving oxygen only (with or without noninvasive ventilation). Dexamethasone increased mortality compared with usual care in patients not requiring oxygen supplementation, leading to a NNH value of 26.7 (95%CI 18.1–50.9, p < 0.05). NNT of dexamethasone vs. usual care was 17.3 (95%CI 14.9–20.6) in subjects <70 years, 27.0 (95%CI 18.5–49.8) in men, and 16.2 (95%CI 13.2–20.8) in patients in which the onset of symptoms was >7 days. Dexamethasone is effective in male subjects < 70 years that require invasive mechanical ventilation experiencing symptoms from >7 days and those patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation; it should be avoided in patients not requiring respiratory support.","Calzetta, Luigino; Aiello, Marina; Frizzelli, Annalisa; Rogliani, Paola; Chetta, Alfredo",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920093/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10081607,307
679960,Handwashing and risk of respiratory infections: a quantitative systematic review,2006-03-07,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has disrupted lives around the world. Autistic adults are at higher risk for co‐occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and may be more prone to difficulties adapting to pandemic‐related changes and social distancing mandates and coping with ongoing uncertainties. On the other hand, the pandemic may lead to greater understanding and acceptance of accommodations in the broader community that may facilitate supports for autistic adults beyond the pandemic. To learn more about their early pandemic experiences, online surveys were sent to independent adults enrolled in the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK). The first survey was open from March 30 to April 19, 2020; a follow‐up survey sent to original responders was open from May 27 to June 6, yielding 396 participants with data for both surveys. We found that adults who were female, younger, had prior diagnoses of a mental health condition, personal COVID‐19 experience (i.e., knowing someone who had symptoms or tested positive) or less frequent hope for the future reported the greatest negative impacts. Decrease in feelings of hopefulness over time predicted greater psychological distress at T2, accounting for T1 impact and distress levels and increases in total COVID‐19 impact. Less perceived benefit of online services also predicted later distress. Although there tends to be a focus on coping with negative effects of the pandemic, mental health providers may consider approaches that focus on positives, such as fostering hope and understanding factors that facilitate benefit from online services. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic adults may be at risk for psychological distress during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The current study suggests that autistic adults who were younger, female, had a mental health diagnosis before the pandemic and knew someone who showed symptoms or tested positive for COVID‐19 reported more areas negatively impacted by COVID‐19 and greater difficulty coping with those effects. Decreases in hope over time were associated with greater psychological distress. Less perceived benefit from online services also predicted distress 2 months later. These results suggest important areas to further explore as we develop supports for autistic adults during the pandemic.","Bal, Vanessa H.; Wilkinson, Ellen; White, L. Casey; Law, J.

680528,Technology-Enabled and Artificial Intelligence Support for Pre-Visit Planning in Ambulatory Care: Findings From an Environmental Scan,2021,"BACKGROUND: One requisite of quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is to normalise the data with an internal reference gene that is invariant regardless of treatment, such as virus infection. Several studies have found variability in the expression of commonly used housekeeping genes, such as beta-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), under different experimental settings. However, ACTB and GAPDH remain widely used in the studies of host gene response to virus infections, including influenza viruses. To date no detailed study has been described that compares the suitability of commonly used housekeeping genes in influenza virus infections. The present study evaluated several commonly used housekeeping genes [ACTB, GAPDH, 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide (ATP5B) and ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9) (ATP5G1)] to identify the most stably expressed gene in human, pig, chicken and duck cells infected with a range of influenza A virus subtypes. RESULTS: The relative expression stability of commonly used housekeeping genes were determined in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), pig tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs), and chicken and duck primary lung-derived cells infected with five influenza A virus subtypes. Analysis of qRT-PCR data from virus and mock infected cells using NormFinder and BestKeeper software programmes found that 18S rRNA was the most stable gene in HBECs, PTECs and avian lung cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the presented data from cell culture models (HBECs, PTECs, chicken and duck lung cells) infected with a range of influenza viruses, we found that 18S rRNA is the most stable reference gene for normalising qRT-PCR data. Expression levels of the other housekeeping genes evaluated in this study (including ACTB and GPADH) were highly affected by influenza virus infection and hence are not reliable as reference genes for RNA normalisation.","Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Tellabati, Meenu; Nelli, Rahul K; White, Gavin A; Perez, Belinda Baquero; Sebastian, Sujith; Slomka, Marek J; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Dunham, Stephen P; Chang, Kin-Chow",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23043930/,307

Here we report that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 9 (PARP9), a member of PARP family, serves as a non-canonical sensor for RNA virus to initiate and amplify type I interferon (IFN) production. We find knockdown or deletion of PARP9 in human or mouse dendritic cells and macrophages inhibits type I IFN production in response to double strand RNA stimulation or RNA virus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient for PARP9 show enhanced susceptibility to infections with RNA viruses because of the impaired type I IFN production. Mechanistically, we show that PARP9 recognizes and binds viral RNA, with resultant recruitment and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT3 pathway, independent of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS). PI3K/AKT3 then activates the IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylating IRF3 at Ser385 and IRF7 at Ser437/438 mediating type I IFN production. Together, we reveal a critical role for PARP9 as a non-canonical RNA sensor that depends on the PI3K/AKT3 pathway to produce type I IFN. These findings may have important clinical implications in controlling viral infections and viral-induced diseases by targeting PARP9.","Xing, Junji; Zhang, Ao; Du, Yong; Fang, Mingli; Minze, Laurie J.; Liu, Yong-Jun; Li, Xian Chang; Zhang, Zhiqiang",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976210/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23003-4,307

Since outbreak management is essential to disease control, we aimed to examine university students' knowledge of and attitudes toward the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and vaccination and other preventive measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 first year university students at Yeditepe University in Istanbul, Turkey between 1(st )and 30(th )of November 2009. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics of the students, perceptions, level of knowledge and attitudes toward influenza pandemic and prevention measures were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by the students affiliated with SANITAS, a university club of students in health related sciences. RESULTS: 25.1% (101/402) of the study group perceived their personal risk of influenza as ""high"", while 40.5% (163/402) perceived it as ""moderate"", 20.6% (107/402) viewed it as ""low"" and 7.7% (31/402) indicated that it was ""unknown"". The risk perception of males was significantly lower than that of females (p = 0.004) and the risk perception among the students of health sciences was significantly lower than that of students of other sciences (p = 0.037). Within the study group, 72.1% (290/402) indicated that their main information source regarding H1N1 was the mass media. Health sciences students tended to rely more on the internet as an information source than other students (p = 0.015). The vast majority (92.8%; 373/402) of those interviewed indicated that they would not be vaccinated. The major concerns regarding vaccination had to do with the safety and side effects of the vaccine. Most of the participants (343/402, 85.3%) were carrying out one of prevention measures and the vast majority believed that hand washing, face mask and quarantina were effective measures for prevention. CONCLUSION: The participants had enough knowledge about H1N1 pandemic about the disease although there were still gaps and confusions in some areas. In the future, when planning management strategies regarding pandemics or outbreaks in higher education institutions, new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines. Main information source is mass media, so it seems that new policies must be developed to attract attention of students to use different and more scientific-based information sources.","Akan, Hulya; Gurol, Yesim; Izbirak, Guldal; Ozdatlı, Sukran; Yilmaz, Gulden; Vitrinel, Ayca; Hayran, Osman",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626872/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-413,307

688015,Risks of COVID-19 by occupation in NHS workers in England,2021-08-29,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to produce high infection rates, significant morbidity and mortality among older adults. A significant proportion of people who have recovered from acute COVID-19 illness seem to suffer from post COVID-19 syndrome. Post COVID-19 syndrome is thought to be a multisystem disease involving physical, functional, mental and psychological domains. This analysis tries to estimate the prevalence, pattern and functional outcomes of post COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalized older adults. Methods A prospective cohort study was done on 279 older adults who were discharged from our centre between August 1st, 2020 and November 30th 2020. Information was collected through a telephonic interview after 90 days of discharge from the hospital using a standard questionnaire by a trained physician. Collected data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results After 90 days of recovery, the most common symptoms prevalent in the study population were fatigue (8.9%) followed by cough (4.3%), breathlessness (1.8%), dizziness (1.4%), myalgia (1.1%), loss of smell and taste (0.8%) and chest discomfort (0.7%). The prevalence of risk of anxiety in the study population after 90 days of recovery was 7.5% while that of risk of depression was 12.2%. After 90 days of recovery, 66 (23.6%) patients reported the presence of at least one clinical feature while 9.3% had two or more clinical features. On comparing the mean activities of daily living (ADL) 5.58 (.795) and mean instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 5.84 (1.49) before the illness and 90 days following recovery there was no statistical difference for the study population. Conclusion The prevalence of post COVID-19 syndrome in older adults is about 9.3%. The most common symptoms reported by older adults after 90 days following recovery were fatigue followed by cough and breathlessness. Most older adults retained their baseline functional status after 90 days of recovery from acute COVID-19.","P., Sathyamurthy; Madhavan, Sudha; Pandurangan, Viswanathan",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422503/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17189,307

This study aims to extensively describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with HF who were admitted to ICU with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis for all adult patients with HF and an objectively confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs between March 1 and August 31, 2020, in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 723 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were admitted into ICUs during the study period: 59 patients with HF and 664 patients with no HF before admission to ICU. Patients with HF had statistically significant more comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, higher baseline severity scores (APACHE II & SOFA score) and nutritional risk (NUTRIC score) were observed in HF patients. Overall, patients with HF had more in-hospital and ICU deaths in comparison to patients without HF: (64.3% vs. 44.6%, P-value <0.01) and (54.5% vs. 39%, P-value = 0.02), respectively. Patients with HF had a similar incidence of thrombosis, ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay compared to patients with no HF. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with HF had more in-hospital and ICU deaths than patients with no HF. Thus, history of HF could be used to help direct case management during hospitalization and possibly dictate proactive COVID-19 care.","Saleh, Khalid Bin; Hafiz, Awattif; Alsulaiman, Khalid; Aljuhani, Ohoud; Alharbi, Shmeylan; Alharbi, Aisha; Vishwakarma, Ramesh; Albekairy, Abdulkareem; Alkathiri, Abdulmalik; Alanazi, Faisal; Almujarri, Ghada; Alobathani, Seba; Alharbi, Yazeed; Zowawi, Hosam M.; Badreldin, Hisham A.",Am Heart J Plus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34308397/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666602221000318?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahjo.2021.100033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666602221000318,307

This method can be adapted to the analyses of other viral membrane fusion.","Wang, Jianqi; Kondo, Naoyuki; Long, Yufei; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Matsuda, Zene",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.06.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003000; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559731/,307
689146,COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional survey from a MERS-CoV experienced nation,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Follow-up studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are scarcely reported. METHODS: We studied 142 hospitalized KTR for a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9 (8-11) months who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 during May 2020 to Dec 2020. The outcomes were to assess persistent symptoms post-discharge; EuroQoL visual analogue score (EQ-VAS); EuroQoL 5-dimension score (E5-QD-5L) score and modified medical research dyspnea score (mMRC) at 1 month, 3-month, and beyond 6 months. Graft outcome was also analyzed. RESULTS: The age of the cohort was 43 (34-69) years and COVID-19 severity ranged from asymptomatic (4%), mild (50%), moderate (35%) to severe (12%). The most common persistent symptom was fatigue which significantly decreased in the follow-up (n = 45 [32.3] vs. 10 [7.4] vs. 4 [2.9]; p-value = 0.001) at 1-month, 3-month, and beyond 6 months respectively. Decrement in the mean (standard deviation) EQ-VAS score from baseline was also improved (28.6 [13] vs. 10.4 [12.5] vs. 7.5 [12.0]; p-value = 0.012). There was significant improvement in all EQ-5D-5L scores in follow-up. There was no deterioration in mMRC scores during the follow-up (n = 4, 3% vs. 7, 5% vs. 3, 2%; p-value = 0.86). Cases requiring oxygen had significantly poorer overall scores initially, but there was no difference at 6 months. All 10 graft losses had oxygen requirement and chronic graft dysfunction at baseline. CONCLUSION: Our initial assessment reports significant improvement in the quality of life in follow-up. The majority recovered from allograft dysfunction. Further research is warranted to study the full spectrum of follow-up.","Chauhan, Sanshriti; Meshram, Hari Shankar; Kute, Vivek; Patel, Himanshu; Desai, Sudeep; Dave, Ruchir",Transpl Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547156/,307
689881,"A Clinician-Led, Experience-Based Co-Design Approach for Developing mHealth Services to Support the Patient Self-management of Chronic Conditions: Development Study and Design Case",2021-07-20,"Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with chronic inflammation in the brain and periphery giving rise to a continuous imbalance of immune processes. Next to inflammation markers, activation of transposable elements, including long intrespersed nuclear elements (LINE) elements and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), has been identified during neurodegenerative disease progression and even correlated with the clinical severity of the disease. ERVs are remnants of viral infections in the human genome acquired during evolution. Upon activation, they produce transcripts and the phylogenetically youngest ones are still able to produce viral-like particles. In addition, ERVs can bind transcription factors and modulate immune response. Being between own and foreign, ERVs are reviewed in the context of viral infections of the central nervous system, in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, this review tests the hypothesis that viral infection may be a trigger at the onset of neuroinflammation and that ERVs sustain the inflammatory imbalance by summarizing existing data of neurodegenerative diseases associated with viruses and/or ERVs.","Römer, Christine",Front Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.648629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776642/,307
690607,Safeguarding from COVID-19: educating healthcare workers about the available protective equipment,2021-04-25,"Naturally occurring allosteric protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","Quijano-Rubio, Alfredo; Yeh, Hsien-Wei; Park, Jooyoung; Lee, Hansol; Langan, Robert A.; Boyken, Scott E.; Lajoie, Marc J.; Cao, Longxing; Chow, Cameron M.; Miranda, Marcos C.; Wi, Jimin; Hong, Hyo Jeong; Stewart, Lance; Oh, Byung-Ha; Baker, David",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743576/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.206946,307
