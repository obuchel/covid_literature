1871,Timing and causes of death in septic shock,2015-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Most studies about septic shock report a crude mortality rate that neither distinguishes between early and late deaths nor addresses the direct causes of death. We herein aimed to determine the modalities of death in septic shock. METHODS: This was a 6-year (2008–2013) monocenter retrospective study. All consecutive patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. Early and late deaths were defined as occurring within or after 3 days following ICU admission, respectively. The main cause of death in the ICU was determined from medical files. A multinomial logistic regression analysis using the status alive as the reference category was performed to identify the prognostic factors associated with early and late deaths. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 66 ± 15 years and a high proportion (67 %) of comorbidities. The in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.2 and 45 %, respectively. Deaths occurred early for 78 (32 %) and later on for 166 (68 %) patients in the ICU (n = 124) or in the hospital (n = 42). Early deaths were mainly attributable to intractable multiple organ failure related to the primary infection (82 %) and to mesenteric ischemia (6.4 %). In-ICU late deaths were directly related to end-of-life decisions in 29 % of patients and otherwise mostly related to ICU-acquired complications, including nosocomial infections (20.4 %) and mesenteric ischemia (16.6 %). Independent determinants of early death were age, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, no pathogen identification, and initial severity. Among 3-day survivors, independent risk factors for late death were age, cirrhosis, no pathogen identification, and previous corticosteroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of septic shock-related deaths. Identification of risk factors of early and late deaths may determine differential prognostic patterns.","Daviaud, Fabrice; Grimaldi, David; Dechartres, Agnès; Charpentier, Julien; Geri, Guillaume; Marin, Nathalie; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Cariou, Alain; Mira, Jean-Paul; Pène, Frédéric",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474967/,406
3308,The Differential Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine-Specific Nitrosamine Ketone on White Matter Ultrastructure,2016-09-20,"AIMS: The chronic consumption of alcohol is known to result in neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive function. Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.","Papp-Peka, A.; Tong, M.; Kril, J.J.; De La Monte, S.M.; Sutherland, G.T.",Alcohol and Alcoholism,https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article-pdf/52/2/165/25415992/agw067.pdf,406
4423,"Life Chaos is Associated with Reduced HIV Testing, Engagement in Care, and ART Adherence Among Cisgender Men and Transgender Women upon Entry into Jail",2019-08-08,"Life chaos, the perceived inability to plan for and anticipate the future, may be a barrier to the HIV care continuum for people living with HIV who experience incarceration. Between December 2012 and June 2015, we interviewed 356 adult cisgender men and transgender women living with HIV in Los Angeles County Jail. We assessed life chaos using the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) and conducted regression analyses to estimate the association between life chaos and care continuum. Forty-eight percent were diagnosed with HIV while incarcerated, 14% were engaged in care 12 months prior to incarceration, mean antiretroviral adherence was 65%, and 68% were virologically suppressed. Adjusting for sociodemographics, HIV-related stigma, and social support, higher life chaos was associated with greater likelihood of diagnosis while incarcerated, lower likelihood of engagement in care, and lower adherence. There was no statistically significant association between life chaos and virologic suppression. Identifying life chaos in criminal-justice involved populations and intervening on it may improve continuum outcomes.","Takada, Sae; Ettner, Susan L.; Harawa, Nina T.; Garland, Wendy H.; Shoptaw, Steve J.; Cunningham, William E.",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6994355/,406

6649,The Cytokine Response to Physical Activity and Training,2012-11-29,"BACKGROUND: There have been few reports on children who developed common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in association with immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2 deficiencies and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Our patient experienced nephrotic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus infection at 5 years of age. A diagnosis of IgA and IgG2 deficiency and SLE was made on the basis of severe proteinuria, hematuria, hypocomplementemia, high anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, and malar rash. However, these clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory features disappeared after the administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prednisolone. For the 5 years following the initial treatment for SLE, the patient experienced a number of infections and had a low serum total IgG level; she was eventually diagnosed with CVID. The administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was required to prevent subsequent infections, and no relapse of SLE was observed. CONCLUSION: We report the development of CVID in an IgA- and IgG2-deficient patient with SLE on the basis of multiple episodes of infection. To prevent the development of CVID in IgA- and IgG2-deficient patients with SLE, it is important to prevent immune dysregulation by the avoidance of infections through the use of IVIG therapy.","Suyama, Kazuhide; Kawasaki, Yukihiko; Abe, Yusaku; Watanabe, Masahiro; Ohara, Shinichiro; Oikawa, Tomoko; Sakai, Nobuko; Hashimoto, Kouichi; Hosoya, Mitsuaki",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101897/,406

14156,"Not yet 90-90-90: A quality improvement approach to human immunodeficiency virus viral suppression in paediatric patients in the rural Eastern Cape, South Africa",2020-10-15,"Traumatic brain injury frequently causes an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) that could lead to reduction of cerebral perfusion pressure and cause brain ischemia. Invasive ICP monitoring is recommended by international guidelines, in order to reduce the incidence of secondary brain injury; although rare, the complications related to ICP probes could be dependent on the duration of monitoring. The aim of this manuscript is to clarify the appropriate timing for removal and management of invasive ICP monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of related complications and guarantee adequate cerebral autoregulatory control. There is no universal consensus concerning the duration of invasive ICP monitoring and its related complications, although the pertinent literature seems to show that the longer is the monitoring maintenance, the higher is the risk of technical issues. Besides, upon 72 h of normal ICP values or less than 72 h if the first computed tomography scan is normal (none or minimal signs of injury) and the neurological exam is available (allowing to observe variations and possible occurrence of new-onset pathological response), the removal of invasive ICP monitoring can be justified. The availability of non-invasive monitoring systems should be considered to follow up patients’ clinical course after invasive ICP probe removal or for substituting the invasive monitoring in case of contraindication to its placement. Recently, optic nerve sheath diameter and straight sinus systolic flow velocity evaluation through ultrasound methods showed a good correlation with ICP values, demonstrating their potential role in place of invasive monitoring or in the early weaning phase from the invasive ICP monitoring.","Anania, Pasquale; Battaglini, Denise; Miller, John P.; Balestrino, Alberto; Prior, Alessandro; D’Andrea, Alessandro; Badaloni, Filippo; Pelosi, Paolo; Robba, Chiara; Zona, Gianluigi; Fiaschi, Pietro",Neurosurg Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676754/,406
14444,The Last Note,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND: Outcome prediction in critically ill patients under invasive ventilation remains extremely challenging. The driving pressure (ΔP) and the mechanical power of ventilation (MP) are associated with patient-centered outcomes like mortality and duration of ventilation. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive validity for mortality of the ΔP and the MP at 24 h after start of invasive ventilation. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of an observational study in intensive care unit patients, restricted to critically ill patients receiving invasive ventilation for at least 24 h. The two exposures of interest were the modified ΔP and the MP at 24 h after start of invasive ventilation. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality; secondary outcomes were ICU and hospital mortality. The predictive validity was measured as incremental 90-day mortality beyond that predicted by the Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. RESULTS: The analysis included 839 patients with a 90-day mortality of 42%. The median modified ΔP at 24 h was 15 [interquartile range 12 to 19] cm H(2)O; the median MP at 24 h was 206 [interquartile range 145 to 298] 10(−3) J/min/kg predicted body weight (PBW). Both parameters were associated with 90-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) for 1 cm H(2)O increase in the modified ΔP, 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.08]; P < 0.001; OR for 100 10(−3) J/min/kg PBW increase in the MP, 1.20 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.33]; P < 0.001). Area under the ROC for 90-day mortality of the modified ΔP and the MP were 0.70 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.74] and 0.69 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.73], which was neither different from that of the APACHE IV score nor that of the SAPS II. CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients under invasive ventilation, the modified ΔP and the MP at 24 h are associated with 90 day mortality. Neither the modified ΔP nor the MP at 24 h has predictive validity beyond the APACHE IV score and the SAPS II.","van Meenen, David M.

15674,Predictors of Anxiety-Induced Sleep Disturbance among in-School Adolescents in Ghana: Evidence from the 2012 Global School-Based Health Survey,2021-02-01,"The delivery of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer with intent to cure has been optimized and standardized over the last 80 years. Both preclinical and clinical work emphasized the observation that radiation destroys the tumor and exposes its components to the immune response in a mode that facilitates the induction of anti-tumor immunity or reinforces such a response. External beam photon radiation is the most prevalent in situ abolition treatment, and its use exposed the “abscopal effect”. Particle radiotherapy (PRT), which has been in various stages of research and development for 70 years, is today available for the treatment of patients in the form of alpha particles, proton, or carbon ion radiotherapy. Charged particle radiotherapy is based on the acceleration of charged species, such as protons or carbon-12, which deposit their energy in the treated tumor and have a higher relative biological effectiveness compared with photon radiation. In this review, we will bring evidence that alpha particles, proton, or carbon ion radiation can destroy tumors and activate specific anti-tumor immune responses. Radiation may also directly affect the distribution and function of immune cells such as T cells, regulatory T cells, and mononuclear phagocytes. Tumor abolition by radiation can trigger an immune response against the tumor. However, abolition alone rarely induces effective anti-tumor immunity resulting in systemic tumor rejection. Immunotherapy can complement abolition to reinforce the anti-tumor immunity to better eradicate residual local and metastatic tumor cells. Various methods and agents such as immunoadjuvants, suppressor cell inhibitors, or checkpoint inhibitors were used to manipulate the immune response in combination with radiation. This review deals with the manifestations of particle-mediated radiotherapy and its correlation with immunotherapy of cancer.","Keisari, Yona; Kelson, Itzhak",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912488/,406
15688,Nutritional Orthopedics and Space Nutrition as Two Sides of the Same Coin: A Scoping Review,2021-02-01,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Did you know that HIV may directly cause organ damage despite the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)? Due to the potency of current HAART, this may look questionable; however, excessive alcohol use may increase the risk of HIV-induced organ damage. While the most implicated organ in the gastrointestinal system is the liver, the pancreas may also be affected. In this study, we aimed to disclose the mechanisms of pancreatitis in alcohol-abusing HIV patients, which is crucial for developing an effective therapeutic strategy. From the literature, we found that alcohol-induced intracellular zymogen activation was mediated by calcium and lysosome hydrolases leading to acinar necrosis. Similarly, HIV entry into pancreatic acinar cells mediates ER and oxidative stress, which triggers acinar necrosis. Infiltration of immune cells has also been reported to induce necrosis. Therefore, effective therapeutic regimens for HIV and alcohol-induced pancreatitis should inhibit HIV entry and ameliorate alcohol’s toxic effects on the pancreas. ABSTRACT: Multiorgan failure may not be completely resolved among people living with HIV despite HAART use. Although the chances of organ dysfunction may be relatively low, alcohol may potentiate HIV-induced toxic effects in the organs of alcohol-abusing, HIV-infected individuals. The pancreas is one of the most implicated organs, which is manifested as diabetes mellitus or pancreatic cancer. Both alcohol and HIV may trigger pancreatitis, but the combined effects have not been explored. The aim of this review is to explore the literature for understanding the mechanisms of HIV and alcohol-induced pancreatotoxicity. We found that while premature alcohol-inducing zymogen activation is a known trigger of alcoholic pancreatitis, HIV entry through C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) into pancreatic acinar cells may also contribute to pancreatitis in people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV proteins induce oxidative and ER stresses, causing necrosis. Furthermore, infiltrative immune cells induce necrosis on HIV-containing acinar cells. When necrotic products interact with pancreatic stellate cells, they become activated, leading to the release of both inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and resulting in pancreatitis. Effective therapeutic strategies should block CCR5 and ameliorate alcohol’s effects on acinar cells.","New-Aaron, Moses; Ganesan, Murali; Dagur, Raghubendra Singh; Kharbanda, Kusum K.; Poluektova, Larisa Y.; Osna, Natalia A.",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913335/,406

The success of lung transplantation mainly depends on the quality and function of the implanted donor lungs, which are frequently subject to brain-death-induced lung injuries and intensive care unit (ICU)-related complications before transplantation. Recent innovations, particularly the development of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), in which donor lungs are ventilated and perfused under normothermic conditions outside the body, have allowed clinicians to more accurately assess the donor lung function prior to transplantation. Therefore, EVLP has been successfully translated into clinical practice with the expansion of the donor lung pool, leading to favorable post-transplant outcomes in a growing number of transplant centers worldwide. The EVLP system and techniques, following the Toronto protocol, have recently been applied for the assessment of extended criteria brain-death donors in clinical lung transplantation in Japan. The advancement of EVLP from organ assessment to organ treatment will be the next challenging stage not only to expand donor lung pool, but also to improve graft survival and long-term outcomes after transplantation.","Nakajima, Daisuke; Date, Hiroshi",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938286/,406

We show, using single-cell chromatin accessibility, that primary human GBMs harbor a heterogeneous self-renewing population whose diversity is captured in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In-depth characterization of chromatin accessibility in GSCs identifies three GSC states: Reactive, Constructive, and Invasive, each governed by uniquely essential transcription factors and present within GBMs in varying proportions. Orthotopic xenografts reveal that GSC states associate with survival, and identify an invasive GSC signature predictive of low patient survival, in line with the higher invasive properties of Invasive state GSCs compared to Reactive and Constructive GSCs as shown by in vitro and in vivo assays.

18172,The microeconomics of abortion: A scoping review and analysis of the economic consequences for abortion care-seekers,2021-06-09,"KEY MESSAGE: A candidate gene responsible for higher grain zinc accumulation in rice was identified, which was probably associated with a partial defect in anther dehiscence. ABSTRACT: Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral element in many organisms. Zn deficiency in humans causes various health problems; therefore, an adequate dietary Zn intake is required daily. Rice, Oryza sativa, is one of the main crops cultivated in Asian countries, and one of the breeding scopes of rice is to increase the grain Zn levels. Previously, we found that an Australian wild rice strain, O. meridionalis W1627, exhibits higher grain Zn levels than cultivated rice, O. sativa Nipponbare, and identified responsible genomic loci. An increase in grain Zn levels caused by one of the loci, qGZn9a, is associated with fertility reduction, but how this negative effect on grain productivity is regulated remains unknown. In this study, we artificially trimmed spikelets on the flowering day and found that a reduction in number of seeds was associated with an increase in the grain Zn levels. We also found that a partial defect in anther dehiscence correlated with the increase in grain Zn levels in plants carrying the W1627 chromosomal segment at qGZn9a in a Nipponbare genetic background. Among eight candidate genes in the qGZn9a region, three were absent from the corresponding region of W1627; one of these, Os09g0384900, encoding a DUF295 protein with an unknown function, was found to be specifically expressed in the developing anther, thereby suggesting that the gene may be involved in the regulation of anther dehiscence. As fertility and grain Zn levels are essential agronomic traits in rice, our results highlight the importance of balancing these two traits.

18819,Antibiotic stewardship knowledge and belief differences among healthcare professionals in hospitals: A survey study,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Cyathostomins are prevalent and pathogenic intestinal helminths of horses, causing acute and chronic disease, including acute larval cyathostominosis, which has a mortality rate of 50%. Factors determining individual susceptibility to acute larval cyathostominosis are unknown. Investigation of these factors could lead to novel treatment and prevention strategies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinicopathological and faecal microbiota changes associated with disease in individual horses in an acute larval cyathostominosis outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: The study population was a herd of 23 mixed breed horses in Ireland. The outbreak occurred in November 2018. Fourteen horses were clinically affected. Clinical status was monitored and recorded. Blood and faecal sampling allowed clinicopathological, faecal 16s rRNA gene sequencing and faecal egg count analyses. RESULTS: Two horses were euthanised, whilst 12 recovered. Common clinical signs included loose faecal consistency, weight loss and pyrexia. Consistent clinicopathological findings were borderline anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglobulinaemia and a reverse A: G ratio. Decreased alpha‐diversity of the faecal microbiota and greater relative abundance of the genus Streptococcus, class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales and family Streptococcaceae, and family Prevotelleceae was found in clinically affected horses compared to their clinically normal cohorts. An increase in obligate fibrolytic bacteria was seen in the clinically normal group compared to the clinical group. Histopathological findings of the colon and caecum revealed a severe necrotising typhlocolitis associated with cyathostomin larvae and bacterial overgrowth in the mucosa of the large intestine. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study population in this outbreak is small. There are several confounding factors limiting this to a descriptive case series. Faecal microbiota has been shown to reflect the large intestinal microbiota but do not represent changes directly. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that acute larval cyathostominosis is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota as well as the inflammatory stimulus of numerous emerging larvae leading to structural and functional pathology of the large intestine.","Walshe, Nicola; Mulcahy, Grace; Crispie, Fiona; Cabrera‐Rubio, Raul; Cotter, Paul; Jahns, Hanne; Duggan, Vivienne",Equine Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8246859/,406

Methods: A 3-year cohort study was performed on 15,928 Chinese adults without diabetes at baseline. All participants were randomly divided into a training set (n = 7,940) and a validation set (n = 7,988). XGBoost method is an effective machine learning technique used to select the most important variables from candidate variables. And we further established a stepwise model based on the predictors chosen by the XGBoost model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve and calibration analysis were used to assess discrimination, clinical use and calibration of the model, respectively. The external validation was performed on a cohort of 11,113 Japanese participants. Result: In the training and validation sets, 148 and 145 incident diabetes cases occurred. XGBoost methods selected the 10 most important variables from 15 candidate variables. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI) and age were the top 3 important variables. And we further established a stepwise model and a prediction nomogram. The AUCs of the stepwise model were 0.933 and 0.910 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a perfect fit between the predicted diabetes risk and the observed diabetes risk (p = 0.068 for the training set, p = 0.165 for the validation set). Decision curve analysis presented the clinical use of the stepwise model and there was a wide range of alternative threshold probability spectrum. And there were almost no the interactions between these predictors (most P-values for interaction >0.05). Furthermore, the AUC for the external validation set was 0.830, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the external validation set showed no statistically significant difference between the predicted diabetes risk and observed diabetes risk (P = 0.824).

Antibody responses are also an important immune correlate of protection for the clinical evaluation of WNV vaccines. However, little direct study has been carried out on the characteristics of the human antibody response to natural WNV infection. Preliminary evidence suggests that there are important differences in the way humans and experimental animals mount humoral responses to WNV. In humans, IgM is remarkably persistent in the serum and specific IgG is slow to appear. In addition, mapping of the IgG response to the functionally relevant E-protein suggests that it directed away from critical protective epitopes and towards weakly neutralizing immunodominant epitopes. These findings have important implications for vaccine design and testing.","Throsby, Mark; Goudsmit, Jaap; Kruif, John de",West Nile Encephalitis Virus Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120614/,406

28104,TOC,2018-02-03,"In low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), community health workers (CHWs) are often seen as a connecting bridge between two dynamic and overlapping systems- the community and formal health systems. Although the importance of CHWs is acknowledged, there is minimal aggregated evidence contributing towards understanding their position, technological capabilities, barriers and facilitators of their effectiveness in the South African context. Despite the widespread enthusiasm around the potential that mobile health (mHealth) technology holds in extending healthcare through CHW to underserved communities, an understanding of mHealth’s various implications in a developing world context is imperative to appreciate both the community and health systems context. The CHWs within this context need to assume multiple roles as they work and live amongst and in the community. The study argues that by examining their multiple roles as part of the healthcare continuum and from within the community setting, appropriating technological solutions can be conceptualized to facilitate and enhance their impact and visibility. This research article then aims to articulate the key conceptual factors which should be considered when implementing technological solutions for CHWs within the South African context. The aim is operationalized by means of the best-fit framework synthesis method to explore the body of knowledge towards presenting a conceptual understanding through a categorization of Factors Influencing Community Health Workers from a Socio-Technical Systems Perspective.","Ratshidi, Lilies; Grobbelaar, Sara; Botha, Adele","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134222/,406

These profiles may cover various aspects of the data represented in the dataset as well as statistical descriptors of the data distribution. In this work, we focus on the characteristic sets profile feature summarizing the characteristic sets contained in an RDF graph. As this type of feature provides detailed information on both the structure and semantics of RDF graphs, they can be very beneficial in query optimization. However, in decentralized query processing, computing them is challenging as it is difficult and/or costly to access and process all datasets. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the concept of a profile feature estimation. We present sampling methods and projection functions to generate estimations which aim to be as similar as possible to the original characteristic sets profile feature. In our evaluation, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed methods on four RDF graphs. Our results show that samples containing [Formula: see text] of the entities in the graph allow for good estimations and may be used by downstream tasks such as query plan optimization in decentralized querying.","Heling, Lars; Acosta, Maribel",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250620/,406
33533,Do No Harm: Plastics are playing a major role in giving healthcare professionals the tools and capabilities they need to battle the COVID pandemic,2020-05-06,"Regarding the risk of antibiotic therapy during pregnancy, any medication given to the mother should be according to the indications due to the risk of possible side effects. Antibiotics are one of the most important groups of these medications to be considered. Along with direct antibiotic-induced side effects, indirect pathways also affect the fetus through the maternal changes. According to the data, different cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are involved in both term and preterm parturition. These cytokines could trigger expression of different substances such as prostaglandins (PGs), their receptors, and PGs synthetizing molecules with already proven roles in parturition. Moreover, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α knocked﻿-out mice have delayed parturition and lower levels of PGs compared to the wild types. The earlier﻿-mentioned cytokines are able to induce matrix metalloproteinases and are also involved in parturition. Certain antibiotics have been shown capable of inducing inflammation cascade directly. Both in﻿-vivo and in﻿-vitro studies in human have also demonstrated this inflammation as elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines especially IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. This increase has been observed both in the presence and the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, antibiotics can induce endotoxemia in healthy cases which finally leads to the pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Regarding the role of mentioned pro-inflammatory cytokines in both term and preterm parturition, it seems that non-indicated use of antibiotics during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm labor.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Anvari Aliabad, Roghayeh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261809/,406

Existing works frequently involve black-box application of generative models, e.g. sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, this approach is inefficient at targeting specific error types as well as increases training costs. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that this fine-grained approach offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors while being competitive or better at other errors. MACER offers a training time speedup of [Formula: see text] over TRACER and [Formula: see text] over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of [Formula: see text] over both.","Chhatbar, Darshak; Ahmed, Umair Z.; Kar, Purushottam",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334193/,406

40651,Psychosocial Factors and Chronic Illness as Predictors for Anxiety and Depression in Adolescence,2020-09-18,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in many parts of the world has posed serious concerns to the public health. During this period of crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminds all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control measures. The WHO has also asked the public to be careful while reading and spreading health recommendations from untrustworthy online sources of information. Myths and misbeliefs about the prevention and spread of COVID-19 not only create global panic but also pose risks to people's lives and public health in general. Rampant misinformation on the disease slows down the efforts of public health bodies to contain the outbreak. Therefore, the role of public health bodies in communicating the right message and in the right form to the public is crucial. In our study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of communication strategies used by international and national public health authorities to inform the public on COVID-19 risks and prevention. In particular, we conduct a survey experiment on a large sample (N = 4000) of adults from seven European countries to test the efficacy of public health messages in a form of prevention and corrective information provision. The study seeks to investigate how people's risk perceptions and behaviors change subject to the preventive information provision or treatment with the information countering widely spread misperceptions about the COVID-19 as compared to the control group. The findings of this research will be relevant for policymakers and public health professionals in the development of effective communication strategies during disease outbreaks. KEY MESSAGES: Risk perceptions towards COVID-19 and their determinants across European countries are unknown. Unclear effectiveness of public health messages in a form of prevention and corrective information provision.","Sabat, I; Varghese, N E; Neuman-Böhme, S; Barros, P P; Brouwer, W; van Exel, J; Schreyögg, J; Stargardt, T",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543440/,406

In Italy and other European and non-European countries, the phenomenon is growing. Young people who suffer from cyberbullying develop psychopathological symptoms of anxiety, depression, and social phobia that can lead to extreme acts, such as suicide. The pressure, the sense of isolation, and helplessness experienced by cyber-victims also affect their family and the school context. Cyberbullying is acted through digital tools, it is often anonymous, and aims to destroy and psychologically humiliate the victim. There are various forms of cyberbullying that involve different reactions and consequences. However, few studies have focused on adolescents’ perception of cyberbullying. Youths often engage in aggressive behaviors, ignoring the feelings and reactions of the victims. Based on these considerations, our article aims to provide a general overview of the spread of the phenomenon and to understand the various types of cyberbullying and its consequences on victims. We will also illustrate a brief evaluation conducted in Italian schools investigating the perception of cyberbullying in a sample of 600 Italian adolescents (11–14 years old). Our work aims to investigate the cognition and the personal perception of youths about cyberbullying and its consequences and to promote educational interventions within and outside the context of school.","Saladino, Valeria; Eleuteri, Stefano; Verrastro, Valeria; Petruccelli, Filippo",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7723823/,406

The ICP is associated with increased rates of preterm birth, neonatal unit admission and stillbirth. This is the result of acute fetal asphyxia as opposed to a chronic uteroplacental insufficiency. Reliable monitoring or predictive tools (e.g. cardiotocography (CTG) or ultrasound) that help to prevent advers events are yet to be explored. Medicinal treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) does not demonstrably reduce adverse perinatal outcomes but does improve pruritus and liver function test results.

It is known that periods of stress and psychological distress can affect women’s menstrual cycles. We, therefore, performed an observational study of women’s reproductive health over the course of the pandemic. Materials & Methods: An anonymous digital survey was shared by the authors via social media in September 2020. All women of reproductive age were invited to complete the survey. Results: 1031 women completed the survey. The mean age was 36.7 ± 6.6 years. 693/70% reported recording their cycles using an app or diary. 233/23% were using hormonal contraception. 441/46% reported a change in their menstrual cycle since the beginning of the pandemic. 483/53% reported worsening premenstrual symptoms, 100/18% reported new menorrhagia (p=0.003) and 173/30% new dysmenorrhea (p<0.0001) compared to before the pandemic. 72/9% reported missed periods who not previously missed periods (p=0.003) and the median number of missed periods was 2 (IQR 1-3). 17/21% of those who ‘occasionally’ missed periods pre-pandemic missed periods ‘often’ during the pandemic. 467/45% reported a reduced libido. There was no change in the median cycle length (28 days) or days of bleeding (5) but there was a wider variability of cycle length (p=0.01) and a 1-day median decrease in the minimum (p<0.0001) and maximum (p=0.009) cycle length. Women reported a median 2kg increase in self-reported weight and a 30-minute increase in median weekly exercise. 517/50% of women stated that their diet was worse and 232/23% that it was better than before the pandemic. 407/40% reported working more and 169/16% were working less. Women related a significant increase in low mood (p<0.0001), poor appetite (p<0.0001), binge eating (p<0.0001), poor concentration (p<0.0001), anxiety (p<0.0001), poor sleep (p<0.0001), loneliness (p<0.0001) and excess alcohol use (p<0.0001). Specific stressors reported included work stress (499/48%), difficulty accessing healthcare (254/25%), change in financial (201/19%) and living (169/16%) situation, difficulties with homeschooling children (191/19%), family or partner conflict (170/16%), family illness or bereavement (156/15%), and difficulties accessing or providing childcare (99/10%). Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the reproductive health of women. The long term health implications of this are yet to be determined and future studies should address this.","Owens, Lisa A; Phelan, Niamh; Behan, Lucy Ann A",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135498/,406
53703,Effects of Olfactory Stimulation on Swallowing Function in Taiwanese Older Adults,2021-05-25,"Genetic engineering of plants has turned out to be an attractive approach to produce various secondary metabolites. Here, we attempted to produce kynurenine, a health-promoting metabolite, in plants of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the gene, coding for human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme responsible for the kynurenine production because of tryptophan degradation. The presence of IDO1 gene in transgenic plants was confirmed by PCR, but the protein failed to be detected. To confer higher stability to the heterologous human IDO1 protein and to provide a more sensitive method to detect the protein of interest, we cloned a gene construct coding for IDO1-GFP. Analysis of transiently transfected tobacco protoplasts demonstrated that the IDO1-GFP gene led to the expression of a detectable protein and to the production of kynurenine in the protoplast medium. Interestingly, the intracellular localisation of human IDO1 in plant cells is similar to that found in mammal cells, mainly in cytosol, but in early endosomes as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the expression of human IDO1 enzyme capable of secreting kynurenines in plant cells.","Bellucci, Michele; Pompa, Andrea; De Marcos Lousa, Carine; Panfili, Eleonora; Orecchini, Elena; Maricchiolo, Elisa; Fraternale, Daniele; Orabona, Ciriana; De Marchis, Francesca; Pallotta, Maria Teresa",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151846/,406

However, how are the algorithms for states’ legibility projects enacted, contested, and reconfigured? Drawing on interviews and media data, this study fills this gap by examining Health Code (jiankangma), the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithmic system that serves as the COVID-19 health passport. I first explore the intensive and invisible work and infrastructures that enact and stabilize Health Code’s sociotechnical assemblage. I then show how this assemblage is frequently challenged and destabilized by errors, breakdowns, and exclusions. Facing unintended engagements from heterogeneous social actors, local interests, and power hierarchies, Health Code reassembles into multiple and contradictory assemblages at different periods and social localities. Finally, I examine how people game and bypass the algorithm’s surveillance with their agencies. Recognizing this messiness and heterogeneity contributes to a more nuanced and realistic understanding of states’ use of algorithms, including the risks. Doing so also urges us to rethink the politics of citizenship and inequality in the digital age beyond inclusion.","Liu, Chuncheng",Sci Technol Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180664/,406
54038,Nutritional Status of COVID 19 Patients: Possible Impact on Mental Health Status,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: The Folstein mini mental state exam (MMSE) is the most commonly administered assessment of cognitive functioning; however, its utility in illiterate individuals is limited. In South Africa, more than eight million adults are considered functionally illiterate and cognitive evaluation using standard scales is inaccurate. Other countries have developed adapted MMSE scales for their local purposes. AIM: The first aim of this study was to develop a South African Brief Cognitive Score (SA BCS) for use in minimally literate or illiterate individuals. The second aim was to test this SA BCS against the original Folstein MMSE in patients with memory problems. SETTING: The study was conducted in Tshilamba, Tshiombo, Tshifudi, Dzimauli and Pile in Venda as well as Rethabiseng and Zithobeni in Bronkhorstspruit for the illiterate study group, and Steve Biko Academic Hospital for the literate study groups. METHODS: The SA BCS was developed considering our local requirements and substituting questions needing literacy with items that did not. Both the original Folstein MMSE and the SA BCS were administered to groups of literate and illiterate normal individuals. Thereafter, the tests were repeated in groups of literate and illiterate patients with cognitive decline. RESULTS: Firstly, 33 illiterate and 31 literate subjects were assessed. The average original Folstein score was 29.29/30 for the literate subjects, and for the SA BCS 29.80. For the illiterate subjects, the average score for the original Folstein MMSE was 21.24/30 and for the SA BCS 27.45. Kruskall–Wallis equality of population rank test confirmed a significant improvement in the scores of the SA BCS in the illiterate group when compared to the original Folstein (p = 0.0001). In the second part of the study, 20 literate and 20 illiterate patients were assessed as before. In the literate group, the average original Folstein MMSE score was 20.5, while the average score for the South African BCS was 22.5. In the illiterate group, the average Folstein MMSE was 18.9; and the average score in the South African BCS was 22.8. The Kruskal–Wallis equality of population rank test showed a significant difference (p = 0.008) between the scores of the illiterate versus literate patients when the Folstein MMSE was used to assess cognition. With the SA BCS, no significant difference was found between the groups (p = 0.79). CONCLUSION: The SA BCS appears to have potential to be a more reliable scale when assessing cognition in illiterate or minimally literate subjects when compared to the original Folstein MMSE.","Schutte, Clara M.; Tsikane, Mukhethwa; Nchoe, Keorapetse",S Afr J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182453/,406

In public universities, however, this expansion was focused mainly on the enrollment of students. In general, it was not followed by consistent institutional policies that supported them throughout their academic trajectories. In this article, we start from the understanding that there is an expected trajectory for these students, which reflects a normative conception of human development, structured by values and beliefs related to the objectives of education. However, human trajectories do not coincide with stages and results institutionally expected. From the analysis of the biographic narrative of a black student who filed applications for (re)enrollment in a public university after two compulsory dismissals for non-compliance with academic performance standards, relying on the Dialogical Self-theory, the Educational Self-theory, and the Trajectory theory, we conclude Sara’s pace of achievement of academic results does not correspond to the university normative standard, requiring specific pedagogical support; that the disruptive events experienced throughout her trajectory at university are eventually understood by her as opportunities for self-development; and finally, the study points to the necessity to overcome the exclusive meritocratic logic that preponderates over public universities currently, which omits the dissonance between norms and success conditions, given the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of students.","de Novaes, Rafaella Eloy; de Oliveira, Maria Cláudia Santos Lopes",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240611/,406

Amidst a significant shortage in the provision of effective primary care, jeopardizing millions of Indians’ access to basic healthcare services, especially the poorest, it is very evident that nurse practitioners are the need of the hour in India. The current scenario of nursing in India warrants policy reforms to facilitate nurses as valuable primary care providers. It also shows the path towards making the Health and Wellness Centre operational by creating a pivotal role for the cadre in such centres, and it will also be important for the nurse practitioner to have a public health leadership role in a country like India. With additional training and qualification and also recognition of nurse practitioners as essential healthcare providers, a complete quality healthcare could be provided. In this research paper we assess the need for nurse practitioners as primary contact providers; reflect on the global evidence on nurse practitioners linking to health outcomes, effective coverage and access to services. We also try to contemplate on the training needs, their role in home-based care and as enablers of the referral mechanism, their untapped potential, and a plan for evaluating their effectiveness.

This phenomenon was expected to die just like other types of public performances, e.g., the eighties' raves. However, this phenomenon is still alive and became widespread in various forms.

Many traditionalist flash mobbers become concerned that the global diffusion of flash mobs has diluted their original meaning. So, in this summative, chronological, and by topic literature review article, we explore the disciplines in which this term was used; then investigate its various forms and propose the term “Mob” to be the root term so we can categorize its various forms (branches) and eliminate ambiguities; and prove that this phenomenon still exists. Finally, we try to shed light on what is missing from the literature and what needs to be studied in the future with regard to this topic.","Al-khateeb, Samer; Agarwal, Nitin",Soc Netw Anal Min,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510885/,406

Partial or full-thickness rectal injuries can occur during the introduction and the advancement of the circular stapler along the upper rectum. The aim of this study is to address some of these issues by designing and optimizing a ""phantom"" anvil manufactured to overcome difficulties throughout the rectal introduction and advancement of the circular stapler for the treatment of benign and malignant colon disease. METHODS The design of the ""phantom"" anvil has been performed using computer-aided modeling techniques, finite element investigations, and 2 essential keynotes in mind. The first one is the internal shape of the anvil, which is used for the connection to the gun. The second is the shape of the cap, which makes possible the insertion of the gun through the rectum. The ""phantom"" anvil has 2 functional requirements, which have been taken into account. The design has been optimized to avoid colorectal injuries, neoplastic dissemination (ie, mechanical seeding) and to reduce the fecal contamination. RESULTS Numerical simulations show that a right combination of both top and bottom fillet radii of the shape of the anvil can reduce the stress for the considered anatomic configuration of >90%. Both the fillet radii at the top and the bottom of the device influence the local stress of the colon rectum. CONCLUSIONS A dismountable device, which is used only for the insertion and advancement of the stapler, allows a dedicated design of its shape, keeping the remainder of the stapler unmodified. Computer-aided simulations are useful to perform numerical investigations to optimize the design of this auxiliary part for both the safety of the patient and the ease of the stapler advancement through the rectum.","Rulli, Francesco; Kartheuser, Alex; Amirhassankhani, Sasan; Mourad, Michel; Stefani, Mario; de Ferrá Aureli, Andrés; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Valentini, Pier Paolo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25462985/,406

RECENT FINDINGS The majority of nutritional studies in the critically ill have been performed on well nourished patients, but validated scoring systems can now identify high nutrition risk patients. Although it remains well accepted that early enteral nutrition with protein supplementation is key, mechanistic data suggest that hypocaloric feeding in septic patients may be beneficial. For critically ill patients unable to tolerate enteral nutrition, randomized pilot data demonstrate improved functional outcomes with early supplemental parenteral nutrition. Current guidelines also recommend early total parenteral nutrition in high nutrition risk patients with contraindications to enteral nutrition. When critically ill patients require low or moderate-dose vasopressors, enteral feeding appears well tolerated based on a large database study, while randomized prospective data showed worse outcomes in patients receiving high-dose vasopressors. SUMMARY Current evidence suggests early enteral nutrition with protein supplementation in critically ill surgical patients with consideration of early parenteral nutrition in high nutrition risk patients unable to achieve nutrition goals enterally. Despite established guidelines for nutritional therapy, the paucity of data to support these recommendations illustrates the critical need for additional studies.","Puzio, Thaddeus J; Kozar, Rosemary A",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002971/,406

Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities of COVID-19 is critical to inform public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts towns/cities (01/01/2020-05/06/2020) and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population was associated with a 312.3 increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born non-citizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted, and may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign born non-citizens, address crowded housing, and protect food-service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities.

It is unknown whether clinical dental screening to diagnose and treat odontogenic disease in these patients can reduce the incidence of dental emergencies. METHODS Between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, we screened 147 patients with newly diagnosed AML before their admission for induction chemotherapy (n1 = 147, ""screened"" group). The patients not screened acted as controls (n2 = 190, ""unscreened"" group), as did patients diagnosed with AML in the 26 months before the initiation of the screening program (n3 = 304, ""prescreening"" group). The number of patients in each group who presented for emergency dental assessment during admission for induction chemotherapy was determined by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS Among the 147 patients in the screened group, only 1 patient presented with an infectious odontogenic emergency (0.68% [95% CI, -0.64% to 1.98%]). In the unscreened group, 8 developed an infectious odontogenic emergency during induction chemotherapy (4.21% [95% CI, 1.37% to 7.15%]), a statistically significant difference (P = .046, a = 0.05). A similar rate of infectious dental emergencies was observed in the prescreening group (4.28% [95% CI, 2.0% to 7.2%]). CONCLUSION Clinical dental screening before induction chemotherapy in patients with AML resulted in a 6-fold reduction in infectious dental emergencies during the induction period.","Watson, Erin E; Metcalfe, Jessica E; Kreher, Matthew R; Maxymiw, Walter G; Glogauer, Michael; Schimmer, Aaron D",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609586/,406
61061,Managing chronic pain patients at the time of COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-12,"Background Compared with 2D evaluation, 3D evaluation possesses the virtues of displaying spatial anatomy of intrahepatic blood vessels and its relations to tumors, and enabling calculation of liver volumes, thus facilitating preoperative surgery planning. Methods The objective of this study is to study whether preoperative 3D (three-dimensional) evaluation produced better long-term overall survival (OS) outcomes compared to the traditional 2D (two-dimensional) evaluation in patients who underwent major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study matched patients who underwent preoperative 2D evaluation with those who underwent preoperative 3D evaluation in a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching. The primary endpoints were long-term survival outcomes in the two groups after major hepatectomy for HCC. Results Of the 248 patients in each of the 2 matched groups, the baseline characteristics were comparable. The median follow-up for all patients was 36 months (range, 0-40 months). The 3-year OS of patients in the PSM cohort was 38.5%. Compared with the 2D Group, patients in the 3D Group had a better OS rate (HR 0.722, 95% CI: 0.556-0.938, P=0.015) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate (HR 0.741, 95% CI: 0.590-0.929, P=0.009). The 3-year OS and DFS rate for the 3D Group versus the 2D group were 58.9% and 44.0% versus 47.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Conclusions 3D preoperative evaluation resulted in significantly better intermediate-term (3-year) overall survival rate than the traditional 2D evaluation.","Li, Pengpeng; Wang, Mengchao; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Hui; Pan, Zeya; Jiang, Beige; Lau, Wan Yee; Huang, Gang; Zhou, Weiping",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.01.106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309329/,406

The main objective was to determine pre-/intraoperative risk factors for anastomotic leak after elective right colon resection for cancer. Secondary objectives were to determine risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS Fifty-two hospitals participated in this prospective, observational study (September 2011-September 2012), including 1102 patients that underwent elective right colectomy. Forty-two pre-/intraoperative variables, related to patient, tumor, surgical procedure, and hospital, were analyzed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leak and postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 93 patients (8.4 %), and 72 (6.5 %) of them needed radiological or surgical intervention. Morbidity, mortality, and wound infection rates were 29.0, 2.6, and 13.4 %, respectively. Preoperative serum protein concentration was the only independent risk factor for anastomotic leak (p < 0.0001, OR 0.6 per g/dL). When considering only clinically relevant anastomotic leaks, stapled technique (p = 0.03, OR 2.1) and preoperative serum protein concentration (p = 0.004, OR 0.6 g/dL) were identified as the only two independent risk factors. Age and preoperative serum albumin concentration resulted to be risk factors for postoperative mortality. Male gender, pulmonary or hepatic disease, and open surgical approach were identified as risk factors for postoperative morbidity, while male gender, obesity, intraoperative complication, and end-to-end anastomosis were risk factors for wound infection. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative nutritional status and the stapled anastomotic technique were the only independent risk factors for clinically relevant anastomotic leak after elective right colectomy for cancer. Age and preoperative nutritional status determined the mortality risk, while laparoscopic approach reduced postoperative morbidity.","Frasson, Matteo; Granero-Castro, Pablo; Ramos Rodríguez, José Luis; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Braithwaite, Mariela; Martí Martínez, Eva; Álvarez Pérez, Jose Antonio; Codina Cazador, Antonio; Espí, Alejandro; Garcia-Granero, Eduardo",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-015-2376-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315015/,406

In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether healthcare workers with high exposure to Covid-19 patients had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than other healthcare workers in a Norwegian University Hospital. We also investigated the prevalence of asymptomatic healthcare workers in a ward with a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. METHODS Healthcare workers from five wards at Akershus University Hospital were included between May 11 and June 11, 2020. Blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and seroprevalences compared between participants with high and low exposure to Covid-19 patients. Demographic data and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors were recorded in a questionnaire. Naso-/oropharyngeal swabs from participants from the outbreak ward were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS 360/436 (82.6%) healthcare workers participated. 9/262 (3.4%) participants from wards with high exposure to Covid-19 patients were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive versus 3/98 (3.1%) from wards with low exposure (OR 1.13; 95%CI 0.3-4.26, p = .861). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 11/263 (4.2%) participants who had worked one or more shifts caring for Covid-19 patients versus in 1/85 (1.2%) without any known occupational Covid-19 exposure (OR 3.67; 95%CI 0.46-29.06, p = .187). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in naso-/oropharyngeal swabs from 2/78 (2.6%) participants. CONCLUSION We found no significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with high exposure to COVID-19 patients.

BACKGROUND PELD has gained acceptance for treating patients with IDC. The Bi-needle technique was designed to improve the efficiency and safety of PELD. METHOD Bi-needle and TESSYS group within each cohort were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching. Finally, 32 patients with IDC treated by Bi-needle technique from December 2015 to September 2017 were enrolled and 25 patients treated by TESSYS technique from the same spine surgery center between January 2013 and October 2017 were enrolled as controls. RESULTS Propensity score matching generated 22 Bi-needle and 22 TESSYS patients. There were no significant differences in visual analog scale and lumbar Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores between Bi-needle and TESSYS group. Operative time and rate of complications in the Bi-needle was significantly better than the TESSYS group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Both surgical methods achieved good clinical outcomes.

63732,Insomnia among employees in occupations with critical societal functions during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-02-16,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by a variety of agents, including Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19, also develop ARDS. In the absence of effective treatments, ARDS results in almost 40% mortality. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol (RES), a stilbenoid, with potent anti-inflammatory properties can attenuate SEB-induced ARDS. In the current study, we investigated the role of RES-induced alterations in the gut and lung microbiota in the regulation of ARDS. Our studies revealed that SEB administration induced inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, and 100% mortality in C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, SEB caused a significant increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria phylum and Propionibacterium acnes species in the lungs. In contrast, RES treatment attenuated SEB-mediated ARDS and mortality in mice, and significantly increased probiotic Actinobacteria phylum, Tenericutes phylum, and Lactobacillus reuteri species in both the colon and lungs. Colonic Microbiota Transplantation (CMT) from SEB-injected mice that were treated with RES as well as the transfer of L. reuteri into recipient mice inhibited the production of SEB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-17 but increased that of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Additionally, such CMT and L. reuteri recipient mice exposed to SEB, showed a decrease in lung-infiltrating mononuclear cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, but an increase in the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th3 cells, and increase in the survival of mice from SEB-mediated ARDS. Together, the current study demonstrates that ARDS induced by SEB triggers dysbiosis in the lungs and gut and that attenuation of ARDS by RES may be mediated, at least in part, by alterations in microbiota in the lungs and the gut, especially through the induction of beneficial bacteria such as L. reuteri.","Alghetaa, Hasan; Mohammed, Amira; Zhou, Juhua; Singh, Narendra; Nagarkatti, Mitzi; Nagarkatti, Prakash",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722710/,406

This model allows assessment of bone substitution materials for oral and craniofacial bone regeneration in terms of bone growth and neovascularization support. Once animals are anesthetized and ventilated (endotracheal intubation), four cylinders made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) are screwed onto the skull, on both sides of the median and coronal sutures. Five intramedullary holes are drilled within the bone area delimited by each cylinder, allowing influx of bone marrow cells. The material samples are placed into the cylinders which are then closed. Finally, the surgical site is sutured, and animals are awaken. Bone growth may be assessed on live animals by using microtomography. Once animals are euthanized, bone growth and neovascularization may be evaluated by using microtomography, immune-histology and immunofluorescence. As the evaluation of a material requires maximum standardization and calibration, the calvarial model appears ideal. Access is very easy, calibration and standardization are facilitated by the use of defined cylinders and four samples may be assessed simultaneously. Furthermore, live tomography may be used and ultimately a large decrease in animals to be euthanized may be anticipated.","Marger, Laurine; Barone, Antonio; Martinelli-Kläy, Carla P; Schaub, Leandra; Strasding, Malin; Mekki, Mustapha; Sailer, Irena; Scherrer, Susanne S; Durual, Stéphane",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/59976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475980/,406

Nevertheless, gambling at casinos and gambling on the Internet are both hugely popular activities. In recent years, both prospect theory and laboratory-controlled experiments have been used to improve our understanding of risk attitudes associated with gambling. Despite theoretical progress, collecting real-life gambling data, which is essential to validate predictions and experimental findings, remains a challenge. To address this issue, we collect publicly available betting data from a DApp (decentralized application) on the Ethereum blockchain, which instantly publishes the outcome of every single bet (consisting of each bet's timestamp, wager, probability of winning, userID and profit). This online casino is a simple dice game that allows gamblers to tune their own winning probabilities. Thus the dataset is well suited for studying gambling strategies and the complex dynamic of risk attitudes involved in betting decisions. We analyse the dataset through the lens of current probability-theoretic models and discover empirical examples of gambling systems. Our results shed light on understanding the role of risk preferences in human financial behaviour and decision-makings beyond gambling.","Meng, Jonathan; Fu, Feng",Royal Society open science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204481/,406

We sought to assess the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) over best medical care for M2 segment MCA occlusion. METHODS Patient level data from trials in the HERMES Collaboration were included. The HERMES core laboratory identified patients with M2 segment MCA occlusions and further classified them as proximal versus distal, anterior versus posterior division, and dominant versus co-dominant versus non-dominant. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) rates at end of procedure, 90-day mRS shift, 90-day mRS 0-1, 24 hours National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0-2, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and death. RESULTS 130 patients with M2 MCA (proximal location n=116 vs distal n=14, anterior division n=72 vs posterior n=58, dominant n=73 vs co-dominant n=50 vs non-dominant n=7) were included. Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b or 3) among those undergoing EVT was seen in 59.2% of patients. Treatment effect favored EVT (adjusted OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.28, p=0.03) for 90-day mRS 0-2 (58.2% EVT vs 39.7% control). Direction of benefit favored EVT for other outcomes. Treatment effect favoring EVT was maximal in patients with proximal M2 segment MCA occlusions (n=116, adjusted OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.37) and in dominant M2 segment MCA occlusions (n=73, adjusted OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.48). No sICH (0%) was observed in patients treated with EVT compared with five (7.9%) in the control arm.

The piecemeal of knowledge related to cetaceans' ecology and distribution in the basin undermines the capacity of addressing cetaceans' protection and identifying effective conservation strategies. In this study, an Ecosystem-Based Marine Spatial Planning (EB-MSP) approach is applied to assess human pressures on cetaceans and guide the designation of a conservation area in the Gulf of Taranto, Northern Ionian Sea (Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea). The Gulf of Taranto hosts different cetacean species that accomplish important phases of their life in the area. Despite this fact, the gulf does not fall within any area-based management tools (ABMTs) for cetacean conservation. We pin down the Gulf of Taranto being eligible for the designation of diverse ABMTs for conservation, both legally and non-legally binding. Through a risk-based approach, this study explores the cause-effect relationships that link any human activities and pressures exerted in the study area to potential effects on cetaceans, by identifying major drivers of potential impacts. These were found to be underwater noise, marine litter, ship collision, and competition and disturbance on preys. We draw some recommendations based on different sources of available knowledge produced so far in the area (i.e., empirical evidence, scientific and grey literature, and expert judgement) to boost cetaceans' conservation. Finally, we stress the need of sectoral coordination for the management of human activities by applying an EB-MSP approach and valuing the establishment of an ABMT in the Gulf of Taranto.","Carlucci, Roberto; Manea, Elisabetta; Ricci, Pasquale; Cipriano, Giulia; Fanizza, Carmelo; Maglietta, Rosalia; Gissi, Elena",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740744/,406

BACKGROUND The currently used DES present certain features that have been linked separately to their better performance in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS First-in-man, prospective and multicenter study including patients treated with ihtDEStiny stent undergoing OCT examination at 9 months follow up. The ihtDEStiny stent is a sirolimus eluting stent with an oval shape ultrathin struts (68 μm) and an abluminal coating of a fluoropolymer containing the antiplatelet agent triflusal. Primary endpoint was the percentage of obstruction of the in-stent volume by the neointima. RESULTS In 58 patients (63 lesions) in-stent late lumen loss was 0.11 ± 0.23 mm (95% CI 0.05-0.16) with only in 6% of stents being > 0.5 mm and in-segment binary stenosis was 1.6%. In OCT mean neointima volume obstruction was 10.5 ± 6.9% with a mean neointima thickness of 110.9 ± 89.8 μm. The proportion of uncovered struts was 2.5%, malapposed struts 1.1% and malapposed/uncovered struts 0.7% and no subclinical thrombi detected. Mean incomplete stent apposition area was 0.1 ± 0.1 mm2. At 12 months target lesion revascularization rate was 3% and no stent thrombosis was reported. CONCLUSIONS In this study the ihtDEStiny stent has shown a very low degree of neointimal proliferation associated with a low rate of uncovered/malapposed struts and total absence of subclinical thrombi at 9 months follow up.","de la Torre Hernandez, Jose M; Otaegui, Imanol; Subinas, Asier; Gomez-Menchero, Antonio; Moreno, Raul; Rondan, Juan; Muñoz-Garcia, Erika; Sainz-Laso, Fermin; Garcia Del Blanco, Bruno; Rumoroso, Jose R; Diaz, Jose F; Berenguer, Alberto; Gomez-Lara, Josep; Zueco, Javier",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2020.12.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386256/,406

However, the epidemiology, genetic, and antigenic characteristics of the virus have yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated the dissemination of PEDV by testing 536 samples by RT-PCR over a 33-month period. The 35.8% of positive samples (n=192) was significantly different (p<0.01) between months over time, with a higher number of positives samples occurring at the beginning of the epidemic and during the second epidemic wave within the main pork producing region. The complete PEDV genomes was generated for 21 strains, which shared a high nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity, except for the spike (S) gene. Recombinant regions were identified within the Colombian strains and between Colombian and Asian PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 Colombian strains demonstrated the presence of 7 lineages that shared common ancestors with PEDV strains from the United States. Moreover, the antigenic analysis demonstrated residue differences in the neutralizing epitopes in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Our results illustrated the simultaneous introduction of the two PEDV genotypes (GIIa American pandemic and S-INDEL) into the Colombian swine industry during the 2014 PEDV epidemic and enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology and molecular diversity of PEDV in Colombia.","Qi, Mingpu; Zambrano-Moreno, Corina; Pineda, Pilar; Calderón, Claudia; Rincón-Monroy, María A; Diaz, Andres; Marthaler, Douglas G",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155439/,406

In this study, polylactide (PLA) nanofibers loaded with PHMB were produced by electrospinning to obtain 3D biodegradable scaffolds with antibacterial properties. PLA fibers loaded with CHX were used as control. The electrospun fibers were studied and analyzed by SEM, FTIR, DSC and contact angle measurements. PHMB and CHX release from loaded scaffolds was evaluated, as well as their antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. The results showed that the nanofibers became smoother and their diameter smaller with increasing the amount of loaded PHMB. This feature led to an increase of both surface roughness and hydrophobicity of the scaffold. PHMB release was highly dependent on the hydrophilicity of the medium and differed from that determined for CHX. Lastly, PHMB-loaded PLA scaffolds showed antibacterial properties since they inhibited adhesion and bacterial growth, and exhibited biocompatible characteristics for the adhesion and proliferation of both fibroblast and epithelial cell lines.","Llorens, Elena; Calderón, Silvia; del Valle, Luis J; Puiggalí, Jordi","Materials science & engineering.

The organometallic (99m)Tc conjugates are suitable for application as diagnostic radiotracers for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as demonstrated in vivo with a fragment of the tumor-targeting bombesin peptide functionalized with a di-1,2,3-triazole chelator and radiolabeled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+). Starting from readily available dialkyne precursors, the central chelating systems are formed as the conjugates are assembled by click reaction with azide-functionalized entities.

The aim of this study was to review the case reports that have described oral manifestations in patients suffering for this syndrome. A systematic review of case reports was performed on PubMed and Science Direct on January 2020 among all the articles dealing with the disease. In vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies have not been included to select only the case reports. Eighteen articles, published between 1999 and 2019, were included. All the patients presented mandibular osteomyelitis or sclerosis, associated with various other symptoms such as trismus, temporomandibular joint arthritis, or dysphagia. The data highlight the high variability in the disease's manifestations between people and also in the treatments applied. Knowing the orofacial signs of the SAPHO syndrome, the dental surgeon has a crucial role in the diagnosis procedure and must take place in the multidisciplinary medical team involved in the patient following.

Data comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the NP specimen to the less invasive, mid-turbinate (MT) nasal specimen in children are limited. METHODS Paired clinical NP and research MT specimens were collected from children <18 years with respiratory symptoms and tested by molecular assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement (Cohen's kappa [κ]) were calculated for research MT specimens compared to the clinical NP specimens. RESULTS Out of 907 children, 569 (62.7%) had parental consent and child assent when appropriate to participate and provided paired MT and NP specimens a median of 4 days after symptom onset (range 1-14 days). 16.5% (n = 94) of MT specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 20.0% (n = 114) of NP specimens. The sensitivity of research MT compared to clinical NP specimens was 82.5% (95% CI: 74.2%, 88.9%), specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.2%, 100.0%), and overall agreement was 96.1% (κ = 0.87). The sensitivity of MT specimens decreased with time from 100% (95% CI: 59.0%, 100.0%) on day 1 of illness to 82.1% (95% CI: 73.8%, 88.7%) within 14 days of illness onset; sensitivity was generally >90% when specimens were collected within the first week of illness. CONCLUSION MT specimens, particularly those collected within the first week of illness, have moderately reduced sensitivity and equivalent specificity to less-tolerated NP specimens in pediatric outpatients. MT specimen use in children may represent a viable alternative to NP specimen collection.","Sahni, Leila C; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Ortiz, Camerin S; Feliz, Karen E; John, Rebekah E; Brown, Cameron A; Lively, Joana Y; Rha, Brian; Munoz, Flor M; Piedra, Pedro A; Dunn, James J; Boom, Julie A",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173660/,406

Alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose have not been directly compared between individuals or animals that underwent RYGB vs VSG. We evaluated in rats and humans how the gut epithelium adapts after surgery and the consequences on alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose. METHODS Obese male rats underwent RYGB, VSG, or sham (control) operations. We collected intestine segments from all rats; we performed histologic analyses and measured levels of messenger RNAs encoding the sugar transporters SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and GLUT5. Glucose transport and consumption were assayed using ex vivo jejunal loops. Histologic analyses were also performed on Roux limb sections from patients who underwent RYGB 1-5 years after surgery. Roux limb glucose consumption was assayed after surgery by positron emission and computed tomography imaging. RESULTS In rats and humans that underwent RYGB, the Roux limb became hyperplasic, with an increased number of incretin-producing cells compared with the corresponding jejunal segment of controls. Furthermore, expression of sugar transporters and hypoxia-related genes increased and the nonintestinal glucose transporter GLUT1 appeared at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Ingested and circulating glucose was trapped within the intestinal epithelial cells of rats and humans that underwent RYGB. By contrast, there was no hyperplasia of the intestine after VSG, but the intestinal absorption of alimentary glucose was reduced and density of endocrine cells secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 increased. CONCLUSIONS The intestine adapts differently to RYGB vs VSG. RYGB increases intestinal glucose disposal and VSG delays glucose absorption; both contribute to observed improvements in glycemia.","Cavin, Jean-Baptiste; Couvelard, Anne; Lebtahi, Rachida; Ducroc, Robert; Arapis, Konstantinos; Voitellier, Eglantine; Cluzeaud, Françoise; Gillard, Laura; Hourseau, Muriel; Mikail, Nidaa; Ribeiro-Parenti, Lara; Kapel, Nathalie; Marmuse, Jean-Pierre; Bado, André; Le Gall, Maude",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2015.10.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26481855/,406

The upregulated activity of these proteins is linked to the development of disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders (ND) and cancer. Although various chemical inhibitors of these enzymes restore the brain functions in models of ND such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and reduce the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, the particular contribution of each paralog to these effects remains unclear as these molecules downregulate the activity of both paralogs with a similar efficacy. Moreover, given that GSK3 paralogs phosphorylate more than 100 substrates, the simultaneous inhibition of both enzymes has detrimental effects during long-term inhibition. Although the GSK3β kinase function has usually been taken as the global GSK3 activity, in the last few years, a growing interest in the study of GSK3α has emerged because several studies have recognized it as the main GSK3 paralog involved in a variety of diseases. This review summarizes the current biological evidence on the role of GSK3α in AD and various types of cancer. We also provide a discussion on some strategies that may lead to the design of the paralog-specific inhibition of GSK3α.","Silva-García, Octavio; Cortés-Vieyra, Ricarda; Mendoza-Ambrosio, Francisco N; Ramírez-Galicia, Guillermo; Baizabal-Aguirre, Víctor M",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10121683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339170/,406

Moreover, a DGKα-selective inhibitor, CU-3, induced cell death in cancer-derived cells and simultaneously enhanced T-cell interleukin-2 production. In addition to DGKα, DGKζ is also known to induce T-cell anergy. In the present study, we examined whether combined inhibition/silencing of DGKα and DGKζ synergistically enhanced T-cell activity. Combined treatment with CU-3 or DGKα-small interfering RNA (siRNA) and DGKζ-siRNA more potently enhanced T-cell receptor-crosslink-dependent interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells than treatment with either alone. Intriguingly, in addition to activating T cells, dual inhibition/silencing of DGKα and DGKζ synergistically reduced viability and increased caspase 3/7 activity in AKI melanoma cells. Taken together, these results indicate that combined inhibition/silencing of DGKα and DGKζ simultaneously and synergistically enhances interleukin-2 production in T cells and induces cell death in melanoma. Therefore, dual inhibition/silencing of these DGK isozymes represents an ideal therapy that potently attenuates cancer cell proliferation and simultaneously enhances immune responses that impact anticancer immunity.","Takao, Saki; Akiyama, Rino; Sakane, Fumio",Journal of cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.29876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399248/,406

COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. RESULTS The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide a snapshot of the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among a convenience sample of U.S. ASMM and underscore the need to provide access to resources sensitive to their social, developmental, and sexual health needs during this crisis.","Nelson, Kimberly M; Gordon, Allegra R; John, Steven A; Stout, Claire D; Macapagal, Katharyn",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039273/,406

The objective of the present study was to assess the occurrence of radiographic changes associated with chronic laminitis in elderly, clinically sound horses. Fifty-one horses were included in the study. Horses were assigned to different age groups, in groups according to their BCS and CNS as well as to groups with different ACTH concentrations in order to assess their risk of chronic laminitis (reported as odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI)). Horses assigned to an older age group (26-32 years) were significantly more likely to have radiographically assessed changes of chronic laminitis than horses in a younger age group (15-25 years) (OR 3.33; CI 1.05-10.59). The other variables (body condition score, cresty neck score, ACTH concentration) were not associated with an increased risk of having laminitic changes in these horses.","Christen, G; Precht, C; van der Kolk, J; Fouché, N; Gerber, V",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://doi.org/10.17236/sat00283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263545/,406

The ability of starlings to carry and disperse pathogens of humans and domesticated livestock has received considerable attention, including studies of enteric bacteria, viruses, and some fungi. To investigate the importance of European starlings as disease vectors, I reviewed and assessed the available literature, comprising several hundred published papers. Although a wide variety of potential pathogens have been reported in starlings, the strongest evidence suggests that they may be responsible for harboring and dispersing some species of enteric bacteria, with Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni of perhaps greatest interest, and primarily in the context of dairies, concentrated animal feeding operations, and other intensive livestock agriculture.","Cabe, Paul R",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578636/,406

The time-resolved photoelectron spectra and photoelectron angular distributions at all pump wavelengths are carefully analysed and the following picture is derived: at the longest pump wavelengths (254.8, 248.3 and 246.1 nm), 2-ethylpyrrole is excited to the S1(1πσ*) state having a lifetime of about 50 fs. At 248.3, 246.1 and 237.4 nm, another excited state of Rydberg character is excited. The lifetime of this state is ∼570 fs at 237.4 nm and becomes slightly longer at other two pump wavelengths. At the shortest pump wavelengths (230.8 and 218.0 nm), 2-ethylpyrrole is excited to a state which is tentatively assigned to the 11ππ* state, having a lifetime of 75 ± 15 and 48 ± 10 fs for the longer and shorter pump wavelengths, respectively. Internal conversion to the S1(1πσ*) state might be one of the decay mechanisms of the 11ππ* state.","Yuan, Wenpeng; Yang, Dongyuan; Feng, Baihui; Min, Yanjun; Chen, Zhichao; Yu, Shengrui; Wu, Guorong; Yang, Xueming",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp01090e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369952/,406

None of the existing clinical treatments provide a solution for all patients. Gene therapy and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) reactivation through genetic approaches have obtained promising, but early, results in patients. Furthermore, the search for active molecules to increase HbF is still ongoing. The delta-globin gene produces the delta-globin of haemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Although expressed at a low level, HbA2 is fully functional and could be a valid anti-sickling agent in SCD. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of a strategy aimed to over-express the delta-globin gene in vivo, we crossed transgenic mice carrying a single copy of the delta-globin gene, genetically modified to be expressed at a higher level (activated), with a humanised mouse model of SCD. The activated delta-globin gene gives rise to a consistent production of HbA2, effectively improving the SCD phenotype. For the first time in vivo, these results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of delta-globin, which could lead to novel approaches to the cure of SCD.","Porcu, Susanna; Simbula, Michela; Marongiu, Maria F; Perra, Andrea; Poddie, Daniela; Perseu, Lucia; Kowalik, Marta A; Littera, Roberto; Barella, Susanna; Caria, Cristian A; Demartis, Franca R; Ristaldi, Maria S",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046885/,406

We report our experience of managing a subset of AIS patients with extracranial vascular stenting/angioplasty and intracranial revascularization. METHODS Consecutive patients who presented at three centers with AIS from tandem vascular occlusions confirmed by brain and neck CT imaging were included in the study. We retrospectively analyzed the patient demographics, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the time of admission, treatment strategy, angiographic results using the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, and clinical and imaging follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were included. The mean NIHSS score at admission was 18. Extracranial carotid occlusions with a concomitant middle cerebral artery occlusion were seen in 89.3% of patients (n=25) and vertebral artery combined with basilar artery lesions in 10.7% (n=3). An antegrade approach (ie, treatment of the extracranial lesion first) was used in 24 patients (85.7%). Proximal occlusion recanalization was achieved usually with a stent (n=27; 96.4%). Pursuant to intracranial revascularization techniques, ≥ TICI 2A recanalization was seen in 96.4% of patients. An mRS score of ≤ 2 at 90 days was achieved in 56.5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows preliminary data from three centers on recanalization of tandem occlusions in patients presenting with AIS. There was a preference to revascularize the proximal occlusion using a stent followed by distal recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis or a combination of these. This approach has low periprocedural complications and can achieve an excellent angiographic and clinical outcome.","Puri, Ajit S; Kühn, Anna L; Kwon, Hyon-Jo; Khan, Muhib; Hou, Samuel Y; Lin, Eugene; Chueh, Juyu; van der Bom, Imramsjah M J; Dabus, Guilherme; Linfante, Italo; Gounis, Matthew J; Wakhloo, Ajay K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578485/,406

However, many cell-penetrating peptides might present drawbacks due to causing cellular toxicity, or due to being entrapped in endosomes, or as a result of their degradation before they meet their target. In this work, a cargo transporting molecule, the Cell Penetrating Sequential Oligopeptide Carrier (CPSOC), formed by the repetitive -Lys-Aib-Cys- moiety, was tested for its ability to penetrate the cell membrane and transport the conjugated peptides into the cells. The cysteine residue anchors bioactive molecules through a stable thioether bond. The lysine supplies the positive charge to the construct, whereas the α-amino isobutyric acid is well known to induce helicoid conformation to the peptide backbone and protects from enzymatic degradation. The present study demonstrates that CPSOC penetrates the membrane transporting the conjugated cargo into the cell. When we tested CPSOC-conjugated peptides carrying critical domains of Cdc42, a small GTPase implicated in exocytosis, the internalized peptides were found to be functional because they inhibited exocytosis of von Willebrand factor from endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies a trafficking event depending on the Cdc42 protein. The data suggest that the carrier can deliver efficiently functional peptides into the cells, and thus, it can be used as a multiple-cargo transporting molecule.","Papadopoulos, Christos; Fotou, Evgenia; Moussis, Vassilios; Ntoyhaniari, Alaxandra; Zografou, Sofia; Maltabe, Violetta; Kouklis, Panos; Christoforidis, Savvas; Tsikaris, Vassilios",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/psc.3359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131994/,406

According to the proposed model, VP24 binding to members of the NPI-1 subfamily of karyopherin alpha (KPNalpha) nuclear localization signal receptors prevents their binding to PY-STAT1, thereby preventing PY-STAT1 nuclear accumulation. This study now identifies two domains of VP24 required for inhibition of IFN-beta-induced gene expression and PY-STAT1 nuclear accumulation. We demonstrate that loss of function correlates with loss of binding to KPNalpha proteins. Thus, the VP24 IFN antagonist function requires the ability of VP24 to interact with KPNalpha.","Mateo, Mathieu; Reid, St Patrick; Leung, Lawrence W; Basler, Christopher F; Volchkov, Viktor E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01372-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19889762/,406

The goal was to inform whether additional guidance and QA tools were needed. METHODS A survey focussed on clinical use, metrics used, how centres would like to use DIR in the future and challenges faced, was designed and sent to 71 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Data was gathered specifically on which centres we using DIR clinically, which applications were being used, what commissioning and QA tests were performed, and what barriers were preventing the integration of DIR into the clinical workflow. Centres that did not use DIR clinically were encouraged to fill in the survey and were asked if they have any future plans and in what timescale. RESULTS 51 out of 71 (70%) radiotherapy centres responded. 47 centres reported access to a commercial software that could perform DIR. 20 centres already used DIR clinically, and 22 centres had plans to implement an application of DIR within 3 years of the survey. The most common clinical application of DIR was to propagate contours from one scan to another (19 centres). In each of the applications, the types of commissioning and QA tests performed varied depending on the type of application and between centres. Some of the key barriers were determining when a DIR was satisfactory including which metrics to use, and lack of resources. CONCLUSIONS The survey results highlighted that there is a need for additional guidelines, training, better tools for commissioning DIR software and for the QA of registration results, which should include developing or recommending which quantitative metrics to use. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE This survey has given a useful picture of the clinical use and lack of use of DIR in UK radiotherapy centres. The survey provided useful insight into how centres commission and QA DIR applications, especially the variability among centres. It was also possible to highlight key barriers to implementation and determine factors that may help overcome this which include the need for additional guidance specific to different applications, better tools and metrics.","Hussein, Mohammad; Akintonde, Adeyemi; McClelland, Jamie; Speight, Richard; Clark, Catharine H",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20210001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882253/,406

83465,The Effect of Telehealth Services on Provider Productivity.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Currently there are only two population studies on sepsis incidence in Asia. The burden of sepsis in Hong Kong is unknown. We developed a sepsis surveillance method to estimate sepsis incidence from a population electronic health record (EHR) in Hong Kong using objective clinical data. The study objective was to assess our method's performance in identifying sepsis using a retrospective cohort. We compared its accuracy to administrative sepsis surveillance methods such as Angus' and Martin's methods. METHOD In this single centre retrospective study we applied our sepsis surveillance method on adult patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong. Two clinicians independently reviewed the clinical notes to determine which patients had sepsis. Performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC) of Angus', Martin's and our surveillance methods using clinical review as ""gold standard."" RESULTS Between January 1 and February 28, 2018, our sepsis surveillance method identified 1352 adult patients hospitalised with suspected infection. We found that 38.9% (95%CI 36.3-41.5) of these patients had sepsis. Using a 490 patient validation cohort, two clinicians had good agreement with weighted kappa of 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81) before coming to consensus on diagnosis of uncomplicated infection or sepsis for all patients. Our method had sensitivity 0.93 (95%CI 0.89-0.96), specificity 0.86 (95%CI 0.82-0.90) and an AUC 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92) when validated against clinician review. In contrast, Angus' and Martin's methods had AUCs 0.56 (95%CI 0.53-0.58) and 0.56 (95%CI 0.52-0.59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS A sepsis surveillance method based on objective data from a population EHR in Hong Kong was more accurate than administrative methods. It may be used to estimate sepsis population incidence and outcomes in Hong Kong.

The assay is technically simple to perform and provides rapid results, making it an appealing option for physicians and laboratorians. The initial product released by BioFire (version 1.6) was reported to have poor sensitivity for adenovirus detection and was therefore of concern when testing immunocompromised patients. This study evaluates the redesigned FilmArray assay (version 1.7) for detection of adenovirus. In this evaluation, we performed both retrospective and prospective verification studies, as well as a detailed serotype analysis. We found that version 1.7 demonstrated improved adenovirus sensitivity. In retrospective studies, sensitivity improved from 66.6% to 90.5%, and in prospective studies, it improved from 42.7% to 83.3%. In addition, when 39 clinically relevant serotypes were tested, 8 were not detected by version 1.6 and only 1 was not detected by version 1.7. The limit of detection remained the same when tested against serotype 4 but improved by 2 log units for serotype 7. Lastly, turnaround time analyses showed that the FilmArray assay was completed 3 h and 9 min after collection, which was more than a 37-h improvement over the previous multiplex PCR assay performed in our laboratory.","Doern, Christopher D; Lacey, Damon; Huang, Rong; Haag, Crissie",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02546-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24068007/,406
85405,Physical activity in wheelchair-using youth with spina bifida: an observational study.,2019,"Methods designed to measure SARS-CoV-2 humoral response include virus neutralization tests to determine antibody neutralization activity. For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","Luo, Yiqi Ruben; Yun, Cassandra; Chakraborty, Indrani; Wu, Alan H B; Lynch, Kara L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00193-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827900/,406

THF is an environmental hazard and carcinogenic to humans. In the present study, a new THF-degrading filamentous fungus, Pseudallescheria boydii ZM01, was isolated and characterized. Strain ZM01 can tolerate a maximum THF concentration of 260 mM and can completely degrade 5 mM THF in 48 h, with a maximum THF degradation rate of 133.40 mg THF h-1 g-1 dry weight. Growth inhibition was not observed when the initial THF concentration was below 150 mM, and the maximum THF degradation rate was still maintained at 118.21 mg THF h-1 g-1 dry weight at 50 mM THF, indicating the great potential of this strain to degrade THF at high concentrations.

Analyses of the effects of initial pH, incubation temperature, and heavy metal ions on THF degradation revealed that strain ZM01 can degrade THF under a relatively wide range of conditions and has good degradation ability under low pH and Cu2+ stress, suggesting its adaptability and applicability for industrial wastewater treatment.","Ren, Hao; Li, Hanbo; Wang, Haixia; Huang, Hui; Lu, Zhenmei",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764240/,406
87901,Taxing working memory to modulate mental imagery of the 9/11 terrorist attacks following media exposure during childhood: a pilot study in young adult UK residents.,2021-01-08,"The processing, storage, and flux of inorganic carbon in rivers and streams play an influential role in the lateral transfer of atmospheric and terrestrial carbon to the marine environment. Quantifying and understanding this transfer requires a rapid and accurate means of measuring representative concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 in field settings. This paper describes a field method for the determination of DIC based on the direct measurement of dissolved CO2 using a commercial carbonation meter. A 100-mL water sample is combined with 10 mL of a high ionic strength, low-pH, citrate buffer, mixed well, and the dissolved CO2 concentration is measured directly. The DIC is then calculated based on the dissolved CO2 concentration, buffer-controlled ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the mixture. The method was accurate, precise, and comparable to standard laboratory analytical methods when tested using prepared sodium bicarbonate solutions up to 40 mM DIC, North Atlantic seawater, commercial bottled waters, and carbonate spring waters. Coal mine drainage waters were also tested and often contained higher DIC concentrations in the field than in subsequent laboratory measurements; the greatest discrepancy was for the high-CO2 samples, suggesting that degassing occurred after sample collection. For chemically unstable waters and low-pH waters, such as those from high-CO2 mine waters, the proposed field DIC method may enable the collection of DIC data that are more representative of natural settings.","Vesper, Dorothy J; Edenborn, Harry M; Billings, Anthony A; Moore, Johnathan E","Water, air, and soil pollution",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2348-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527988/,406
88095,Shortages of Palliative Care Medications in Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Gambling with Suffering.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Shared decision-making (SDM) involves patients and clinicians choosing treatment jointly. SDM in mental health is hampered by lack of well-developed supporting tools. We describe an evidence-based patient decision aid (PDA) to facilitate SDM for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) following US National Quality Forum standards which are based upon the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS). METHODS A web-based PDA was developed by a multidisciplinary steering committee of clinicians, patient advocates, patients and a decision scientist. Development included creating content consistent with decision-making domains that are impacted by patient preference in TRD. Development was guided by literature review, group conference calls/discussions, patient and clinician interviews (N = 8), high and lower literacy focus groups (N = 11) and pilot study (N = 5). The PDA presents risk-benefit information on domains (e.g., effectiveness, mode of administration, side effects, cost) and includes values clarification exercises. Pilot study patients were administered the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) prior to and following PDA interaction and clinician SDM. RESULTS During the pilot, prior to PDA interaction, mean (standard deviation) DCS score was 42.2 (14.4) and DSES score was 86.0 (14.6) out of 100. Following PDA interaction and SDM, DCS decreased (improved) to 28.1 (SD 4.1) and DSES increased to 95.5 (6.7). All patients endorsed that the PDA helped them to: recognize pros and cons of options; understand how treatments were administered, possible side-effects, and likelihood of benefit; recognize what was important relative to the decision; organize thoughts and prepare for a discussion with their clinician. CONCLUSIONS This PDA may support SDM in TRD. A future trial to determine impact of the present SMD on decision-making quality is warranted. It also highlights gaps in comparative effectiveness trials that could guide equitable shared decision-making.","Shillington, Alicia C; Langenecker, Scott A; Shelton, Richard C; Foxworth, Phyllis; Allen, Luis; Rhodes, Martha; Pesa, Jacqueline; Williamson, David; Rovner, Margaret Holmes",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734922/,406

The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the manpower almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed.

90495,A review of reviews: Sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular disease specific to older people.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Solitaire FR can be used not only as a tool for mechanical thrombectomy but also as a detachable permanent stent. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of permanent stent placement with the Solitaire FR compared with other self-expanding stents for intracranial artery recanalization for acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2011 through January 2016, we retrospectively selected 2979 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Among them, 27 patients who underwent permanent stent placement (13 patients with the Solitaire FR [Solitaire group] and 14 patients with other self-expanding stents [other stent group]) were enrolled. The postprocedural modified TICI grade and angiographic and clinical outcomes were assessed. The safety and efficacy of permanent stent placement of the Solitaire FR for acute large-artery occlusion were evaluated. RESULTS Stent placement was successful in all cases. Modified TICI 2b-3 reperfusion was noted in 84.6% of the Solitaire group and in 78.6% of the other stent group. Procedural time was significantly shorter in the Solitaire group than in the other stent group (P = .022). Shorter procedural time was correlated with favorable outcome (ρ = 0.46, P = .035). No significant differences were found in the modified TICI grade, NIHSS score, mRS, and hemorrhagic transformation rate between the 2 groups. The acute in-stent thrombosis rate at discharge was significantly lower when a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was injected during the procedure (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS Permanent stent placement with the Solitaire FR compared with other self-expanding stents appears to be feasible and safe as a rescue tool for refractory intra-arterial therapy.","Woo, H G; Sunwoo, L; Jung, C; Kim, B J; Han, M-K; Bae, H-J; Bae, Y J; Choi, B S; Kim, J H",AJNR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-seven patients treated with single RF ablation for solitary HCC measuring ≤2 cm were assessed. RF ablation alone was done in nine patients and in 48 patients following chemoembolization, with an interval of 0 days in 6, 1-14 days in 27, 15-28 days in 6, and ≥4 weeks in 9. Ablative zone sizes, disappearance of tumor enhancement, and creation of sufficient ablative margins (>5 mm) were evaluated on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. RESULTS Both mean long-axis (4.2-4.7 vs. 3.6 ± 0.4 cm, p < 0.04) and short-axis (3.3-3.8 vs. 2.3 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.03) diameters were expanded significantly when RF ablation was done until 4 weeks after chemoembolization than with RF ablation alone. Tumor enhancement disappeared in all patients. Frequency of achieving sufficient ablative margins was significantly higher when RF ablation was done until 4 weeks after chemoembolization than with RF ablation alone (74.0-83.3 vs. 22.2 %, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Ablative zones created by RF ablation with chemoembolization become larger than RF ablation alone, leading to secure ablative margins.","Yamanaka, Takashi; Yamakado, Koichiro; Takaki, Haruyuki; Nakatsuka, Atsuhiro; Shiraki, Katsuya; Hasegawa, Hiroshi; Takei, Yoshiyuki; Takeda, Kan",Japanese journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-012-0087-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22610876/,406

However, the use of these devices is associated with higher rates of perforator and branch ischemia following the treatment of aneurysms of the posterior circulation. METHODS This work involved a single-center; retrospective study reviewing eight patients who had aneurysms related to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and who were treated with flow-diverter stents from September 2013 to May 2017. RESULTS The mean aneurysm diameter was 7.6 mm (range, 5 to 11 mm). The types of aneurysm included five aneurysms that were saccular, two that were fusiform, and one that was dissecting. All saccular aneurysms in the neck involved the PICA origin, and one dissecting aneurysm was localized in the proximal part of the PICA. Procedural success was 100% (8/8), and there were no ischemic complications. One patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage died because of rebleeding (modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 6). Other than this patient all of the patients' mRS scores were zero at discharge and at the clinical follow-up period (mean, 2.5 years). All of the aneurysms were completely occluded according to the latest angiographic controls (mean follow-up period of 19.5 months). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of PICA aneurysms with flow-diverter stents showed positive results with a high rate of technical success and low complication and mortality rates. The use of flow-diverter stents in the treatment of PICA aneurysms should be considered a safe and effective endovascular treatment option.","Oğuz, Şükrü; Dinc, Hasan","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019918824003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803331/,406

METHODS Eighty-five patients were followed up to assess recurrence (main endpoint), reoperation, mesh complications and death, from the date of index until recurrence, death or study completion, whichever was first. Recurrence, reoperation rates and death were estimated by intention to treat. Mesh-related complications were only assessed in the LVHR group, excluding conversions (intraperitoneal onlay; n = 40). Quality of life, using the European Hernia Society Quality of Life score, was assessed in surviving non-reoperated patients (n = 47). RESULTS The incidence rates with 10 person-years of follow-up were 21.01% (CI 13.24-33.36) for recurrence, 11.92% (CI: 6.60-21.53) for reoperation and 24.88% (CI 16.81-36.82) for death. Sixty-two percent of recurrences occurred within the first 2 years of follow-up. No significant differences between arms were found in any of the outcomes analyzed. Incidence rate of intraperitoneal mesh complications with 10 person-years of follow-up was 6.15% (CI 1.99-19.09). The mean EuraHS-QoL score with 13.8 years of mean follow-up for living non-reoperated patients was 6.63 (CI 4.50-8.78) over 90 possible points with no significant differences between arms. CONCLUSION In incisional ventral hernias with wall defects up to 15 cm wide, laparoscopic repair seems to be as safe and effective as open techniques, with no long-term differences in recurrence and reoperation rates or global quality of life, although lack of statistical power does not allow definitive conclusions on equivalence between alternatives.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DJBL at inducing weight loss. We assessed the effect of DJBL on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through 1 July 2017. Included were published studies that assessed DJBL outcomes in obese T2D patients. RESULTS Primary outcomes were change in HbA1c and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were change in weight and gut hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin. Seventeen studies were included. At explant, HbA1c decreased by 1.3% [95% CI 1.0, 1.6] and HOMA-IR decreased by 4.6 [2.9, 6.3]. Compared with control subjects, DJBL subjects had greater HbA1c reduction by 0.9% [0.5, 1.3]. Six months after explant, HbA1c remained lower than baseline by 0.9% [0.6, 1.2]. At explant, patients lost 11.3 kg [10.3, 12.2], corresponding to a BMI reduction of 4.1 kg/m2 [3.4, 4.9], total weight loss of 18.9% [7.2, 30.6], and excess weight loss of 36.9% [29.2, 44.6]. The amount of weight loss remained significant at 1 year postexplantation. After DJBL, GIP decreased, whereas GLP-1, PYY, and ghrelin increased. CONCLUSIONS DJBL improves glycemic control and insulin resistance in T2D patients with obesity. DJBL also appears to induce significant weight loss in this population. Additionally, changes in gut hormones suggest mechanisms similar to RYGB. Study limitations included heterogeneity among studies.","Jirapinyo, Pichamol; Haas, Andrea V; Thompson, Christopher C",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-1985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678867/,406

We performed a systematic review of published series on endovascular treatment of cavernous carotid aneurysms to determine outcomes and complications associated with endovascular coiling and PAO of cavernous carotid artery aneurysms. METHODS In September 2013, we conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for reports on endovascular treatment of intracranial cavernous carotid aneurysms from January 1990 to August 2013. Comparisons were made in periprocedural complications and outcomes between coiling and PAO patients who did not receive bypass. Event rates were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS 20 studies with 509 patients and 515 aneurysms were included in this systematic review. Aneurysm occlusion rates at >3 months after operation were significantly higher in the PAO without bypass group (93.0%, 95% CI 86.0 to 97.0) compared with the coiling group (67.0%, 95% CI 55.0 to 77.0) (p<0.01). Retreatment rates were significantly lower in the PAO without bypass group (6.0%, 95% CI 2.0 to 12.0) compared with the coiling group (18.0%, 95% CI 12.0 to 26.0) (p=0.01). Coiling patients had a similar morbidity rate (3.0%, 95% CI 2.0 to 6.0) compared with PAO without bypass patients (7.0%, 95% CI 3.0 to 12.0) (p=0.13). Coiling patients had a similar mortality rate (0.0%, 95% CI 0.0 to 6.0) compared with PAO without bypass patients (4.0%, 95% CI 1.0 to 9.0) (p=0.68). CONCLUSIONS Evidence from non-comparative studies suggests that traditional endovascular options are highly effective in treating cavernous sinus aneurysms. PAO is associated with a higher rate of complete occlusion. Periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates are not negligible, especially in patients receiving PAO.","Turfe, Zaahir A; Brinjikji, Waleed; Murad, Mohammad H; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Cloft, Harry J; Kallmes, David F",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658655/,406

Padaeus Stål belongs to a complex of other genera of Carpocorini Mulsant and Rey related to Euschistus Dallas. These genera present similarities in color, size, and shape, and share common features. However, among its four congeneric species, Padaeus bovillus Distant has been highlighted as an outlier by the posterior margins of the bucculae evanescent, while its congeneric species present posterior margins of the bucculae lobed. Thus, herein we redescribe P. bovillus and present a hypothesis regarding its phylogenetic placement within the Carpocorini. Furthermore, a new species similar to P. bovillus is described. Four molecular markers (COI, CytB, 16S, and 28S) plus 86 morphological characters were used to infer the phylogeny under Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. For the descriptions, we measured 16 morphometric parameters and dissected the genitalic structures.

95378,"Educational Inequalities in Hospital Use Among Older Adults in England, 2004-2015.",2020-10-06,"OPINION STATEMENT Acute ischemic stroke carries high morbidity and mortality. The advent of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular reperfusion techniques have helped improve clinical outcomes for patients with large vessel acute ischemic stroke. The care of the post-endovascular stroke patient is complex and encompasses almost all aspects of medicine. Hemodynamics should be optimized post procedure to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion and strict hemodynamic parameters must be adhered to minimize reperfusion injury. Though no studies have specifically examined hemodynamic goals, our practice is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 70 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 for patients following successful recanalization. Early anti-thrombotic therapy is indicated in patients with stent placement. It remains less clear which patients may benefit from additional anticoagulation or therapy with IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Careful consideration must be paid to volume status to reduce risk of contrast nephropathy and maximize cerebral perfusion. Oral care and attention to dysphagia are key in preventing aspiration pneumonia. Glycemic control should be optimized to avoid excessive hyper and hypoglycemia. In the absence of data to guide treatment of anemia, our practice is to transfuse asymptomatic anemia when Hgb < 7 mg/dL, or if the patient is symptomatic or hemodynamically unstable. Neuro-protective strategies should be considered in the context of clinical trials until further studies are complete. At a minimum, fever should be treated aggressively. Young patients with good pre-morbid functional status who continue to have large volume infarcts may benefit from decompressive hemicraniectomy. When appropriate, aggressive and early mobilization is recommended to prepare patients for acute rehabilitation. Because randomized prospective data is lacking, patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials to optimize care of this growing patient population.","Patel, Vishal N; Gupta, Rishi; Horn, Christopher M; Thomas, Tommy T; Nogueira, Raul G",Current treatment options in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-012-0216-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319133/,406
95387,"""Abandoned"" Nursing Homes Continue to Face Critical Supply and Staff Shortages as COVID-19 Toll Has Mounted.",2020-06-11,"Capsaicin is an agonist of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). Strong TRPV1 stimulation with capsaicin causes mitochondrial damage in primary sensory neurons. However, the effect of repetitive and moderate exposure to capsaicin on the integrity of neuronal mitochondria remains largely unknown. Our electron microscopic analysis revealed that repetitive stimulation of the facial skin of mice with 10 mM capsaicin induced short-term damage to the mitochondria in small-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons. Further, capsaicin-treated mice exhibited decreased sensitivity to noxious heat stimulation, indicating TRPV1 dysfunction, in parallel with the mitochondrial damage in the trigeminal ganglion neurons. To analyze the capsaicin-induced mitochondrial damage and its relevant cellular events in detail, we performed cell-based assays using TRPV1-expressing PC12 cells. Dose-dependent capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity was observed. High doses of capsaicin caused rapid destruction of mitochondrial internal structure, while low doses induced mitochondrial swelling. Further, capsaicin induced a dose-dependent loss of mitochondria and autophagy-mediated degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). Concomitantly, transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, Mic60/Mitofilin, and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 was observed, which implied induction of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for the loss of mitochondria. Collectively, although trigeminal ganglion neurons transiently exhibit mitochondrial damage and TRPV1 dysfunction following moderate capsaicin exposure, they appear to be resilient to such a challenge. Our in vitro data show a dose-response relationship in capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. We postulate that induction of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in response to capsaicin stimulation play important roles in repairing the damaged mitochondrial system.","Shibata, Mamoru; Kayama, Yohei; Takizawa, Tsubasa; Ibata, Keiji; Shimizu, Toshihiko; Yuzaki, Michisuke; Suzuki, Norihiro; Nakahara, Jin",Molecular pain,https://doi.org/10.1177/1744806920960856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985330/,406

In some cases, impending extrusion can be identified and managed before frank erosion occurs. AIMS To report our results using a transglanular approach for management of impending distal erosion of penile prosthetic devices. METHODS Patients who presented with impending erosion of penile prosthetics were identified by retrospective chart review. Patients who were managed with a transglanular surgical approach constitute the study group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical data were culled from the charts. Identified patients were contacted and were asked a battery of questions regarding their subjective assessment of the treatment's efficacy. RESULTS Six men were identified. Mean age at time of surgery was 56 years. Four men had had implants placed within the past 2 years and two had implants that had been in place for greater than 12 years. Mean operative time was 25 minutes. Four patients were successfully managed with a single repair procedure. Two men required repeat revision surgery. Of men that were available for additional postoperative contact, three of four reported satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS The transglanular approach for repair of impending distal erosion of penile prosthetics is a quick and minimally morbid procedure that produces satisfactory results in the majority of patients. Further refinements of technique will likely lead to greater overall improvement in outcomes.","Shindel, Alan W; Brant, Will O; Mwamukonda, Kuwong; Bella, Anthony J; Lue, Tom F",The journal of sexual medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01802.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20384937/,406

Although the virus is transmitted through contact and droplets, aerosol-generating procedures produce aerosols that can spread through airborne routes. Several gastrointestinal societies have released statements to protect patients and health care providers (HCPs). This study describes a barrier box that may be used as an adjunctive device in addition to personal protective equipment during endoscopies. Methods A transparent acrylic box called ""Endoshield"" was created to place over patient's head and shoulders and was tested for its ease of use for the endoscopist and suitability for patient size and position. Results Twelve children (66.67%, male) with a median age of 9 years (range, 2-11 years) underwent emergency or urgent endoscopy between April and June 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. The most common presenting symptom was life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding (8/12, 66.67%), while the rest had urgent symptoms (4/12, 33.33%). The ""Endoshield"" was suitable for all patient positions (left lateral position: 9/12, 75% and supine position: 3/12, 25%). The patients and HCPs were followed up for their symptoms on day 14, and none of them had any symptoms of concern.

100316,Why have we been slow to act on air pollution as a public health issue?,2020-09-21,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Preventive cardiology has an important role to play in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been observed to have a greater mortality impact on subgroups of people in the population who are deemed to be at higher medical disease risk. Individuals with cardiovascular disorders are one such COVID-19-associated high-mortality risk group. RECENT FINDINGS Evidence is accumulating that COVID-19 infection may worsen an individual's future cardiovascular health, and, preinfection/postinfection cardiovascular evaluation may be warranted to determine if progressive cardiovascular damage has occurred because of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, focusing on the association between COVID-19 severity and cardiac-specific biomarkers, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin T (TnT)/troponin I (TnI), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). TnT had the highest odds ratio or OR (11.83) indicating the greatest association with COVID-19 severity, followed by NT-proBNP (7.57), TnI (6.32), LDH (4.79), D-dimer (4.10), creatine kinase (3.43), and CK-MB (3.35). All of the biomarkers studied were significantly correlated with COVID-19 severity including severe symptoms, ICU care, and mortality (P < 0.0001, except P < 0.01 for CK-MB). SUMMARY COVID-19 infection results in short-term and long-term disease risk that may involve adverse cardiovascular health issues including heart failure. Cardiac-specific biomarkers appear to identify a subset of COVID-19 patients who have the highest risk of an adverse medical outcome. Preventive cardiology has an important role to play in the COVID-19 pandemic.The risk/benefit analysis of maintaining or eliminating the use of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) medications deserves further investigation.","Qiang, Zhiyi; Wang, Bing; Garrett, Brenda C; Rainey, R Patrick; Superko, Harold Robert",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709980/,406

For single people, their opportunities to meet a partner were completely lost. For couples who lived apart, this meant that they were not able to see their partner for many months. However, by contrast, for cohabiting couples, lockdown meant that they were forced to spend 24 h a day with each other, and perhaps their children or housemates, for months at a time. As lockdowns have loosened around the world, the possibility of a second wave arises, and lockdowns are being reinstated in many regions. The prospect of potential long-term lockdowns means that adjusting to this new normal in relationships is an important consideration.

Specifically, the built environment has a large impact on the prevention and containment of both chronic and infectious disease in humans and in non-human animals. The effects of the built environment on health can be direct, for example, by influencing environmental quality, or indirect by influencing behaviours that impact disease transmission and health. Furthermore, these impacts can happen at many scales, from the individual to the society, and from the design of the plates we eat from to the design of cities. In this paper, we review the ways that the built environment affects both the prevention and the containment of chronic and infectious disease. We bring examples from both human and animal societies and attempt to identify parallels and gaps between the study of humans and animals that can be capitalized on to advance the scope and perspective of research in each respective field. By consolidating this literature, we hope to highlight the importance of built structures in determining the complex dynamics of disease and in impacting the health behaviours of both humans and animals.This article is part of the theme issue 'Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour'.","Pinter-Wollman, Noa; Jelić, Andrea; Wells, Nancy M","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

101973,A 2-Year Longitudinal Study of Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Risk in Survivors of Stroke.,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Systematic reviews of behaviour change interventions for smoking cessation vary in scope, quality, and applicability. The current review aims to generate more accurate and useful findings by (1) a detailed analysis of intervention elements that change behaviour (i.e. behaviour change techniques (BCTs)) and potential moderators of behaviour change (i.e. other intervention and sample characteristics) and (2) assessing and controlling for variability in support provided to comparison groups in smoking cessation trials. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted of randomized controlled trials of behaviour change interventions for smoking cessation in adults (with or without pharmacological support), with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, published after 1995. Eligible articles will be identified through the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register. Study authors will be asked for detailed descriptions of smoking cessation support provided to intervention and comparison groups. All data will be independently coded by two researchers. The BCT taxonomy v1 (tailored to smoking cessation interventions) and template for intervention description and replication criteria will be used to code intervention characteristics. Data collection will further include sample and trial characteristics and outcome data (smoking cessation rates). Multilevel mixed-effects meta-regression models will be used to examine which BCTs and/or BCT clusters delivered to intervention and comparison groups explain smoking cessation rates in treatment arms (and effect sizes) and what key moderators of behaviour change are. Predicted effect sizes of each intervention will be computed assuming all interventions are compared against comparison groups receiving the same levels of behavioural support (i.e. low, medium, and high levels). Multi-disciplinary advisory board members (policymakers, health care providers, and (ex-)smokers) will provide strategic input throughout the project to ensure the review's applicability to policy and practice. DISCUSSION By capturing BCTs in intervention and comparison groups, this systematic review will provide more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, the most promising BCTs and/or BCT clusters associated with smoking cessation rates in intervention and comparison arms, and important moderators of behaviour change. The results could set new standards for conducting meta-analyses of behaviour change interventions and improve research, service delivery, and training in the area of smoking cessation.

102616,Public perceptions and attitudes to biological risks: Saudi Arabia and regional perspectives.,2016,"Rationale Severe acute asthma (SAA) can be fatal, but is often preventable. We previously observed in a retrospective cohort study, a three-fold increase in SAA paediatric intensive care (PICU) admissions between 2003 and 2013 in the Netherlands, with a significant increase during those years of numbers of children without treatment of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Objectives To determine whether steroid-naïve children are at higher risk of PICU admission among those hospitalised for SAA. Furthermore, we included the secondary risk factors tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitisation, previous admissions and viral infections. Methods A prospective, nationwide multicentre study of children with SAA (2-18 years) admitted to all Dutch PICUs and four general wards between 2016 and 2018. Potential risk factors for PICU admission were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Measurements and main results 110 PICU and 111 general ward patients were included. The proportion of steroid-naïve children did not differ significantly between PICU and ward patients. PICU children were significantly older and more exposed to tobacco smoke, with symptoms >1 week prior to admission. Viral susceptibility was not a significant risk factor for PICU admission. Conclusions Children with SAA admitted to a PICU were comparable to those admitted to a general ward with respect to ICS treatment prior to admission. Preventable risk factors for PICU admission were >7 days of symptoms without adjustment of therapy and exposure to tobacco smoke. Physicians who treat children with asthma must be aware of these risk factors.","Boeschoten, Shelley A; Boehmer, Annemie L; Merkus, Peter J; van Rosmalen, Joost; de Jongste, Johan C; Fraaij, Pieter L A; Molenkamp, Richard; Heisterkamp, Sabien G; van Woensel, Job B; Kapitein, Berber; Haarman, Eric G; Wösten-van Asperen, Roelie M; Kneyber, Martin C; Lemson, Joris; Hartman, Stan; van Waardenburg, Dick A; Bunker-Wiersma, Heleen E; Brouwer, Carole N; van Ewijk, Bart E; Landstra, Anneke M; Verwaal, Mariel; Vaessen-Verberne, Anja A; Hammer, Sanne; Buysse, Corinne M; de Hoog, Matthijs",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00126-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832524/,406

We aimed to examine prefecture-level spatial heterogeneity and clustering of the associations of economic and health care factors with infant mortality rates (IMR) in China. IMR data in 348 prefectures were calculated and adjusted, and economic and health care data were collected in each prefecture in China, 2010. Stepwise regression was used to select important variables, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to examine the spatial variations of the relationships between economic and health care factors and IMR. The k-means clustering was developed to elucidate the spatial clustering patterns of the GWR coefficients. The results showed that three important variables were selected in the multivariable regression model, including per capita income of rural residents, Engel's coefficient of rural residents, and proportion of government health expenditure. The GWR with these three variables revealed spatial heterogeneity of the associations between IMR and economic and health care factors; western China generally had higher GWR R-squares and stronger associations between IMR and all the three variables than the middle-eastern part of China. Based on the GWR coefficients, three distinct spatial clusters were identified. This study contributes new findings on the spatial heterogeneity of the associations between economic and health care factors and infant mortality rate in China, which calls for region-specific policies to reduce infant mortality in China.","Wang, Shaobin; Wu, Jun",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818850/,406

However, during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), factors other than the administered hypnotic agents may influence EEG signals, and their effects on BIS values are unknown. METHODS This report is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, controlled interventional study comparing the effect of sevoflurane administration guided by BIS monitoring (group SevoBIS) and constant administration of sevoflurane (group Sevo1.8Vol%) during CPB. Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. The relationships of BIS to SPC, CPB pump flow, arterial pressure, hematocrit, temperature, time on CPB, and patient characteristics were analysed. RESULTS No association was observed between BIS values and SPC in group SevoBIS. In group Sevo1.8Vol%, a 40 μg ml-1 increase in SPC, which encompassed the entire range of observed values of the SPC in this analysis, was associated with a decrease of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.1) in BIS values (p = 0.005). Each increase in CPB time of 10 minutes was associated with an increase in BIS values of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.11-0.39, p<0.001). Path analysis revealed that the BIS values of SevoBIS patients were 5.3 (95%CI: 3.2-7.5) units higher than those of Sevo1.8Vol% patients (p<0.001), which was the strongest effect on BIS values. Path analysis revealed a slope of 0.5 (95%CI: 0.3-0.7) BIS units per 1°C body temperature (p<0.001).

Alcohol consumption affects motor and proprioceptive functions, decreasing motor and cognitive functions and causing attention deficits. We aim to evaluate visual function and attention, and psychological profiles in consumer and abstainer ADS patients. METHODS This quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study evaluates visual function in a sample of ADS patients. The Portuguese version of the Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess patients' psychological status. The orthoptic examination protocol for visual function consisted of 11 standardized tests: VA for distance and near, ocular movements, near convergence and accommodation point, cover and prismatic cover tests, fusional vergence for distance and near, near stereoacuity, chromatic vision, contrast sensitivity and visual attention. RESULTS The sample included 176 patients. 121 were consumers and 55 were abstainers, aged between 31 and 72. The most affected parameters of visual function were visual acuity (80.39%), contrast sensitivity (67.50%), convergence at distance (66.44%) and near stereopsis (62.75%). Visual function was impacted in both groups. Regarding psychological status, consumers had higher averages for the Depression subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Obsession. Abstainers had the highest averages in the Obsession subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Depression.

The aim of this study was to investigate regional oxygen saturation index (rSO2) in the brachioradialis (forearm) muscle by comparing measurements in healthy subjects and in intensive care unit (ICU) septic shock patients, and determine whether brachioradialis muscle rSO2 is associated with poor outcome in ICU septic shock patients. METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study in healthy volunteers (n = 50) and ICU septic shock patients (n=19). Brachioradialis (forearm) rSO2 measurements in healthy volunteers at rest and in ICU septic shock patients were compared. Pulmonary artery catheter monitoring was used in ICU patients. RESULTS Significant differences in rSO2 were observed between healthy volunteers and ICU septic shock patients at ICU admission (68.7±4.9 vs. 55.0±13.0; p<0.001). When comparing septic shock survivors and nonsurvivors, significant differences were observed in rSO2 at baseline (64.5±8.9 vs. 47.5±10.7; p<0.01), 12 hours (67.3±9.6 vs. 45.0±14.9; p<0.01), and 24 hours (65.7±7.0 vs. 50.1±10.3; p<0.01).

METHOD Five women completed two bouts of cycling at the same relative workload (55% Wmax) for 120 minutes on acute exposure to HA (3375m) and at sea level (~113m). In each trial, participants ingested 1.2 g.min of glucose (enriched with C glucose) and 0.6 g.min of fructose (enriched with C fructose) before and every 15 minutes during exercise. Indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry were used to calculate fat oxidation, total and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation and endogenous glucose oxidation derived from liver and muscle glycogen. RESULTS The rates and absolute contribution of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation was significantly lower at HA compared with sea level (ES>0.99, P<0.024), with the relative exogenous carbohydrate contribution approaching significance (32.6±6.1 vs. 36.0±6.1%, ES=0.56, P=0.059) during the second hour of exercise.

CONCLUSION In women, acute exposure to HA reduces the reliance on exogenous carbohydrate oxidation during cycling at the same relative exercise intensity.Keys WordsAcute Hypoxia, Carbon Isotope, Exogenous Carbohydrate Oxidation, Liver Glycogen, Muscle Glycogen, Plasma Glucose Oxidation.","O'Hara, John P; Duckworth, Lauren; Black, Alistair; Woods, David R; Mellor, Adrian; Boos, Christopher; Gallagher, Liam; Tsakirides, Costas; Arjomandkhah, Nicola C; Morrison, Douglas J; Preston, Thomas; King, Roderick Fgj",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206498/,406
108839,"Letter to the Editor Regarding Nogueira et al ""Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal"".",2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVES Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many pregnant patients experienced barriers in accessing opioid use disorder (OUD) medication. This project surveyed buprenorphine treatment clinics to determine how many accepted pregnant women before and then during the pandemic. Of those clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic, respondents were asked what services were provided and what forms of payment they accepted. METHODS Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (N = 490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. RESULTS Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.","Lensch, Ashley C; Hairston, Essence; Carter, Ginny; Jones, Hendrée E",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606424/,406
109364,A structured program for perinatal depression and anxiety to be adopted in the emergencies.,2021,"COVID-19 has complicated wildfire management and public safety for the 2020 fire season. It is unclear whether COVID-19 has impacted the ability of residents in the wildland-urban interface to prepare for and evacuate from wildfire, or the extent to which residents feel their household's safety has been affected. Several areas with high wildfire risk are also experiencing record numbers of COVID-19 cases, including the state of Arizona in the southwestern United States. We conducted a mixed-mode survey of households in close proximity to two recent wildfires in rural Arizona to better understand whether residents living in the wildland-urban interface perceive COVID-19 as a factor in wildfire safety. Preliminary data suggest that the current challenges around collective action to address wildfire risk may be further exacerbated due to COVID-19, and that the current pandemic has potentially widened existing disparities in household capacity to conduct wildfire risk mitigation activities in the wildland-urban interface. Proactive planning for wildfire has also increased perceived ability to practice safe distancing from others during evacuation, highlighting the benefits that household planning for wildfire can have on other concurrent hazards. Parallels in both the wildfire and pandemic literature highlight vast opportunities for future research that can expand upon and advance our findings.","Edgeley, Catrin M; Burnett, Jack T",Fire,https://doi.org/10.3390/fire3030041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111035/,406

110112,Assessing Telemedicine Unreadiness Among Older Adults in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-03,"Objectives The more often the endoscopy sedation is performed, the more the risk of adverse events, and therefore, advanced monitoring becomes more and more essential in endoscopy units. The present study aims to evaluate whether the Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring is an early predictor of respiratory depression and to determine the compliance between commonly used clinical sedation score. Methods This study was approved by the ethics committee. The sample consisted of 60 patients aged 18 to 50 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). All patients received propofol mediated sedation. Ramsay sedation score (RSS) was used as a clinical sedation score to assess the depth of sedation. Participants were attached to a BIS monitor. Perioperative hemodynamics, BIS values, the mean dose of propofol, procedure duration, apnea, frequency of oxygen desaturation and airway-related interventions, as well as demographic parameters, were recorded. BIS scores were blinded to RSS data. Results The study sample consisted of 60 patients (36 females) aged 18 to 50 years (mean: 36.10±8.02). The mean procedure time and the dose of propofol were 32.70±1.79 min and 287.17±59.66 mg, respectively. The cut-off values for respiratory depression were as follows. At the 15th min of measurement, the BIS score of 60 had 96.2% sensitivity and 42.9% specificity. At the 20th min of measurement, the BIS score of 59.50 had 98.2% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. At the 25th min of measurement, the BIS score of 59.00 had 98.3% sensitivity and 50.0% specificity. Regression analysis showed that the mean BIS score (p=0.000, 95%CI-0.110-0.043) increased by 0.076 with a unit increase in the RSS. Conclusion BIS was highly correlated with RSS, and therefore, can be used to avoid respiratory depression during sedation.","Kilic, Ebru Tarikci; Sayar, Suleyman",Sisli Etfal Hastanesi tip bulteni,https://doi.org/10.14744/semb.2020.10476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364885/,406

METHODS A literature review was conducted searching for all articles relating novel technique of surgical management of patients with use of prosthetic reinforcements vaginally. The classification was made from descriptions found and then assessed by questionnaires filled out by surgeons. RESULTS The classification takes account of all the techniques available today and can integrate new. Among the surgeons, 56.5% (13/23) found that the POP-ST is adapted to reflect the reality and variety of techniques and 60.8% (14/23) will be ready for daily use. CONCLUSION A classification covering all the techniques put them at risk of a final tool too complex for routine use. The simplification would make it more usable but limited the comprehensiveness and evolutionary. Only 23 surgeons returned the questionnaire. A larger sample would be desirable. The POP-ST is the first classification of this type. We believe that it would assess the new techniques to better understand the complications.","Mourtialon, P; Delorme, E; Douvier, S; Mares, P; Sagot, P; de Tayrac, R","Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgyn.2010.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727681/,406

Aims: We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk by sampling Chinese Weibo users and analyzing their social media messages. Method: We predicted the probability of suicide (including hopelessness, suicidal ideation, negative self-evaluation, and hostility) of Weibo users in order to assess the changes in suicide probability at different times. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to examine the differences in suicide probability in different regions during different periods. Results: There was no significant difference in suicide probability between profoundly infected areas (PIAs) and less infected areas (LIAs) before the outbreak of COVID-19. LIAs had an increase in hopelessness during the COVID-19 growth period, while hopelessness and hostility in PIA increased during the COVID-19 decline period, indicating potential suicide probability. Limitations: Results should be interpreted with caution, and cross-cultural research may be considered in the future. Conclusion: COVID-19 has a dynamic impact on suicide probability.

112012,Helping nursing homes to manage the COVID-19 crisis: an illustrative example from France.,2020-07-28,"Historically, the ocular toxicity of manufactured consumer materials has been evaluated using the rabbit in vivo Draize rabbit eye test. The animal data obtained were used by the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS) to define the classification and labelling (C&L) for eye damage/irritation endpoint. However, the Draize test, a method which was never formally validated, has been widely criticized because of its technical limitations. In addition, ethical and economic issues and advances in scientific knowledge, and political and public pressures have made animal experimentation unsustainable. This scenario has consequently led to the development of nonanimal testing and protocols/approaches with considerable predictive value and relevance for humans. It is widely accepted that one single nonanimal method cannot cover all the criteria of damage/inflammation assessed by regulatory adopted in vivo animal testing. Thus, integrated testing strategies (ITS) have been proposed, including a tiered testing approach combining different nonanimal testing with different endpoints, which have been used for regulatory purposes, on a case-by-case basis and within integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA), to identify materials according to their ability to trigger eye damage. In particular, the top-down and bottom-up approaches have been recommended for the C&L of materials, which cause serious eye damage or eye irritation, respectively. This chapter describes detailed protocols for eye irritation testing based on cells (Short Time Exposure-STE, OECD No. 491/2017), a vascularized membrane (the Hen's Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane-HET-CAM) and corneal tissue (Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability-BCOP, OECD No. 437/2017), which can be applied using top-down or bottom-up approaches. In addition, it suggests making a corneal histomorphometric evaluation as an additional parameter in the BCOP method to differentiate materials that cause serious eye tissue damage (UN GHS Cat. 1) from materials that have reversible eye irritation effects (UN GHS Cat. 2).","Valadares, Marize Campos; de Oliveira, Gisele Augusto Rodrigues; de Ávila, Renato Ivan; da Silva, Artur Christian Garcia",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1091-6_13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423234/,406
114791,Healthcare Workers with Diabetes. Need for more attention in COVID-19 outbreak.,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND Health care teams are increasingly forced to navigate complex challenges to achieve their collective aim of delivering high-quality, safe patient care. The teamwork literature has struggled to develop strategies that promote effective adaptive behaviours among health care teams. In part, this challenge stems from the fact that truly collective adaptive behavior requires members of the teams to abandon the human urge to act self-sufficiently. Nature contains striking examples of collective behaviour as seen in social insects, fish and bird colonies. This collective behaviour is known as Swarm Intelligence (SI). SI remains poorly described in the healthcare team literature and its potential benefits hidden. OBJECTIVE In this cross-cutting edge paper, I explore the principles of SI as they pertain to systemic or collective adaptation in human teams. In particular, I consider the principles of trace-based communication and collective self-healing and what they might offer to team adaptation researchers in medical education. RESULTS From a SI perspective, a solution to a problem emerges as a result of the collective action of the members of the swarm, not the individual action. This collective action is achieved via 4 principles: direct and indirect communication, awareness, self-determination and collective self-healing. Among those principles, trace-based communication and collective self-healing have been purposefully used by other industries to foster team adaptation. Trace-based communication relies on leaving ""traces"" in the environment to drive the behaviour of others. Collective self-healing is the ability of the swarm to cope with failure and adapt to changes by permitting swarm members to be interchangeable. CONCLUSIONS While allowing teams to rely on indirect communication and to be interchangeable might create discomfort to our ways of thinking, teams outside healthcare are demonstrating their value to advance human teamwork. SI offers a helpful analogy and a constructive language for thinking about team adaptation.","Cristancho S, Sayra M",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815185/,406

The aim of this study was to test whether Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) could ameliorate SN-induced toxicity in lung and submandibular salivary gland (SMG). A sample size of 30 adult male albino rats was randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 served as control group. Rats were treated orally with 80 mg/kg of SN in group 2 or SN preceded by (15 mg/kg) GA in group 3. Lung & SMG tissues were used for oxidative stress assessment, examination of histopathological changes, fibrosis (MTC, TGF-β and α-SMA) and inflammation (TNF-α, IL-1β and CD-68). Concurrent administration of GA ameliorated pulmonary and salivary SN-induced toxicity via restoring the antioxidant defense mechanisms with reduction of MDA levels. GA reduced the key regulators of fibrosis TGF-β and α-SMA and collagen deposition. In addition to reduction of inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β) and macrophages recruitments, GA amended both pulmonary and salivary morphological changes. The present study proposed GA as a promising natural herb with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects against pulmonary and salivary SN-induced toxicity.","Elsherbini, Amira M; Maysarah, Nadia M; El-Sherbiny, Mohamed; Al-Gayyar, Mohammed Mh; Elsherbiny, Nehal M",Human & experimental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0960327120964555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33030083/,406

Delirium in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) could predict adverse clinical outcomes. METHODS We investigated a potential link between intraoperative EEG patterns and PACU delirium as well as an association of PACU delirium with perioperative outcomes, readmission and length of hospital stay. The risk factors for PACU delirium were also explored. Data were collected from 626 patients receiving general anaesthesia for procedures that would not interfere with frontal EEG recording. RESULTS Of the 626 subjects enrolled, 125 tested positive for PACU delirium. Whilst age, renal failure, and pre-existing neurological disease were associated with PACU delirium in the univariable analysis, the multivariable analysis revealed the importance of information derived from the EEG, anaesthetic technique, anaesthesia duration, and history of stroke or neurodegenerative disease. The occurrence of EEG burst suppression during maintenance [odds ratio (OR)=1.86 (1.13-3.05)] and the type of EEG emergence trajectory may be predictive of PACU delirium. Specifically, EEG emergence trajectories lacking significant spindle power were strongly associated with PACU delirium, especially in cases that involved ketamine or nitrous oxide [OR=6.51 (3.00-14.12)]. Additionally, subjects with PACU delirium were at an increased risk for readmission [OR=2.17 (1.13-4.17)] and twice as likely to stay >6 days in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS Specific EEG patterns were associated with PACU delirium. These findings provide valuable information regarding how the brain reacts to surgery and anaesthesia that may lead to strategies to predict PACU delirium and identify key areas of investigation for its prevention.","Hesse, S; Kreuzer, M; Hight, D; Gaskell, A; Devari, P; Singh, D; Taylor, N B; Whalin, M K; Lee, S; Sleigh, J W; García, P S",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.09.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915984/,406

T cell immunity is essential to resolve SARS-CoV-2 infection and is a critical component of immunity against related coronaviruses. A T cell-directed vaccine may stimulate viral clearance mechanisms that reduce morbidity and obviate the risk of antibody-dependent enhanced disease. Moreover, T cell-directed vaccines can be designed to recall memory against similar viruses and/or to stimulate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other highly pathogenic coronaviruses.

METHODS The literature was systematically reviewed and the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system was applied to move from evidence to recommendations. RESULTS We recommend that all emergency medical service (EMS) providers consider to: apply basic airway manoeuvres and airway adjuncts (good practice recommendation); turn unconscious non-trauma patients into the recovery position when advanced airway management is unavailable (good practice recommendation); turn unconscious trauma patients to the lateral trauma position while maintaining spinal alignment when advanced airway management is unavailable [strong recommendation, low quality of evidence (QoE)]. We suggest that intermediately trained providers use a supraglottic airway device (SAD) or basic airway manoeuvres on patients in cardiac arrest (weak recommendation, low QoE). We recommend that advanced trained providers consider using an SAD in selected indications or as a rescue device after failed endotracheal intubation (ETI) (good practice recommendation). We recommend that ETI should only be performed by advanced trained providers (strong recommendation, low QoE). We suggest that videolaryngoscopy is considered for ETI when direct laryngoscopy fails or is expected to be difficult (weak recommendation, low QoE). We suggest that advanced trained providers apply cricothyroidotomy in 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' situations (weak recommendation, low QoE).

Although the knowledge base surrounding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 has grown rapidly, significant gaps in our knowledge remain and inaccurate information continues to circulate. This review will discuss the interaction between asthma and COVID-19 to provide a comprehensive understanding based on the currently available published data. RECENT FINDINGS Non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, but SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to exacerbate asthma. Data thus far strongly suggest that patients with asthma are at no increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or more severe disease if infected with COVID-19. Although the data are extremely limited on inhaled corticosteroids and biologic medications, there remain no data suggesting that these therapeutics positively or negatively impact the severity or outcome of COVID-19. SUMMARY Data are rapidly evolving regarding COVID-19 and asthma. At this time, asthma does not appear to positively or negatively affect outcomes of COVID-19; however, it is imperative that practitioners keep abreast of the changing literature as we await a vaccine and control of this pandemic.","Timberlake, Dylan T; Strothman, Kasey; Grayson, Mitchell H",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0000000000000720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399389/,406
120216,Help-Seeking Behavior of Returning to Work in Healthcare Workers and its Influencing Factors During COVID-19 Subsiding.,2020-07-07,"Streptococcus suis (ex Elliot 1966, Kilpper-Bälz & Schleifer 1987) is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-positive ovoid or coccal bacterium surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule. Based on the antigenic diversity of the capsule, S. suis strains are classified serologically into 35 serotypes. Streptococcus suis is a commensal of pigs, commonly colonizing their tonsils and nasal cavities, mostly in weaning piglets between 4-10 weeks of age. This species occurs also in cattle and other mammals, in birds and in humans. Some strains, mostly those belonging to serotype 2, are also pathogenic for pigs, as well as for other animals and humans. Meningitis is the primary disease syndrome caused by S. suis, both in pigs and in humans. It is estimated that meningitis accounted for 68.0% of all cases of human disease reported until the end of 2012, followed by septicaemia (including life-threatening condition described as 'streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome' - STSLS), arthritis, endocarditis, and endophthalmitis. Hearing loss and/or ves tibular dysfunction are the most common sequelae after recovery from meningitis caused by S. suis, occurring in more than 50% of patients. In the last two decades, the number of reported human cases due to S. suis has dramatically increased, mostly due to epidemics recorded in China in 1998 and 2005, and the fulminant increase in morbidity in the countries of south-eastern Asia, mostly Vietnam and Thailand. Out of 1,642 cases of S. suis infections identified between 2002-2013 worldwide in humans, 90.2% occurred in Asia, 8.5% in Europe and 1.3% in other parts of the globe. The human disease has mostly a zoonotic and occupational origin and occurs in pig breeders, abattoir workers, butchers and workers of meat processing facilities, veterinarians and meat inspectors. Bacteria are transmitted to workers by close contact with pigs or pig products, usually through contamination of minor cuts or abrasions on skin of hands and/or arms, or by pig bite. A different epidemiologic situation occurs in the Southeast Asian countries where most people become infected by habitual consumption of raw or undercooked pork, blood and offal products in the form of traditional dishes. Prevention of S. suis infections in pigs includes vaccination, improvement in pig-raising conditions, disinfection and/or fumigation of animal houses, and isolation of sick animals at the outbreak of disease. Prevention of human infections comprises: protection of skin from pig bite or injury with sharp tools by people occupationally exposed to pigs and pig products, prompt disinfection and dressing of wounds and abrasions at work, protection of the respiratory tract by wearing appropriate masks or repirators, consulting a doctor in the case of febrile illness after exposure to pigs or pork meat, avoidance of occupations associated with exposure to pigs and pork by immunocompomised people, avoidance of consumption of raw pork or pig blood, adequate cooking of pork, and health education.","Dutkiewicz, Jacek; Sroka, Jacek; Zając, Violetta; Wasiński, Bernard; Cisak, Ewa; Sawczyn, Anna; Kloc, Anna; Wójcik-Fatla, Angelina",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/79813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29284248/,406

We here report the crystal structure of the aggregation-prone region of Staphylococcus aureus Bap which adopts a dumbbell-shaped fold. The middle module (MM) connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes consists of a tandem of novel double-Ca2+ -binding motifs involved in cooperative interaction networks, which undergoes Ca2+ -dependent order-disorder conformational switches. The N-terminal lobe is sufficient to mediate amyloid aggregation through liquid-liquid phase separation and maturation, and subsequent biofilm formation under acidic conditions. Such processes are promoted by disordered MM at low [Ca2+ ] but inhibited by ordered MM stabilized by Ca2+ binding, with inhibition efficiency depending on structural integrity of the interaction networks. These studies illustrate a novel protein switch in pathogenic bacteria and provide insights into the mechanistic understanding of Bap proteins in modulation of functional amyloid and biofilm formation, which could be implemented in the anti-biofilm drug design.","Ma, Junfeng; Cheng, Xiang; Xu, Zhonghe; Zhang, Yikan; Valle, Jaione; Fan, Shilong; Zuo, Xiaobing; Lasa, Iñigo; Fang, Xianyang",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020107500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046916/,406

Using a high-fidelity simulator, participants provided airway management according to the SARS-CoV-2 protocol. A nonvisible fluorescent marker was used as a surrogate marker of contamination. We assessed ultraviolet light visualization of the fluorescent marker after doffing and satisfaction with donning, use during simulation, and doffing. We found that after doffing, markers were not visualized on any of the participants and that the median satisfaction scores of the alternative and standard BIG (sBIG) were 4 [interquartile range (IQR) = 1-5] and 4 (IQR = 2-4), respectively.

Their resistance to degradation makes them dangerous for the marine environment. In this study, the degradation of the four main plastics (Nylon, Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) found in the sea was observed for 6.5 months as they were exposed to UV irradiation in a marine environment. Data on changes in the physical and chemical properties of each of them were collected in order to evaluate the possibilities of material (mechanical) recycling. A thermobalance was used to look for differences in the thermal decomposition of the plastics during this time. In addition, the mechanical properties of each plastic were studied. Results showed that both thermal and mechanical properties were affected, causing a weakening of the material which became less elastic and more rigid. Furthermore, SEM and AFM images were obtained: they showed cracks, flakes and granular oxidation as well as a loss of homogeneity on the surface of the samples. These changes make mechanical recycling unfeasible, since the quality of the recycled material is insufficient to ensure a high virgin material substitution rate.","Iñiguez, María E; Conesa, Juan A; Fullana, Andrés",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343762/,406

127466,Commentary: Pandemic Inequities: Refugees' Health in the Rural United States During COVID-19.,2021-01-12,"CONTEXT Use of bariatric surgery for severe obesity has increased dramatically. OBJECTIVE To systematically review 1. the clinical efficacy and safety, 2. cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery, and 3. the association between number of surgeries performed (surgical volume) and outcomes. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), CENTRAL, EconLit, EURON EED, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, trial registries and HTA websites were searched to January 2011. STUDY SELECTION 1. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2. cost-utility and cost-minimisation studies comparing a contemporary bariatric surgery (i.e., adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy) to another contemporary surgical comparator or a non-surgical treatment or 3. Any study reporting the association between surgical volume and outcome. DATA EXTRACTION Outcomes included changes in weight and obesity-related comorbidity, quality of life and mortality, surgical complications, resource utilization, and incremental cost-utility. RESULTS RCT data evaluating mortality and obesity-related comorbidity endpoints were lacking. A small RCT of 16 patients reported that adjustable gastric banding reduced weight by 27% (p < 0.01) compared to diet-treated controls over 40 weeks. Six small RCTs reported comparisons of commonly used, contemporary procedures. Gastric banding reduced weight to a lower extent than gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy and resulted in shorter operating times, fewer serious complications, lower weight loss efficacy, and more frequent reoperations compared to gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass reduced weight to a similar extent. A 2-year RCT in 50 adolescents reported that gastric banding substantially reduced weight compared to lifestyle modification (35 kg vs. 3 kg; p <0.001). Based on findings of 14 observational studies, higher volume centers and surgeons had lower mortality and complication rates. Surgery resulted in long-term incremental cost-utility ratios of $ <1.000-$40,000 (2009 USD) per quality-adjusted-life-year compared with non-surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS Contemporary bariatric surgery appears to result in sustained weight reduction with acceptable costs but rigorous, longer-term (≥5 year) data are needed and a paucity of RCT data on mortality and obesity related comorbidity is evident. Procedure-specific variations in efficacy and risks exist and require further study to clarify the specific indications for and advantages of different procedures.","Padwal, Raj; Klarenbach, Scott; Wiebe, Natasha; Hazel, Maureen; Birch, Daniel; Karmali, Shahzeer; Sharma, Arya M; Manns, Braden; Tonelli, Marcello",Journal of general internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-011-1721-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538168/,406

Most candidates found the technical aspects of online learning easy and were satisfied with remote training overall. Across all programs, most trainees considered class length and reading load about right and felt their class participation was unaffected, though they found it harder to concentrate. Most found it no harder to start a training case, felt the shift to remote supervision had no negative effect, and were satisfied with seeing their training analyst remotely. Most trainees preferred in-person classes, clinical work, and training analyses to those offered remotely, yet in light of the health risks they said they were less likely to continue training in fall 2020 if in-person work resumed.

Here we found that, phytohormone auxin-induced, sterol-dependent nanoclustering of cell surface transmembrane receptor kinase 1 (TMK1) is critical for the formation of polarized domains at the plasma membrane (PM) during the morphogenesis of cotyledon pavement cells (PC) in Arabidopsis. Auxin-induced TMK1 nanoclustering stabilizes flotillin1-associated ordered nanodomains, which in turn promote the nanoclustering of ROP6 GTPase that acts downstream of TMK1 to regulate cortical microtubule organization. In turn, cortical microtubules further stabilize TMK1- and flotillin1-containing nanoclusters at the PM. Hence, we propose a new paradigm for polarity formation: A diffusive signal triggers cell polarization by promoting cell surface receptor-mediated nanoclustering of signaling components and cytoskeleton-mediated positive feedback that reinforces these nanodomains into polarized domains.","Pan, Xue; Fang, Linjing; Liu, Jianfeng; Senay-Aras, Betul; Lin, Wenwei; Zheng, Shuan; Zhang, Tong; Guo, Jingzhe; Manor, Uri; Van Norman, Jaimie; Chen, Weitao; Yang, Zhenbiao",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17602-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764676/,406
129442,Considerations in Addressing Social Determinants of Health to Reduce Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Stroke Outcomes in the United States.,2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents are typically excluded from clinical trials due to multimorbidity, dementia, and frailty, so there are no clear evidence-based rules for treating arterial hypertension in this population. Moreover, the role of hypertension as mortality risk factor in LTCFs has not yet been clearly established. OBJECTIVES The study aimed to investigate whether treated hypertension is associated with lower mortality among older LTCF residents with multimorbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was performed in a group of 168 residents aged ≥ 65 years in three LTCFs. Initial assessment included blood pressure (BP) measurements and selected geriatric scales: MNA-SF, AMTS and ADL. Hypertension, comorbidities, pharmacotherapy, antihypertensive drugs and mortality during one-year follow-up were extracted from the medical records. The data was compared in groups: Survivors and Deceased. RESULTS Survivors and Deceased revealed similar age, DBP, number of diseases, medications, and antihypertensive drugs. However, Deceased had significantly lower SBP (P <0.05) and presented significantly worse functional, nutritional and cognitive status than Survivors (P <0.001). Hypertension (P <0.001) and antihypertensive therapy (P <0.05) were significantly more frequent among Survivors. Significantly more of the hypertensive-treated than other multimorbid residents survived the follow-up (P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that treated hypertension had a protective effect on mortality [OR = 0.11 (95% CI, 0.03-0.39); P <0.001]. CONCLUSIONS One-year survival of LTCF residents with treated hypertension was significantly higher than the others. Appropriate antihypertensive therapy may be a protective factor against death in frail nursing home residents, even in short period of time.","Kańtoch, Anna; Pac, Agnieszka; Wizner, Barbara; Wójkowska-Mach, Jadwiga; Heczko, Piotr; Grodzicki, Tomasz; Gryglewska, Barbara",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876894/,406

Assessing their environmental fate is crucial when taking decisions on the manufacturing, handling, usage, and release of these substances, as is the evaluation of their toxicity in humans and other higher organisms. While this data are often hard to come by, the experimental data already available on the biodegradability and toxicity of many unusual compounds (including genuinely xenobiotic molecules) make it possible to develop machine learning systems to predict these features. As such, we have created a predictor of the ""risk"" associated with the use and release of any chemical. This new system merges computational methods to predict biodegradability with others that assess biological toxicity. The combined platform, named BiodegPred (https://sysbiol.cnb.csic.es/BiodegPred/), provides an informed prognosis of the chance a given molecule can eventually be catabolized in the biosphere, as well as of its eventual toxicity, all available through a simple web interface. While the platform described does not give much information about specific degradation kinetics or particular biodegradation pathways, BiodegPred has been instrumental in anticipating the probable behavior of a large number of new molecules (e.g. antiviral compounds) for which no biodegradation data previously existed.","Garcia-Martin, Juan Antonio; Chavarría, Max; de Lorenzo, Victor; Pazos, Florencio",Biology methods & protocols,https://doi.org/10.1093/biomethods/bpaa025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376807/,406

However, little is known about its involvement in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we aimed to investigate the association between Dab2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CAD in Chinese Han and Uyghur populations.We performed a case-control study in CAD group that consisted of 621 Han and 346 Uygurs, and the age and gender matched control group consisted of 611 Han and 405 Uygurs. The clinicopathological characteristics of these subjects were analyzed. Genotyping of 4 SNPs (rs1050903, rs2855512, rs11959928, and rs2255280) of the Dab2 gene was performed in all subjects with an improved multiplex ligase detection reaction method.The distribution of the genotype, dominant model (AA vs. AC + CC), as well as allele frequencies of both rs2855512 and rs2255280, was significantly different between CAD patients and control subjects in Han population but not in Uyghur population. AA genotype may be a risk factor for CAD. For Han population, statistical significant correlation between dominant model for both SNPs (AA) and CAD was found after multivariate adjustment. After multivariate adjustment in the Han population, we speculate that rs285512 A allele and rs2255280 A allele may be potentially associated with the onset of coronary heart disease. Individuals with the AA genotype had an OR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.88, P = .01, rs2855512) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.08-1.85, P = .01, rs2255280) for CAD compared with individuals with the AC or CC genotype, respectively.Our data indicates that the AA genotype of rs2855512 and rs2255280 in the Dab2 gene may be a genetic marker of CAD risk in Chinese Han population.","Wang, Yinghong; Wang, Yongtao; Adi, Dilare; He, XiaoDong; Liu, Fen; Abudesimu, Asiya; Fu, Zhenyan; Ma, Yitong",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629690/,406

The objective of the CLIVIT Trial was to compare ligatures with vascular clips for hemostasis in elective benign thyroid surgery. METHODS This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel group superiority trial was conducted in 13 German surgical centers. Patients scheduled for at least subtotal resection bilaterally were intraoperatively randomized. The primary endpoint was resection time. Secondary endpoints were the amount of postoperative bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, wound infection, temporary (reversal within 12 months) and permanent (over 1 year) recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis, length of hospital stay, and safety. REGISTRATION ISRCTN 96901396. RESULTS Two hundred fifty patients were treated with ligatures and 241 with vascular clips. No differences in patients' baseline and surgical characteristics were observed. No difference was detected for mean resection time (clip 63.5 min ± 29.6, ligature 66.1 min ± 29.3, P = 0.258). Postoperative bleeding (mean 86 ml ± 93), reoperation due to bleeding (clips 4, ligature 2), wound infections (clips 4, ligature 4), postoperative hospital stay (mean 3.0 ± 1.9), and safety data also did not vary significantly. The rates of temporary and permanent RLN paralysis were 6.9 % (34/491) and 2.9 % (14/491), respectively. Not using a surgical drain (123 patients) was not associated with a higher rate of complications. CONCLUSION Vascular clips did not reduce the resection time. However, a 2.9 % rate of permanent RLN paralysis is of concern. Drains in elective surgery may be of no benefit.","Diener, Markus K; Seiler, Christoph M; von Frankenberg, Moritz; Rendel, Kathleen; Schüle, Silke; Maschuw, Katja; Riedl, Stefan; Rückert, Jens C; Eckmann, Christian; Scharlau, Uwe; Ulrich, Alexis; Bruckner, Thomas; Knaebel, Hanns-Peter; Rothmund, Matthias; Büchler, Markus W",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-012-0976-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729718/,406

The serum concentrations of NT, 8-isoprostane, and TAC were measured by ELISA methods. RESULTS Elevated 8-isoprostane levels were observed in all patients with DM, but this biomarker's maximum values have been seen in T1DM and T2DM on insulin groups. A similar tendency was observed for the concentration of NT in both the 1st and 3rd trimesters. TAC levels showed a statistically relevant decrease in all DM groups compared to the control. The correlation analysis showed a direct correlation between HbA1c and serum 8-isoprostane levels in the 1st (r = .27) and 3rd (r = .3) pregnancy trimesters as well as inverse correlation with TAC level (r = -.48).

We aimed to explore the contribution of central apnoeas and chemoreflex sensitization to ticagrelor-related dyspnoea in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty consecutive patients with ACS, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of obstructive sleep apnoea, treated either with ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. (n = 30) or prasugrel 10 mg o.d. (n = 30) were consecutively enrolled. One week after ACS, all patients underwent 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, pulmonary static/dynamic testing, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity assessment, 24-hour cardiorespiratory monitoring for hypopnoea-apnoea detection, and evaluation of the chemosensitivity to hypercapnia by rebreathing technique.No differences were found in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, echocardiographic and pulmonary data between the 2 groups. Patients on ticagrelor, as compared to those on prasugrel, reported more frequently dyspnoea (43.3% versus 6.7%, p = 0.001; severe dyspnoea 23.3% versus 0%, p = 0.005), and showed higher apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and central apnoea index (CAI) during the day, the night and the entire 24-hour period (all p < 0.001). Likewise, they showed a higher chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (p = 0.001). Among patients treated with ticagrelor, those referring dyspnoea had the highest AHI, CAI and chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Central apnoeas are a likely mechanism of dyspnoea and should be screened for in patients treated with ticagrelor. A drug related sensitization of the chemoreflex may be the cause of ventilatory instability and breathlessness in this setting.","Giannoni, Alberto; Borrelli, Chiara; Gentile, Francesco; Mirizzi, Gianluca; Coceani, Michele; Paradossi, Umberto; Vergaro, Giuseppe; Bramanti, Francesca; Iudice, Giovanni; Emdin, Michele; Passino, Claudio",European heart journal.

BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.","Kazaryan, Airazat M; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Røsok, Bård I; Rosseland, Arne R; Villanger, Olaug; Fosse, Erik; Mathisen, Oystein; Edwin, Bjørn",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181f66954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21107111/,406

140494,Teacher as scribe: A novel way to augment direct observation in the emergency department.,2021-04-01,"Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been associated with brain-related changes. However, biomarkers have yet to be defined that could ""accurately"" identify antidepressant-responsive patterns and reduce the trial-and-error process in treatment selection. Cerebral blood perfusion, as measured by Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), has been used to understand resting-state brain function, detect abnormalities in MDD, and could serve as a marker for treatment selection. As part of a larger trial to identify predictors of treatment outcome, the current investigation aimed to identify perfusion predictors of treatment response in MDD. Methods For this secondary analysis, participants include 231 individuals with MDD from the EMBARC study, a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating clinical, behavioural, and biological predictors of antidepressant response. Participants received sertraline (n = 114) or placebo (n = 117) and response was monitored for 8 weeks. Pre-treatment neuroimaging was completed, including ASL. A whole-brain, voxel-wise linear mixed-effects model was conducted to identify brain regions in which perfusion levels differentially predict (moderate) treatment response. Clinical effectiveness of perfusion moderators was investigated by composite moderator analysis and remission rates. Composite moderator analysis combined the effect of individual perfusion moderators and identified which contribute to sertraline or placebo as the ""preferred"" treatment. Remission rates were calculated for participants ""accurately"" treated based on the composite moderator (lucky) versus ""inaccurately"" treated (unlucky). Findings Perfusion levels in multiple brain regions differentially predicted improvement with sertraline over placebo. Of these regions, perfusion in the putamen and anterior insula, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform, parahippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, and orbital frontal gyrus contributed to sertraline response. Remission rates increased from 37% for all those who received sertraline to 53% for those who were lucky to have received it and sertraline was their perfusion-preferred treatment. Interpretation This large study showed that perfusion patterns in brain regions involved with reward, salience, affective, and default mode processing moderate treatment response favouring sertraline over placebo. Accurately matching patients with defined perfusion patterns could significantly increase remission rates.

This study explores the use of sidetone regulation during audio-visual communication as one potential technique to alleviate the effects of telecommunication on the voice. METHOD The speech acoustics of 18 participants with typical voices were measured during conversational tasks during three conditions of sidetone amplification: baseline (no sidetone amplification), low sidetone amplification, and high sidetone amplification. Vocal intensity, vocal quality (estimated using acoustic measures of the low-high ratio and the smoothed cepstral peak prominence), and self-perceived vocal effort were used to measure the impacts of sidetone amplification on vocal function. RESULTS Compared to baseline, there were statistically significant decreases in vocal intensity and increases in low-high ratio in the high level of sidetone amplification condition. Changes in these measures were not significantly correlated. When asked to rank conditions based on their perceived vocal effort, participants most often ranked the high level of sidetone amplification as least effortful; however, the visual-analog ratings of vocal effort were not significantly different between conditions. The smoothed cepstral peak prominence did not change with varying levels of sidetone amplification. CONCLUSIONS Vocal intensity decreased with high levels of sidetone amplification. High levels of sidetone amplification also resulted in increases in the low-high ratio, which were shown to be more than just a byproduct of decreased vocal intensity. The impact of sidetone amplification on vocal effort was less clear, but results suggested that participants generally decreased their vocal effort with increased levels of sidetone amplification. This was a preliminary study and future work is warranted in a population of participants with voice complaints and in a more noisy, realistic environments.","Tomassi, Nicole E; Castro, M Eugenia; Timmons Sund, Lauren; Díaz-Cádiz, Manuel E; Buckley, Daniel P; Stepp, Cara E",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.03.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992477/,406

The objective of this scoping review was to analyze the available data associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality in pediatric cancer patients and to provide useful information to plan and design strategies in this group. Methods A search was conducted, and eight articles were obtained for qualitative analysis; 110 patients were included, all from cross-sectional studies. At the time of publication, all the analyzed documents reported no deaths associated with COVID-19. Results According to the information, COVID-19 infection appears to be less severe in the pediatric population in comparison with adults and does not appear to be a cause of mortality in patients with childhood cancer.

Observations Uptake and implementation of ERAS Society guidelines, together with ERAS-related research, have increased exponentially since the inception of the ERAS movement. Opportunities to further improve patient outcomes include addressing frailty, optimizing nutrition, prehabilitation, correcting preoperative anemia, and improving uptake of ERAS worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. Challenges facing enhanced recovery today include implementation, carbohydrate loading, reversal of neuromuscular blockade, and bowel preparation. The COVID-19 pandemic poses both a challenge and an opportunity for ERAS. Conclusions and Relevance To date, ERAS has achieved significant benefit for patients and health systems; however, improvements are still needed, particularly in the areas of patient optimization and systematic implementation.

Three scenarios were estimated: Scenario 1 with official MINSAL data; scenario 2 with official MINSAL data and recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health; and scenario 3 with official MINSAL data, recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health, and without considering deaths in the total recovered. There are considerable differences between scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3 in the number of deaths, active patients, and duration of the disease. Scenario 3, considered the most adverse, estimates a total of 11,000 infected people, 1,151 deaths, and that the peak of the disease will occur in the first days of May.

144353,The occupational risk of Helicobacter pylori infection: a systematic review.,2018,"Viral infection of the liver can lead to severe tissue damage when high levels of viral replication and spread in the organ are coupled with strong induction of inflammatory responses. Here we report an unexpected correlation between the expression of a functional X domain encoded by the hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), the high-level production of inflammatory cytokines, and the induction of acute viral hepatitis in mice. X-domain (also called macro domain) proteins possess poly-ADP-ribose binding and/or ADP-ribose-1''-phosphatase (ADRP) activity. They are conserved in coronaviruses and in members of the ""alpha-like supergroup"" of phylogenetically related positive-strand RNA viruses that includes viruses of medical importance, such as rubella virus and hepatitis E virus. By using reverse genetics, we constructed a recombinant murine coronavirus MHV-A59 mutant encoding a single-amino-acid substitution of a strictly conserved residue that is essential for coronaviral ADRP activity. We found that the mutant virus replicated to slightly reduced titers in livers but, strikingly, did not induce liver disease. In vitro, the mutant virus induced only low levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In vivo, we found that IL-6 production, in particular, was reduced in the spleens and livers of mutant virus-infected mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the MHV X domain exacerbates MHV-induced liver pathology, most likely through the induction of excessive inflammatory cytokine expression.","Eriksson, Klara Kristin; Cervantes-Barragán, Luisa; Ludewig, Burkhard; Thiel, Volker",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02082-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18922871/,406

A Scoping Review.,2020-11-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a high demand for respiratory protection among health care workers in hospitals, especially surgical N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). To aid in alleviating that demand, a survey of commercially available filter media was conducted to determine whether any could serve as a substitute for an N95 FFR while held in a 3D-printed mask (Stopgap Surgical Face Mask from the NIH 3D Print Exchange). Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85 L min-1 used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to >637 Pa (1.1 to > 65 mm H2O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR. Disinfection by dry heat, even after 25 cycles, did not significantly affect filter efficiency and reduced viral infectivity by > 99.9%. However, 10 cycles of 59% vaporized H2O2 significantly (p < 0.001) reduced filter efficiency of the media tested. Several commercially available filter media were found to be potential replacements for the media used to construct the typical cup-like N95 FFR. However, their use in the 3D-printed mask demonstrated reduced efficiency and increased breathing resistance at 85 L min-1.","O'Shaughnessy, Patrick T; Strzelecki, Brian; Ortiz-Hernandez, Monica; Aubin, Patrick; Jing, Xuefang; Chang, Qing; Xiang, Jinhua; Thorne, Peter S; Stapleton, Jack T",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1913283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989113/,406

A wide range of analytical approaches are used in metabolomics, notably mass spectrometry (MS) combined to liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE). However, none of these methods enable a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome, due to its extreme complexity and the large differences in physico-chemical properties between metabolite classes. In this context, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) represents a promising alternative approach to improve the metabolome coverage, while further increasing the analysis throughput. SFC, which uses supercritical CO2 as mobile phase, leads to numerous advantages such as improved kinetic performance and lower environmental impact. This chromatographic technique has gained a significant interest since the introduction of advanced instrumentation, together with the introduction of dedicated interfaces for hyphenating SFC to MS. Moreover, new developments in SFC column chemistry (including sub-2 µm particles), as well as the use of large amounts of organic modifiers and additives in the CO2-based mobile phase, significantly extended the application range of SFC, enabling the simultaneous analysis of a large diversity of metabolites. Over the last years, several applications have been reported in metabolomics using SFC-MS - from lipophilic compounds, such as steroids and other lipids, to highly polar compounds, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, or nucleosides. With all these advantages, SFC-MS is promised to a bright future in the field of metabolomics.","van de Velde, Bas; Guillarme, Davy; Kohler, Isabelle","Journal of chromatography.

CAPPs belong to the Primase-Polymerase (Prim-Pol) superfamily of replicases that operate in various DNA repair and replication pathways that maintain genome stability. Here, we characterise the DNA synthesis activities of bacterial CAPP homologues from Type IIIA and IIIB CRISPR-Cas systems and establish that they possess a range of replicase activities including DNA priming, polymerisation and strand-displacement. We demonstrate that CAPPs operonically-associated partners, Cas1 and Cas2, form a complex that possesses spacer integration activity. We show that CAPPs physically associate with the Cas proteins to form bespoke CRISPR-Cas complexes.

146945,Advising Medical Students During COVID-19: The Case for a Single Emergency Medicine Rotation for All.,2020-07-01,"Subversion of the host cell cycle to facilitate viral replication is a common feature of coronavirus infections. Coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein could modulate host cell cycle, but the mechanistic details remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated manipulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) N protein on cell cycle and its influence on viral replication. Results indicated that PEDV N-induced Vero E6 cell cycle arrest at S-phase, which promoted viral replication (P < 0.05). S-phase arrest was dependent on N protein nuclear localization signal S71NWHFYYLGTGPHADLRYRT90 and interaction between N protein and p53. In the nucleus, the binding of N protein to p53 maintained consistently high-level expression of p53, which activated p53-DREAM pathway. The key domain of the N protein interacting with p53 was revealed to be S171RGNSQNRGNNQGRGASQNRGGNN194 (NS171-N194), in which G183RG185 are core sites. NS171-N194 and G183RG185 were essential for N-induced S-phase arrest. Moreover, small molecular drugs targeting the NS171-N194 domain of PEDV N protein were screened through molecular docking. Hyperoside could antagonize N protein-induced S-phase arrest by interfering with interaction between N protein and p53 and inhibit viral replication (P < 0.05). The above experiments were also validated in porcine intestinal cells, and resulting data were in line with that of Vero E6 cells. Therefore, these results revealed that PEDV N protein interacted with p53 to activate p53-DREAM pathway, and subsequently induced S-phase arrest to create a favorable environment for virus replication. These findings provided new insight into the PEDV-host interaction and the design of novel antiviral strategies against PEDV.","Su, Mingjun; Shi, Da; Xing, Xiaoxu; Qi, Shanshan; Yang, Dan; Zhang, Jiyu; Han, Yuru; Zhu, Qinghe; Sun, Haibo; Wang, Xiaoran; Wu, Haoyang; Wang, Meijiao; Wei, Shan; Li, Chunqiu; Guo, Donghua; Feng, Li; Sun, Dongbo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00187-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037422/,406

However, there has been less research examining the potential for these exposures to also contribute to risk for bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to examine the association between neonatal markers of selected prenatal infections and risk for bipolar disorder. METHODS Using population-based Danish registers, we examined 127 individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 127 sex and day-of-birth individually matched controls. Based on neonatal dried blood spots, we measured antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. Relative risks were calculated for the matched pairs when examined for optical density units for antibodies to each of the infectious agents. RESULTS There was no association between any of the neonatal markers of prenatal infection and risk of bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS In contrast with studies of schizophrenia, our analysis does not support maternal infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, or Toxoplasma gondii as risk factors for bipolar disorder. However, larger study samples are needed, and data on, for example, specific serotypes of Toxoplasma and indicators of the timing of maternal infection are still warranted.","Mortensen, Preben Bo; Pedersen, Carsten Bøcker; McGrath, John Joseph; Hougaard, David Michael; Nørgaard-Petersen, Bent; Mors, Ole; Børglum, Anders D; Yolken, Robert H",Bipolar disorders,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00962.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085475/,406
149172,Making a Diagnosis Is Central to the Practice of Psychiatry.,2021-08-01,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade. The micronutrients with the most evidence suggesting a role in immune support are vitamins C and D, zinc, and polyphenols.","León-Lara, Ximena; Vargas-Castillo, Ariana; Ávila-Nava, Azalia; Guevara-Cruz, Martha; Serralde Zúñiga, Aurora E; Medina-Vera, Isabel",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829849/,406
150107,The PANDEMIC framework for encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations.,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) injection is used for treating gastric varices (GV). Determining the degree of obliteration of GV is not readily evident at endoscopy. AIMS The aim of this study was to evaluate CT portography with gastric variceal volume calculations to assess endoscopic therapeutic efficacy of NBCA injection. METHODS The study design is a retrospective series pilot study. The setting is a single, tertiary care academic medical center. Ten patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with NBCA injection of GV and had biphasic CT scans performed before and after injection therapy. Based on portal venous images, 3D reconstruction and semi-automated volume calculations of GV were performed. Pre and post injection GV volume calculations were compared. RESULTS The mean pre-procedure GV volume was 89.84 cm3. Eight patients had significant improvement in GV volume from pre-treatment versus post-treatment (95.65 cm3 vs. 49.65 cm3, P-value 0.04). Pre-procedure GV volume was not significantly different in patients treated for active hemorrhage versus no hemorrhage (101.66 cm3 vs. 72.11 cm3, P-value 0.33). Two patients had a subsequent GV hemorrhage after NBCA injection. The mean residual GV volume in these patients versus those that did not re-bleed was significantly more (127.77 cm3 vs. 38.00 cm3, P-value 0.005). CONCLUSIONS CT portography with measurement of GV volume is a potentially useful tool in determining the therapeutic efficacy NBCA injection of GV. Patients with higher residual GV volumes are at increased risk of hemorrhage and may benefit from repeat injection to reach ideal GV volumes.","Rice, John P; Lubner, Meghan; Taylor, Andrew; Spier, Bret J; Said, Adnan; Lucey, Michael R; Musat, Alexandru; Reichelderfer, Mark; Pfau, Patrick R; Gopal, Deepak V",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-011-1616-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21336602/,406
150698,Family medicine research assistants' experiences during COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study.,2020-12-30,"Outbreaks of respiratory disease were investigated in reared pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) aged approximately 18 to 32 weeks, released into the semi-wild on four shooting estates in southern England. The clinical signs in the affected birds included swelling of the face and eyes, loss of condition, gasping respirations and coughing. The gross pathology findings included sinusitis, airsacculitis, pleural oedema and lung lesions. The histopathological findings in the affected lungs were characterized by a granulomatous pneumonia. Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) was isolated from respiratory tract tissues, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on three isolates revealed two distinct genotypes, one previously associated with some electrophoretic type (ET) 1 strains and the other a novel genotype that clustered among sequences previously associated with ET 3, ET 4, ET 5 and ET 6 isolates. The localization of ORT within the lung tissue was demonstrated by fluorescent in-situ hybridization in the bronchial exudate of three cases, although not within the granulomatous lesions themselves. In each case, ORT was identified as part of a complex of other respiratory agents including avian paramyxovirus type 2, avian coronavirus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae and other Mycoplasma species, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, other Pasteurellaceae and Syngamus trachea, suggesting synergism with other agents. Exposure to other intercurrent factors, including adverse weather conditions and internal parasitism, may also have exacerbated the severity of disease.","Welchman, D de B; Ainsworth, H L; Jensen, T K; Boye, M; King, S A; Koylass, M S; Whatmore, A M; Manvell, R J; Ayling, R D; Dalton, J R",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2013.778387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581445/,406
150891,Models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research: a scoping review protocol.,2018,"BACKGROUND Several laparoscopic Duhamel-type procedures for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) have been reported, but laparoscopic, Z-shaped, colorectal, side-to-side anastomosis has not been described. Z-shaped anastomosis has been used as the treatment of choice for HD at our clinic for a long time. A laparoscopic approach was adopted to perform this Z-shaped anastomosis in 2001. We describe herein our experiences with laparoscopic Z-shaped anastomosis and evaluate the clinical outcomes. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 26 children with rectosigmoid HD underwent a laparoscopic modified Duhamel procedure comprising Z-shaped anastomosis. Mean age at operation was 17.2 months. Mean weight was 8.7 kg. No children had a colostomy. Seven children had trisomy 21 and one had Klinefelter syndrome. Laparoscopic modified Duhamel procedure was performed using three 5-mm trocars. Intra- and postoperative complications and functional outcomes were evaluated. Patients with trisomy 21 were excluded from the functional evaluation. RESULTS The operation was completed laparoscopically for 25 of the 26 patients, with only one patient requiring conversion to an open procedure because of injury to the ureter. Mean operating time was 296 min. In one case, a minor leak was observed. No infections or related complications were observed. Mean follow-up period was 50.4 months. Sudden death secondary to rotaviral enterocolitis occurred 8 months postoperatively in one case. Twenty-one of the 25 patients (84%) showed episodes of constipation during the early follow-up period, and one child required late myectomy due to sphincter achalasia. As the child grew older, the need for medication was diminished. Of the 14 patients over 4 years old, excluding those patients with trisomy 21, all achieved normal defecation without incontinence. CONCLUSIONS Our series revealed that all patients over 4 years old who underwent laparoscopic Z-shaped colorectal anastomosis achieved normal defecation without fecal incontinence. Laparoscopic Z-shaped colorectal anastomosis for HD appears feasible and safe to perform with good results.","Urushihara, Naoto; Fukumoto, Koji; Fukuzawa, Hiroaki; Sugiyama, Akihide; Watanabe, Kentaro; Mitsunaga, Maki; Miyake, Hiromu; Kusafuka, Junich; Aoba, Takeshi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2031-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044983/,406

Over 1,900 cases have been reported to date, with ∼36% fatality rate. Lack of autopsies from MERS cases has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. A small animal model that develops progressive pulmonary manifestations when infected with MERS-CoV would advance the field. As mice are restricted to infection at the level of DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor, we generated mice with humanized exons 10-12 of the mouse Dpp4 locus. Upon inoculation with MERS-CoV, human DPP4 knockin (KI) mice supported virus replication in the lungs, but developed no illness. After 30 serial passages through the lungs of KI mice, a mouse-adapted virus emerged (MERSMA) that grew in lungs to over 100 times higher titers than the starting virus. A plaque-purified MERSMA clone caused weight loss and fatal infection. Virus antigen was observed in airway epithelia, pneumocytes, and macrophages. Pathologic findings included diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation associated with accumulation of activated inflammatory monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs. Relative to the parental MERS-CoV, MERSMA viruses contained 13-22 mutations, including several within the spike (S) glycoprotein gene. S-protein mutations sensitized viruses to entry-activating serine proteases and conferred more rapid entry kinetics. Recombinant MERSMA bearing mutant S proteins were more virulent than the parental virus in hDPP4 KI mice. The hDPP4 KI mouse and the MERSMA provide tools to investigate disease causes and develop new therapies.","Li, Kun; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine L; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Park, Jung-Eun; Earnest, James T; Bair, Thomas B; Bates, Amber M; Brogden, Kim A; Flaherty, Heather A; Gallagher, Tom; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley; McCray, Paul B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619109114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348219/,406

152667,Psychiatric Symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in Older Adults with Bipolar Disorder.,2020-12-26,"Background Self-reported disability has a strong negative impact on older people's quality of life and is often associated with the need for assistance and health care services. Resistance training (RT) has been repeatedly shown to improve muscle function (e.g. strength) and functional capacity (e.g. gait speed, chair-rise) in older adults with functional limitations. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether such objectively assessed improvements translate into a reduction in self-reported disability. Objectives To assess: i) whether and to what extent RT interventions have an effect on self-reported disability in older adults (≥65 years) with functional limitations or disability; and ii) whether the effects on self-reported disability are associated with changes in objective measures of muscle strength and functional capacity across studies. Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched in June 2018. Randomized controlled trials reporting effects of RT on self-reported disability/function in ≥65 year-old adults with defined, functional limitations or self-reported disability were eligible. Data on self-reported disability/function were pooled by calculating adjusted standardized mean differences (SMD) using Hedges'g. Likewise, effect sizes for three secondary outcomes: knee extensor muscle strength; gait capacity; and lower body functional capacity were calculated and fit as covariates in separate meta-regressions with self-reported disability as the dependent factor. Results Fourteen RCTs were eligible for the primary meta-analysis on self-reported disability. The total number of participants was 651 (intervention n = 354; control n = 297). A significant moderate positive effect of RT was found (SMD: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.253 to 0.925, p = 0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was present (I2 statistic = 75,1%, p < 0.001). RT effects on objective measures of lower body functional capacity were significantly associated with effects on self-reported disability (Adj. R2 = 99%, p = 0.002, n = 12 studies), whereas no significant associations with gait capacity or knee extensor strength were found. Conclusions This review provides evidence that RT has a moderate positive effect on self-reported disability/function in old people with or at risk for disability. The effects are strongly associated with effects on objective measures of lower body functional capacity.","Olsen, Pia Øllgaard; Termannsen, Anne-Ditte; Bramming, Maja; Tully, Mark A; Caserotti, Paolo",European review of aging and physical activity : official journal of the European Group for Research into Elderly and Physical Activity,https://doi.org/10.1186/s11556-019-0230-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867068/,406

Some evidence suggests that individuals living in rural areas may be at greater risk of problem alcohol use. The present exploratory cross-sectional study sought to examine problem alcohol use at diagnosis in a sample of HNC patients by rural vs urban status. METHODS Self-reported problem alcohol use as measured by the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) was examined in rural and urban HNC patients at diagnosis (N=454). Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to examine correlates of problem alcohol use. Subgroup analyses examined HNC-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by problem drinking status at diagnosis and 3- and 12-months postdiagnosis in rural patients. RESULTS Multivariable linear regression analysis controlling for age, cancer site, cancer stage, depressive symptoms at diagnosis, and tobacco use at diagnosis indicated that rural residence was significantly associated with SMAST scores at diagnosis such that rural patients were more likely to report higher scores (ß=.095, sr2 =.010, p=.04). Covariate-adjusted subgroup analyses suggest that rural patients with self-reported problem alcohol use may exhibit deficits in HNC-specific HRQOL at diagnosis and 3- and 12-months postdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS HNC patients should be screened for problem alcohol use at diagnosis and counseled regarding the deleterious effects of continued drinking during treatment and beyond. Because access to treatment and referral options may be lacking in rural areas, additional ways of connecting rural patients to specialty care should be explored.

Janus wettability between the adaxial and abaxial sides of the banana leaf surface is revealed for the first time in this work. This has relevance for the preparation of bionic materials and an important role in the efficient and high-quality production management of pesticide spraying in banana orchards. The main purpose of this research is to analyze and study the microscale mechanism and coupling relationship between the Janus wettability of banana leaf surface and the microstructure and micromorphology. We adopt advanced modern instrument analysis technology, such as contact angle (CA) measurements, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray spectrometric analysis (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and performed tests on the adaxial and abaxial sides of banana leaves to investigate the cause of Janus wettability. The results show that banana leaves exhibit different degrees of anisotropy, mainly due to the surface micromorphology. Banana leaves exhibit a hydrophilic Wenzel state on the adaxial side and a weakly hydrophobic Cassie-Baxter state on the abaxial side. We focused on studying the coupling effect and found that the main coupling element impacting the Janus wettability of the banana leaf surface is the nanopillars microstructure, and the secondary coupling element is the content of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface. This work may lead to the design and fabrication of Janus wetting surfaces by mimicking the nanopillar structure on banana leaf surfaces and help explore the potential application of efficient and high-quality pesticide spraying in banana orchards.","Jiang, Yinlong; Duan, Jieli; Jiang, Tingting; Yang, Zhou",Micron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2021.103073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932752/,406

Renal denervation (RDN) arose as a safe and very effective treatment for TRH with early studies showing dramatic blood pressure reductions however subsequent studies have not shown such a benefit. This review discusses the pathophysiology of TRH and the results of the published studies in RDN for TRH. The initial symplicity (1 and 2) studies using the Ardian RDN catheter showed that office blood pressures were significantly reduced 6 months following the procedure. However these initial studies were limited by a lack of a true control group and inadequate blinding. Subsequent studies (symplicity 3 and simplicity flex) included patients with elevated blood pressures on 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure monitor as well as office measurements. Furthermore, both included a sham arm where patients were randomized to undergo renal angiography alone or RDN, patients were blinded to whether they were in the treatment or sham arm. These more recent studies showed that in both the control and treatment group while there was a significant BP reduction from baseline there was no difference between the groups. Thus RDN appears to have no benefit in blood pressure reduction in those with TRH. RDN currently should only be used in patients with TRH as part of a properly designed clinical study. Pre clinical data suggests that renal sympathetic overactivity is an issue in younger hypertensive patients and this may be the group in which future studies using RDN should focus.","Shaw, James A; Warren, Josephine L",Cardiovascular therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-5922.12103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25565369/,406

Cancer diagnosis, among other clinical features, increases the risk of poor outcome of COVID-19 infection. A recently validated risk calculator (COVID-GRAM) can help to guide prognosis. EVENTS COVID-19 infection caused significant clinical deterioration in this patient. A Treatment Escalation Plan of ward-based care was put in place and the palliative care team involved. The goal of care was comfort. RESULTS The patient improved clinically and retested negative for COVID-19. He was discharged to a nursing home for ongoing supportive care of his malignancy. DISCUSSION The validated COVID-GRAM calculator predicted a greater than 99% risk that this patient would require intensive therapy unit admission or die. This patient overcame significant physiological challenges to survive COVID-19, highlighting the challenges of prognostication and suggesting that palliation of COVID-19 is not detrimental to survival.","Bisson, Elspeth; Presswood, Edward; Kenyon, Jasmine; Shelton, Fenella; Hall, Toby",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620682/,406

155548,Ensuring Quality in the Era of Virtual Care.,2021-02-02,"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has spread around the world. However, the dynamic course of critically ill COVID-19 has not been described thoroughly. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 195 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Hubei province, China, between January 5, 2020 and April 3, 2020. Epidemiologic data, clinical features, treatments and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Most critically ill patients were older with higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. After critical illness onset, a total of 181 (92.8%) patients received ventilation support, of which 84 (43.1%) received non-invasive and 97 (49.7%) received invasive mechanic ventilation (IMV). Among the 97 patients with IMV, 28 (28.9%) received prone ventilation, 57 (58.8%) received neuromuscular blocked therapy and 22 (11.3%) received tracheostomy due to prolonged ventilator use. Early hypoxemia, subsequent hypercapnia, pulmonary hypertension, and finally pulmonary fibrosis were notable in the clinical course of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Eighty-nine (45.6%) patients presented with shock. Acute kidney injury (29.7%) and secondary infection (28.2%) were also notable. The overall mortality of critically ill patients at day 28 was 42.1%. ICU mortality was around 33%, as 16 patients died prior to ICU admission. A low PaO2/FiO2 ratio was an independent risk factor for death. High viral load was observed in most non-survivors. CONCLUSION ARDS and shock were notable in the critical illness of COVID-19. Ventilation support and hemodynamic support were the cornerstones for critical care. High viral load was associated with death of critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Shuliang; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Xingguo; Li, Zhifeng; Liu, Xing; Hu, Chang; Chen, Chunxi; Wang, Dawei; Peng, Zhiyong",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826818/,406

DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR share similar overall gene and protein molecule structures, and they exhibit high affinity for high-mannose carbohydrates. LSECtin, a Ca2+-dependent C-type lectin, interacts with mannose, NAcGlc and fucose. These lectins allow pathogen recognition (e.g., viruses, bacteria and allergens) and cell adhesion for dendritic and endothelial cells in different tissues, which may enhance the infection and facilitate the spread of those pathogens. A better understanding of these lectins may yield information about how pathogens are captured by particular cells and how they spread in different tissues.

Neuronal cell death during fatal alphavirus encephalomyelitis is immune-mediated; however, the types of cells involved and their regulation have not been determined. We show that the virus-induced inflammatory response was accompanied by production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10, and in the absence of IL-10, paralytic disease occurred earlier and mice died faster. To determine the reason for accelerated disease in the absence of IL-10, immune responses in the CNS of IL-10(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice were compared. There were no differences in the amounts of brain inflammation or peak virus replication; however, IL-10(-/-) animals had accelerated and increased infiltration of CD4(+)IL-17A(+) and CD4(+)IL-17A(+)IFNγ(+) cells compared with WT animals. Th17 cells infiltrating the brain demonstrated a pathogenic phenotype with the expression of the transcription factor, Tbet, and the production of granzyme B, IL-22, and GM-CSF, with greater production of GM-CSF in IL-10(-/-) mice. Therefore, in fatal alphavirus encephalomyelitis, pathogenic Th17 cells enter the CNS at the onset of neurologic disease and, in the absence of IL-10, appear earlier, develop into Th1/Th17 cells more often, and have greater production of GM-CSF. This study demonstrates a role for pathogenic Th17 cells in fatal viral encephalitis.","Kulcsar, Kirsten A; Baxter, Victoria K; Greene, Ivorlyne P; Griffin, Diane E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418966111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25362048/,406

Construction material, converting waste plastic into fuel, household goods, fabric and clothing are some of the sectors where waste plastic is emerging as a viable option. Out of these, construction material modified with plastic waste has garnered lot of attention. Modification of construction material with plastic waste serves a dual purpose. It reduces the amount of plastic waste going to landfills or litter and secondly lessens the use of mined construction materials, thereby mitigating the negative impact of construction industry on environment. This paper summarizes the developments with regard to the use of plastic waste as a constituent of construction material. Inclusion of plastic waste as a binder, aggregate, fine aggregate, modifier or substitute of cement and sand in the manufacturing of bricks, tiles, concrete and roads has been comprehensively reviewed. Also, the influence of addition of plastic waste on strength properties, water absorption, durability, etc. has been thoroughly discussed. The research studies considered for this review have been categorized based on whether they dealt with the use of plastic waste for bricks and tiles or in concrete for road construction.","Lamba, Pooja; Kaur, Dilraj Preet; Raj, Seema; Sorout, Jyoti",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16980-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34655383/,406

Despite widespread growth of this field, there are few technical reports that elaborate the details of donor arm procurement. This article details a technique for rapid donor procurement through the elbow for mid to distal forearm-level hand allograft procurement. Methods: Nine arm procurements were performed on deceased tissue-only donors provided by the local organ procurement organization, including two bilateral and five unilateral cases. Technique highlights include using a fishmouth incision through the lateral and medical epicondyles, identification of the neurovascular structures, and disarticulating the elbow joint. Results: Procuring through the elbow provides straightforward anatomy, bypasses the need to cut through bone, and allows tissue allotransplantation teams to achieve procurement, flushing, and packaging within 20 minutes. Conclusions: Procurement through the elbow is a simple procedure that streamlines the process for multi-organ donors by minimizing the time needed for hand allograft procurement. Team coordination and surgical rehearsals are essential for successful hand and upper extremity procurement and allotransplantation.","Mendenhall, Shaun D; Lutfy, Justyn; Graham, Emily; Overschmidt, Bo; Levin, L Scott; Neumeister, Michael W",Hand,https://doi.org/10.1177/1558944719863127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331207/,406

Here, we report the development of a novel tribo-electroceutical fabric (TECF) consisting of commonly available materials namely Nylon, and Silicone Rubber (SR) for the fabrication of protective gloves on Nitrile platform, as a model wearable PPE. A small triboelectric device (2 cm × 2 cm) consisting of SR and Nylon on Nitrile can generate more than 20 volt transient or 41 µW output power, which is capable of charging a capacitor up to 65 V in only ∼50 sec. The novelty of the present work relies on the TECF led anti-microbial activity through the generation of an electric current in saline water. The fabrication of TECF based functional prototype gloves can generate hypochlorite ions through the formation of electrolysed water upon rubbing them with saline water. Further a computational modelling has been employed to reveal the optimum structure and mechanistic pathway of anti-microbial hypochlorite generation. Detailed anti-microbial assays have been performed to establish effectiveness of such TECF based gloves to reduce the risk from life threatening pathogen spreading.

Measurements of NT50 are difficult to implement in large quantities. A high-throughput laboratory test is expected for determining the level of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Methods We analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer. SP IgG index was compared with 50% neutralization titers. Results The median SP IgG index values of the subjects (mean age = 43 years; 75% female) were 0.1, 1.35, 60.80, and 97.35 before and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first dose, respectively. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first dose, SP IgG titers were found to have positive correlation with NT50 titer (r=0.7535 in 4 weeks; r=0.4376 in 6 weeks). Proportions of the SP IgG index values against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the original strain were 2.029, 0.544, 1.017, and 0.6096 respectively. Older age was associated with lower SP IgG titer index 6 weeks after the first dose.

Projected climate change threatens these benefits to society3–5. Here, we assess vulnerability to climate change of 16,006 plant species present in the urban forests of 1,010 cities within 93 countries, using three vulnerability metrics: exposure, safety margin and risk. Exposure expresses the magnitude of projected changes in climate in a given area, safety margin measures species’ sensitivity to climate change, and risk is the difference between exposure and safety margin6. We identified 9,676 (60.5%) and 8,344 (52.1%) species exceeding their current climatic tolerance (i.e. safety margin) for mean annual temperature (MAT) and annual precipitation (AP), respectively. By 2050, 13,479 (84.2%) and 9,960 (62.2%) species are predicted to be at risk from projected changes in MAT and AP, respectively, with risk increasing in cities at lower latitudes.

College students have higher risk given their transitionary life stage and lack of access to enablers of food security, including federal food assistance programs. This project investigates interpersonal and community-level factors of the social ecological model that affect food choices, self-efficacy, and coping mechanisms among food insecure college students during the pandemic. Describe facilitators and barriers to food security among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. After IRB approval was obtained, participants (n = 18) were interviewed via a video-conferencing platform to investigate interpersonal coping mechanisms related to food security. Inclusion criteria encompassed current enrollment, participation in the on-campus food pantry, and age less than 30 years. Interviews focused on students' food acquisition and utilization, experiences with food insecurity before and during the pandemic, and feelings of stress. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and themed using a 2-coder method. Students identified lack of knowledge about food assistance programs, confusion over food assistance qualification, and lack of transportation to food assistance sites as perceived barriers to improving food security during the pandemic. Primary coping mechanisms and facilitators to obtaining food were food pantry utilization, social support through food sharing, participation in the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and engagement with community support programs. COVID-19 has further exacerbated college students' vulnerability to food insecurity. College students have limited access to SNAP and rely on interpersonal relationships and community resources to maintain food security. Findings describe unique coping strategies to access food and identify strategies to improve college student food security during the pandemic. United Way for Greater Austin.

169864,COVID-19 - Receding Second Wave: Concerns about Pediatric Third Wave,2021,"Senolytics are a group of medicinal substances that selectively remove the so-called aging cells. The available theories indicate that these cells are resistant to apoptosis and accumulate at the causal sites of many chronic disorders and diseases, are metabolically active, and may acquire a proinflammatory, pro-apoptotic secretory phenotype that destroys healthy tissues. This results in the release of tissue-damaging pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. The most disturbing phenomenon is the innate immunity of aging cells to these factors. Aging cells undergo also metabolic changes, i.e. decreased use of fatty acids, increased glycolysis, and increased production of reactive oxygen species, which can affect other cells and even spread the aging process. Senolytic drugs (including Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin, Navitoclax) have the ability to temporarily turn off the ability to defend against apoptosis. The senescent cells take weeks to accumulate again, so these substances can be given intermittently, reducing the likelihood of side effects. In preclinical models, it was shown that senolytics delay the processes of e.g. weakness, cancer, and dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, musculoskeletal system, lungs, eyes. However, ongoing clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and bone marrow transplantation have not yet been completed. Pending the results confirming the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these substances, they cannot be used by patients until then. Despite this, many senolytic substances are now available in the form of dietary supplements. The pharmaceutical market and the production of dietary supplements are developing very dynamically, new technologies and new applications are constantly being discovered. However, supplements are not subject to any control as to the quality of the finished preparations and their composition, which may increase the danger of their use.

170159,Diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some virulent viruses. Yet our ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 μL of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across five orders of magnitude. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022885. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were anti-viral and anti-bacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex, and proteins involved in redox activity; whether any results are specific to vampire bats could be assessed by future pan-mammalian analyses. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.","Neely, Benjamin A.; Janech, Michael G.; Fenton, M.

170629,'Psychological consequences and coping strategies of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital': A qualitative study,2021,"The innate immunity system constitutes the first line of host defense against pathogens. Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogen-binding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (∼2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.","Barreiro, Luis B.; Patin, Etienne; Neyrolles, Olivier; Cann, Howard M.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Lluís",The American Journal of Human Genetics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002929707633667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707633667,406
171734,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice among the Healthcare Professionals regarding the myths on COVID-19 vaccination - Demystified.",2021-08-01,"Aberrant levels of cathepsin L (Cts L), a ubiquitously expressed endosomal cysteine protease, have been implicated in many diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Significantly, Cts L has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19 due to its recently unveiled critical role in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. However, there are currently no clinically approved specific inhibitors of Cts L, as it is often challenging to obtain specificity against the many highly homologous cathepsin family cysteine proteases. Peptide-based agents are often promising protease inhibitors as they offer high selectivity and potency, but unfortunately are subject to degradation in vivo. Thioamide substitution, a single-atom O-to-S modification in the peptide backbone, has been shown to improve the proteolytic stability of peptides addressing this issue. Utilizing this approach, we demonstrate herein that good peptidyl substrates can be converted into sub-micromolar inhibitors of Cts L by a single thioamide substitution in the peptide backbone. We have designed and scanned several thioamide stabilized peptide scaffolds, in which one peptide, R-1A(S), was stabilized against proteolysis by all five cathepsins (Cts L, Cts V, Cts K, Cts S, and Cts B) while inhibiting Cts L with &gt;25-fold specificity against the other cathepsins. We further showed that this stabilized R-1A(S) peptide could inhibit Cts L in human liver carcinoma lysates (IC50 = 19 mu M). Our study demonstrates that one can rationally design a stabilized, specific peptidyl protease inhibitor by strategic placement of a thioamide and reaffirms the place of this single-atom modification in the toolbox of peptide-based rational drug design.","Phan, H.

171813,State-wide Genomic Epidemiology Investigations of COVID-19 Infections in Healthcare Workers: Insights for Future Pandemic Preparedness,2021-09-13,"Objectives: European consensus guidelines recommend annual screening for cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) with annual clinical, biochemical and ultrasound (USS) evaluation. Abdominal USS is initiated from age 5 in many centres across the UK;however, it has been our practice to initiate from age 2. In this study we aim to determine the incidence of liver abnormalities in young children as recent reduced access to radiological services due to the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted us to re-evaluate our practice. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated abdominal USS reports of consecutive children aged 2–5 years with confirmed diagnosis of CF attending the NI regional CF centre between 2012 and 2020, along with relevant demographic and clinical data and liver function tests. All data was retrieved from the Northern Ireland Electronic Care record (NIECR). Results: Seventy 2–5-year-olds underwent a total of 199 scans between 2012 and 2020. In 2-year-olds, 43% of scans detected an abnormality, increasing to 70% in 5-year-olds, RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.03, 2.65, p = 0.03. 107 (53.4%) scans had one or more abnormality reported. Increased echogenicity of liver and/or pancreas was the most common abnormality identified in 72 of 107 scans (67.2%);hepatomegaly in 46 (42.9%);coarse heterogeneous echotexture in 24 (22.4%);increased periportal echogenicity in 6 (5.6%) and other incidental findings in 10 (9.3%) of scans, including cholelithiasis, splenic cyst, renal scarring, renal stones, and micro gallbladder. Conclusion: Abnormalities are present in over half of abdominal ultrasound scans in 2–5-year-olds. Increased echogenicity, liver enlargement and coarsened echotexture are indicative of hepatic steatosis, which has unclear significance in this age group. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the role of early USS in detection of liver disease, and whether any particular abnormalities may identify those at risk of development of severe CFLD.","Keown, K.; Jenkins, L.; Paterson, A.; Reid, A.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1569-1993(21)01009-2,406

During infections, Th1 immune responses are dominant, while in allergic conditions, Th2 responses are more pronounced. Th1 immune response protects the body against infections, and Th2 response leads to allergy and asthma. For maintaining health, the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses is necessary. The COVID-19 infection augments Th1 and also eosinophilic responses. On the other hand, the main protocols to control the COVID-19 pandemic require adherence to health standards, maintaining personal hygiene, frequent disinfecting of hands, using face masks, etc. In the post-COVID-19 era, this sterile condition may relinquish, and the Th1/Th2 immune imbalance may lead to an increase in the incidence of allergy and asthma. Therefore, focus on the COVID-19 infection should not deter us from foreseeing a surge in asthma and other post-coronavirus problems.","Nasab, E. M.; Athari, S.

Using mixed methods, this service evaluation sought the views of primary care clinicians using eConsult. Methods A two-phase sequential exploratory mixed-method approach was used. An inductive thematic analysis of feedback from primary care clinicians in the Salisbury Plain Area identified themes around eConsult use. These were used to construct an 18-item survey instrument. This was then distributed to primary care clinicians in Defence Primary Healthcare to assess the broader applicability of the themes. Results Four themes were identified: the impact on accessibility, the effects on working practices, the impact on the dynamics of the consultation and the effect of training and administrative support. eConsult did not save time for clinicians but was generally more convenient for patients. eConsult was often used in conjunction with telephone and face to face follow up, forming a blended consult. Accessibility was improved, but cultural factors may affect some patients engaging. Conclusions eConsult improves accessibility and can reduce telephone and face to face consultations but does not reduce workload. It should be used alongside conventional access methods, not instead of. It is useful for straightforward clinical and administrative problems but is less useful for more complex cases unless part of a blended consult. Future use could be modified to provide greater data gathering for occupational health and chronic disease monitoring and should be monitored to ensure it is inclusive of all demographic groups.","Willman, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.01.20220368v1?rss=1,406

Policies meant to limit the spread of COVID have inadvertently exacerbated the difficulties experienced by autistic children and further exposed them to vulnerabilities that will impact their mental health. In response, interventions have been adapted for remote delivery. There is limited evidence of the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical utility for treating mental health challenges in autistic children through an online medium, within the context of a pandemic. The current study used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to assess parents’ experience as they participated in an adapted manualized CBT program (Secret Agent Society: Operation Regulation, SAS:OR;Beaumont, 2013) with their autistic child. Parents reported child-related behavioral changes in pre- and post-program surveys, and both parents and therapists were interviewed about their experience through the program. The quantitative findings suggest that children learned new emotion regulation through online participation, and parents were satisfied with the program. The qualitative data supported the quantitative findings and provided new insight into factors that facilitated child engagement or made participation challenging. Overall, the findings suggest that adapted online CBT programs for autistic children can have clinical utility, and further research is needed to determine their efficacy.","Lee, V.; Roudbarani, F.; Tablon Modica, P.; Pouyandeh, A.; Weiss, J.

This study aimed to assess the effect of the two-month quarantine enforced at the beginning of the outbreak on physical activity (PA), sleep, and anxiety in inhabitants of Kerman. Methods: The present study was conducted on 911 subjects randomly selected and interviewed twice: Before the COVID-19 outbreak (Feb 2020) and at the end of two-month quarantine. The level of anxiety was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PA by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), and daily sleep hours were reported by participants. Results: A high percentage of people experienced a decrease in PA (39.6%), an increase in sleep hours (33.7%), and an increase in anxiety (16.3%) during the quarantine. Women, young people, students, and illiterate people were more susceptible to increased level of anxiety;and women, young people, hypersomniac people, and people with higher education levels experienced lower PA. Furthermore, the odds of an increase in sleep hours was higher in men and young people and lower in people with intense PA and higher levels of anxiety. The changes in the three variables were mostly related to the quarantine, although interaction between PA and sleep was also present. Conclusion: The quarantine caused hypersomnia, a decrease in PA, and an increase in anxiety level especially among young people and women. As these are also risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, it is suggested that health authorities encourage an active lifestyle in the public and provide them with economic and psychological supports during the quarantine.","Najafipour, H.; Shojaei Shahrokhabadi, M.; Nasri, H.

Aims: To use data from a large UK cohort study to assess associations between physical environmental exposures, ID, and conduct problem trajectories. Method: The sample included 8,168 Millennium Cohort Study children (1.9% with ID). Multilevel growth curve modelling was used to examine the role of physical environment characteristics in the developmental trajectories of conduct problems after adjustments for ID status. Results: Exposure to external environmental domains was not associated with differences in child conduct problems across development. Alternatively, internal aspects of the household environment: spatial density (b = 0.40, p<.001) and damp problems (b = 0.14, p<.001) were both significantly associated with increased trajectories. Various individual and familial covariates were positively associated with conduct problems over time, including: presence of ID (b = 0.96, p<.001), autism spectrum disorder (b = 1.18, p<.001), male sex (b = 0.26, p<.001), poverty (b = 0.19, p<.001), maternal depression (b = 0.65, p<.001), and non-nuclear family structure (b = 0.35, p<.001). Positive ID status appeared to moderate the effects of internal household spatial density, reporting a non-linear negative association with spatial density and conduct problems across development (b = -1.08, p<.01).

The accompanying vegetation is an integral part of the waterside space system and a source of ecosystem services and disservices. The composition of greenery in waterside spaces should therefore be preceded by detailed research. This research would be the basis for the development of recommendations for enhancement of the positive impact of vegetation on humans and minimisation of its negative effect. The aim of the study was to identify ecosystem services and disservices of vegetation in the four most important waterside recreation spaces in the city of Rzeszów, Poland, and to develop plant composition guidelines. A detailed inventory of vegetation and aerobiological monitoring of the presence of airborne allergenic pollen grains and fungal spores were carried out. Next, the ecosystem services and disservices of the vegetation were determined based on literature data and on our expert judgement. Additionally, a counting of the number of visitors to waterside areas was conducted. All these steps were used to develop recommendations for shaping the vegetation of study areas. The results of the investigations show that the boulevards along the artificial lake function completely differently than other investigated places as the area resembles an urban park, and the water is not the main attraction in this space. The vegetation of the boulevards and the nearby gravel-pit bathing area has mostly a spontaneous character and offers the widest range of ecosystem services and disservices. The management of the vegetation should focus on its health-enhancing values. The vegetation growing near the outdoor swimming pools has been designed by man. Nevertheless, it requires recomposing and is targeted specifically at the enhancement of the visual attractiveness.

Knowledge Forum is designed to make transparent and accessible means by which deep understanding and sustained creative work proceed. Accordingly, for example, rise-above notes and view rearrangement support synthesis and explanatory coherence, epistemic markers support knowledge-advancing discourse, and analytics support self-and group-monitoring of progress as work proceeds. In this report, we focus on these aspects of Knowledge Building, using a subset of analytics to enhance understanding of key concepts and design of principles-based practices to advance education for knowledge creation. Overall, we aimed to have students take collective responsibility for advancing community knowledge, rather than focus exclusively on individual achievement. As we reflect on our experiences and challenges, we attempt to answer the following questions: Do courses that introduce Knowledge Building in higher education need an in-person or synchronous component? In what ways can we leverage in-class time and Knowledge Forum work to engage students in more advanced knowledge creation?

180734,Taking leadership over psychopathogenic environments,2021,"Background: Multimorbidity (MM) is one of the major challenges currently facing health systems at the international level and tends to occupy a considerable part of the daily activity of physicians around the world. It is important to think about the medical approach to dealing with patients with multimorbidity in order to maximize the quality of the services provided by national health services, and thus to secure a better quality of life for these patients. Information about the time spent in a medical consultation with a patient with MM criteria is essential to better organize and deliver healthcare. As far as we know, no previous review has summarized the data relating to how having MM affects the length of the average consultation time. Objective: To review all the experimental observational studies that describe the impact of having MM on the average time of a medical consultation. Methods: This systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM criteria. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The comparator used was the length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included. Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included. The study shows that there is a clear trend for patients with MM criteria to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p<0.001). The global quality of this study was considered Satisfactory. Conclusions: It is imperative to study the consultation time spent on patients with MM criteria. Finding a longer consultation time indicates it is important to rethink and adapt GPs lists and time planning to be able to give better medical care to patients with MM by providing agendas that have specific times set aside for these patients and allocating enough time for every task required.","Tadeu, A.

All participants underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and repeated bilateral measurements of intra-auricular temperature at time points 0, 30 and 120 minutes during the OGTT using a tympanic thermometer (Covidien Genius 2). Results: Baseline temperature was 0.17°C lower in males compared to females (p = 0.001) and inversely associated with age (p < 0.0001). During the OGTT, there was a significant increase in body temperature (0.18 ± 0.34°C). This response was present in females and males. BMI was negatively associated with the increase of temperature during the OGTT (p = 0.0147). Participants with higher BMI displayed higher fasting temperatures, but less increase of temperature during the OGTT. Body temperature was not associated with glycemia, insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion, neither in females nor males. Conclusions: There is a robust increase in body temperature during a glucose load that can be captured by intra-auricular temperature measurements. We did not detect any associations of the body temperature with glucose metabolism, arguing against a major contribution of the variability of body temperature in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, the rise in temperature in response to oral glucose is reduced in obesity and might therefore be involved in body weight regulation. Disclosure: A. Vosseler: None. L. Fritsche: None. J.

IL-6-/- and IL-6+/+ mice of resistant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H-2b haplotype intracerebrally infected with Theiler's virus cleared the infection normally without development of viral persistence, lethal neuronal infection, or late phase demyelination. In contrast, infection of IL-6-/- mice on a susceptible H-2q haplotype resulted in frequent deaths and severe neurologic deficits within 2 weeks of infection as compared with infected IL-6+/+ H-2q littermate controls. Morphologic analysis demonstrated dramatic injury to anterior horn neurons of IL-6-/- H-2q mice at 12 d after infection. Infectious viral titers in the CNS (brain and spinal cord combined) were equivalent between IL-6-/- H-2q and IL-6+/+ H-2q mice. In contrast, more viral RNA was detected in the spinal cord of IL-6-/- mice compared with IL-6+/+ H-2q mice. Virus antigen was localized predominantly to anterior horn cells in infected IL-6-/- H-2q mice. IL-6 deletion did not affect the humoral response directed against virus, nor did it affect the expression of CD4, CD8, MHC class I, or MHC class II in the CNS. Importantly, IL-6 was expressed by astrocytes of infected IL-6+/+ mice but not in astrocytes of IL-6-/- mice or uninfected IL-6+/+ mice. Furthermore, expression of various chemokines was robust at 12 d after infection in both H-2b and H-2q IL-6-/- mice, indicating that intrinsic CNS inflammatory responses did not depend on the presence of IL-6. Finally, in vitro analysis of virus-induced death in neuroblastoma-spinal cord-34 motor neurons and primary anterior horn cell neurons showed that IL-6 exerted a neuroprotective effect. These data support the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a critical role in protecting specific populations of neurons from irreversible injury.","Pavelko, Kevin D; Howe, Charles L; Drescher, Kristen M; Gamez, Jeff D; Johnson, Aaron J; Wei, Tao; Ransohoff, Richard M; Rodriguez, Moses",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12533608/,406
188696,Mental and physical complaints in thyroid disorders in the general population.,2005,"INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged atypical pneumonia caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Chest radiographic appearances have been reported as non-specific, ranging from normal to peribronchial thickening and ill-defined airspace shadowing. This study is a retrospective review of chest radiographic findings in children with suspected and probable SARS during the 2003 outbreak in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS We focused on children admitted to the SARS treatment ward from March 2003 to May 2003. Chest radiographs of children admitted with suspected or probable SARS as well as other febrile illness during this period were retrospectively and independently reviewed by 3 radiologists. The radiographs were randomised and anonymised before interpretation. Subsequently, we identified the radiographs of patients who were categorised as suspected or probable SARS. We present our findings in these patients' radiographs. RESULTS A total of 67 patients' serial chest radiographs were interpreted. Of these, we subsequently selected those patients with suspected or probable SARS for analysis. The radiographic abnormalities in suspected or probable SARS patients consisted of patchy ground glass opacities or patchy airspace consolidation. The abnormalities had a predominantly lower zone distribution on chest radiographs, followed by mid-zone involvement. There was a slight preponderance of peripheral zone involvement. There was equal distribution of abnormalities in both lungs. All the children with radiographic abnormalities made uneventful recoveries and had normal radiographs on follow-up review. CONCLUSIONS In children, SARS appears to have a relatively mild and nonspecific pattern of respiratory illness. The radiographic features in children with suspected or probable SARS in our study were comparable to other clusters of paediatric patients during initial presentation. It is difficult to distinguish SARS in children from other viral pneumonias on radiographic features alone. Positive travel history to endemic regions or positive contact history, and laboratory findings of lymphopaenia, leukopaenia and thrombocytopaenia are important clues.","Emmanuel, Jaiman V; Pua, Uei; Wansaicheong, Gervais K L; Goh, Julian P N; Tsou, Ian Y Y","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16830001/,406

Whether any of these also function in viral RNA synthesis is unknown. For the related mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), it has been suggested that the nucleocapsid protein (N) is involved in viral RNA synthesis. As described for MHV, we established that the EAV N protein colocalizes with the viral replication complex, suggesting a role in RNA synthesis. Using an infectious cDNA clone, point mutations and deletions were engineered in the EAV genome to disrupt the expression of each of the structural genes. All structural proteins, including N, were found to be dispensable for genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription. We also constructed a mutant in which translation of the intraleader ORF was disrupted. This mutant had a wild-type phenotype, indicating that, at least in cell culture, the product of this ORF does not play a role in the EAV replication cycle.","Molenkamp, R; van Tol, H; Rozier, B C; van der Meer, Y; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10993938/,406

Such reviews fail to assess states' actual capacity for meeting the challenges they may face during an emergency, as evidenced by activities undertaken during the various phases of a disaster. This article examines North Carolina's public health preparedness and response performance during two hurricanes, Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Isabel in 2003, as well as capacity building activities in the intervening years. North Carolina created new infrastructures, enhanced laboratory capacity, and strengthened communications after Hurricane Floyd. These activities facilitated implementation of functional capabilities through effective centralized communication, command and control incident management, and a rapid needs assessment and medical surveillance during Hurricane Isabel. North Carolina continues to implement these capabilities in public health emergencies. Measuring and implementing functional capabilities during exercises or real events facilitates achievement of preparedness performance standards, goals, and objectives.","Davis, Mary V; MacDonald, Pia D M; Cline, J Steven; Baker, Edward L",Public health reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17236604/,406

The circumstances surrounding the emergence of this pathogen, and the factors that facilitated the initial cross-species transmission, are still incompletely understood. It became apparent in the early days of the outbreak that the virus can be directly transmitted between humans. Pathogens that originate in animal reservoirs and subsequently acquire the potential for human-to-human transmission have caused outbreaks throughout human history. Although each outbreak is marked by its own particularities, it is important to remember the teachings that emerge from previous epidemics and pandemics. Integrating the important lessons of the past will provide the best opportunity to understand host-pathogen interaction and the most powerful approach to implementing effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures.","Stein, Richard A",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19470591/,406
191268,Research during COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from the Ethics Committees of a Lower Middle Income Country.,2020,"Attachment to a cell surface receptor can be a major determinant of virus tropism. Previous studies have shown that human respiratory coronavirus HCV-229E uses human aminopeptidase N (hAPN [CD13]) as its cellular receptor for infection of lung fibroblasts. Although human coronaviruses are recognized respiratory pathogens, occasional reports have suggested their possible neurotropism. We have previously shown that human neural cells, including glial cells in primary cultures, are susceptible to human coronavirus infection in vitro (A. Bonavia, N. Arbour, V. W. Yong, and P. J. Talbot, J. Virol. 71:800-806, 1997). However, the only reported expression of hAPN in the nervous system is at the level of nerve synapses. Therefore, we asked whether hAPN is utilized as a cellular receptor for infection of these human neural cell lines. Using flow cytometry, we were able to show the expression of hAPN on the surfaces of various human neuronal and glial cell lines that are susceptible to HCV-229E infection. An hAPN-specific monoclonal antibody (WM15), but not control antibody, inhibited the attachment of radiolabeled HCV-229E to astrocytic, neuronal, and oligodendrocytic cell lines. A correlation between the apparent amount of cell surface hAPN and the level of virus attachment was observed. Furthermore, the presence of WM15 inhibited virus infection of these cell lines, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. These results indicate that hAPN (CD13) is expressed on neuronal and glial cell lines in vitro and serves as the receptor for infection by HCV-229E. This further strengthens the neurotropic potential of this human respiratory virus.","Lachance, C; Arbour, N; Cashman, N R; Talbot, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9658094/,406
191464,Resetting Your Priorities in Family Medicine Post-Pandemic.,2021,"A fundamental aspect of visuomotor behavior is deciding where to look or move next. Under certain conditions, the brain constructs an internal representation of stimulus location on the basis of previous knowledge and uses it to move the eyes or to make other movements. Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex were modulated when such an internal representation was acquired: Responses to a stimulus were affected progressively by sequential presentation of the stimulus at one location but not when the location was varied randomly. Responses of individual neurons were spatially tuned for gaze direction and tracked the Bayesian probability of stimulus appearance. We propose that the representation arises in a distributed cortical network and is associated with systematic changes in response selectivity and dynamics at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.","Sharma, Jitendra; Dragoi, Valentin; Tenenbaum, Joshua B; Miller, Earl K; Sur, Mriganka",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12805552/,406

Coronavirus particles were detected in the limbic system by electron microscopy. The combination of temporal propagation through an anatomical-physiological central nervous system pathway and anatomical restriction of viral infection suggests that specific interneuronal transport is important in spread of the virus.

192376,The Greek translation of the symptoms rating scale for depression and anxiety: preliminary results of the validation study.,2003,"BACKGROUND Impetigo, scabies, and fungal skin infections disproportionately affect populations in resource-limited settings. Evidence for standard treatment of skin infections predominantly stem from hospital-based studies in high-income countries. The evidence for treatment in resource-limited settings is less clear, as studies in these populations may lack randomisation and control groups for cultural, ethical or economic reasons. Likewise, a synthesis of the evidence for public health control within endemic populations is also lacking. We propose a systematic review of the evidence for the prevention, treatment and public health management of skin infections in resource-limited settings, to inform the development of guidelines for the standardised and streamlined clinical and public health management of skin infections in endemic populations. METHODS The protocol has been designed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. All trial designs and analytical observational study designs will be eligible for inclusion. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature will include PubMed, Excertpa Medica and Global Health. Grey literature databases will also be systematically searched, and clinical trials registries scanned for future relevant studies. The primary outcome of interest will be the clinical cure or decrease in prevalence of impetigo, scabies, crusted scabies, tinea capitis, tinea corporis or tinea unguium. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility assessment and data extraction using standardised electronic forms. Risk of bias assessment will be undertaken by two independent reviewers according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data will be tabulated and narratively synthesised. We expect there will be insufficient data to conduct meta-analysis. The final body of evidence will be reported against the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation grading system. DISCUSSION The evidence derived from the systematic review will be used to inform the development of guidelines for the management of skin infections in resource-limited settings. The evidence derived will be intended for use by clinicians, public health practitioners and policy makers in the treatment of skin infections and the development of skin infection control programmes. The review will identify any gaps in the current evidence to provide direction for future research.

METHODS In the 1 st, 3 rd, 6 th month after their discharge, eg. SARS-IgG, T cell subsets, blood routine, and the blood biochemistry were systemically determined in SARS convalescent patients. RESULTS The SARS-antibodies could be used as the diagnostic evidence. During the 6 months after discharge, the titers of SARS-antibodies were high, but they lowered along with passage of time. At the first recheck, the CD4(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 55.9% of patients, the CD3(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 31.2% of patients, and the CD8(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 14.0% of patients. At the second recheck, the levels of T cell subsets recovered to normal level in the most patients. CONCLUSION T cell subsets, and the number of leukocyte are abnormal in some patients convalescent from SARS. All the indexes examined recover to normal levels half year after discharge. Therefore, it is necessary to follow up the changes in the levels of SARS-antibodies.","Yin, Cheng-hong; Wang, Chao; Wen, Yan; Jiang, Li; Liu, Ying; Chen, Jiang-hong; Tang, Shu-zhen; Yue, Mao-xing; He, Zheng-yi; Zhang, Shu-wen; Wang, Bao-en",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970096/,406

195543,Ethics of health care in the Corona pandemic.,2020-07-01,"Influenza epidemics of variable extent and severity occur every winter and are frequently associated with exacerbations of asthma. Accordingly, annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for patients with asthma. However, there are very limited data concerning its protective effect in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of influenza vaccination on the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections and also asthma-related outcomes such as exacerbation rates, hospital admissions, and rescue courses of oral corticosteroids in patients with stable asthma. Between September 15 and November 7, 2001, a total of 128 patients with asthma were randomly assigned to receive (n = 86) and not to receive vaccine (n = 42). The primary outcome measures were frequency of upper respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of asthma during the winter following vaccination. Study subjects were asked to record the presence and duration of symptoms suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection and call their physician in the presence of conditions suggestive of an exacerbation until March 2002. Among the vaccinated group, 48% of the patients reported that they had no upper respiratory tract infection during the winter following injection, whereas 57% of nonvaccinated participants were upper respiratory symptom free during the same period (p > 0.05). The frequency of upper respiratory tract infection was also not different between the two groups in all severity forms of asthma (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the frequency of exacerbations of asthma between the two groups during the study period (p > 0.05). None of the vaccinated group was hospitalized due to an asthma attack; however, two patients (4.8%) in the nonvaccinated group had to be hospitalized following an exacerbation (p > 0.05). In summary, our findings do not support the protective effect of influenza vaccination for patients with asthma. However, no firm conclusions on this effect of the vaccine can be made without the data on the rate of influenza epidemic in that season and without the knowledge of the cause of upper respiratory tract infections in those patients. Therefore, we believe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including larger subgroups of severe asthmatics, are needed to evaluate the protective effect of influenza vaccination in asthma.","Abadoğlu, Oznur; Mungan, Dilşad; Paşaoglu, Gülden; Celík, Gülfem; Misirligil, Zeynep",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15260460/,406

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from all children with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), Singapore, from January to May 2020 were analysed. RESULTS Of the 39 COVID-19 children included, 38.5% were asymptomatic. Household transmission accounted for 95% of cases. The presenting symptoms of symptomatic children were low-grade fever (54.2%), rhinorrhoea (45.8%), sore throat (25%), diarrhoea (12.5%) and acute olfactory dysfunction (5.4%). Children of Chinese ethnicity (37.5% vs 6.7%), complete blood count (45.8% vs 6.7%) and liver enzyme abnormalities (25% vs 7.7%) were more common in symptomatic versus asymptomatic children. All children had a mild disease course and none required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. CONCLUSIONS The high proportion of asymptomatic infected children coupled with household transmission as the main source of paediatric COVID-19 infection underscores the importance of early screening and isolation of children upon detection of an index case of COVID-19 in a household. Symptomatic children were more likely to have abnormal laboratory parameters but they did not have a poorer outcome compared to asymptomatic cases.","Li, Jiahui; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Chong, Chia Yin; Maiwald, Matthias; Kam, Kai Qian; Nadua, Karen; Tan, Natalie Wh; Yung, Chee Fu","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164022/,406

RESULTS Depression (20.64 +/- 15.20) and anxiety levels (14.72 +/- 12.36) were significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to peritoneal dialysis (13.54 +/- 12.51; 12.74 +/- 11.21) and control groups (7.17 +/- 5.58; 9.86 +/- 9.19). In peritoneal dialysis group, as depression and anxiety levels increased, body image was disturbed and sexual satisfaction decreased. In peritoneal dialysis group, body image (86.98 +/- 23.63) was better than hemodialysis group (101.58 +/- 26.51) and was not different from the control group (83.67 +/- 22.11). In hemodialysis group, as depression and anxiety levels increased, body image was disturbed. In both groups, long-term dialysis disturbed body image. CONCLUSION Patients should be informed about the impacts of dialysis. Clinicians may wish to monitor dialysis-users for anxiety, depression, dyadic adjustment, and body image difficulties at follow-up appointments. Interventions that target intimate partner interventions, appearance-related beliefs, and anxiety depression may be of benefit to this population.","Oyekçin, Demet Güleç; Gülpek, Demet; Sahin, Erkan Melih; Mete, Levent",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22978081/,406

This study explored these issues using qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 23 community-dwelling Chinese older adults (age 55-78 y, 12 women); 16 were physically active and 7 physically inactive. Using cross-case analyses, 7 dimensions of SWB emerged: physical, psychological, developmental, material, spiritual, sociopolitical, and social. Although elements of SWB may be shared across cultures, specific distinctions were identified. Active respondents reported the unique contributions of physical activity to the physical, psychological, developmental, and social elements of SWB. The findings suggest that physical activity could enhance the quality of life in Chinese older adults.","Ku, Po-Wen; McKenna, Jim; Fox, Kenneth R",Journal of aging and physical activity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048943/,406

PCR detected all of 11 different strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as well as rat sialodacryoadenitis virus but not bovine coronavirus or human coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E. The M gene sequences of bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 are homologous to that of MHV, but minor differences exist in the primer regions, preventing annealing of the primers. For detecting MHV-Y in tissue samples, PCR was faster than and at least as sensitive as either of the two bioassays (infant mouse bioassay and mouse antibody production test) currently used for MHV diagnostic purposes.","Homberger, F R; Smith, A L; Barthold, S W",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1661745/,406
202021,Nurse Practitioners Rising to the Challenge During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Long-Term Care Homes,2021,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Envs) function as a trimer, mediating virus entry by promoting the fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. HIV-1 Env trimers induce membrane fusion through a pH-independent pathway driven by the interaction between an Env trimer and its cellular receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4. We studied viruses with mixed heterotrimers of wild-type and dominant-negative Envs to determine the number (T) of Env trimers required for HIV-1 entry. To our surprise, we found that a single Env trimer is capable of supporting HIV-1 entry; i.e., T = 1. A similar approach was applied to investigate the entry stoichiometry of envelope glycoproteins from amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV), avian sarcoma/leukosis virus type A (ASLV-A), and influenza A virus. When pseudotyped on HIV-1 virions, the A-MLV and ASLV-A Envs also exhibit a T = 1 entry stoichiometry. In contrast, eight to nine influenza A virus hemagglutinin trimers function cooperatively to achieve membrane fusion and virus entry, using a pH-dependent pathway. The different entry requirements for cooperativity among Env trimers for retroviruses and influenza A virus may influence viral strategies for replication and evasion of the immune system.","Yang, Xinzhen; Kurteva, Svetla; Ren, Xinping; Lee, Sandra; Sodroski, Joseph",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16160141/,406

Patient developed fever, severe cough, loss of smell, loss of taste, nasal block, anorexia, headache, body ache, chills, and fatigue and was hospitalised when she developed severe breathing difficulty. Later, she tested positive for COVID-19 by RT PCR. The patient sought Ayurvedic treatment voluntarily when her SPO2 remained at 80% even after being given oxygen support. The patient was administered Ayurvedic medicines while undergoing oxygen therapy at the hospital. The patient refused to take Fabiflu recommended by the treating physician and discontinued other allopathic drugs except for Vitamin C. The patient showed clinical improvement within a day of administration of Ayurvedic medicines and was able to talk, eat, and sit on the bed without breathing difficulty and her SPO2 became stable between 95 and 98%. In the next two days, she was asymptomatic without oxygen support and was discharged from the hospital in the following week. Since obesity and high plasma CRP indicated high risk for progression to severe disease, the favourable outcomes with Ayurvedic treatment in this patient is significant and warrants further studies. Ayurveda care may be considered as first-line cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 patients presenting with symptomatic hypoxia in an integrative setup.","Joshi, Jyoti Anand; Puthiyedath, Rammanohar",,,406

205071,The Role of Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Regenerative capability of the peripheral nervous system after injury is enhanced by Schwann cells (SCs) producing several growth factors. The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SC-like phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs. ACh, via M2 muscarinic receptors, contributes to the modulation and maturation of NGF, improving the regenerative properties of dASCs.","Piovesana, R; Faroni, A; Taggi, M; Matera, A; Soligo, M; Canipari, R; Manni, L; Reid, A J; Tata, A M",Sci Rep,,406

As the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin has been shown to have inconsistent roles in the incidence of NDs. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to evaluate the effect of metformin exposure on onset of NDs. METHODS: The observational studies that investigated the associations between metformin and the incidence of NDs were searched in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. A random-effect model was performed using STATA to calculate the combined ORs. RESULTS: In total, 23 comparisons out of 19 studies with 285 966 participants were included. Meta-analysis found there was no significant effect on incidence of all the subtypes of NDs with metformin exposure (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). However, metformin monotherapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of PD incidence compared with non-metformin users or glitazone users (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.42). CONCLUSION: Metformin has failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on NDs. In addition, it may increase the risk of PD development. In light of current results, how metformin would impact NDs, especially the potential risk of PD, needs to be scrutinized. The underlying mechanisms are vital to achieve some more profound understanding on the regimen. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD 42019133285.","Ping, Fan; Jiang, Ning; Li, Yuxiu",,,406

206164,Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in COVID-19 Isolated Patients and in Their Relatives,2020,"BACKGROUND: Clinical risk scores and machine learning models based on routine laboratory values could assist in automated early identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients at risk for severe clinical outcomes. They can guide patient triage, inform allocation of health care resources, and contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes. METHODS: In- and out-patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the Insel Hospital Group Bern, Switzerland, between February 1st and August 31st ('first wave', n = 198) and September 1st through November 16th 2020 ('second wave', n = 459) were used as training and prospective validation cohort, respectively. A clinical risk stratification score and machine learning (ML) models were developed using demographic data, medical history, and laboratory values taken up to 3 days before, or 1 day after, positive testing to predict severe outcomes of hospitalization (a composite endpoint of admission to intensive care, or death from any cause). Test accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: Sex, C-reactive protein, sodium, hemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, glucose, and leucocytes around the time of first positive testing (- 3 to + 1 days) were the most predictive parameters. AUROC of the risk stratification score on training data (AUROC = 0.94, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.97, negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.80) were comparable to the prospective validation cohort (AUROC = 0.85, PPV = 0.91, NPV = 0.81). The most successful ML algorithm with respect to AUROC was support vector machines (median = 0.96, interquartile range = 0.85-0.99, PPV = 0.90, NPV = 0.58). CONCLUSION: With a small set of easily obtainable parameters, both the clinical risk stratification score and the ML models were predictive for severe outcomes at our tertiary hospital center, and performed well in prospective validation.","Schöning, Verena; Liakoni, Evangelia; Baumgartner, Christine; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K; Hautz, Wolf E; Atkinson, Andrew; Hammann, Felix",J Transl Med,,406

The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapies has been limited in consideration of the risk of occupational infection in health-care professionals. Aims: In preclinical experimental simulations, evaluate occupational and environmental safety of the newly developed isolation system for aerosol-transmitted infections (ISATI). Method: Simulations were conducted to test ISATI's capability to isolate aerosolized molecular (caffeine), and biological (SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA) markers. Caffeine deposition was analyzed on nitrocellulose sensor discs by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: ISATI demonstrated efficacy in isolating molecular and biological markers within the enclosed environment in simulated conditions of CPAP, HFNO and mechanical ventilation therapy. Neither the molecular marker nor substantial amounts of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the surrounding environment, outside ISATI, indicating appropriate occupational safety for health-care professionals. Conclusion: Aerosolized markers were successfully contained within ISATI in all experimental simulations, offering occupational and environmental protection against the dissemination of aerosolized microparticles under CPAP or HFNO therapy conditions, which are indicated for patients with acute respiratory infections.","Quadros, Claudio Almeida; Leal, Maria Carolina Bezerra Di Medeiros; Baptista-Sobrinho, Carlos de Almeida; Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; Souza, Bruno Solano De Freitas; Milan-Mattos, Juliana Cristina; Catai, Aparecida Maria; Pires Di Lorenzo, Valéria Amorim; Ferreira, Antonio Gilberto",Expert Rev Med Devices,,406

As a result, most of the Spanish population had to self-isolate at home. The physical and psychological consequences of this unexpected scenario could be particularly worrisome for people older than 60 years. This study is aimed to examine the psychological well-being of older adults during the home isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether meeting the World Health Organization's global recommendations on physical activity (PA) for health is associated with their resilience, affect, and depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 483 citizens whose ages ranged from 60 to 92 years (overall sample: Mâ¯=â¯65.49, SDâ¯=â¯5.14) were recruited via a snowball sampling strategy to answer to an online questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The four instruments used were The Connor-Davidson CD-RISC resilience scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the six-item self-report scale of Depressive Symptoms, and The international Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Results showed that older adults who regularly engaged in vigorous (VPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the quarantine reported higher scores in resilience (Locus, Self-efficacy, and Optimism), positive affect, and lower in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These finding are the first quantitative evidence pointing toward a link between engagement in VPA and/or MVPA and resilience, positive affect, and depressive symptoms within the COVID-19 restrictions in Spain. Acknowledging these associations may be important in developing health promotion programs for older people during the remaining period of confinement or future ones.","Carriedo, Alejandro; Cecchini, José A; Fernandez-Rio, Javier; Méndez-Giménez, Antonio",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,406

To explore these putative roles, we evaluated the independent and joint associations of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with pneumonia risk in a prospective cohort study of 2275 men aged 42-61 years at recruitment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Objectively measured CRF and self-reported sauna bathing habits were assessed at baseline. CRF was categorized as low and high (median cut-offs) and FSB as low and high (defined as &#8804;1 and 2-7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 26.6 years, 529 cases of pneumonia occurred. Comparing high vs low CRF, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CIs) for pneumonia was 0.75 (0.61-0.91). Comparing high vs low FSB, the corresponding HR was 0.81 (0.68-0.97). Compared to men with low CRF & low FSB, the multivariable-adjusted HRs of pneumonia for the following groups: high CRF & low FSB; low CRF & high FSB; and high CRF & high FSB were 0.88 (0.65-1.20), 0.89 (0.71-1.13), and 0.62 (0.48-0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a general male Caucasian population, a combination of high fitness levels and frequent sauna baths is associated with a substantially lowered future pneumonia risk compared with each modality alone. The implications of these findings in altering COVID-19 disease or its severity deserve study.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Laukkanen, Jari A",Eur J Clin Invest,,406

As there is no prior study available, we evaluated these mental health outcomes and associated factors among the general population and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Bangladesh. This nationwide cross-sectional study comprised 3388 individuals including 834 HCPs. The measures included socio-demographics, healthcare, and patient-care related information, the Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Just over one-quarter of the participants were depressed, and was significantly associated with COVID-19 fear. Regression analyses showed that, both in general population and HCPs, depression and fear of COVID-19 were strongly predicted by being female; however, depression was inversely associated with being married. Particularly, among the HCPs, being restless while examining a patient with flu-like symptoms and while examining a patient returning from abroad was found to be significant predictor for both depression and fear of COVID-19. HCPs who were using single protective equipment for a week had greater depression and those who felt insecure due to the pandemic had a high level of COVID-19 fear. The findings identified major psychological impacts among the participants, suggesting the urgent need to promote mental wellbeing in both general population and medical professionals.","Sakib, Najmuj; Akter, Tahmina; Zohra, Fatematuz; Bhuiyan, A K M Israfil; Mamun, Mohammed A; Griffiths, Mark D",Int J Ment Health Addict,,406

In contrast, meta-learning technology uses relatively small amounts of training data, called fast learners. Such methods are beneficial under conditions of limited data availability, which often obtain for trend prediction based on time-series data limited by sparse information. In this study, we consider short-term stock price prediction using a meta-learning framework with several convolutional neural networks, including the temporal convolution network, fully convolutional network, and residual neural network. We propose a sliding time horizon to label stocks according to their predicted price trends, referred to as called dynamic k-average labeling, using prediction labels including""rise plus"",""rise"",""fall"", and""fall plus"". The effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning framework was evaluated by application to the S&P500. The experimental results show that the inclusion of the proposed meta-learning framework significantly improved both regular and balanced prediction accuracy and profitability.","Chang, Shin-Hung; Hsu, Cheng-Wen; Li, Hsing-Ying; Zeng, Wei-Sheng; Ho, Jan-Ming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13599v1.pdf,406
214602,"The impact of the risk of COVID-19 on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) members of the UK dental profession",2020,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 utilizes metallocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin receptor (ACE) 2 to gain entry into human cells. Activation of several proteases facilitates the interaction of viral spike proteins (S1) and ACE2 receptor. This leads to cleavage of host ACE2 receptors. ACE2 activity counterbalances the angiotensin II effect, its loss may lead to elevated angiotensin II levels with modulation of platelet function, size and activity. COVID-19 disease encompasses a spectrum of systemic involvement far beyond respiratory failure alone. Several features of this disease, including the etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the hypercoagulable state, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that there is a high incidence of AKI (81%) in the critically ill adults with COVID-19 in the setting of elevated D-dimer, elevated ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Strikingly, there were unique features of platelets in these patients, including larger, more granular platelets and a higher mean platelet volume (MPV). There was a significant correlation between measured D-dimer levels and MVP; but a negative correlation between MPV and glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in critically ill cohort. Our data suggest that activated platelets may play a role in renal failure and possibly hypercoagulability status in COVID19 patients.","Taha, Muhanad; Sano, Dahlia; Hanoudi, Samer; Esber, Zahia; Elahi, Morvarid; Gabali, Ali; Chopra, Teena; Draghici, Sorin; Samavati, Lobelia",Platelets,,406

Email can be one of the most fruitful attack vectors of research institutions as they also contain access to all accounts and thus to all private information. We propose an approach for analyzing in terms of security research institutions' communication networks. We first obtained institutions' communication networks as well as a method to analyze possible breaches of collected emails. We downloaded the network of 4 different research centers, three from Spain and one from Portugal. We then ran simulations of Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) complex network dynamics model for analyzing the vulnerability of the network. More than half of the nodes have more than one security breach, and our simulation results show that more than 90\% of the networks' nodes are vulnerable. This method can be employed for enhancing security of research centers and can make email accounts' use security-aware. It may additionally open new research lines in communication security. Finally, we manifest that, due to confidentiality reasons, the sources we utilized for obtaining communication networks should not be providing the information that we were able to gather.","Guti'errez-Fandino, Asier; Armengol-Estap'e, Jordi; Villegas, Marta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11699v1.pdf,406
215167,Essential health services delivery in Zimbabwe during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives and recommendations,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To establish the evidence for rehabilitation interventions tested in populations of patients admitted to ICU and critical care with severe respiratory illness, and consider whether the evidence is generalizable to patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The authors undertook a rapid systematic review. Medline (via OvidSP), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCOhost), Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL (via Wiley), Epistemonikos (via Epistemonikos.org), PEDro (via pedro.org.au) and OTseeker (via otseeker.com) searched to 7 May 2020. The authors included systematic reviews, RCTs and qualitative studies involving adults with respiratory illness requiring intensive care who received rehabilitation to enhance or restore resulting physical impairments or function. Data were extracted by one author and checked by a second. TIDier was used to guide intervention descriptions. Study quality was assessed using Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tools. RESULTS: Six thousand nine hundred and three titles and abstracts were screened; 24 systematic reviews, 11 RCTs and eight qualitative studies were included. Progressive exercise programmes, early mobilisation and multicomponent interventions delivered in ICU can improve functional independence. Nutritional supplementation in addition to rehabilitation in post-ICU hospital settings may improve performance of activities of daily living. The evidence for rehabilitation after discharge from hospital following an ICU admission is inconclusive. Those receiving rehabilitation valued it, engendering hope and confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise, early mobilisation and multicomponent programmes may improve recovery following ICU admission for severe respiratory illness that could be generalizable to those with COVID-19. Rehabilitation interventions can bring hope and confidence to individuals but there is a need for an individualised approach and the use of behaviour change strategies. Further research is needed in post-ICU settings and with those who have COVID-19.

215776,The Older Adult Pandemic Inventory: Preliminary Findings from an Outpatient Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic,2021,"The article discusses the role of immune dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection, the participation of ACE2 for the penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus into cells and the possible role of RAAS blockers, which have a direct effect on the pathological activity of the RAAS, in the development of and the severity of the disease. It is noted that the beneficial organoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their withdrawal may lead to clinical decompensation in patients at high risk of cardiovascular risk. Since then, a number of observational cohort studies have been carried out to address the main questions: does the use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB increase the risk of contracting the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and whether the use of RAAS blockers is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 disease. The article provides an overview of the scientific evidence on the relationship between the use of RASS blockers and COVID-19 infection. Several cohort studies and two meta-analyzes found no association between prior use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB and the risk of COVID-19 infection (RR 0.96–0.99). In studies on the study of clinical and laboratory features of the action of RAAS blockers in COVID-19, a significantly larger number of subpopulations of T-lymphocytes CD3+ and CD8+, lower concentrations of biomarkers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, IL-6, procalcitonin), as well as a lower viral load. In clinical outcomes, with the use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB, there was a lower incidence of severe/critical forms, and a shorter duration of hospitalization. In large cohort studies with &gt;1000 patients, the use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB was not associated with an increase in the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 (RR &lt; 1.0), and some studies showed a 37–67% decrease in RR. Meta-analyzes also confirmed the absence of the effect of RAAS blockers on the risk of mortality, and in the population of patients with hypertension, a significant reduction in the risk of mortality and severe course of COVID-19 was revealed. Most international associations of specialists, as well as the Russian Cardiological Society, are recommended to continue the use of RAAS blockers in patients with cardiovascular diseases and not to be canceled in case of COVID-19 disease. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to generate new evidence. © 2021, Remedium Group Ltd. All rights reserved.","Leonova, M. V.",Meditsinskiy Sovet,,406

Based on that, using the novel notion of Contagion Graph, it proposes a graphbased method derived from Dijkstra's algorithm that allows to decrease the computational complexity of a simulation. The Contagion Graph can be also employed as an approximation scheme describing the""mean behavior""of an epidemic over a network and requiring low computational power.

218069,Mood and Affect in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"In a recent study, we reported that certain anti-spike antibodies of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV viruses can have a pathogenic effect through binding to sick lung epithelium cells and misleading immune responses to attack self-cells. We termed this new pathogenic mechanism ""Antibody Dependent Auto-Attack"" (ADAA). This study explores a drug candidate for prevention and treatment of such ADAA-based diseases. The drug candidate is a formulation comprising N-acetylneuraminic acid methyl ester (NANA-Me), an analog of N-acetylneuraminic acid. NANA-Me acts through a unique mechanism of action (MOA) which is repairment of the missing sialic acid on sick lung epithelium cells. This MOA can block the antibodies binding to sick cells, which are vulnerable to pathogenic antibodies. Our in vivo data showed that the formulation significantly reduced the sickness and deaths caused by pathogenic anti-spike antibodies. Therefore, the formulation has the potential to prevent and treat the serious conditions caused by pathogenic antibodies during a COVID-19 infection. In addition, the formulation has potential to prevent and treat the adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines because the vaccines can induce similar antibodies, including pathogenic antibodies. The formulation will be helpful in increasing the safety of the vaccines without reducing the vaccines efficacy. Compared to existing antiviral drugs, the formulation has a unique MOA of targeting receptors, broad spectrum of indications, excellent safety profile, resistance to mutations, and can be easily produced.","Wang, Huiru; Wu, Xiancong; Zhang, Yuekai; Chen, Qiuchi; Dai, Lin; Chen, Yuxing; Liu, Xiaoling",,,406

To face the contagion growth, from March 8 to May 8 2020, a regional law re-designed the hub-and-spoke system for time-dependent diseases to better allocate resources for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We report the reorganization of the major hospital in Lombardy during COVID-19 pandemic, including the rearrangement of its ICU beds to face COVID-19 pandemic and fulfill its role as extended hub for time-dependent diseases while preserving transplant activity. To highlight the impact of the emergently planned hub-and-spoke system, all patients admitted to a COVID-19-free ICU hub for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke during the two-month period were retrospectively collected and compared to 2019 cohort. Regional data on organ procurement was retrieved. Observed-to-expected (OE) in-ICU mortality ratios were computed to test the impact of the pandemic on patients affected by time-dependent diseases. RESULTS: Dynamic changes in ICU resource allocation occurred according to local COVID-19 epidemiology/trends of patients referred for time-dependent diseases. The absolute increase of admissions for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke was roughly two-fold. Patients referred to the hub were older and characterized by more severe conditions. An increase in crude mortality was observed, though OE ratios for in-ICU mortality were not statistically different when comparing 2020 vs. 2019. An increase in local organ procurement was observed, limiting the debacle of regional transplant activity. CONCLUSIONS: We described the effects of a regional emergently planned hub-and-spoke system for time-dependent diseases settled in the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","Chieregato, Arturo; Veronese, Giacomo; Curto, Francesco; Zaniboni, Matteo; Fossi, Francesca; Zumbo, Fabrizio; Scattolini, Carla; Compagnone, Christian; Alberti, Beatrice M; Baciu, Camelia; Bergesio, Lavinia; Carenini, Stefano M; Cipolla, Cristiana; Formentano, Alessandra C; Guidi, Alessandro; Massimo, Francesco; Galluccio, Irene; Pagani, Silvano; Paparone, Rosaria; Pozzi, Federico; Pressato, Lorenzo; Pugnetti, Enrica; Riganti, Mauro; Ruggieri, Francesco; Tagliaferri, Fernanda; Trinchero, Gabriele; Vassena, Emanuele; Bassi, Gabriele; Giudici, Riccardo; Sacchi, Marco; Chiara, Osvaldo; Agostoni, Elio C; Grasselli, Giacomo; Fumagalli, Roberto",Minerva anestesiol,,406

Our objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOC relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. MethodsWe analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors (summarized in three measures: 1. strength of public health countermeasures: stringency index, 2. how much people moved about outside their homes: mobility index, and 3. vaccine intervention: proportion of Canadian population fully vaccinated). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), the provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index and full vaccine coverage. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOC (Alpha, or B.1.1.7, Beta, or B.1.351, Gamma, or P.1, and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) between the clusters. ResultsThree clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures were identified. Cluster 1 consisted of the three Canadian territories, and characterized by higher degree of vaccine deployment and lesser degree of countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and Atlantic region) was typified by lesser implementation of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster was formed by provinces in the Pacific region, Central Canada, and Prairie region, with moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalence were significantly different across the clusters. InterpretationThis study found that implementation of COVID-19 public health measures varied across the provinces and territories. Considering the high prevalence of VOCs in Canada, completing the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner is crucial.","Adeyinka, Daniel A; Camillo, Cheryl; Marks, Wendie; Muhajarine, Nazeem",,,406

METHODS: The medical data of 89 COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 3, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. Eighty-nine cases were divided into survival group (53 cases) and non-survival group (36 cases) according to the results of 28-day follow-up. The SAA levels of all patients were recorded and compared on 1 day after admission (before treatment) and 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days after treatment. The ROC curve was drawn to analyze the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 by SAA. RESULTS: The difference of comparison of SAA between survival group and non-survival group before treatment was not statistically significant, Z1 = - 1.426, P = 0.154. The Z1 values (Z1 is the Z value of the rank sum test) of the two groups of patients at 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days after treatment were - 5.569, - 6.967, and - 7.542, respectively. The P values were all less than 0.001, and the difference was statistically significant. The ROC curve results showed that SAA has higher sensitivity to the prognostic value of 1 day (before treatment), 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days after treatment, with values of 0.806, 0.972, 0.861, and 0.961, respectively.

Currently existing techniques such as RT-PCR, antigen-antibody-based detection, and CT scans are prompt solutions for diagnosing infected patients. However, the limitations of currently available indicators have enticed researchers to search for adjunct or additional solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis. Meanwhile, identifying biomarkers or indicators is necessary for understanding the severity of the disease and aids in developing efficient drugs and vaccines. Therefore, clinical studies on infected patients revealed that infection-mediated clinical biomarkers, especially pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are highly associated with COVID-19. These biomarkers are undermined or overlooked in the context of diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of infected patients. Hence, this review discusses the potential implementation of these biomarkers for COVID-19 electrical biosensing platforms. The secretion range for each biomarker is reviewed based on clinical studies. Currently available electrical biosensors comprising electrochemical and electronic biosensors associated with these biomarkers are discussed, and insights into the use of infection-mediated clinical biomarkers as prognostic and adjunct diagnostic indicators in developing an electrical-based COVID-19 biosensor are provided.","Selvarajan, Reena Sri; Gopinath, Subash C B; Zin, Noraziah Mohamad; Hamzah, Azrul Azlan",Sensors (Basel),,406

The objective of this study was to examine the perception of medical services by cancer patients during the pandemic and to identify the key elements influencing the level of satisfaction with oncological care. Of note, 394 patients diagnosed with cancer treated in inpatient oncology wards participated in the study (Poland). The diagnostic survey method was used. A survey questionnaire developed by the authors was used and validated the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire. The calculations were made in Statistica 10.0 (Statsoft;2011, Dell Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA). The average general level of satisfaction with oncological care in the study group was 80.77 out of a total score of 100, representing the highest level of satisfaction. Levels of satisfaction varied according to time since diagnosis (longer time-greater satisfaction) and were lower where treatment was delayed or perceived as disorganised.

The objective of this study was to examine consecutive antibody seroprevalence changes among hospital staff, a high-risk population. A two-time survey was performed in May and October 2020 for 545 hospital staff to investigate the changes in the results of the rapid kit test and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The seroprevalence of each assay was summarized at both the survey periods. The proportion of seropositive individuals in the CLIA for each survey period and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Central Fukushima were then compared. We chose 515 participants for the analysis. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in CLIA increased from 0.19% in May to 0.39% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 0.97% in May to 0.39% in October. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in the rapid kit test decreased from 7.96% in May to 3.50% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 7.77% in May to 2.14% in October. The IgG and IgM antibody seroprevalence among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima decreased; the seroprevalence among hospital staff was consistent with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central Fukushima area. Although it is difficult to interpret the results of the antibody assay in a population with a low prior probability, constant follow-up surveys of antibody titers among hospital staff had several merits in obtaining a set of criteria regarding the accuracy of measures against COVID-19 and estimating the COVID-19 infection status among hospital staff.","Kobashi, Yurie; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Shimazu, Yuzo; Obara, Daiji; Zhao, Tianchen; Tsubokura, Masaharu",Int Immunopharmacol,,406

225467,COVID-19 Trials and Tribulations by Rebecca Gliksman MD MPH,2020,"The historically rapid development of effective COVID-19 vaccines has policymakers facing evergreen public health questions regarding vaccination records and verification. Governments and institutions around the world are already taking action on digital vaccine certificates, including guidance and recommendations from the European Commission, the WHO, and the Biden Administration. These could be encouraging efforts: an effective system for vaccine certificates could potentially be part of a safe return to work, travel, and daily life, and a secure technological implementation could improve on existing systems to prioritize privacy, streamline access, and build for necessary interoperability across countries and contexts. However, vaccine credentials are not without potential harms, and, particularly given major inequities in vaccine access and rollout, there are valid concerns that they may be used in ineffective or exclusionary ways that exacerbate inequality, allow for discrimination, violate privacy, and assume consent. While the present moment calls for urgency, we must also acknowledge that choices made in the vaccine credentialing rollout for COVID-19 are likely to have long-term implications, and must be made with care. In this paper, we outline potential implementation and ethical concerns that may arise from tech-enabled vaccine credentialing programs now and in the future, and discuss the technological tradeoffs implicated in these concerns. We suggest a set of principles that, if adopted, may mitigate these concerns, forestall preventable harms, and point the way forward; the paper is structured as a deep dive into each of these principles.","Siddarth, Divya; Hart, Vi; Cantrell, Bethan; Yasuda, Kristina; Mandel, Josh; Easterbrook, Karen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13515v1.pdf,406
225468,COVID-19 Trials and Tribulations by Rebecca Gliksman MD MPH,2020,"Introduction La pandémie de COVID-19 a profondément affecté le monde entier. Pour pouvoir contrôler son émergence et minimiser la morbidité et la mortalité associées, il faudrait adapter les comportements, qui sont influencés par les connaissances et les perceptions, notamment en milieu de soins. Dans cette optique, cette étude visait à évaluer le niveau de connaissance, des attitudes et des pratiques des étudiants en médecine (EEM) à l’égard du COVID-19 et à identifier leurs facteurs associés. Matériels et méthodes Une étude transversale portant sur 431 EEM des différents niveaux d’étude a été menée à la faculté de médecine en novembre 2020. Le recueil des données était fait par un auto-questionnaire administré via Google Forms administré dans les plateformes éducatives officielles de la faculté. Résultats Les scores globaux des connaissances, de l’attitude et des pratiques des EEM à l’égard du COVID-19 étaient de 74,6±13, 69±10,2 et 78,8±13,6/100, respectivement. Les EEM avaient un bon niveau de connaissance dans, 203 cas (47,1 %), une attitude positive dans 83 cas (19,3 %) et de bonnes pratiques dans 264 cas (61,3 %). L’analyse multivariée a révélé que les facteurs indépendants prédictifs de bonnes connaissances étaient le tabagisme actuel (odds ratio ajusté [ORA]=1,8 ;p=0,04), l’assistance antérieure à une formation sur le COVID (ORA=1,5 ;p=0,04) et le niveau élevé des études (ORA=2,4 ;p=0,02). L’antécédent de maladie chronique était un facteur indépendant d’une attitude positive (ORA=2,4 ;p=0,009), tandis que le tabagisme actif (ORA=0,4 ;p=0,01) était indépendamment associé à une attitude négative. L’utilisation des réseaux sociaux comme principale source d’information sur le COVID-19 était indépendamment associée à une mauvaise connaissance (ORA=0,5 ;p=0,01) et à une attitude négative (ORA=0,4 ;p=0,008). Les facteurs indépendants de bonnes pratiques étaient le niveau élevé des études (ORA=2,4 ;p=0,01), avoir un contact étroit avec une personne atteinte du COVID-19 (AOR=2,1 ;p=0,04), l’assistance à une formation sur le COVID-19 (ORA=1,5 ;p=0,04) et avoir de bonnes connaissances (ORA=2,2 ;p&lt;0,001). Conclusion Les EEM avaient un niveau satisfaisant des connaissances et des pratiques à l’égard du COVID-19, mais leur attitude était majoritairement négative. Ainsi, le développement de cours interactifs sur les maladies émergentes et l’intégration de l’épidémiologie interventionnelle de terrain qui implique la confrontation des EEM aux situations d’urgence épidémique sont fortement recommandés.","Ketata, N.; Ben Ayed, H.; Ben Hmida, M.; Trigui, M.; Ben Jmeaa, M.; Yaich, S.; Kassis, M.; Feki, H.; Damak, J.",Infectious Diseases Now,,406

Mobile phone surveys (MPS) offer the opportunity to collect real-time data on behavior, exposure, knowledge, and perception, as well as care and treatment to inform decision making. The surveys aimed to collect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related information in Ecuador and Sri Lanka using mobile phones. In Ecuador, a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted. In Sri Lanka, an evaluation of a novel medicine delivery system was conducted. Using the established mobile network operator channels and technical assistance provided through The Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H), Ministries of Health fielded a population-based COVID-19-specific MPS using Surveda, the open source data collection tool developed as part of the initiative. A total of 1,185 adults in Ecuador completed the MPS in 14 days. A total of 5,001 adults over the age of 35 in Sri Lanka completed the MPS in 44 days. Both samples were adjusted to the 2019 United Nations Population Estimates to produce population-based estimates by age and sex. The Ecuador COVID-19 MPS found that there was compliance with the mitigation strategies implemented in that country. Overall, 96.5% of Ecuadorians reported wearing a face mask or face covering when leaving home. Overall, 3.8% of Sri Lankans used the service to receive medicines from a government clinic. Among those who used the medicine delivery service in Sri Lanka, 95.8% of those who used a private pharmacy received their medications within one week, and 69.9% of those using a government clinic reported the same. These studies demonstrate that MPS can be conducted quickly and gather essential data. MPS can help monitor the impact of interventions and programs, and rapidly identify what works in mitigating the impact of COVID-19.","Phadnis, Rachael; Wickramasinghe, Champika; Zevallos, Juan Carlos; Davlin, Stacy; Kumarapeli, Vindya; Lea, Veronica; Lee, Juliette; Perera, Udara; Solórzano, Francisco Xavier; Vásconez, Juan Francisco",PLoS One,,406
226407,COVID-19 in nursing homes,2020,"Orientation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken the world by storm. Little is known about leadership, motivation and employee performance during pandemics and associated lockdowns. Research purpose: The current study investigated a model of leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance in the context of a 'hard lockdown' in South Africa. Motivation for the study: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, it was considered from an academic-practitioner perspective to explore leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance. Research approach/design and method: Specifically, remote workers were sampled online via social media (n = 229). Structural equation modelling methods were used to analyse the data, also controlling optimism and pessimism at the item level. Main findings: The results showed that the resources of leadership behaviour and team effectiveness had direct positive paths to work engagement and that work engagement had a positive path to two performance factors: adaptivity and proactivity. Furthermore, there were significant indirect relationship present from leadership behaviour and team effectiveness to both adaptability and proactivity through work engagement. Practical/managerial implications: From the evidence it seems appropriate to recommend that organisations explore fostering the employee job resources in order to positively impact work engagement, which in turn can have beneficial performance outcomes for organisations who have employees working remotely whilst the COVID-19 regulations remain in force. Contribution/value-add: This study was unique as it sampled from employees 'locked down' during a pandemic and gauged their perceptions of leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance.","Koekemoer, L.; de Beer, L.

226639,"Vitamin D, antiviral agent, and COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak caused short-term disruptions in the supply chain of fresh agricultural products (FAPs), which exposed the vulnerability of the existing FAP supply chain. With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three-level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third-party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID-19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply-chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an effective supply mechanism for FAPs in metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes the authors' experience of guaranteeing the quality and safety of FAPs for future pandemic cases. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","Yin, Shi; Bai, Lan; Zhang, Runqing",J. sci. food agric,,406

Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier-relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode-locked laser, and sub-picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group-IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.","Mu, Haoran; Liu, Yani; Bongu, Sudhakara Reddy; Bao, Xiaozhi; Li, Lei; Xiao, Si; Zhuang, Jincheng; Liu, Chen; Huang, Yamin; Dong, Yemin; Helmerson, Kristian; Wang, Jiaou; Liu, Guanyu; Du, Yi; Bao, Qiaoliang",Adv Mater,,406

We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 in the low picomolar range.","Moliner-Morro, Ainhoa; J Sheward, Daniel; Karl, Vivien; Perez Vidakovics, Laura; Murrell, Ben; McInerney, Gerald M; Hanke, Leo",Biomolecules,,406

Here, we study the binding of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses isolated from pangolins, GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019, to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of pangolin CoVs binds to hACE2 as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. Furthermore, incorporation of pangolin CoV RBDs allows entry of pseudotyped VSV particles into hACE2-expressing cells. A screen for binding of pangolin CoV RBDs to ACE2 orthologs from various species suggests a broader host range than that of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, cryo-EM structures of GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019 RBDs in complex with hACE2 show their molecular binding in modes similar to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Introducing the Q498H substitution found in pangolin CoVs into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD expands its binding capacity to ACE2 homologs of mouse, rat, and European hedgehog. These findings suggest that these two pangolin CoVs may infect humans, highlighting the necessity of further surveillance of pangolin CoVs.","Niu, Sheng; Wang, Jia; Bai, Bin; Wu, Lili; Zheng, Anqi; Chen, Qian; Du, Pei; Han, Pengcheng; Zhang, Yanfang; Jia, Yunfei; Qiao, Chengpeng; Qi, Jianxun; Tian, Wen-Xia; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Qihui; Gao, George Fu",EMBO J,,406

Laboratory and immunological alterations have been considered as potential markers of disease severity and clinical evolution. Type I interferons (IFN-I), mainly represented by IFN-&#945; and ß, are a group of cytokines with an important function in antiviral responses and have played a complex role in COVID-19. Some studies have demonstrated that IFN-I levels and interferon response is elevated in mild cases, while other studies have noted this in severe cases. The involvement of IFN-I on the pathogenesis and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this study, we summarize the available evidence of the association of plasma protein levels of type I IFN with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. A systematic search of the MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was performed up to March of 2021, looking for articles that evaluated plasma protein levels of IFN-I in mild, severe, or critical COVID-19 patients. Comparative meta-analyses with random effects were performed to compare the standardized mean differences in plasma protein levels of IFN-I of mild versus severe and mild versus critical patients. Meta-regressions were performed to test the moderating role of age, sex, time that the IFN-I was measured, and limit of detection of the assay used in the difference between the means. Results: There was no significant difference in plasma levels of IFN-&#945; when comparing between mild and severe patients (SMD = -0.236, 95% CI -0.645 to 0.173, p = 0.258, I2 = 82.11), nor when comparing between patients mild and critical (SMD = 0.203, 95% CI -0.363 to 0.770, p = 0.481, I2 = 64.06). However, there was a significant difference between healthy individuals and patients with mild disease (SMD = 0.447, 95% CI 0.085 to 0.810, p = 0.016, I2 = 62.89). Conclusions: Peripheral IFN-&#945; cannot be used as a severity marker as it does not determine the clinical status presented by COVID-19 patients.","da Silva, Rafaela Pires; Gonçalves, João Ismael Budelon; Zanin, Rafael Fernandes; Schuch, Felipe Barreto; de Souza, Ana Paula Duarte",Front Immunol,,406

Understandably, patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (iRMDs) and their physicians are feverishly preoccupied with questions about vaccination and the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, as it will take months before all patients with iRMDs will have access to the vaccines, measures that are taken now in order to increase potential safety and efficacy of the vaccines may impose a risk for the patients with regard to reactivation of their underlying iRMD. The ad hoc commission 'Covid-19' and the board of directors of the German Society for Rheumatology have addressed this topic and have developed considerations, which are intended to answer urgent questions, to take away concerns and fears and to make initial recommendations for patients with iRMDs.","Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Specker, Christof; Skapenko, Alla",,,406

Existing research identified the role of digital content and social media in cultural institutions, but only in times of normal operations. This study adds to the existing literature by exploring the types of digital content implemented, impacts on social media engagement, measures of social media engagement, and future implications in regard to COVID-19 temporary closures. This study recruited 66 cultural institutions from across the United States to take part in in-depth semi-structured phone interviews to fulfill the research goals. Museums, zoos, aquariums, performing arts organizations, heritage foundations, and historical societies were represented. A qualitative approach was adopted, and content analysis on the interview transcripts indicated that cultural institutions implemented digital content to build communities through live and serialized content, partnerships, fundraising, increased transparency, and increased accessibility during temporary closures. Using primarily Instagram and Facebook with their digital content, cultural institutions increased social media engagement during this time. Although there was no consensus on best practices in measuring social media engagement, many institutions highlighted tracking active engagement such as likes, comments, and shares. As a result of the success of the digital content, cultural institutions planned continued digital content campaigns such as videos, blogs, partnerships, and paid educational content in times of normal operations.","Ryder, Brittany Zhang Tingting Hua Nan",Administrative Sciences,,406

The use of a membrane module allows, among other things, for a compact design with a relatively large heat and mass transfer area and eliminates carryover of solution droplets. In this paper, a cross-flow, hollow-fiber membrane module was proposed for air dehumidification and regeneration of lithium chloride. A two-dimensional heat and mass transfer model for cross-flow in a membrane module used for air dehumidification and liquid desiccant regeneration was developed. The effectiveness, moisture removal rate and moisture removal rate were studied numerically and validated against experimental results. Based on the numerical simulations, the most favorable ranges of operating conditions were determined. It was found that the operating conditions significantly impact the dehumidification performance. The proposed dehumidifier maintains its performance in a wide range of inlet air humidity ratios. For dehumidification, the recommended temperature of the incoming solution was in the range of 14–18 °C, while for regeneration the solution range was 40–50 °C. The packing fraction was suggested in the range of 0.30–0.40. These results can help design membrane-based liquid dehumidification systems.","Rajski, Krzysztof",Energies,,406

We describe our initial experiences performing otologic surgery with the exoscope during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The exoscope was used for several semiurgent otologic surgeries in combination with complete eye protection, a ""tent"" drape, a smoke evacuator with ultra-low particulate air filter, and betadine irrigation. These techniques are demonstrated in the accompanying video. This was compared with our experiences using the microscope. RESULTS: The described modified goggles allowed complete eye protection while providing a fully three-dimensional view of the surgical site. The other safety measures described are simple and efficient techniques which can easily be adopted for otologic surgery using the microscope. CONCLUSION: Use of the exoscope for otologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic allows full three-dimensional visualization of the surgical field while simultaneously providing complete eye protection. Use of the ""tent"" drape, ultra-low particulate air filter, and betadine irrigation are also options that otologic surgeons may consider for additional safety.","Tu, Nathan; Bojrab, Dennis; Sioshansi, Pedrom; Lin, Kenny; Hong, Robert; Babu, Seilesh",Otol. neurotol,,406

Como parte do processo de desenvolvimento das estratégias, a OMS vem examinando uma série de intervenções que têm o potencial de desempenhar um papel no enfrentamento das taxas mundialmente crescentes das DNTs. A esse respeito, a regulamentação do marketing de alimentos, especialmente o dirigido às crianças, emerge como uma área que necessita de maior atenção. Numa tentativa de discutir essa questão com maior profundidade, a OMS comissionou a presente revisão do cenário das regulamentações sobre o marketing de alimentos (incluindo bebidas não alcoólicas) dirigido a crianças. Embora as definições formais de æmarketingÆ sejam muito amplas, para os propósitos desta revisão o termo foi usado para se referir apenas àqueles processos que são bastante visíveis ao consumidor, ou seja, publicidade e promoções. Seis técnicas de marketing amplamente usadas pelas empresas para promover alimentos para crianças foram selecionadas: publicidade televisiva, marketing nas escolas, patrocínio, merchandising, marketing na internet e promoções de vendas.

The debate is an old one and the lesson we have yet to learn was tragically apparent a century ago during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Any history of structural racism in America must begin with the chronicles of African Americans, Native Alaskans, and Indigenous North Americans as they were the originally enslaved and displaced people, subjected to overt and covert policies of oppression ever since. The experiences of Native Alaskans of Bristol Bay Alaska in 1918-1919 present a parallel, illuminating a wrenching example of structural racism that cost lives and impoverished society, then as now. Proven policy solutions exist to remove the structures that produce inequitable health outcomes, but implementing them will require public health officials and policymakers to take multidisciplinary policy actions, to find policy opportunities for change to be made, and, likely, a change in the political environment. The first exists now, the second is afforded because of the current pandemic and the urgent need for policy solutions, and the third is likely coming soon.","de Valpine, Maria Gilson; Lewis, Erica J",Public health nurs,,406

METHODS: Eight COVID-19 patients with signs of encephalopathy were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the serum and CSF using a Food and Drug Administration-approved and independently validated ELISA. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and immunoglobulin G (IgG) intrathecal synthesis were further tested using albumin and IgG indices. The CSF was also tested for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies and 14-3-3, a marker of ongoing neurodegeneration. RESULTS: All patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their CSF, and 4 of 8 patients had high titers, comparable to high serum values. One patient had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG intrathecal synthesis, and 3 others had disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The CSF in 4 patients was positive for 14-3-3-protein suggesting ongoing neurodegeneration. In all patients, the CSF was negative for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. None of the patients, apart from persistent encephalopathic signs, had any focal neurologic signs or history or specific neurologic disease. CONCLUSIONS: High-titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the CSF of comatose or encephalopathic patients demonstrating intrathecal IgG synthesis or BBB disruption. A disrupted BBB may facilitate the entry of cytokines and inflammatory mediators into the CNS enhancing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The observations highlight the need for prospective CSF studies to determine the pathogenic role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and identify early therapeutic interventions.","Alexopoulos, Harry; Magira, Eleni; Bitzogli, Kleopatra; Kafasi, Nikolitsa; Vlachoyiannopoulos, Panayiotis; Tzioufas, Athanasios; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dalakas, Marinos C",,,406

244468,The Psychological Impact of Epidemic and Pandemic Outbreaks on Healthcare Workers: Rapid Review of the Evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses acceptability and usability of home-based self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA). METHODS: We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%).

244575,Reforming our general surgery residency program at an urban level 1 Trauma Center during the COVID-19 pandemic: Towards maintaining resident safety and wellbeing,2020,"There is a concern that as a result of COVID-19 there will be a shortage of ventilators for patients requiring respiratory support. This concern has resulted in significant debate about whether it is appropriate to withdraw ventilation from one patient in order to provide it to another patient who may benefit more. The current advice available to doctors appears to be inconsistent, with some suggesting withdrawal of treatment is more serious than withholding, while others suggest that this distinction should not be made. We argue that there is no ethically relevant difference between withdrawing and withholding treatment and that suggesting otherwise may have problematic consequences. If doctors are discouraged from withdrawing treatment, concern about a future shortage may make them reluctant to provide ventilation to patients who are unlikely to have a successful outcome. This may result in underutilisation of available resources. A national policy is urgently required to provide doctors with guidance about how patients should be prioritised to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from limited resources.","Cameron, James; Savulescu, Julian; Wilkinson, Dominic",J. med. ethics,,406

245414,Authenticity as a Resilience Factor Against CV-19 Threat Among Those With Chronic Pain and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,2021,"Background: Since end of March, the health care system in Germany has been placed into a state of emergency in order to gain resources for the spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. Materials and methods: With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. Results: Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (-41%), wounds (-29%), thoracic (-24%) and abdominal pain (-23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency. Conclusion: In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed a significant decline in the number of patients in one of the largest emergency rooms in Munich. This has to be avoided with existing hospital capacities, in order to prevent potential damage to health caused by postponed or missing emergency presentations.","Tschaikowsky, T; Becker von Rose, A; Consalvo, S; Pflüger, P; Barthel, P; Spinner, C D; Knier, B; Kanz, K-G; Dommasch, M",Notf Rett Med,,406
245806,"Gonorrhoea during COVID-19 in London, UK",2021,"Introduction: A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory distress syndrome that has been called COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented pandemic. Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.","Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin",Medwave,,406

Around the globe unprecedented shortages of equipment and qualified personnel were reported in hospitals and diagnostic laboratories. When a crisis is global, supply chains are strained worldwide and external help may not be readily available. In Switzerland, as part of the efforts of the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, we developed a tailor-made web-based tool where needs and offers for critical laboratory equipment and expertise can be brought together, coordinated, prioritized, and validated. This Academic Resources for COVID-19 (ARC) Platform presents the specialized needs of diagnostic laboratories to academic research groups at universities, allowing the sourcing of said needs from unconventional supply channels, while keeping the entities tasked with coordination of the crisis response in control of each part of the process. An instance of the ARC Platform is operated in Switzerland (arc.epfl.ch) catering to the diagnostic efforts in Switzerland and sourcing from the Swiss academic sector. The underlying technology has been released as open source so that others can adopt the customizable web-platform for need/supply match-making in their own relief efforts, during the COVID-19 pandemic or any future disaster.","Courcol, Jean-Denis; Invernizzi, Cédric F; Landry, Zachary C; Minisini, Mikhaél; Baumgartner, Dieter A; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Chabriw, Barbara; Clerc, Estelle E; Daniels, Michael; Getta, Pavlo; Girod, Matthieu; Kazala, Kinga; Markram, Henry; Pasqualini, Axel; Martínez-Pérez, Clara; Peaudecerf, François J; Peaudecerf, Margit S; Pfreundt, Ulrike; Roller, Benjamin R K; Slomka, Jonasz; Vasse, Marie; Wheeler, Jeanette D; Metzger, César M J A; Stocker, Roman; Schürmann, Felix",Front Public Health,,406
251231,Museums working with older people in times of pandemic,2020,"Stroke care has been shown to be worse for patients presenting overnight/weekends (off-hours) to centers compare to those presenting during business hours (on-hours).Telemedicine (TM) helps provide safe management of stroke patients. The UT Teleneurology (UTT) hub provides acute neurological coverage by stroke specialists to 18 spoke centers. To our knowledge, the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the “weekend effect” has not been studied. The objective is to compare TM consult volumes and time metrics of stroke patients who received tPA via TM off-hours with those on-hours during the pandemic. In a retrospective query of the UTT registry from 3/20 - 6/20, we identified 122 stroke patients who received tPA - 109 were included in our analysis - 2 were excluded after quality check, 11 were excluded as inpatient strokes. We compared baseline characteristics and time metrics between the off-hours (5pm-7:59am, weekends) and on-hours (weekdays 8am-4:59pm) patients (Table 1). We also compared the number of TM consults between the height of the pandemic (3/20 - 6/20) and the previous year (3/19 - 6/19). Of 109 patients, 72 were managed via TM during off-hours, 37 during on-hours. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were no differences in time metrics including door to needle time. Of note, there was no difference in the number of acute TM consults or patients receiving tPA. There were fewer routine TM consults during the pandemic, and a trend toward fewer phone consults. There was no difference in time metrics between the patients treated off-hours vs on-hours in the pandemic period. TM may be advantageous over in-person neurology coverage during crises, and is consistent regardless of the hour/day. Contrary to other studies, the number of acute TM consults and patients receiving tPA did not differ between the study periods. Routine consults decreased during the pandemic - perhaps coinciding with state closure mandates/fewer hospitalized stroke patients. (Figure Presented).","Diaz Rojas, M. V.; Wu, T.

251408,Challenges in providing oral and dental health services in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges and disruptions to hospitals throughout the world, with profound implications for cardiac surgery and cardiac surgeons. In this review, we highlight the hospital and cardiac surgical experience at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas as of mid-July 2020. Our local experience has consisted of a spring surge (early March to early May), followed by a relative flattening and then a summer surge (early June to present day), similar to a sine wave. Throughout the entire pandemic, our simultaneous medical priorities have been treating the growing number of patients with COVID-19 while continuing to provide needed care for those without COVID-19. The current situation will be the ""new normal"" until a vaccine becomes available. It will be vital to stay attuned to epidemiologists, public health officials, and infection control experts, because what they see today, the intensive care units will see tomorrow. The lessons we have learned are outlined in this review but can be summarized most succinctly: preparation. We must prepare in advance, stockpile supplies and personal protective equipment, have rapid and vigorous testing protocols in place, utilize technology (eg, online meetings, videoconference ""office visits""), and encourage hospital-wide and community protective efforts (social distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene).

No published systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines based on data from phase III clinical trials. Therefore, this study has estimated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the differences between vaccine types. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, medRxiv databases and two websites were used to retrieve the studies. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled efficacy and safety with risk ratio (RR). A total of eight studies, seven COVID-19 vaccines and 158,204 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. All the vaccines had a good preventive effect on COVID-19 (RR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09–0.32), and the mRNA vaccine (RR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03–0.09) was the most effective against COVID-19, while the inactivated vaccine (RR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19–0.54) was the least. In terms of safety, the risk of overall adverse events showed an increase in the vaccine group after the first (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.03–2.05) or second (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04–2.20) injection. However, compared with the first injection, the risk of local (RR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.02–6.83 vs. RR = 2.25, 95% CI: 0.52–9.75) and systemic (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.21–1.46 vs. RR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.84–3.01) adverse events decreased after the second injection. As for the mRNA vaccine, the risk of overall adverse events increased significantly, compared with the placebo, no matter whether it was the first (RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.80–1.86) or the second (RR = 2.16, 95% CI = 2.11–2.20) injection. All the COVID-19 vaccines that have published the data of phase III clinical trials have excellent efficacy, and the risk of adverse events is acceptable. The mRNA vaccines were the most effective against COVID-19, meanwhile the risk and grade of adverse events was minimal, compared to that of severe symptoms induced by COVID-19.","Cheng, Haoyue Peng Zhicheng Luo Wenliang Si Shuting Mo Minjia Zhou Haibo Xin Xing Liu Hui Yu Yunxian",Vaccines,,406

We investigate the problem of partial information, where the state of each agent is not known and the control must be decided based on noisy observations. This results in a high dimensional controlled Markov process that is impractical to handle directly. In the limit as the number of agents approaches infinity, a finite dimensional mean field optimal control problem emerges, where the dependence on the available information vanishes. In this work, we calculate the Gaussian fluctuations about the mean field optimal control, which incorporates the available observations. The method we establish uses an approximate Kalman filter on the fluctuations about the mean field solution. It is straightforward to compute, even when the number of states is large. We consider an example of an epidemic model with observation of positive tests, as well as simple two state model that exhibits a phase transition at which point the fluctuations diverge.","Palmer, Aaron Zeff",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05974v1.pdf,406

A total of 900 HCPs (300 from each country) and 1,797 adult community members (approximately 600 from each country) participated in the study. Adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using modified Poisson regression. According to the HCPs, more than half (56%) of essential health services were affected. Child health services and HIV/surgical/other services had a slightly higher percentage of interruption (33%) compared with maternal health services (31%). A total of 21.8%, 19.3%, and 7.7% of the community members reported that their family members and themselves had difficulty accessing childcare services, maternal health, and other health services, respectively.

However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n = 92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369 ± 2.003, social isolation: 8.000 ± 2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565 ± 6.605 and 22.087 ± 8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis.

Nine met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. They were published from 2011 to 2018 and conducted in the USA (n = 6), Australia (n = 2) and Canada (n = 1). None of the studies offered insight into self-managing cancer within a rural-urban context in the UK. Studies used qualitative (n = 4), mixed methods (n = 4) and quantitative designs (n = 1). CONCLUSION: If rural and urban populations define their health in different ways as some of the extant literature suggests, then efforts to support self-management in both populations will need to be better informed by robust evidence given the increasing focus on patient-centred care. It is important to consider if residency can be a predictor of as well as a barrier or facilitator to self-management.","Nelson, David; McGonagle, Ian; Jackson, Christine; Kane, Ros",Support. care cancer,,406

The existing therapeutic options for COVID-19 beyond the intensive supportive care are limited, with an undefined or modest efficacy reported so far. Drug repurposing represents an enthusiastic mechanism to use approved drugs outside the scope of their original indication and accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic options. With the emergence of COVID-19, drug repurposing has been largely applied for early clinical testing. In this review, we discuss some repurposed anticancer drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, which are under investigation in clinical trials or proposed for the clinical testing.","El Bairi, Khalid; Trapani, Dario; Petrillo, Angelica; Le Page, Cécile; Zbakh, Hanaa; Daniele, Bruno; Belbaraka, Rhizlane; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Afqir, Said",Eur J Cancer,,406

Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed.","Lee, Whanhee; Kim, Honghyok; Choi, Hayon Michelle; Heo, Seulkee; Fong, Kelvin C; Yang, Jooyeon; Park, Chaerin; Kim, Ho; Bell, Michelle L",Sci Total Environ,,406

Of note, our patient received three courses of steroids in total during his ICU stay,and current literature strongly supports the use of steroids in critically unwell patients with COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest reported ventilated time and intensive care/hospital stay for a surviving patient with COVID-19 and highlights the importance of allowing sufficient time for clinical interventions to take effect, even when the prognosis appears bleak.","Chia, Germaine; Barrett, Hannah; Patel, Parind; Soni, Sanooj",BMJ case reports,,406
258483,Burnout and Interventions for Healthcare workers to cope during COVID-19,2021,"The Mumbai Suburban Railways, \emph{locals}, are a key transit infrastructure of the city and is crucial for resuming normal economic activity. To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. \emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on \textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic \&social activity.","Talekar, Alok; Shriram, Sharad; Vaidhiyan, Nidhin; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Venkatramanan, Srini; Wang, Lijing; Adiga, Aniruddha; Sadilek, Adam; Tendulkar, Ashish; Marathe, Madhav; Sundaresan, Rajesh; Tambe, Milind",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12839v2.pdf,406

Health care workers were faced with a disease that led to significant morbidity and mortality with no proven therapies. As hospitals became inundated with patients and underwent rapid expansion of capacity, resources such as drugs, protective and medical equipment, and hospital staff became limited. Pharmacists played a critical role in the management of clinical care and drug delivery during the pandemic. As members of the department of pharmacy within NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, we describe our experiences and processes to overcome challenges faced during the pandemic. Strict inventory management through the use of daily usage reports, frequent communication, and minimization of waste was critical for the management of drug shortages. The creation of guidelines, protocols, and restrictions were not only used to mitigate drug shortages, but also helped educate health care providers and guided medication use. Managing technology through setting up new automatic dispensing cabinets to address hospital expansions and modifying the electronic order entry system to include new protocols and drug shortage information were also vital. Additional key pharmacist functions included provision of investigational drug service support and training of pharmacists, prescribers, nurses, and respiratory therapists to educate and standardize medication use. Through implementation of operational and clinical processes, pharmacists managed critical drug inventory and guided patient treatment.

The ever-growing list of globally spread corona virus-19 disease (COVID-19) patients has demonstrated the high transmission rate among the human population. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs or vaccines to prevent and treat the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. Considering the current state of affairs, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify novel and effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by re-evaluating the knowledge of traditional medicines and repurposing of drugs. Here, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach to explore the beneficial roles of phytochemicals and active pharmacological agents present in the Indian herbs which are widely used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines in the form of Kadha to control various respiratory disorders such as cough, cold and flu. Our study has identified an array of phytochemicals present in these herbs which have significant docking scores and potential to inhibit different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other Coronavirus target proteins. The phytochemicals present in these herbs possess significant anti-inflammatory property. Apart from this, based on their pharmaceutical characteristics, we have also performed in-silico drug-likeness and predicted pharmacokinetics of the selected phytochemicals found in the Kadha. Overall our study provides scientific justification in terms of binding of active ingredients present in different plants used in Kadha preparation with viral proteins and target proteins for prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.

The study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry, providing an evidence base for the growing use of Telepsychiatry.MethodThe authors searched three databases - Cochrane, PubMed and PsychINFO - using the terms virtual consultation/telepsychiatry/video consultation AND psychiatry/mental illness.The authors excluded all papers that were not in English and that did not focus on the psychiatric consultation.Result961 papers were identified, reduced to 321 using exclusion criteria and removal of duplicates. Using thematic analysis the authors found five themes that occurred across all papers in relation to the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry.Patient & Clinician SatisfactionThere is consistently high patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry but lower clinician satisfaction, often as a result of cynicism and a lack of familiarity. Clinician satisfaction increases when clinicians trial Telepsychiatry and become more positive about its uses.Diagnostic ReliabilityTelepsychiatry was found to have high levels of inter-rater reliability equivalent to face-to-face consultations for common disorders including mood and psychotic disorders, substance misuse and dementia. It was also found to have high levels of diagnostic reliability across age groups.OutcomesTelepsychiatry has been found to reduce symptoms of common psychiatric disorders and improve quality of life in a variety of environments including emergency departments, inpatient units and prisons. Telepsychiatry increases access to specialised services resulting in quicker access to treatment and reduction in admissions.TechnologyWithout adequate internet connectivity clinicians are unable to conduct an appropriate mental state examination and the therapeutic relationship becomes challenging. Inadequate technology can impact the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry amongst those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and may not have access to appropriate technology.Professional GuidanceThere is a concerning lack of guidance around the use of Telepsychiatry. Without clear protocols there is a lack of standardisation and clinicians are unwilling to integrate Telepsychiatry into their practice. Main concerns raised are around confidentiality, consent, the appropriateness of certain patient groups and emergencies.ConclusionThis review found evidence for the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry with greatest emphasis on technology and patient satisfaction. The main barrier is the reluctance amongst clinicians to facilitate Telepsychiatry into their practice, often due to cynicism and a lack of familiarity. The authors recommend training in the uses of Telepsychiatry and the provision of professional guidance from medical bodies to allay concerns and provide clear standards.","Sharma, Gunjan Karrish Devan",BJPsych Open,,406

The study shows a general upswing in the grocery trade and disproportionately high growth in online grocery trade and identifies driving and limiting factors. While COVID-19 has opened a window of opportunity, our results indicate little transition of grocery to e-grocery. This finding can be explained by the sudden and temporary constellation at the level of the socio-technical regime during the pandemic.

However, many phenomena are non-Gaussian, and these estimators can therefore have poor efficiency. This paper proposes a new tunable S-estimator, termed the S-q estimator, for the general class of symmetric elliptical distributions, a class containing many common families such as the multivariate Gaussian, t-, Cauchy, Laplace, hyperbolic, and normal inverse Gaussian distributions. Across this class, the S-q estimator is shown to generally provide higher maximum efficiency than other leading high-breakdown estimators while maintaining the maximum breakdown point. Furthermore, its robustness is demonstrated to be on par with these leading estimators while also being more stable with respect to initial conditions. From a practical viewpoint, these properties make the S-q broadly applicable for practitioners. This is demonstrated with an example application -- the minimum-variance optimal allocation of financial portfolio investments.","Fishbone, Justin A.; Mili, Lamine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13567v1.pdf,406

A service evaluation of the views of patients, parents/carers and staff",2021,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for gastric cancer, however, it bears a high postoperative morbidity and mortality rate. A recent randomized control trial proposed prehabilitation to reduce the postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Currently, there is a lack of evidence of using prehabilitation for patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The aim of our study is to demonstrate that home-based prehabilitation can reduce postoperative morbidity after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS: PREFOG is a multi-center, open-label randomized control trial comparing 90-days postoperative morbidity rate after gastrectomy for gastric cancer between patients with or without prehabilitation. One-hundred twenty-eight patients will be randomized into an intervention or control group. The intervention arm will receive trimodal home-based prehabilitation including nutritional, psychological and exercise interventions. Secondary outcomes of the study will include physical and nutritional status, anxiety and depression level, quality of life, postoperative mortality rates and full completion of the oncological treatment as determined by the multidisciplinary tumor board. DISCUSSION: PREFOG study will show if home-based trimodal prehabilitation is effective to reduce postoperative morbidity after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes. METHODS: The ENCOVID multicentre study included patients with encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from 13 centres in northern Italy. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a wide spectrum of encephalitis characterized by different clinical presentation, response to treatment and outcomes.","Pilotto, Andrea; Masciocchi, Stefano; Volonghi, Irene; Crabbio, Massimo; Magni, Eugenio; De Giuli, Valeria; Caprioli, Francesca; Rifino, Nicola; Sessa, Maria; Gennuso, Michele; Cotelli, Maria Sofia; Turla, Marinella; Balducci, Ubaldo; Mariotto, Sara; Ferrari, Sergio; Ciccone, Alfonso; Fiacco, Fabrizio; Imarisio, Alberto; Risi, Barbara; Benussi, Alberto; Premi, Enrico; Focà, Emanuele; Caccuri, Francesca; Leonardi, Matilde; Gasparotti, Roberto; Castelli, Francesco; Zanusso, Gianluigi; Pezzini, Alessandro; Padovani, Alessandro",J. infect. dis,,406

Using real-time data from the electricity system is especially challenging for quantitative applications requiring high quality and physically consistent data. Until now, time-intensive, ad-hoc and manual data verification and cleaning strategies have been used to prepare the data for quantitative analysis. As an alternative to existing techniques, here we provide a physics-informed framework to greatly accelerate and automate data processing to enable internally consistent electric system consumption, production, import, and export data in near real-time. A key component of this framework is an optimization program to minimize the data adjustments required to satisfy energy conservation equations. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by applying it to the continental United States electricity network. The resulting publicly-available data set, which provides in near-real time, hourly updates on electricity generation, consumption, imports, exports and associated emissions, is the first of this nature.","Chalendar, Jacques A de; Benson, Sally M",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05663v3.pdf,406

266743,Serum cytokines profile of critically ill COVID-19 patients with cardiac dysfunction,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally with far-reaching, significant, and unprecedented impacts on health and everyday life. Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data mining methods will also be used. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic; demographic correlates of distress; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for practitioners and useful for informing policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions during the pandemic.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO number, CRD42017073266), we systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for studies examining association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills, without restriction in study design or language. Two reviewers extracted in an independent way the data. The Quality of Reporting of Observational Longitudinal Research scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. Effect size (ES) for adjusted models and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for (i) intelligence quotient, (ii) language related skills and (iii) mathematic related skills comparing offspring's cognitive skills when gestational weight gain was within recommendations (as reference) with those from mothers whose gestational weight gain was above or below the recommendations. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. There was a positive trend that associated gestational weight gain above recommendations with better offspring's intelligence quotient, although not statistically significant (ES 0.02, 95% CI -0.00, 0.05; I2 = 0.00%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a not significant positive association between gestational weight gain above recommendations and intelligence quotient and some studies reported associations between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills. Our analyses confirm a wide variability in the results of studies published so far and highlights the need for conducting studies including specific samples of pregnant women by pre-pregnancy body mass index and trimester of pregnancy.","Martínez-Hortelano, Jose Alberto; Álvarez-Bueno, Celia; Cavero-Redondo, Iván; Herráiz-Adillo, Ángel; Berlanga-Macías, Carlos; Martínez-Vizcaíno, Vicente",BMC Pediatr,,406
268269,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown on Caregivers of People With Dementia,2021,"Preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent for COVID-19) requires implementing contact and respiratory precautions. Modifying human behavior is challenging and requires understanding knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding health threats. This study explored KAPs among people in Ecuador. A cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire was used to assess knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes toward ability to control COVID-19, self-reported practices related to COVID-19, and demographics. A total of 2399 individuals participated. Participants had moderate to high levels of knowledge. Participants expressed mixed attitudes about the eventual control of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Participants reported high levels of adoption of preventive practices. Binomial regression analysis suggests unemployed individuals, househusbands/housewives, or manual laborers, as well as those with an elementary school education, have lower levels of knowledge. Women, people over 50 years of age, and those with higher levels of schooling were the most optimistic. Men, individuals 18-29, single, and unemployed people took the riskiest behaviors. Generally, knowledge was not associated with optimism or with practices. Our findings indicate knowledge about COVID-19 is insufficient to prompt behavioral change among Ecuadorians. Since current COVID-19 control campaigns seek to educate the public, these efforts' impacts are likely to be limited. Given attitudes determine people's actions, further investigation into the factors underlying the lack of confidence in the ability of the world, and of Ecuador, to overcome COVID-19, is warranted. Edu-communicational campaigns should be accompanied by efforts to provide economically disadvantaged populations resources to facilitate adherence to recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus.","Bates, Benjamin R; Moncayo, Ana L; Costales, Jaime A; Herrera-Cespedes, Carolina A; Grijalva, Mario J",J Community Health,,406

To establish a safe and convenient assay system for studying entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we constructed a codon-optimized, full-length C-terminal mutant spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2. We generated a luciferase (Luc)-expressing pseudovirus containing the wild-type or mutant S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the envelope-defective HIV-1 backbone. The key parameters for this pseudovirus-based assay, including the S mutants and virus incubation time, were optimized. This pseudovirus contains a Luc reporter gene that enabled us to easily quantify virus entry into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing 293T cells. Cathepsin (Cat)B/L inhibitor E-64d could significantly block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in 293T-ACE2 cells. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients or recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. Thus, we developed a pseudovirus-based assay for SARS-CoV-2, which will be valuable for evaluating viral entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against this highly pathogenic virus.","Hu, Jie; Gao, Qingzhu; He, Changlong; Huang, Ailong; Tang, Ni; Wang, Kai",,,406

The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis. However, the maximal specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, recent evidence indicated that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with ""re-examination positive"" might be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 also increases the rate of false-negative results. Moreover, the mixed sample nucleic acid detection is helpful in seeking out the early community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly, but the detection kit needs ultra-high detection sensitivity. Herein, the lowest detection concentration of different nucleic acid detection kits was evaluated and compared to provide direct evidence for the selection of kits for mixed sample detection or make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.","Zhou, Yunying; Pei, Fengyan; Ji, Mingyu; Wang, Li; Zhao, Huailong; Li, Huanjie; Yang, Weihua; Wang, Qingxi; Zhao, Qianqian; Wang, Yunshan",PLoS One,,406

Healthcare personnel (HCP) constitute a priority group for several vaccinations. However, studies indicate significant rates of vaccine hesitancy among them and, therefore, of acceptance of vaccination recommendations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in Southern Italy to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCP about VPDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and search for determinants that may influence their choice. A self-administered questionnaire was used. HCP improved their knowledge about VPDs and were more favorable to vaccinations in September-December 2020 compared to January-December 2019. Overall, 75% of respondents would get a COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings indicate a potential role of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Italian HCP's knowledge and attitudes towards vaccines.","Ledda, Caterina; Costantino, Claudio; Cuccia, Mario; Maltezou, Helena C; Rapisarda, Venerando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,406
270252,Pharmacy-related buprenorphine access barriers: An audit of pharmacies in counties with a high opioid overdose burden,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Certified nursing assistant (CNA) turnover and retention are critical aspects of facilities' ability to provide cost-effective, high quality person-centered care. Previous studies and industry practice often treat turnover and retention as similar concepts, assuming that low turnover and high retention are synonymous. The study addressed the question of whether turnover and retention rates differ and if so, what do those differences mean for nursing home practice, policy, and research. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study examines facility-level factors associated with CNA retention and turnover rates using 2015 data from the Ohio Biennial Survey of Long-Term Care Facilities, Ohio Medicaid Cost Reports, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Report, and the Area Health Resource File. Using bivariate tests and regression analysis, we compare rates and the factors associated with retention and turnover. RESULTS: The mean facility annual retention rate was 64% and the mean annual turnover rate was 55%. As expected, there was a statistically significant and negative correlation between the rates (r = -0.26). However, some facilities had both high retention and high turnover and some had low rates for both measures. Not all the variables that are associated with turnover are also associated with retention. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: CNA retention is not simply the absence of CNA turnover. Given the differences, nursing homes may need to use strategies and policies designed to target a particular stability measure.","Kennedy, Katherine A; Applebaum, Robert; Bowblis, John R",GerontologistGerontologist,,406
270257,Transitional care during COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: Calls for new strategies to integrate traditional approaches with information and communication technologies,2021,"As the world continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, we are gaining valuable insights by comparing this virus to other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that have also caused outbreaks. Coronaviruses infect many animal species, but disease severity varies between strains. Viral accessory proteins are generally implicated in increased infectivity, pathogenicity, and virulence. The accessory protein open reading frame 8 (ORF8), although not essential for viral replication, appears to play a critical role in disease severity by inhibiting multiple pathways of the immune response. Furthermore, the ORF8 gene is found within a highly variable portion of the genome, increasing the possibility of dangerous mutant forms arising. Structure-based design of therapeutics holds great promise for effective targeting of such rapidly evolving threats. Thus, we designed physical models and computer representations of ORF8, based on the published structure 7JTL, to better evaluate the structural features responsible for viral pathogenicity. ORF8 exists as a homodimer held together by amino acid residues that interact through hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, a salt bridge, and a disulfide bond. These interactions occur in a region referred to as the covalent interface. Another interface, referred to as the noncovalent interface, exists between separate homodimers and results in oligomerization. The homodimers in the oligomer are held together by an intermolecular beta sheet that is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic surface. These two dimerization interfaces are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and have been proposed to be involved in the protein's ability to evade and suppress the host immune response. The computer and physical representations allow for better visualization of the ORF8 structure to evaluate the role of the multimeric structure. ORF8 has been found to interact with various host proteins, including Interleukin-17 Receptor A (IL17RA), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. To further corroborate the existence of this interaction and to better understand the role oligomerization might play in pathogenicity, we assessed the possible interactions of ORF8 (7JTL) and IL17RA (5N9B) through theoretical modeling using available tools such as HDOCK. A better understanding of these inter-subunit interactions may improve our understanding of the unique mechanism the virus uses to evade the immune system and may be instrumental in the development of effective therapeutics.","Robinson, Allison Peterson Ryan Stearns Leeann Vazquetelles Ryan Wiles Elizabeth Hart Bailey Guzman Karen",The FASEB Journal,,406

This paper presents design components and rationale for constructing highly efficient trials to screen potential COVID-19 treatments. METHODS: Key trial design elements useful in this circumstance include futility hypotheses, treatment pooling, reciprocal controls, ranking and selection, and platform administration. Assuming most of the many candidates for COVID-19 treatment are likely to be ineffective, these components can be combined to facilitate very efficient comparisons of treatments. RESULTS: Simulations indicate such designs can reliably discard underperforming treatments using sample size to treatment ratios under 30. CONCLUSIONS: Methods to create very efficient clinical trial comparisons of treatments for COVID-19 are available. Such designs might be helpful in the pandemic and should be considered for similar needs in the future.","Piantadosi, Steven",Clin Trials,,406

This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. RESULTS: Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. CONCLUSION: The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government. This study's findings reported that superior health facilities are required to treat the patients.

272511,Heartbeat: racial and ethnic healthcare disparities in cardiovascular care,2021,"Large-scale conformational transitions in the spike protein S2 domain are required during host-cell infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Although conventional molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2, it is still challenging to gain molecular insight into the key conformational changes because of the size of the spike protein and the long timescale required to capture these transitions. In this work, we have developed an efficient simulation protocol that leverages many short simulations, a dynamic selection algorithm, and Markov state models to interrogate the structural changes of the S2 domain. We discovered that the conformational flexibility of the dynamic region upstream of the fusion peptide in S2 is coupled to the proteolytic cleavage state of the spike protein. These results suggest that opening of the fusion peptide likely occurs on a submicrosecond timescale after cleavage at the S2' site. Building on the structural and dynamical information gained to date about S2 domain dynamics, we provide proof of principle that a small molecule bound to a seam neighboring the fusion peptide can slow the opening of the fusion peptide, leading to a new inhibition strategy for experiments to confirm. In aggregate, these results will aid the development of drug cocktails to inhibit infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","Remington, Jacob M; McKay, Kyle T; Ferrell, Jonathon B; Schneebeli, Severin T; Li, Jianing",Biophys J,,406
272693,The pandemic of 21st century - COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal anxiety has been a significant public health issue globally, leading to adverse health outcomes for mothers and children. The study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and anxiety level of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan and investigate the influencing factors for prenatal anxiety in this specific context. METHODS: Pregnant subjects' KAP towards COVID-19 and their sociodemographics and pregnancy information were collected using questionnaires. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prenatal anxiety prevalence in this population was 20.8%. The mean score of knowledge was 13.2 ± 1.1 on a 0 ~ 14 scale. The attitudes and practices data showed that 580/ 817 (71.0%) were very concerned about the news of COVID-19, 455/817 (55.7%) considered the official media to be the most reliable information source for COVID-19, and 681/817 (83.4%) were anxious about the possibility of being infected by COVID-19. However, only 83/817 (10.2%) worried about contracting COVID-19 infection through the ultrasound transducer during a routing morphology scan. About two-thirds 528/817 (64.6%) delayed or canceled the antenatal visits. Approximately half of them 410/817 (50.2%) used two kinds of personal protection equipments (PPEs) during hospital visits. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the influential factors for prenatal anxiety included previous children in the family, knowledge score, media trust, worry of contracting the COVID-19 infection and worry about getting infected with COVID-19 from the ultrasound probe antenatal care (ANC) schedule. CONCLUSION: Prenatal anxiety was prevalent among pregnant women in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19. The current findings identified factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety that could be targeted for psychological care.","Ding, Wenping; Lu, Jianmei; Zhou, Yan; Wei, Weizhong; Zhou, Zhihong; Chen, Min",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,406

275305,A Rapid Multi-Centre Service Evaluation of Presentations to Children's Emergency Departments During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives for this study were to assess whether gout and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis and to assess whether gout and/or RA are risk factors for death from COVID-19. METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses: analysis A, to test for association between gout and/or RA and COVID-19 diagnosis (n = 473,139); analysis B, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died of or survived COVID-19 (n = 2059); analysis C, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID-19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n = 473,139). RESULTS: RA, but not gout, was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in analysis A. Neither RA nor gout was associated with risk of death in the group diagnosed with COVID-19 in analysis B. However, RA was associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 by using the UK Biobank cohort in analysis C, independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.9; 95% confidence interval CI 1.2-3.0). Gout was not associated with death related to COVID-19 in the same UK Biobank analysis (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8-1.7). CONCLUSION: RA is a risk factor for death from COVID-19 by using the UK Biobank cohort.

Given its unique political system dominated by the People’s Action Party (PAP) and bureaucratic culture, the Singapore government has progressively implemented numerous control measures including strict travel bans, contact tracing, “Circuit Breaker,” compulsory mask-wearing, and social distancing policies, along with financial relief to businesses and workers, in a very top-down fashion. Although the health and treatment issues of foreign migrant workers in dormitories continue to be the subject of ongoing debate among many scholars, it should be noted that the mortality rate in Singapore still remains very low compared to that of many other countries. Singapore’s case points to an important lesson that learning-driven coordinated strategic approaches matter for effective crisis management in the long term.","Abdullah, Walid Jumblatt; Kim, Soojin",Am.

WHO guidelines for COVID-19 clinical management includes infection control and prevention, social distancing and supportive care using supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilator support. Currently, evolving researches and clinical reports regarding infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs that may produce appropriate pharmacological therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 infected patients. In this study, we performed virtual screening and evaluated the obtained results of US-FDA approved small molecular database library (302 drug molecule) against two important different protein targets in COVID-19. Best compounds in molecular docking were used as a training set for generation of two different pharmacophores. The obtained pharmacophores were employed for virtual screening of ChEMBL database. The filtered compounds were clustered using Finger print model to obtain two compounds that will be subjected to molecular docking simulations against the two targets. Compounds complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease and S-protein were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD simulation studies suggest the potential inhibitory activity of ChEMBL398869 against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and restress the importance of Gln189 flexibility in inhibitors recognition through increasing S2 subsite plasticity.","Said, Mohamed A; Albohy, Amgad; Abdelrahman, Mohamed A; Ibrahim, Hany S",Eur J Pharm Sci,,406
278386,How Should Board Certification Evolve?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ¯=â¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ¯=â¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ¯=â¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ¯=â¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ¯=â¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ¯=â¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ¯=â¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ¯=â¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","González-Blanco, Leticia; Dal Santo, Francesco; García-Álvarez, Leticia; de la Fuente-Tomás, Lorena; Moya Lacasa, Carlota; Paniagua, Gonzalo; Sáiz, Pilar A; García-Portilla, María Paz; Bobes, Julio",Schizophr. res,,406

There are many methods for estimating $R$; however, few of these explicitly model heterogeneous disease reproduction, which gives rise to superspreading within the population. Here we propose a parsimonious discrete-time branching process model for epidemic curves that incorporates heterogeneous individual reproduction numbers. Our Bayesian approach to inference illustrates that this heterogeneity results in less certainty on estimates of the time-varying cohort reproduction number $R_t$. Leave-future-out cross-validation evaluates the predictive performance of the proposed model, allowing us to assess epidemic curves for evidence of superspreading. We apply these methods to a COVID-19 epidemic curve for the Republic of Ireland and find some support for heterogeneous disease reproduction. We conclude that the 10\% most infectious index cases account for approximately 40-80\% of the expected secondary infections. Our analysis highlights the difficulties in identifying heterogeneous disease reproduction from epidemic curves and that heterogeneity is a vital consideration when estimating $R_t$.","Meagher, Joe; Friel, Nial",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12064v1.pdf,406

282101,Enhance care continuity post COVID-19,2021,"During COVID-19 emergency the majority of health structures in Europe saturated or nearly saturated their availabilities already in the first weeks of the epidemic period especially in some regions of Italy and Spain. The aim of this study is to analyse the efficiency in the management of hospital beds before the COVID-19 outbreak at regional level in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This analysis can indicate a reference point for future analysis on resource management in emergency periods and help hospital managers, emergency planners as well as policy makers to put in place a rapid and effective response to an emergency situation. The results of this study clearly underline that France and Germany could rely on the robust structural components of the hospital system, compared to Italy and Spain. Presumably, this might have had an impact on the efficacy in the management of the COVID-19 diffusion. In particular, the high availability of beds in the majority of the France regions paired with the low occupancy rate and high turnover interval led these regions to have a high number of available beds. Consider also that this country generally manages complex cases. A similar structural component is present in the German regions where the number of available beds is significantly higher than in the other countries. The impact of the COVID-19 was completely different in Italy and Spain that had to deal with a relevant large number of patients relying on a reduced number of both hospital beds and professionals. A further critical factor compared to France and Germany concerns the dissimilar distribution of cases across regions. Even if in these countries the hospital beds were efficiently managed, the concentration of hospitalized patients and the scarcity of beds have put pressure on the hospital systems.","Pecoraro, Fabrizio; Luzi, Daniela; Clemente, Fabrizio",PLoS One,,406

We estimated associations between preexisting diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort. METHODS: UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006-2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and preexisting common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (March 16 to April 26, 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. RESULTS: Of 269 070 participants aged older than 65, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common comorbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%), and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age group, sex, ethnicity, and education, preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first 5 remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic kidney disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men. CONCLUSIONS: There are specific high-risk preexisting comorbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and related deaths in community-based older men and women. These results do not support simple age-based targeting of the older population to prevent severe COVID-19 infections.","Atkins, Janice L; Masoli, Jane A H; Delgado, Joao; Pilling, Luke C; Kuo, Chia-Ling; Kuchel, George A; Melzer, David",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,,406

286378,Pilot assessment of a virtual intensive outpatient program for adults with eating disorders,2020,"An association among the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) with the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association between application of ACEI/ARB and risk of COVID-19, inflammation level, severity COVID-19 infection, and death in patients with COVID-19. Eleven studies were included with 33 483 patients. ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated immune cells counts (CD3, CD8). Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI/ARB therapy, and ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79). Subgroup analyses showed among the general population, ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with reduced severe COVID-19 infection (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.60-1.05) and all-cause mortality (OR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.75), and COVID-19 infection (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID-19 (OR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.51-1.03) and lower mortality (OR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.00). On the basis of the available evidence, ACEI/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID-19, either in general population or hypertension patients. Our results need to be interpreted with caution considering the potential for residual confounders, and more well-designed studies that control the clinical confounders are necessary to confirm our findings.","Liu, Xiao; Long, Chuyan; Xiong, Qinmei; Chen, Chen; Ma, Jianyong; Su, Yuhao; Hong, Kui",Clin. cardiol,,406

287297,What to Do With Sideline Guilt-Reply,2021,"Physical distancing measures are important tools to control disease spread, especially in the absence of treatments and vaccines. While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing-both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing-and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples' behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come.","Newbold, Stephen C; Finnoff, David; Thunström, Linda; Ashworth, Madison; Shogren, Jason F",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,406

Early prediction whether and when cognitive decline from normal cognition (NC) will occur is crucial for preventing or delaying the progression timely. The current study aimed to provide a personalized risk assessment of CI by using baseline information and establishing a multi-predictor nomogram. METHODS: 108 patients with PD were collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), of whom 58 had progressed to CI and 50 remained NC during 5-year follow up. Radiomics signatures were obtained by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. Clinical factors and laboratory biomarkers were selected by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The combined model of radiomics signatures and clinical risk factors was developed by a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. A multi-predictor nomogram derived from the combined model was established for individualized estimation of time to progress (TTP) of CI. We analyzed the risk of two subgroups of the combined model by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. RESULTS: The combined model showed the best performance with a C-index of 0.988 and 0.926 in the training and validation datasets. KM analysis verified significant TTP of CI (Pï¼0.05) between two subgroups stratified by the cutoff value (-0.058). CONCLUSION: The combined model and its multi-predictor nomogram can be used to perfectly and individually predict the TTP of CI for patients with PD. Stratification of PD will benefit its timely clinical intervention and the delay and prevention of CI.","Tang, Chunyan; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Wu, Wei; Zhong, Weijia; Wu, Xiaojia",Neurosci Lett,,406
288886,Building Back Better: Applying Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic to Expand Critical Information Access,2021,"Biosecurity as a discipline remains largely defined by institutional-level practices unbounded by the guidelines and checklists prevalent in the field of biosafety. The result is a high-level of interpretation at the individual and institutional level of defining and implementing biosecurity. At its core, biosecurity frameworks are largely anchored to a mirrored process of risk assessment and management. Therefore, biosecurity is still rooted in the fields of threat and vulnerability assessment, analysis, and management. The aperture of threat and vulnerability management may at first seem contrary to the overall field of public health where emerging infectious disease, and the negative consequences, are more commonly perceived as risks. However, in the spectrum of threat to vulnerability to risk (see Chaps. “ Redefining Biosecurity by Application in Global Health, Biodefense, and Developing Technologies ” and “ The Biothreat Assessment as a Foundation for Biosecurity ”) infectious disease as an entity emerges as a threat. The ability or inability to respond and defend from infectious disease can be characterized as vulnerabilities. The negative consequences (e.g., spread of, infection, mortality, economic impacts) exist as a probability of occurrence, or simply, a risk. This is increasingly evident at the time of composition of this chapter and this book during the global COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter explores the parallels and distinctions of biosecurity-related concepts as they apply to the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons learned from previous epidemics and pandemics, and offers suggestions of stronger connectivity to threat and vulnerability management concepts as we inevitably prepare for future epidemics and pandemics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dittrich, S.; Richardson, L.; Burnette, R.

As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors. In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection ('totally naïve'), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. For R0 > 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission dies out. Non-pharmaceutical strategies to handle the epidemic are sketched and based on current knowledge, the current situation is sketched and scenarios for the near future discussed.","Hens, Niel; Vranck, Pascal; Molenberghs, Geert",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,,406

Hence, applying preventive measures is the most critical intervention to control the infection. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens because of their immunosuppressive state and physiological adaptive change during pregnancy. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess knowledge and practice to prevent coronavirus disease and its associated factors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 participants from May 25-June 15, 2020. A simple random sampling technique was employed. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire and analysis using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall 46.8 and 47.6% of women were knowledgeable and had good practice to prevent coronavirus respectively.

The existence of superspreading implies a fat-tailed distribution of infectiousness (new secondary infections caused per day) among different individuals. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the variation in infectiousness by examining the variation in early-time growth rates of new cases among different subpopulations. We use this method to estimate the mean and variance in the infectiousness, ß, for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early stages of the pandemic within the United States.

291456,Access to Care for Dementia Patients Suffering From COVID-19,2020,"Sir, Italy has been recently involved in the outbreak of severe interstitial pneumonia associated with the previously unknown Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1,2). Even before the notification of the first autochthonous cases, the SARS-CoV-2 associated syndrome (COVID-19) had raised an intense attention in the public opinion (3), with a counterproductive over-abundance of mixed quality information. As even Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) were not spared by subsequent misunderstandings and knowledge gaps during the previous influenza pandemic of 2009 (4), we performed a web-based survey (Google® Modules), specifically aimed to characterize knowledge status and risk perceptions in a sample from participating to 6 Facebook discussion groups (181,684 total unique members at the time of the study). The questionnaire was made available between February 1st and 7th, 2020, i.e. around 2 weeks before the first COVID-19 was officially diagnosed in Italian residents. Overall, the sampled population included 2106 respondents (Table 1), and 39.3% were HCWs. Even though HCWs were more likely to exhibit a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related issues (aOR 2.195, 95%CI 1.809 to 2.664), they were not exempt for misunderstandings, particularly on actual incidence and lethality of COVID-19. Interestingly, most of respondents were aware of the main clinical features of COVID-19, with HCWs more frequently acknowledging that the COVID-19 may run pauci- or even asymptomatic (86.3% vs. 79.1%), resembling an Influenza-Like Illness (i.e. fever, cough, headache, etc.), with a potential latency up to 14 days (85·9% vs· 80·3%), eventually spreading by droplets (98.5% vs. 92.7%) rather through running water (92.3% vs· 79.8%), or blood/body fluids (88.0% vs. 70.4%). Retrospectively, the assessment of preventive measures and risk perception appears somewhat worrisome. For instance, while HCWs were more likely to acknowledge as an appropriate preventive measure wearing a filtering mask (i.e. N95/FFP2/3 mask; aOR 2.296, 95%CI 1.507 to 3.946), around » of HCWs failed to recognize the importance of such personal protective equipment, while 7.4% felt as appropriate the wearing of a surgical mask. Moreover, not only COVID-19 was appropriately acknowledged as a severe disease by only 62.0% of respondents, with no differences between HCWs and non-HCWs, but an even smaller share (i.e. 8.0%) reported any concern for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. In fact, at the time of the survey SARS-CoV-2 was more properly associated with international travelers (26.7%). Our results are therefore of certain interests for several reasons. First at all, early epidemiological reports on the Italian cases of COVID-19 hint towards some failures in the initial management of incident cases (5-6). In fact, in our survey a large share of respondents substantially overlooked the risk to interact with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, that was otherwise perceived as a not-so-severe disease (i.e. ""nothing more than a seasonal flu"", as often described in some social media) (7). Moreover, around a 1/3 of HCWs participating to the study presumptively did not use proper personal protective equipment for the airways interacting with possible COVID-19 cases, either underestimating the infection risk or being unable to recognize early symptoms. Actually, the base of evidence shared by participants at the time of the study substantially ignored that COVID-19 may be characterized by dermatologic and gastro-intestinal symptoms (8-9). As most of infections may be actually pauci- or asymptomatic, such early exposure in the healthcare settings may have contributed to the quick spreading of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Northern Italy. Therefore, despite the intrinsic limits of a convenience sampling, web-based survey (10), our study stresses the importance to improve the overall quality of information on COVID-19 conveyed not only in HCWs, but also in the general population. Moreover, our data may contribute to clarify the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy.","Riccò, Matteo; Vezzosi, Luigi; Balzarini, Federica; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",,,406

After World Health Organization leaders declared that the spread of COVID-19 was a pandemic, it became evident that patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 would present for surgery at our community hospital, the only facility in the county. The Maryland governor charged hospital administrators with expanding bed capacity in anticipation of a surge of critically ill patients. Concurrently, the Maryland secretary of health prohibited all elective procedures. During the early phase of preparation and response, processes, information, and hospital capabilities and capacity changed frequently and rapidly. Effective communication, teamwork, and interprofessional and interdepartmental collaboration helped us prepare to deliver safe surgical care to patients during the pandemic and maintain safety for all involved.

291630,Disruption of patient and family centered care through the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the past 20 years four major viral infectious diseases outbreaks caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide: SARS, Influenza H1N1, MERS, and COVID-19. They all present clinically initially as upper and lower respiratory tract infections and may progress to multi-organ failure. METHODS: This study was a systematic review of literature conducted in September 2020 to study extra-pulmonary complications of SARS, FLU, MERS, and current COVID-19. We carried out a systematic search using the keywords in online databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar until June 2020. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to review the most common extra-pulmonary manifestations of SARS, Influenza, MERS, and COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Several studies have reported extra-pulmonary conditions in patients diagnosed with SARS, Influenza, MERS, and COVID-19, either by direct viral injury or from the systemic response to the initial infection. CONCLUSION: SARS, Influenza, MERS, and COVID-19 have all been associated with dysfunction of kidneys, endocrine system, neuromuscular symptoms, perinatal complications, and myocardial injury. Progression from pulmonary disease to a systemic condition has a poor outcome and can result in multi-organ failure.","Lombardi, Alecio F; Afsahi, Amir M; Gupta, Amit; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",,,406
291712,Dilemma of Surgical Abdomen with Pulmonary Infiltrates on Chest Radiograph: Suspected Cases in COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Prior data suggest Emergency Department (ED) visits for many emergency conditions decreased during the initial COVID-19 surge. However, the pandemic's impact on the wide range of conditions seen in EDs, and the resources required for treating them, has been less studied. We sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of ED visits and associated resource utilization during the initial COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis from 5 hospitals in a large health system in Massachusetts, comparing ED encounters from 3/1/2020-4/30/2020 to identical weeks from the prior year. Data collected included demographics, ESI, diagnosis, consultations ordered, bedside procedures, and inpatient procedures within 48 h. We compared raw frequencies between time periods and calculated incidence rate ratios. RESULTS: ED volumes decreased by 30.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Average acuity of ED presentations increased, while most non-COVID-19 diagnoses decreased. The number and incidence rate of all non-critical care ED procedures decreased, while the occurrence of intubations and central lines increased. Most subspecialty consultations decreased, including to psychiatry, trauma surgery, and cardiology. Most non-elective procedures related to ED encounters also decreased, including craniotomies and appendectomies. CONCLUSION: Our health system experienced decreases in nearly all non-COVID-19 conditions presenting to EDs during the initial phase of the pandemic, including those requiring specialty consultation and urgent inpatient procedures. Findings have implications for both public health and health system planning.","Baugh, Joshua J; White, Benjamin A; McEvoy, Dustin; Yun, Brian J; Brown, David F M; Raja, Ali S; Dutta, Sayon",Am. j. emerg. med,,406

Vertical transmission has been proven in only a couple of cases so far. METHODS: We describe early-onset, severe COVID-19 disease in a neonate with very strong evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A COVID-19 suspected mother, who tested negative by RT-PCR for COVID, but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by serology, delivered a term baby. The neonate was kept in strict isolation. Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 on umbilical stump, placenta, and nasopharyngeal aspirate of the neonate, collected at birth were positive. On day 2, the neonate developed clinical features of COVID in the form of fever, poor feeding, and hyperbilirubenemia along with elevated inflammatory markers. Antibiotics were started empirically pending cultures. Blood, CSF, and urine cultures were sterile. Baby tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two more occasions before testing positive for antibodies and was discharged on day 21 of life. CONCLUSION: This report highlights a very strong possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from a mildly symptomatic, RT-PCR negative but antibody-positive mother with significant symptomatic, early-onset neonatal infection.","Kulkarni, Rajesh; Rajput, Uday; Dawre, Rahul; Valvi, Chhaya; Nagpal, Rema; Magdum, Nikita; Vankar, Harshali; Sonkawade, Naresh; Das, Aiswarya; Vartak, Sagar; Joshi, Suvarna; Varma, Santosh; Karyakarte, Rajesh; Bhosale, Ramesh; Kinikar, Aarti",Infection,,406

298205,Case with psychotic disorder as a clinical presentation of COVID-19,2020,"Background/Purpose: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early March, there has been a push to expand virtual patient care visits instead of in-person clinic visits. Studies have found that telemedicine can provide efficient triaging, reduction in emergency room visits, and conservation of health care resources and personnel. While virtual patient care has been implicated in providing similar outcomes to traditional face-to-face care, there are a lack of studies on the effectiveness of virtual care visits for patients with abnormal head shapes. This study aims to develop an understanding of whether physicians can accurately diagnose pediatric patients with craniosynostosis or deformational plagiocephaly via virtual care visits, and whether they can determine if affected patients will benefit from helmet correction or if surgical treatment is required. Methods/Description: An IRB-approved retrospective chart analysis over a 4-month period (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020) was performed analyzing all pediatric patients (&lt;18 years old) who underwent virtual care calls for diagnosis and treatment of abnormal head shape. Patients were referred to UTPhysicians Pediatric Surgery clinic for evaluation by a member of the Texas Cleft-Craniofacial Team (2 surgeons or 1 physician's assistant). Variables such as patient demographics, diagnosis, and need for confirmation were recorded. Results: Thirty-five patients were identified who fit our search criteria. Out of these patients, 11 (31.43%) cases were diagnosed with craniosynostosis and 22 (62.86%) cases were diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly. Median age at virtual care evaluation was 14.10 months (IQR 5.729, 27.542) for patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis and 6.51 months (IQR 4.669, 7.068) for patients diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly. All 11 (100%) patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis were referred for a confirmatory CT scan prior to undergoing surgical intervention and saw an alleviation in head shape postoperatively. Eighteen (81.82%) of patients diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly were recommended to undergo conservative treatment and the remaining 4 (18.18%) were recommended for helmet therapy. Two cases (5.71%) were unable to be diagnosed virtually. These patients needed a follow-up visit in person to establish a diagnosis and plan of treatment. Conclusions: Virtual care visits are increasing in frequency and this includes consultations for abnormal head shapes. Our study underscores the feasibility of virtually diagnosing and recommending a plan for treatment in pediatric patients with abnormal head shapes, with only 5.71% requiring additional treatment or in-person visits to confirm the diagnosis. This information can be implemented to further our knowledge on the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment options for patients with craniosynostosis and deformational plagiocephaly. Further analyses are needed to quantify the financial and patient-reported outcomes of virtual care visits for these patients.","Rizvi, I.; Fallah, K.; Nguyen, P.; Greives, M.",Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal,,406

The aim of this study was to explore the decision-making processes of continued paid home care support for dementia in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: Unpaid carers caring for a person living with dementia (PLWD) who were accessing paid home care before COVID-19 and residing in the UK were eligible to take part. Participants were interviewed over the phone and asked about their experiences of using paid home care services before and since COVID-19, and their decision-making processes of accessing paid home care since the outbreak and public health restrictions. RESULTS: Fifteen unpaid carers, who were also accessing paid care support for the PLWD before COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) Risk; (2) Making difficult choices and risk management; and (3) Implications for unpaid carers. Many unpaid carers decided to discontinue paid carers entering the home due to the risk of infection, resulting in unpaid carers having to pick up the care hours to support the person living with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report on the impact of COVID-19 on paid home care changes in dementia. Findings raise implications for providing better Personal Protective Equipment for paid carers, and to support unpaid carers better in their roles, with the pandemic likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Cannon, Jacqueline; Eley, Ruth; Tetlow, Hilary; Gaughan, Anna; Komuravelli, Aravind; Shenton, Justine; Rogers, Carol; Butchard, Sarah; Callaghan, Steve; Limbert, Stan; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Shaw, Lisa; Whittington, Rosie; Hughes, Mishca; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Geriatr,,406

This study is aimed at exploring the association of leptin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to RA in a Chinese population. Methods: We recruited 600 RA patients and 600 healthy controls from a Chinese population and analyzed their three leptin SNPs (rs10244329, rs2071045, and rs2167270) using the improved Multiplex Ligase Detection Reaction (iMLDR) assays. The associations of these SNPs with clinical manifestations of RA were also analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed for plasma leptin determination. Results: No significant difference in either allele or genotype frequencies of these three SNPs between RA patients and healthy controls was observed (all P > 0.05). Association between the genotype effects of dominant, recessive models was also not found (all P > 0.05). No significant difference in plasma leptin levels was detected between RA patients and controls (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Leptin gene (rs10244329, rs2071045, and rs2167270) polymorphisms are not associated with RA genetic susceptibility and its clinical features in the Chinese population.","Tao, Sha-Sha; Dan, Yi-Lin; Wu, Guo-Cui; Zhang, Qin; Zhang, Tian-Ping; Fan, Yin-Guang; Pan, Hai-Feng",Biomed Res Int,,406
301692,Comparing the operational strategies of South Korea and Israel's coronavirus drive-through testing centers and the implications on testing capacity,2020,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the present coronavirus pandemic and some suggestions were made about its possible artificial origin. We, therefore, compared SARS-CoV-2 with such known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BLAST and clustalW were used to identify and align viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to other animal coronaviruses (human, bat, mouse, pangolin) and related artificial constructs. Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL. RESULTS: Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter. On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man. CONCLUSIONS: Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded. On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to advance medical research and should not be abandoned because of irrational fears.","Dallavilla, T; Bertelli, M; Morresi, A; Bushati, V; Stuppia, L; Beccari, T; Chiurazzi, P; Marceddu, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,406
302305,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on students in a French region severely affected by the disease: results of the PIMS-CoV 19 study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the spectrum of risk factors for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) has not been well-described. While several studies evaluating the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs have been reported since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), and several more are still underway. There is, therefore, an immediate need for an ongoing, rigorous systematic review that continuously assesses the risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection among front-line HCWs. OBJECTIVE: Here, we outline a protocol to serve as a guideline for conducting a living systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the burden of COVID-19 on front-line HCWs and identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. METHODS: The protocol was developed and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The conduct of the proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis will primarily follow the principles recommended in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking systematic reviews in healthcare, and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The systematic literature searches will be performed using the EBSCOhost platform by searching the following databases within the platform: Academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, CINAHL with full text, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct databases, Google Scholar, and; also a search in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization library databases for relevant studies will be performed. The searches will include peer-reviewed articles, published in English and Mandarin language irrespective of publication year, evaluating the risk for testing positive for C0VID-19, the risk of developing symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both, among front-line HCWs. The initial review period will consider articles published since the onset of COVID-19 disease to the present and then updated monthly. Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) will be used to pool the odds ratios or mean differences for individual risk factors where possible. Results will be presented as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences, or standardised mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous outcomes. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to rate study quality, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). The results of the living systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported per the PRISMA guidelines. DISCUSSION: Though addressing the needs of front-line HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic is a high priority, data to inform such initiatives are inadequate, particularly data on the risk factor disparities between patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. The proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis anticipate finding relevant studies reporting risk factors driving the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs, thus providing subsidies for public health interventions and occupational health policies. The study results will be disseminated electronically, in print and through conference presentation, and key stakeholder meetings in the form of policy briefs.

This procedure also has had essencial role in the therapeutic approach of certain groups of pathologies. Colonic cleansing is a necessary and previous stage to do elective colonoscopy. The quality of the colon preparation has been found related directly to the sucess of procedure. Three solutions were compared as colonic cleansing agents in adult patients submitted to colonoscopy at ambulatory regimen. Sixty patients were randomized and then divided into three groups of twenty persons. Each one of these groups was submitted to a colonic cleansing with one of these studied solutions: 10% mannitol solution, sodium picosulphate and sodium phosphate. Taste, tolerance, associated side effects and quality of cleansing preparation were evaluated. Clinic parameters like standing pulse and blood pressure besides the assessment of sodium, potassium, calcium and phophate were also studied and compared with measurements taken before and after bow el preparation of each one of patients. The groups presented similar results when related to side effects. Electrolyte alterations were verified in these three studied groups without clinical signs. The variations related to cardiac frequency, blood pressure and hematocrit, though showing contraction of the intravascular volume, did not attend with clinic effects. The bad taste of sodium phosphate solution did not compromise its tolerance. The sodium phosphate and 10% mannitol solutions provide superior results in quality of colonic cleansing and as much as costs when compared to sodium picosulphate solution. When these three groups were compared all evaluated electrolytes presented significant differences and hyperphosphatemia of patients prepared with sodium phosphate solution was the most important of then. None of these differences was related to clinic effects.","Miki Jr, Paulo; Joaquim Ribeiro da Rocha, José; Aprilli, Francisco; Féres, Omar",Acta cir. bras.,,406

METHOD: Retrospective analysis of physical functioning sample data of middle-aged people with SMI was compared to standardized older adult data. Compared: Sit to Stand Test (STS; n = 68), 6 min Walk Test (6MWT; n = 71), and Single Legged Stance Test (SLS; n = 55). One sample t tests were computed, using standardized values for older adult healthy populations, to identify differences for the group. RESULTS: STS (M = 11.3 SD = 5.36), for the sample were comparable to 80-89 year old. The 6MWT values were significantly worse than 80-89-year-old range for women, t(28) = -2.88, p < .01, and men, t(40) = -5.32, p =. 00. SLS values for women and men were comparable to the 70-79-year-old range in the general population. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: People with SMI have functional fitness levels that are older than chronological age, and should be assessed regularly for physical functioning to support independent living.

311023,Bubble concept for sporting tournaments during the COVID-19 pandemic: Football Club World Cup,2021,"The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Barbouni, Anastasia; Niaura, Raymond",Intern Emerg Med,,406

The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the adjusted relationship between elevated procalcitonin on admission and the severity of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched 1805 articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to 2 April 2021. The articles were selected which reported the adjusted relationship applying multivariate analysis between PCT and the severity of COVID-19. The pooled effect estimate was calculated by the random-effects model. Results: The meta-analysis included 10 cohort studies with a total of 7716 patients. Patients with elevated procalcitonin on admission were at a higher risk of severe and critical COVID-19 (pooled effect estimate: 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.29; I2 = 85.6%, p < 0.001). Similar results were also observed in dead patients (pooled effect estimate: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.36-2.30). After adjusting for diabetes, the positive association between PCT and the severity of COVID-19 decreased. Subgroup analysis revealed heterogeneity between studies and sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. There was no evidence of publication bias by Egger's test (p = 0.106). Conclusions: Higher procalcitonin is positively associated with the severity of COVID-19, which is a potential biomarker to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and predict the prognosis.","Shen, Yue; Cheng, Cheng; Zheng, Xue; Jin, Yuefei; Duan, Guangcai; Chen, Mengshi; Chen, Shuaiyin",Medicina (Kaunas),,406

DATA: We selected studies written in English assessing or discussing the decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against SARS-CoV-2. Two independent researchers performed the search and study screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out considering the study design of the included studies. SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS, and Preprint platforms (bioRxiv and medRxiv). STUDY SELECTION: We included 55 reports from PubMed and SCOPUS. Nine articles were letters to the editors, 21 were in vitro studies, 16 were literature reviews, and 9 were classified as other study designs. We included 37 preprints. Two articles were letters to the editors, 24 were in vitro studies, 3 were literature reviews, and 8 were classified as other study designs. In general, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited and most promising. However, there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of N95 respirator decontamination. CONCLUSION: The evidence regarding decontamination strategies of N95 respirators against SARS-CoV-2 remains scarce. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation seem to be the current standard for N95 respirator decontamination. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation appear to be the most promising methods for N95 respirator decontamination.","Sarkis-Onofre, Rafael; Borges, Rafaela do Carmo; Demarco, Giulia; Dotto, Lara; Schwendicke, Falk; Demarco, Flávio Fernando",J Dent,,406

Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China were analyzed in this paper. METHODS: Various statistical and network analysis methods were employed. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 patients show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences; possible causes were explored. The estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days. Incubation periods of 92% of patients were no more than 14 days. The epidemic in Henan has undergone three stages and has shown high correlations with the numbers of patients recently returned from Wuhan. Network analysis revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various People's Hospitals are the main force in treating COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The incubation period was statistically estimated, and the proposed state transition diagram can explore the epidemic stages of emerging infectious disease. We suggest that although the quarantine measures are gradually working, strong measures still might be needed for a period of time, since â¼7.45% of patients may have very long incubation periods. Migrant workers or college students are at high risk. State transition diagrams can help us to recognize the time-phased nature of the epidemic.

320133,"Diverging temporalities of care work on urban farms: Negotiating history, responsibility, and productivity in Lithuania",2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The outbreak of COVID-19 has vastly increased the operational burden on healthcare systems worldwide. For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multicenter study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the quadripartite equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium-sized liver transplant centers from 12 countries across 4 continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a ""sickest-first"" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - recipient outcome, donor/graft safety, waiting list mortality and healthcare resources - for 7 countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems. LAY SUMMARY: There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise that models these ethical tensions and can guide the regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems.","Chew, Claire Alexandra; Iyer, Shridhar Ganpathi; Kow, Alfred Wei Chieh; Madhavan, Krishnakumar; Wong, Andrea Sze Teng; Halazun, Karim J; Battula, Narendra; Scalera, Irene; Angelico, Roberta; Farid, Shahid; Buchholz, Bettina M; Rotellar, Fernando; Chan, Albert Chi-Yan; Kim, Jong Man; Wang, Chih-Chi; Pitchaimuthu, Maheswaran; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Soin, Arvinder Singh; Derosas, Carlos; Imventarza, Oscar; Isaac, John; Muiesan, Paolo; Mirza, Darius F; Bonney, Glenn Kunnath",J. hepatol,,406
320157,Cochrane corner: Video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older people,2020,"The coronavirus disease that presumably began in 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in a pandemic. Initially, COVID-19 was thought to only affect respiration. However, accumulating evidence shows a wide range of neurological symptoms are also associated with COVID-19, such as anosmia/ageusia, headaches, seizures, demyelination, mental confusion, delirium, and coma. Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may arise due to a cytokine storm and a heighten state of inflammation. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) is a central pathway involved with inflammation and is shown to be elevated in a dose-dependent matter in response to coronaviruses. NF-&#954;B has a role in cytokine storm syndrome, which is associated with greater severity in COVID-19-related symptoms. Therefore, therapeutics that reduce the NF-&#954;B pathway should be considered in the treatment of COVID-19. Neuro-COVID-19 units have been established across the world to examine the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19. Neuro-COVID-19 is increasingly becoming an accepted term among scientists and clinicians, and interdisciplinary teams should be created to implement strategies for treating the wide range of neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients.","Davies, Don A; Adlimoghaddam, Aida; Albensi, Benedict C",Mol.

321808,Presence and Overlap of Bipolar Symptoms and Borderline Features during Major Depressive Episodes,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guidelines recommend delaying clinical care for all affected cancer patients, including incidentally diagnosed asymptomatic infections. This retrospective study conducted in a safety-net hospital in Houston examines the care delivery of asymptomatic COVID-19 cancer patients and how their diagnosis affected their care. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on cancer patients with a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory result in the Harris Health System in Houston, Texas. Patient demographics, treatment delays, and patient outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (n=24) of all patients with cancer and COVID-19 diagnosis (n=181) were asymptomatic and 96% had a solid organ malignancy. Among asymptomatic patients, 44% (n=11) of them experienced a median treatment delay of 33 days and 21% (n=5) transitioned to hospice. No patients had progression of disease at first evaluation after recovering from COVID-19 diagnosis. Asymptomatic patients were more likely to have a worse ECOG performance status, metastatic disease, and charity insurance as compared with symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the safety of our current isolation guidelines for all COVID-19 asymptomatic cancer patients. While treatment delays occurred, they did not appear to significantly impact overall care. Differences in care delivery and health care usage patterns between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients demonstrate the need for continued studies in vulnerable populations.","Chen, Nan; Jotwani, Aparna; Li, Ang",Am J Clin Oncol,,406

A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a recent respiratory syndrome epidemic in humans. In December 2019, the sudden emergence of this new coronavirus and the subsequent severe disease it causes created a serious global health threat and hazards. This is in contrast to the two aforementioned coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (in 2002) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV (in 2012), which were much more easily contained. The World Health Organization (WHO) dubbed this contagious respiratory disease an ""epidemic outbreak"" in March 2020. More than 80 companies and research institutions worldwide are working together, in cooperation with many governmental agencies, to develop an effective vaccine. To date, six authorized vaccines have been registered. Up till now, no approved drugs and drug scientists are racing from development to clinical trials to find new drugs for COVID-19. Wild animals, such as snakes, bats, and pangolins are the main sources of coronaviruses, as determined by the sequence homology between MERS-CoV and viruses in these animals. Human infection is caused by inhalation of respiratory droplets. To date, the only available treatment protocol for COVID-19 is based on the prevalent clinical signs. This review aims to summarize the current information regarding the origin, evolution, genomic organization, epidemiology, and molecular and cellular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the diagnostic and treatment approaches for COVID-19 and its impact on global health, environment, and economy.","Attia, Youssef A; El-Saadony, Mohamed T; Swelum, Ayman A; Qattan, Shaza Y A; Al-Qurashi, Adel D; Asiry, Khalid A; Shafi, Manal E; Elbestawy, Ahmed R; Gado, Ahmed R; Khafaga, Asmaa F; Hussein, Elsayed O S; Ba-Awadh, Hani; Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep; Alhussaini, Bakr; Alyileili, Salem R; El-Tarabily, Khaled A; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,406

Pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) was selected for the current study due to its sensitivity to pollutants and because is one of the emblematic fish species that inhabits shallow lakes of the Pampa region (Argentina). Recently, in Chascomús lake were recorded concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn with values above the Argentine National Guidelines for the Protection of the Aquatic life. Regarding this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of environmental concentrations of these metals on the sperm quality, fertilization and hatching rates, and embryo and larval survival of pejerrey. Also, the same endpoints were analyzed with concentrations ten times higher to simulate a polluted worst-case scenario. The results showed that the presence of some metals in aquatic environments reduced pejerrey sperm motility (in ~50%) and velocity (in ~30%). These results were obtained using a computer assisted sperm analyzer enforcing the application of this analysis as a tool or bioindicator of aquatic pollution. In addition, fertilization rate was diminished (in ~40%) for all treatments. Besides, the hatching rate, and embryo and larval survival were drastically affected being zero for the highest metal concentrations assessed. All together these results, showed that even lower metal concentrations can negatively affect different reproductive parameters of one of the most emblematic fish species of the Argentinean water bodies.","Gárriz, Ángela; Miranda, Leandro A",Ecotoxicology,,406

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis, and no specific therapy or drug has been formally recommended for use against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, it is a rational strategy to investigate the repurposing of existing drugs to use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the meantime, the medical community is trialing several therapies that target various antiviral and immunomodulating mechanisms to use against the infection. There is no doubt that antiviral and supportive treatments are important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but anti-inflammatory therapy also plays a pivotal role in the management COVID-19 patients due to its ability to prevent further injury and organ damage or failure. In this review, we identified drugs that could modulate cytokines levels and play a part in the management of COVID-19. Several drugs that possess an anti-inflammatory profile in others illnesses have been studied in respect of their potential utility in the treatment of the hyperinflammation induced by SAR-COV-2 infection. We highlight a number of antivirals, anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and antiparasitic drugs that have been found to mitigate cytokine production and consequently attenuate the ""cytokine storm"" induced by SARS-CoV-2. Reduced hyperinflammation can attenuate multiple organ failure, and even reduce the mortality associated with severe COVID-19. In this context, despite their current unproven clinical efficacy in relation to the current pandemic, the repurposing of drugs with anti-inflammatory activity to use in the treatment of COVID-19 has become a topic of great interest.","Heimfarth, Luana; Serafini, Mairim Russo; Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo; Quintans, Jullyana de Souza Siqueira; Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José",Int Immunopharmacol,,406

334912,Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19,2020,"The construction of a continuous family of distributions on a compact set is demonstrated by concatenating, in a continuous manner, three probability density functions with bounded support using a modified mixture technique. The construction technique is similar to that of generalized trapezoidal (GT) distributions, but contrary to GT distributions, the resulting density function is smooth within its bounded domain. The construction of Generalized Trapezoidal Ogive (GTO) distributions was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, where smoothness of an infection rate curve may be a desirable property combined with the ability to separately model three stages and their durations as the epidemic progresses, being: (1) an increasing infection rate stage, (2) an infection rate stage of some stability and (3) a decreasing infection rate stage. The resulting model allows for asymmetry of the infection rate curve opposite to, for example, the Gaussian Error Infection (GEI) rate curve utilized early on for COVID-19 epidemic projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). While other asymmetric distributions too allow for the modeling of asymmetry, the ability to separately model the above three stages of an epidemic's progression is a distinct feature of the model proposed. The latter avoids unrealistic projections of an epidemic's right-tail in the absence of right tail data, which is an artifact of any fatality rate model where a left-tail fit determines its right-tail behavior.","Dorp, Johan René van; Shittu, Ekundayo; Mazzuchi, Thomas A.",Chaos Solitons Fractals X,,406

One of these rapid changes involved students and professors that had to turn the traditional ""in presence"" classes into online courses facing several problems for educational delivery. OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to investigate the factors that affected both teaching/learning effectiveness and general human comfort and wellbeing after the sudden transition from classrooms to eLearning platforms due to COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS: A workshop, involving students and experts of Human Factors and Ergonomics, has been performed to identify aspects/factors that could influence online learning. Then, from workshop output and literature studies, a survey composed of two questionnaires (one for students and one for teachers) has been developed and spread out among Italian universities students and professors. RESULTS: 700 people answered the questionnaires. Data have been analysed and discussed to define the most important changes due to the new eLearning approach. Absence of interactions with colleagues and the necessity to use several devices were some of the aspects coming out from questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows an overview of factors influencing both teaching/learning effectiveness and general human comfort and wellbeing.

336680,"Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: The experiences of South Australia's Rescue, Retrieval and Aviation Services",2021,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread throughout the globe infecting over 150 million people and causing the death of over 3.2 million people. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network and a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data. Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.","Quilodr'an-Casas, C'esar; Silva, Vinicius Santos; Arcucci, Rossella; Heaney, Claire E.; Guo, Yike; Pain, Christopher C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02664v2.pdf,406

Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is >5 years. It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage. We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate. If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary. Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity.

Data visualization tools construct an important pillar in energy micro-moments, i.e., the concept of providing the right information at the right time in the right way for a specific power consumer. Such behavioral change can be triggered with the help of good recommendations and suitable visualizations to convey the right message. A questionnaire is built as a mobile application to evaluate different groups of conventional and novel visualizations. Conventional charts are restricted to bar, line and stacked area charts, while novel visualizations contain heatmap, spiral and appliance-level stacked bar charts. Significant findings gathered from participants' responses indicate that they are slightly inclined towards conventional charts. However, their understanding of the novel charts is better by 8% when the analysis questions are investigated. Finally, a question is answered on whether a group of visualizations should be discarded completely, or some modifications can be applied.","Al-Kababji, Ayman; Alsalemi, Abdullah; Himeur, Yassine; Bensaali, Faycal; Amira, Abbes; Fernandez, Rachael; Fetais, Noora",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04274v1.pdf,406

341558,Cognitive Assessment of Patients with COVID-19 Disease After Their Intensive Care Unit Stay,2021,"Healthcare professionals are the crucial and influencing source of information for vaccines and their communication among patients and communities that can accelerate successful vaccination in a country. This cross-sectional study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh to observe the basic perception and attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) - doctors, interns, nurses, ward boys, cleaners, and medical technologists of major COVID-dedicated hospitals. The cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in February 2021 among 550 HCWs to assess the perception and attitude towards vaccination against COVID-19. The study participants were targeted as the priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, working in two major COVID-dedicated hospitals, Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital (HF-center), and Sheikh Russel National Gastro-liver Institute and Hospital (SR-center) in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the pandemic. The questionnaire was structured with a three-point scale of responses from 'true', 'false', and 'do not know'. The responses were calculated on point-score as +1 for the correct response, -1 for the wrong response, and 0 for 'do not know' with an overall highest and the lowest possible score of +5 to -5. Absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%) were presented for qualitative variables, while quantitative variables were presented as mean (+/- standard deviation). Chi-square test was done for univariate analysis of qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative variables. With the 95.27% response rate, including 204 males and 320 were female and the male: female ratio was 1: 1.56. The majority of the participants were doctors (45.8%) followed by nurses (27.9%), and MLSS (26.3%) respectively. The respondents were between 18 to 64 years of age with a mean of 36.17+/-10.94 years. Most of the respondents (95.99%) responded correctly about the cost-free availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in the country, 87.40% preferred vaccination as safe and effective. Again 29.77% HCWs think the vaccine might not be safe or effective due to emergency authorization.

341797,Establishing a healthcare worker screening programme for COVID-19,2020,"The current study aims to evaluate the impact of a two-week Online Mindfulness Meditation (MM) intervention on levels of Depression, Stress, and Anxiety and gain insights into participants' motivation and experiences of the intervention. Twenty-five participants (16 females & 9 males) were recruited through web-based advertisement using a random purposive sampling technique. DAS scale was administered before and after the intervention period to identify quantitative changes over time. Further, ten participants (6 females & 4 males) who exhibited significant changes in their quantitative measures were interviewed via video conferencing to understand the particular motivators and experiences of participating;where the responses were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Change in outcome measures over time was examined using Mean, S.D., and paired t-test. Results revealed significant improvements in reducing the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms significantly (all p >0.001) and improvement was sustained at three months follow- up. The qualitative analysis depicted Spiritual inclination and Experience of stress and loneliness as motivation themes for enrolling. Moreover, the lived experience of the participants exhibited three overarching themes -- a. Self- awareness, b. Insight development, c. Social cohesion. The study provides evidence in support of the effectiveness of brief, MM in a non-clinical population and suggests that low-intensity intervention can be used for modulating negative psychological states through easily accessible and non- physical contact training mode. However, more research is needed to confirm and better understand these results and to test the potential of such interventions.

342105,Nursing Homes and Long Term Care After COVID-19: A New ERA?,2020,"The global coronavirus pandemic has reified divisions, inequity, and injustices rooted in systems of domination like racism, sexism, neoliberal capitalism, ableism, and more. Feminist scholars have theorized these interlocking systems of domination as 'the continuum of violence.' Building on this scholarship, we conceptualize the US response to and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as reflective of the continuum of violence. We argue that crises like pandemics expose the anti-democratic and exclusionary practices inherent to this continuum, which is especially racialized and gendered. To support our argument, we provide empirical evidence of the continuum of violence in relation to COVID-19 vis-Ã-vis the interrelated issues of militarization and what feminists call ""everyday security,"" such as public health and gender-based violence. The continuum of violence contributes theoretically and practically to our understanding of how violence that the pandemic illuminates is embedded in broader systems of domination and exclusion.","Forester, Summer; O039,; Brien, Cheryl",Polit.

342351,On the Front (Phone) Lines: Results of a COVID-19 Hotline,2021,"Background: To date, no recommendations have been published on when and how to start again carrying out elective, non-urgent surgery on COVID-19-negative patients after the epidemic peak has been reached in a given country or region and the pressure on healthcare facilities, healthcare workers and resources has been released by so far that elective surgery procedures can be safely and ethically programmed again. This study aims to investigate whether elective orthopaedic surgery will increase the risk of developing COVID-19. Materials and methods: This was a combined retrospective and prospective studies performed at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgeries at our institution from April to May 2020. Those who were previously infected with COVID-19 from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reverse transcriptase (RT) examination obtained via nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, as well as those who were reluctant to participate were excluded from the study. Results: A total of 35 subjects (mean age 32.89â¯±â¯17.42) were recruited. Fifteen (42.9%) subjects were male, and 20 subjects (57.1%) were female. Mean duration of surgery was 240â¯min with the longest and shortest duration of 690 and 40â¯min, respectively. General anaesthesia was performed in the majority of cases in 18 surgeries (51.4%) with local anaesthesia as the least in 2 surgeries (5.7%). Length of stay of our study was 6 days of average. None of the patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: We found that elective orthopaedic surgery may not be associated with increased cases of COVID-19 cases. However, our study was limited by short duration of follow-up. Further studies are required in order to investigate the affect of undergoing elective surgery and the number of COVID-19 cases.","Kamal, A F; Widodo, W; Kuncoro, M W; Karda, I W A M; Prabowo, Y; Sigh, G; Liastuti, L D; Hutagalung, E U; Saleh, I; Tobing, S D A L; Gunawan, B; Dilogo, I H; Lubis, A M T; Kurniawan, A; Oesman, I; Ppsi, N N; Latief, W; Wijaya, M T; Ivansyah, M D; Primaputra, M R A; Reksoprodjo, A Y; Hendriarto, A; Novriandi, K M A; Alaztha, Z; Canintika, A F; Sitanggang, A H R",,,406

Some scholars postulate that the media played a positive and negative role to control and prevent its spread. Nigeria is not left out of this as the pandemic is also prevalent in the country. Therefore, this study examines media coverage of the pandemic in Nigeria and the correlation between the messages and compliance with the pandemic preventive measures. We used the Agenda-Setting theory, which describes how the media brings up specific issues to public discourse and prioritise them above other matters, making the audience perceive some critical topics more than others. We used the survey method and questionnaire to gather the data and used descriptive and inferential statistics to analyse them. We found that the people had frequent exposure to media messages on Covid-19;despite the regular exposure, they complied partially with the Covid-19 preventive measures;there was a significant relationship between exposure to media message on Covid-19 and compliance with its preventive measures. Furthermore, the respondents had a high rating for the media coverage of the pandemic. We recommend that the public sustain the increased exposure of the media messages on Covid-19. © 2021 Sciendo.

343094,"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak and Relationships With Expressive Flexibility and Context Sensitivity",2021,"In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers in some countries were forced to make distressing triaging decisions about which individual patients should receive potentially life-saving treatment. Much of the ethical discussion prompted by the pandemic has concerned which moral principles should ground our response to these individual triage questions. In this paper we aim to broaden the scope of this discussion by considering the ethics of broader structural allocation decisions raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we consider how nations ought to distribute a scarce life-saving resource across healthcare regions in a public health emergency, particularly in view of regional differences in projected need and existing capacity. We call this the regional triage question. Using the case study of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic, we show how the moral frameworks that we might adopt in response to individual triage decisions do not translate straightforwardly to this regional-level triage question. Having outlined what we take to be a plausible egalitarian approach to the regional triage question, we go on to propose a novel way of operationalising the 'save the most lives' principle in this context. We claim that the latter principle ought to take some precedence in the regional triage question, but also note important limitations to the extent of the influence that it should have in regional allocation decisions.","Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Palacios-Gonzalez, Cesar; Savulescu, Julian",Health care anal,,406

343598,"Tele Screening, Triaging of Dental Patients, And Reopening of Dental Services During SAR-CoV2 Pandemic",2020,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), known as a highly contagious disease, currently affecting more than 200 countries worldwide. The main feature of SARS-CoV-2 that distinguishes it from other viruses is the speed of transmission combined with higher risk of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with diabetes mellitus (DM), severe obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension are more likely to get infected and are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Among elderly patients who are at higher risk of death from COVID-19, 26.8% have DM. Although the reasons for this increased risk are yet to be determined, several factors may contribute to type-2 DM patients' increased susceptibility to infections. A possible factor that may play a role in increasing the risk in people affected by diabetes and/or obesity is the impaired innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation that can lead to abrupt systemic metabolic alteration. SARS patients previously diagnosed with diabetes or hyperglycemia had higher mortality and morbidity rates when compared with patients who were under metabolic control. Similarly, obese individuals are at higher risk of developing complications from SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we will explore the current and evolving insights pertinent to the metabolic impact of coronavirus infections with special attention to the main pathways and mechanisms that are linked to the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes.","Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse; Kavalakatt, Sina; Ali, Hamad; Abdul Ghani, Mohammed; Abubaker, Jehad",Front Immunol,,406

The effects of varying degrees of implementation of public health and social measures between countries is evident in terms of widely differing disease burdens and levels of disruption to public health systems. Despite Thailand being the first country outside China to report a positive case of COVID-19, the subsequent number of cases and deaths has been much lower than in many other countries. As of 7 January 2021, the number of confirmed COVID-19-positive cases in Thailand was 9636 (138 per million population) and the number of deaths was 67 (1 per million population). We describe the nature of the health workforce and function that facilitated the capacity to respond to this pandemic. We also describe the public health policies (laboratory testing, test-and-trace system and mandatory 14-day quarantine of cases) and social interventions (daily briefings, restriction of mobility and social gatherings, and wearing of face masks) that allowed the virus to be successfully contained. To enhance the capacity of health-care workers to respond to the pandemic, the government (i) mobilized staff to meet the required surge capacity; (ii) developed and implemented policies to protect occupational safety; and (iii) initiated packages to support morale and well-being. The results of the policies that we describe are evident in the data: of the 66 countries with more than 100 COVID-19-positive cases in health-care workers as at 8 May 2020, Thailand ranked 65th.","Nittayasoot, Natthaprang; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Namwat, Chawetsan; Dejburum, Patcharaporn; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Bull World Health Organ,,406

346233,A Mobile Primary Care Clinic Mitigates an Early COVID-19 Outbreak Among Migrant Farmworkers in Iowa,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients' lived experiences, for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid. DESIGN: The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long COVID. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-COVID functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method. RESULTS: Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed COVID-19, 79% female, and 12.5% hospitalized for COVID-19). The long COVID ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33). CONCLUSIONS: The long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients' lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.","Tran, Viet-Thi; Riveros, Caroline; Clepier, Bérangère; Desvarieux, Moïse; Collet, Camille; Yordanov, Youri; Ravaud, Philippe",Clin. infect. dis,,406

Although COVID-19 is caused by infection in the respiratory tract, extrapulmonary manifestations including dysregulation of the immune system and hepatic injury have been observed. Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, we sought to study the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HBV coinfection in patients. METHODS: Blood samples of 50 SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients, 56 SARS-CoV-2 mono-infected patients, 57 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patient controls and 57 healthy controls admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected in this study. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry panels including markers indicative of liver functions were performed. Cytokines including IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection did not significantly affect the outcome of the COVID-19. However, at the onset of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients showed more severe monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as more disturbed hepatic function in albumin production and lipid metabolism. Most of the disarrangement could be reversed after recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: While chronic HBV infection did not predispose COVID-19 patients to more severe outcomes, our data suggest SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection poses a higher extent of dysregulation of host functions at the onset of COVID-19. Thus, caution needs to be taken with the management of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients.","Liu, Rui; Zhao, Li; Cheng, Xiaoming; Han, Huan; Li, Cong; Li, Dong; Liu, Andrew; Gao, Guosheng; Zhou, Feng; Liu, Fang; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",Liver int,,406

The model input of this approach is the specification of the flow of information. This enables the representation of (i) reliable information, (ii) noise, and (iii) disinformation, in a unified framework. Because the approach is designed to characterise the dynamics of the system under study, it is possible to quantify the impact of information control, including those resulting from the dissemination of disinformation. It is shown that if a decision maker assigns an exceptionally high weight on one of the alternative realities, then under the Bayesian logic their perception hardly changes in time even if evidences presented indicate that this alternative corresponds to a false reality. By observing the role played by noise in other areas of natural sciences, a new approach to tackle the dark forces of fake news is proposed.","Brody, Dorje C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03432v1.pdf,406

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test whether adverse RV remodeling (dysfunction/dilation) predicts COVID-19 prognosis independent of clinical and biomarker risk stratification. METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 inpatients undergoing clinical transthoracic echocardiography at 3 New York City hospitals were studied; images were analyzed by a central core laboratory blinded to clinical and biomarker data. RESULTS: In total, 510 patients (age 64 ± 14 years, 66% men) were studied; RV dilation and dysfunction were present in 35% and 15%, respectively. RV dysfunction increased stepwise in relation to RV chamber size (p = 0.007). During inpatient follow-up (median 20 days), 77% of patients had a study-related endpoint (death 32%, discharge 45%). RV dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 4.43; p = 0.001) and dilation (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.96; p = 0.02) each independently conferred mortality risk. Patients without adverse RV remodeling were more likely to survive to hospital discharge (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.90; p = 0.041). RV indices provided additional risk stratification beyond biomarker strata; risk for death was greatest among patients with adverse RV remodeling and positive biomarkers and was lesser among patients with isolated biomarker elevations (p &#8804; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, adverse RV remodeling conferred a >2-fold increase in mortality risk, which remained significant (p < 0.01) when controlling for age and biomarker elevations; the predictive value of adverse RV remodeling was similar irrespective of whether analyses were performed using troponin, D-dimer, or ferritin. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse RV remodeling predicts mortality in COVID-19 independent of standard clinical and biomarker-based assessment.","Kim, Jiwon; Volodarskiy, Alexander; Sultana, Razia; Pollie, Meridith P; Yum, Brian; Nambiar, Lakshmi; Tafreshi, Romina; Mitlak, Hannah W; RoyChoudhury, Arindam; Horn, Evelyn M; Hriljac, Ingrid; Narula, Nupoor; Kim, Sijun; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa; Goyal, Parag; Safford, Monika M; Shaw, Leslee; Devereux, Richard B; Weinsaft, Jonathan W",J Am Coll Cardiol,,406

352612,Palliative care and the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are caused by coronaviruses and have infected people in China and worldwide. We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at provincial level in mainland China. METHODS: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). RESULTS: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher overall incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China; the highest RR = 135.08, 95% CI: 128.36-142.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China; the highest RR = 423.51, 95% CI: 240.96-722.32) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the ""Wuhan lockdown"". The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks exhibited distinct spatiotemporal clustering patterns at the provincial levels in mainland China, which may be attributable to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms.","Zhang, Xi; Rao, Huaxiang; Wu, Yuwan; Huang, Yubei; Dai, Hongji",BMC Infect Dis,,406
352908,Investigation of healthcare workers attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"A variety of demographic statistical models exist for studying population dynamics when individuals can be tracked over time In cases where data are missing due to imperfect detection of individuals, the associated measurement error can be accommodated under certain study designs (e g those that involve multiple surveys or replication) However, the interaction of the measurement error and the underlying dynamic process can complicate the implementation of statistical agent‐based models (ABMs) for population demography In a Bayesian setting, traditional computational algorithms for fitting hierarchical demographic models can be prohibitively cumbersome to construct Thus, we discuss a variety of approaches for fitting statistical ABMs to data and demonstrate how to use multi‐stage recursive Bayesian computing and statistical emulators to fit models in such a way that alleviates the need to have analytical knowledge of the ABM likelihood Using two examples, a demographic model for survival and a compartment model for COVID‐19, we illustrate statistical procedures for implementing ABMs The approaches we describe are intuitive and accessible for practitioners and can be parallelised easily for additional computational efficiency","Hooten, Mevin; Wikle, Christopher; Schwob, Michael",International Statistical Review = Revue Internationale de Statistique,,406

353060,Nurses' pandemic lives: A mixed-methods study of experiences during COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provides a powerful tool to identify new infections and facilitate contact tracing. In fact, as the prevalence of COVID-19 decreases, this RT-PCR testing remains as the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results can lead to misdiagnoses in the clinic. These inconsistencies are due to the variability in (1) the collection times of biological samples post infection, and (2) sampling procedures. METHODS: We applied the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate logistic regression on RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the proportion (%) of negative conversion among patients who had tested twice or more, and compared the proportions arising from oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and combined double testing, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% on day 4, 16.4% on day 7, 41.0% at 2 weeks, and 61.0% at 3 weeks post-admission. We also found that 34.1% and 60.3% of subjects had at least one negative RT-PCR result on days 7 and 14 after the onset of symptoms, respectively. The proportion of negative conversions following sputum testing was higher than that from oropharyngeal swabs in the early stages but this declined after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical if we are to control the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this study, early, consecutive and combined double testing, will be the key to identify infected patients, particularly for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. These strategies will minimize misdiagnosis and the ineffective isolation of infected patients.","Song, Yangzi; Chen, Chen; Wang, Yu; Zhang, Ju; Chen, Meiling; Gao, Guiju; Wang, Sa; Yang, Di; Song, Rui; Wang, Linghang; Xie, Wen; Yu, Fengting; Yan, Liting; Wang, Yajie; Zeng, Hui; Zhang, Fujie",Int J Infect Dis,,406
353121,Anxiety levels and solution-focused thinking skills of nurses and midwives working in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A descriptive correlational study,2021,"The transition of traditional schooling to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted formal school education. Though at home, teachers and students continued teaching and learning in socially distant ways using online technologies. From various teacher surveys, only about 60% of students in the United States regularly engaged with learning activities. Teachers and parents also expressed a significant need for help to keep students motivated and engaged in learning activities. During the pandemic, online learning left teachers and parents needing support for learning activities that motivate and engage students. Project-based learning is an increasingly popular pedagogical practice centered around students working collaboratively on projects while the teacher facilitates learning activities and progression. Project-based learning embodies several factors considered central to motivation in online learning. In this paper, we inquire how this approach presents itself as a candidate for learning during the pandemic when considering students’ motivation to learn through online learning experiences. We construct a conceptual framework informed by motivational theories that share core tenets with this form of learning and use the framework to analyze interviews of 11 teachers from 4 schools that taught with a project-based learning approach before the pandemic and transitioned to teaching, using it online, in the Spring of 2020. From our analyses of the teachers’ narratives, we discuss teaching aspects of the approach that lend themselves well to online teaching, elements that the teachers believe are missing, and how educators might cater to these missing aspects with a focus on student motivation to learn. © 2021, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

This randomized, open-label, controlled, phase III trial assessed the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for five days in combination with standard care compared to standard care alone in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Chloroquine 450 mg BID on day 1 and 450 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID on day 1 and 400 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 were administered in the intervention group. Patients were enrolled from April 16 to August 06, 2020, in 6 hospitals in southern Brazil. The primary outcome was the clinical status measured on day 14 after randomization with a 9-point ordinal scale. The main secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation use; the incidence of acute renal dysfunction in 28 days; and the clinical status of patients on days 5, 7, 10 and 28. All patients with a positive RT-PCR result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed (modified intention to treat (mITT) population). Arrythmias and cardiovascular complications were assessed as safety outcomes. A total of 105 patients were enrolled and followed for 28 days. The trial was stopped before reaching the planned sample size due to harmful effects. Patients in the intervention group had a worse clinical outcome on the 14th day (odds ratio (OR) 2.45 [1.17 to 4.93], p = 0.016) and on the 28th day (OR 2.47 [1.15 to 5.30], p = 0.020). Moreover, the intervention group had higher incidences of invasive mechanical ventilation use (risk ratio (RR) 2.15 [1.05 to 4.40], p = 0.030) and severe renal dysfunction (KDIGO stage 3) (RR 2.24 [1.01 to 4.99], p = 0.042) until the 28th day of follow-up. No significant arrythmia was noted. In patients with severe COVID-19, the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine added to standard treatment resulted in a significant worsening of clinical status, an increased risk of renal dysfunction and an increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04420247.

354878,"Adolescents' sedentary time, affect, and contextual factors: An ecological momentary assessment study",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. Cardiac injury is not uncommon among COVID-19 patients. We sought to describe the electrocardiographic characteristics and to identify the prognostic significance of electrocardiography (ECG) findings of patients with COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: ECG abnormality was associated with higher risk of death. METHODS: Consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and definite in-hospital outcome were retrospectively included. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were extracted from medical record. Initial ECGs at admission or during hospitalization were reviewed. A point-based scoring system of abnormal ECG findings was formed, in which 1 point each was assigned for the presence of axis deviation, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, conduction tissue disease, QTc interval prolongation, pathological Q wave, ST-segment change, and T-wave change. The association between abnormal ECG scores and in-hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients (mean 62.84 ± 14.69 years old, 48.0% male) were included. T-wave change (31.7%), QTc interval prolongation (30.1%), and arrhythmias (16.3%) were three most common found ECG abnormalities. 30 (9.80%) patients died during hospitalization. Abnormal ECG scores were significantly higher among non-survivors (median 2 points vs 1 point, p < 0.001). The risk of in-hospital death increased by a factor of 1.478 (HR 1.478, 95% CI 1.131-1.933, p = 0.004) after adjusted by age, comorbidities, cardiac injury and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: ECG abnormality was common in patients admitted for COVID-19 and was associated with adverse in-hospital outcome. In-hospital mortality risk increased with increasing abnormal ECG scores.","Yang, Deyan; Li, Jing; Gao, Peng; Chen, Taibo; Cheng, Zhongwei; Cheng, Kangan; Deng, Hua; Fang, Quan; Yi, Chunfeng; Fan, Hongru; Wu, Yonghong; Li, Liwei; Fang, Yong; Tian, Guowei; Pan, Wan; Zhang, Fan",Clin. cardiol,,406

It has caused tremendous morbidity, mortality and greatly impacted the lives and economy worldwide as an outcome of mandatory quarantines or isolations. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Physicians and researchers throughout the world are working to understand the pathophysiology to expose the conceivable handling regimens and to determine the effective vaccines and/or therapeutic agents. Some of them re-purposed drugs for clinical trials which were primarily known to be effective against the RNA viruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. In the absence of a proven efficacy therapy, the current management use therapies based on antivirals, anti-inflammatory drugs, convalescent plasma, anti-parasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, oxygen therapy and heparin support. What is needed at this hour, however, is a definitive drug therapy or vaccine. Different countries are rushing to find this, and various trials are already underway.

In his State of the Nations Address on 16 February 2018, President Ramaphosa cited the Thuma Mina song of Hugh Masekela to mobilise the resourcefulness of South Africans to volunteer their services to create a better future for all. In this article, it becomes clear that ‘Thuma Mina’ is more than just a song by Hugh Masekela and churches;it has deep roots in Isaiah 6:8 and the narrative of Isaiah’s calling by God to be a prophet. In embracing the ‘Thuma Mina’ concept, Ramaphosa’s presidency has a prospect of succeeding against all odds. The president must just remain rooted to its historical significance, its connectivity to Yahweh (YHWH) and the good will of the people of South Africa as engraved in Ubuntu and the spirit of volunteerism, servanthood and generosity. Interdisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article brings the disciplines of theology, leadership and politics in defining ‘Thuma Mina’ and the prospect of the Ramaphosa presidency. It proposes that the continued use of ‘Thuma Mina’ will remain a driver to mobilise South Africans to embrace the spirit of volunteerism, servanthood and sacrifice to bring about lasting solutions to challenges of decay that South Africa faces.","Mashau, Thinandavha D.; Kgatle, Mookgo S.",Verbum et Ecclesia,,406

358682,COVID 19 and Individuals with Substance Use Disorder: Challenges to the Treatment Centers in Pakistan,2020,"ABSTRACT: The cause of neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is often unknown but is commonly associated with a recent upper respiratory viral tract infection. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a tireless effort to understand the sequelae of the virus. A 46-year-old woman who presented after a COVID-19 hospitalization complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for 23 days was subsequently found to have lower extremity sensorium changes as well as upper extremity weakness. Left shoulder abduction and extension were both 3/5 in motor strength and left hip flexion strength was 4/5 with diminished sensation to crude touch in the left lateral thigh. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS/EMG) findings included a mild left median neuropathy at the wrist, and motor unit recruitment pattern consistent with a chronic left upper trunk plexopathy with re-innervation. The case presented describes an extended neuralgic amyotrophy syndrome (ENAS) from an atraumatic mechanism in a previously diagnosed COVID-19 patient. ENAS has at least three immune mediated etiologies postulated 1) direct neuropathogenicity 2) molecular mimicry and 3) direct cytotoxic effects on peripheral nerves. As COVID-19 survivors continue to be seen in outpatient settings, practitioners should remain aware of diffuse neurological complications as sequelae of the virus persist.","Alvarez, Armando; Amirianfar, Edwin; Mason, Marisa Carino; Huang, Laura; Jose, Jean; Tiu, Timothy",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,,406

361138,A New Rating Scale (SAVE-9) to Demonstrate the Stress and Anxiety in the Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Viral Epidemic,2020,"AIM: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for substantial changes in the procedures for accessing healthcare services. Even in the current pandemic, we should not reduce our attention towards the diagnosis and treatment of GDM. The purpose of this document is to provide a temporary guide for GDM screening, replacing the current guidelines when it is not possible to implement standard GDM screening because of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for pregnant women or when usual laboratory facilities are not available. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the first visit during pregnancy, we must exclude the presence of ""Overt diabetes"" in all women. The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either fasting plasma glucose &#8805;126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose &#8805;200 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin &#8805;6.5%. When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable if fasting plasma glucose is &#8805; 92 mg/dL. In order to consider the impaired fasting glucose as an acceptable surrogate for the diagnosis of GDM, the fasting glucose measurement should be performed within the recommended time windows for the risk level (high or medium risk). CONCLUSIONS: The changes to the screening procedure for GDM reported below are specifically produced in response to the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, these recommended changes should cease to be in effect and should be replaced by current national guidelines when the healthcare authorities declare the end of this emergency.","Torlone, Elisabetta; Festa, Camilla; Formoso, Gloria; Scavini, Marina; Sculli, Maria A; Succurro, Elena; Sciacca, Laura; Di Bartolo, Paolo; Purrello, Francesco; Lapolla, Annunziata",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,406
361528,Dental Care and the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Precautionary Principle and the Best Available Evidence,2020,"The effective reproduction number, Rt, is a key time-varying prognostic for the growth rate of any infectious disease epidemic. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring Rt reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates Rt using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in Rt, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example.

As a consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, thousands of scientists have been working tirelessly trying to understand the biology of this new virus and the disease pathophysiology, with the main goal of discovering effective preventive treatments and therapeutic agents. Plant-derived secondary metabolites may play key roles in preventing and counteracting the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections by inhibiting the activity of several viral proteins, in particular those involved in the virus entry into the host cells and its replication. Using in vitro approaches, we investigated the role of a pomegranate peel extract (PPE) in attenuating the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and on the activity of the virus 3CL protease. Although further studies will be determinant to assess the efficacy of this extract in vivo, our results opened new promising opportunities to employ natural extracts for the development of effective and innovative therapies in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Tito, A.; Colantuono, A.; Pirone, L.; Pedone, E.; Intartaglia, D.; Giamundo, G.; Conte, I.; Vitaglione, P.; Apone, F.",Frontiers in Chemistry,,406
363873,Occupational COVID-19: what can be learned from notifications of occupational diseases?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Multiple major health organisations recommend the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date. METHODS: We used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: Data for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study. Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died. The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4-40·4). Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge. The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·20-2·97). In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38·0% (95% CI 34·6-41·5). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%. These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19.

To accomplish this goal, we devised two separate approaches and evaluated their performance and run-time efficiency. The first approach leverages a pre-trained face detector in combination with a mask-wearing image classifier trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset. The second approach utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform localization and classification of faces in one shot, fine-tuned on a small set of labeled real-world images. The first pipeline achieved a test accuracy of 99.97% on the synthetic dataset and maintained 6 FPS running on video data. The second pipeline achieved a mAP(0.5) of 89% on real-world images while sustaining 52 FPS on video data. We have concluded that if a larger dataset with bounding-box labels can be curated, this task is best suited using object detection architectures such as YOLO and SSD due to their superior inference speed and satisfactory performance on key evaluation metrics.","Ding, Yuchen; Li, Zichen; Yastremsky, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01816v1.pdf,406

We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation. Using RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures, we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Our objective is to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","Hierro, Luis Ángel; Garzón, Antonio J; Atienza-Montero, Pedro; Márquez, José Luis",Sci Rep,,406

Despite the known sex difference in COVID-19 disease mortality, preliminary data suggest there are certain female populations, including pregnant and menopausal women and possibly polycystic ovarian syndrome patients who are more susceptible to COVID-19-related morbidity. This commentary analyzes the interplay between sex differences, hormones, and the immune function in each of these populations with respect to the risk and severity of COVID-19 and proposes biological rationales to explain these differences.","Gotluru, Chitra; Roach, Allison; Cherry, Sheldon H; Runowicz, Carolyn D",Obstet Gynecol,,406

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated these changes. Limited evidence exists for experiences of video care in secondary mental health services. We aimed to assess the acceptability of video care in mental health clinical practice during COVID-19.MethodStructured questionnaires were developed with the help of patients and clinicians. The patient experience questionnaire was built into video sessions and completed online, using the Attend Anywhere (AA) platform from July 2020 to March 2021. A Trust-wide clinician views and experiences survey was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS (version 27.0).ResultOf 1,296 patients who completed the online feedback, the majority provided positive feedback for all aspects of video care. Most patients felt their needs were met (90%) and were supported (93%) during the video call. Positive experiences were informed by clinicians’ communication skills. For future appointments, just over half (51.7%) of patients preferred using video calls, followed by face-to-face (33%). Future video preference was informed by reasons reducing social anxiety and practical aspects such as child/carer needs, physical disability and travel.Of 252 clinicians completing the survey, 161 (64.7%) had used video for remote care delivery. Clinicians also provided positive feedback, with Microsoft-teams as the preferred platform. Most clinicians felt the therapeutic relationship (76.4%) and privacy (78.7%) were maintained using video. While 73% felt there were no safeguarding issues that impacted adversely, 30% felt that care quality was affected, and (69.9%) reported limited visual cues for video calls. Most clinicians (73%) felt confident about clinical decision-making remotely, though there were areas where clinicians felt less confident, such as assessing patients’ appearance and behaviour. Additionally, compared with face-to-face, video consultations seemed to be effective for social anxiety, but less so for Autism spectrum disorders, and with no perceived difference for depression or self harm. For future, more clinicians preferred face-to-face (40.1%) than video care (36.1%).ConclusionMental health care delivered remotely via video is experienced positively by patients and clinicians alike. However, clinicians felt that quality of care is impacted, and additional remote clinical skills training may be beneficial. Going forward, there is acceptability for the use of video care in routine mental health practice for certain mental health presentations.","Samad, Lamiya Teague Bonnie Moreira Karen Bagge Sophie Khalifa Elzubeir Wilson Jonathan",BJPsych Open,,406

AIMS: To investigate the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. METHODS: We performed an observational multicentre study including all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 24 centres in France from 26 February to 20 April 2020. The primary endpoint was a composite of in-hospital death or need for orotracheal intubation. RESULTS: Overall, 2809 patients (mean age 66.4±16.9years) were included. Three hundred and seventeen patients (11.2%) had a history of heart failure; among them, 49.2% had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and 50.8% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. COVID-19 severity at admission, defined by a quick sequential organ failure assessment score>1, was similar in patients with versus without a history of heart failure. Before and after adjustment for age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities and quick sequential organ failure assessment score, history of heart failure was associated with the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.90; P=0.02). This result seemed to be mainly driven by a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.13-2.27; P=0.01) rather than heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.79-1.81; P=0.41). CONCLUSIONS: History of heart failure in patients with COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death or orotracheal intubation. These findings suggest that patients with a history of heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, should be considered at high risk of clinical deterioration.","Panagides, Vassili; Vincent, Flavien; Weizman, Orianne; Jonveaux, Melchior; Trimaille, Antonin; Pommier, Thibaut; Cellier, Joffrey; Geneste, Laura; Marsou, Wassima; Deney, Antoine; Attou, Sabir; Delmotte, Thomas; Fauvel, Charles; Ezzouhairi, Nacim; Perin, Benjamin; Zakine, Cyril; Levasseur, Thomas; Ma, Iris; Chavignier, Diane; Noirclerc, Nathalie; Darmon, Arthur; Mevelec, Marine; Karsenty, Clément; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Mika, Delphine; Pezel, Théo; Waldmann, Victor; Ternacle, Julien; Cohen, Ariel; Bonnet, Guillaume",Arch Cardiovasc Dis,,406
367862,A rapid mobilization of 'virtual' primary care services in response to COVID-19 at Veterans Health Administration,2020,"As one of the most important estimators in classical statistics, the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) has been adopted for point estimation in many statistical studies, especially for small sample problems. Moving beyond typical settings in the exponential distribution family, it is usually challenging to prove the existence and further construct such UMVUE in finite samples. For example in the ongoing Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), it is hard to characterize the complete sufficient statistics of the underlying treatment effect due to pre-planned modifications to design aspects based on accumulated unblinded data. As an alternative solution, we propose a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) guided ensemble learning framework to construct an improved estimator from existing ones. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically reaches the minimal variance within the class of linearly combined estimators. Simulation studies are further performed to demonstrate that our proposed estimator has considerable finite-sample efficiency gain. In the ACTT on COVID-19 as an important application, our method essentially contributes to a more ethical and efficient adaptive clinical trial with fewer patients enrolled.","Zhan, Tianyu; Fu, Haoda; Kang, Jian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06523v1.pdf,406
367876,The Role of Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"As the world continues to suffer from an ever-growing number of confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, researchers are at the forefront of developing the best plan to overcome this pandemic through analyzing the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment options pertaining to the virus. In the midst of a pandemic, the main route for detection of the virus has been conducting antigen tests for rapid results, using qRT-PCR, and conducting more accurate molecular tests, using rRT-PCR, on samples from patients. Most common treatments for those infected with COVID-19 include Remdesivir, an antiviral, dexamethasone, a steroid, and rarely, monoclonal antibody treatments. Although these treatments exist and are used commonly in hospitals all around the globe, clinicians often challenge the efficacy and benefit of these remedies for the patient. Furthermore, targeted therapies largely focus on interfering with or reducing the binding of viral receptors and host cell receptors affected by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus. In addition to treatment, the most efficacious method of preventing the spread of COVID-19 is the development of multiple vaccines that have been distributed as well as the development of multiple vaccine candidates that are proving hopeful in preventing severe symptoms of the virus. The exaggerated immune response to the virus proves to be a worrying complication due to widespread inflammation and subsequent clinical sequela. The medical and scientific community as a whole will be expected to respond with the latest in technology and research, and further studies into the pathogenesis, clinical implications, identification, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 will push society past this pandemic.","Tellez, Daniel Dayal Sujay Phan Phong Mawley Ajinkya Shah Kush Consunji Gabriel Tellez Cindy Ruiz Kimberly Sabnis Rutuja Dayal Surbi Venketaraman Vishwanath",Clinics and Practice,,406

Aim: We aimed to evaluate the perceived impact of social media on panic buying behaviors in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 10 to November 25, 2020. A self-reported instrument was designed in English and then translated to the Kurdish Language to conduct the study. It was disseminated through social media platforms (Facebook, Viber, and WhatsApp) and e-mail, via a link, and 466 responses were collected from social media users. The statistical computations were performed using SPSS version 21. Results: The majority of respondents were male (62.2%), were <25 years old (43.9%), and had completed their bachelor's degree (53.9%), and most of the respondents (86.3%) used Facebook. Among the respondents, 42.1% were involved in panic buying, 32.8% of the respondents thought that social media platforms had an influence on panic buying, 86.1% of the respondents thought that social media should be sensible while reporting it, 88.4% thought that the reporting should be controlled, and 78.5% thought that photos of empty shelves should be avoided. There was a significant positive statistical correlation (r = 0.84) between social media use and panic buying among consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iraqi Kurdistan (p = <0.001). Conclusion: This research assessed how social media affects buying behavior, particularly in Iraq. Collective measures, such as sensible use and adequate media literacy, are needed to prevent such behaviors at least during public health emergencies.","Arafat, S M Yasir; Ahmad, Araz Ramazan; Murad, Hersh Rasool; Kakashekh, Hardawan Mahmoud",Front Public Health,,406

Zimbabwe is no exception, as motivated by the Sustainable Development Goals of 2015 which aims at attaining zero hunger by 2030 and the New Urban Agenda which envisions that cities and huan settlements must provide access to quality services in the form of food nutrition and security. Through Zimbabwe’s regulatory framework, the Environmental Management Act and the Urban Councils Act, have been used as tools to promote food waste reuse and recycling hence, the reduction in food waste through recycling at household and even at commercial levels. However, local authorities suffer from a lack of capacity to effectively collect waste hence, the need to effectively deal with issues regarding food waste from the household level. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has also threatened food security in the African region and hence, the need to effectively maximise on food recycling and reuse measures. The chapter concludes that food waste recycling and reuse are an essential component for urban environments to thrive excellently, as this does not only cut on food waste to guarantee food security for the poor, but also promotes healthier and cleaner working and living environments for the populace. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Kanonhuhwa, T.

Confinement-induced decreases in physical activity levels and increases in sedentary behavior may provoke a rapid deterioration of cardiovascular health and premature deaths among populations with increased cardiovascular risk. Even short-term (1-4 wk) inactivity has been linked with detrimental effects in cardiovascular function and structure and increased cardiovascular risk factors. In this unprecedented and critical scenario, home-based physical activity programs arise as a clinically relevant intervention to promote health benefits to cardiac patients. Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different models of home-based exercise programs in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular events among different populations. This body of knowledge can inform evidence-based policies to be urgently implemented to counteract the impact of increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby alleviating the global burden of cardiovascular disease.","Peçanha, Tiago; Goessler, Karla Fabiana; Roschel, Hamilton; Gualano, Bruno",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,,406

With many different healthcare professionals contributing to the prehabilitation literature, there is significant variation in reported primary endpoints that restricts comparison. In addition, there has been limited work on patient-related outcome measures suggesting that patients with colorectal cancer needs and issues are being overlooked. The Defining Standards in Colorectal Optimisation Study aims to achieve international consensus from all stakeholders on key standards to provide a framework for reporting future prehabilitation research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will identify key standards reported in trials of prehabilitation in colorectal surgery. Standards that are important to patients will be identified by a patient and public involvement (PPI) event. The longlist of standards generated from the systematic review and PPI event will be used to develop a three-round online Delphi process. This will engage all stakeholders (healthcare professionals and patients) both nationally and internationally. The results of the Delphi will be followed by a face-to-face interactive consensus meeting that will define the final standards for prehabilitation for elective colorectal surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences Ethics Committee has approved this protocol, which is registered as a study (200190120) with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative. Publication of the standards developed by all stakeholders will increase the potential for comparative research that advances understanding of the clinical application of prehabilitation.

A systematic review,2021,"Postoperative dressing protocols after clean surgery without implant vary widely. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether early postoperative dressing removal is a valid option, as compared to untouched dressing or twice-weekly dressing change approach. A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients who underwent carpal tunnel release (CTR) or trigger finger release (TFR) between January and November 2020. Patients were randomly distributed into 3 groups: surgical dressing untouched until first follow up (SDU); surgical dressing changed twice a week in a health maintenance organization (HMO); and surgical dressing removed at first postoperative day (SDR). Data collected included patient characteristics, pre-and post-operative functional (QuickDASH) and autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living performance (IADL)) scores, Vancouver scar scale (VSS) and potential complications. Eighty-four patients were included: 28 (33.3%), 29 (34.5%) and 27 (32.1%) in the SDU, HMO and SDR groups, respectively. Deterioration in mean IADL score at 2-week follow-up was statistically significant in the HMO group (mean delta 3.35, p = 0.008). Quick DASH score improved significantly between preoperative and 2-week follow-up values only in the SDU group (mean delta 9.12, p = 0.012). Other parameters, including wound complications, did not differ significantly between groups. Early removal of postoperative dressing and immediate wound exposure was a safe option after CTR and TFR. An untouched bulky dressing correlated with early functional improvement. Finally, iterative dressing change in HMO showed no benefit and led to significant deterioration in early postoperative autonomy. IRB APPROVAL: 0548-18-TLV.

This article describes the different approaches taken towards optimal fallow periods in Canadian jurisdictions. METHODS: We searched publicly available information from dentist and dental hygiene regulator websites across the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada. We also searched for guidance documents on dental associations' websites or through personal communication with government officials. We extracted and tabulated information on fallow period recommendations or guidance, when available. RESULTS: Nine jurisdictions (6 provinces and all 3 territories) acknowledge or provide guidance on fallow periods following aerosol-generating procedures. Among those who have provided guidance regarding a fallow period, recommendations follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance if the air changes per hour (ACH) in the dental operatory is known. CONCLUSION: The evidence for deciding on optimal fallow period is limited and still being explored, resulting in substantial variation across Canadian jurisdictions. A focus on developing scientific evidence relevant to dentistry and assimilating existing science is crucial to establishing consistency and uniformity in information to deliver safe oral health care services.","Singhal, Sonica; Farmer, Julie; Aggarwal, Anuj; Kim, JinHee; Quiñonez, Carlos",Int. dent. j,,406

The purpose of this article is to provide an evidence-based overview of the adverse mental health impacts on healthcare workers during times of crisis and other challenging working conditions and to highlight the importance of prioritizing and protecting the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we provide a broad overview of the elevated risk of stress, burnout, moral injury, depression, trauma, and other mental health challenges among healthcare workers. Second, we consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns, as reflected in emerging research on the negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. Further, we consider potential approaches for overcoming these threats to mental health by exploring the value of practicing self-care strategies, and implementing evidence based interventions and organizational measures to help protect and support the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce. Lastly, we highlight systemic changes to empower healthcare workers and protect their mental health and well-being in the long run, and propose policy recommendations to guide healthcare leaders and health systems in this endeavor. This paper acknowledges the stressors, burdens, and psychological needs of the healthcare workforce across health systems and disciplines, and calls for renewed efforts to mitigate these challenges among those working on the frontlines during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Søvold, Lene E; Naslund, John A; Kousoulis, Antonis A; Saxena, Shekhar; Qoronfleh, M Walid; Grobler, Christoffel; Münter, Lars",Front Public Health,,406
377316,The prevention of suicide among military veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Coronaviruses use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate and express their genome. The RdRp associates with additional non-structural proteins (nsps) to form a replication-transcription complex (RTC) that carries out RNA synthesis, capping and proofreading. However, the structure of the RdRp long remained elusive, thus limiting our understanding of coronavirus genome expression and replication. Recently, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-1 RdRp was reported. Driven by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, structural data on the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and associated factors has since emerged at an unprecedented pace, with more than twenty structures released to date. This review provides an overview of the currently available coronavirus RdRp structures and outlines how they have, together with functional studies, led to a molecular understanding of the viral polymerase, its interactions with accessory factors and the mechanisms by which promising antivirals may inhibit coronavirus replication.","Hillen, Hauke S",Curr Opin Virol,,406

385300,Correction to: Beyond Burnout: Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic Challenges to Self-care,2021,"This research presents a nudge-based approach to promoting honest behavior. Specifically, we introduce the moral barrier hypothesis, which posits that moral violations can be inhibited by the introduction of spatial boundaries, including ones that do not physically impede the act of transgressing. We found that, as compared to a no barrier condition, children cheated significantly less often when a barrier was strategically placed to divide the space where children were seated from a place that was associated with cheating. This effect was seen both when the barrier took a physical form and when it was purely symbolic. However, the mere presence of a barrier did not reduce cheating: if it failed to separate children from a space that was associated with cheating, children cheated as much as when there was no barrier at all. Taken together, these findings support the moral barrier hypothesis and show that even seemingly unremarkable features of children's environments can nudge them to act honestly.","Zhao, Li; Zheng, Yi; Compton, Brian J; Qin, Wen; Zheng, Jiaxin; Fu, Genyue; Lee, Kang; Heyman, Gail D",Proc.

On top of meeting urgent needs of patients for medical treatment, the emergency department also has to devote resources into investigation and prevention of COVID-19. At the beginning of the epidemic, with the strategy to intercept the chain of infection, Peking University First Hospital (PKUFH) focused on three important aspects: controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations, to expeditiously draft scientific and proper management measures for the emergency department, followed by real-time dynamic adjustments based on the development trend of the epidemic. These measures effectively ensured a smooth, orderly and safe operation of the emergency department. As of the writing of this manuscript, there has been no active COVID-19 infection in patients and medical staff in the emergency department, and no infection in patients admitted to PKUFH through the emergency department. This study describes the prevention and control measures in the emergency department of PKUFH during the outbreak of COVID-19, aiming to provide some reference for domestic and international medical institutions.","Hu, Xiaojing; Liu, Si; Wang, Bo; Xiong, Hui; Wang, Ping",Intern Emerg Med,,406

390819,Beyond transmission: Dire need for integration of nutrition interventions in COVID-19 pandemic-response strategies in developing countries like Pakistan,2020,"Testing of symptomatic persons for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is occurring worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out jointly in test settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only requires collecting information about potential risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide healthcare databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of nonepidemic disease.","Vandenbroucke, Jan P; Brickley, Elizabeth B; Vandenbroucke-Grauls, Christina M J E; Pearce, Neil",Epidemiology,,406

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of Dutch NHs with clinically suspected COVID-19 and who received RT-PCR test. METHODS: We collected data of NH residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 via electronic health records between March 18 and May 13, 2020. Registration was performed on diagnostic status [confirmed (COVID-19+)/ruled out (COVID-19-)] and symptomatology (typical and atypical symptoms). Information on mortality and risk factors for mortality were extracted from usual care data. RESULTS: In our sample of residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 (N = 4007), COVID-19 was confirmed in 1538 residents (38%). Although symptomatology overlapped between residents with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-, those with COVID-19+ were 3 times more likely to die within 30 days [hazard ratio (HR), 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-3.6]. Within this group, mortality was higher for men than for women (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), and we observed a higher mortality for residents with dementia, reduced kidney function, and Parkinson's disease, even when corrected for age, gender, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: About 40% of the residents with clinically suspected COVID-19 actually had COVID-19, based on the RT-PCR test. Despite an overlap in symptomatology, mortality rate was 3 times higher for residents with COVID-19+. This emphasizes the importance of using low-threshold testing in NH residents, which is an essential prerequisite to using limited personal protective equipment and isolation measures efficiently.","Rutten, Jeanine J S; van Loon, Anouk M; van Kooten, Janine; van Buul, Laura W; Joling, Karlijn J; Smalbrugge, Martin; Hertogh, Cees M P M",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,406

This case study describes the utilization of Harrison's open-systems model to create an approach for rapid adoption of existing telehealth technologies in a large scale academic medical center. Methods: An internal group of organizational developers, was enlisted to enable this effort. Local networks were employed and organized into focus groups to rapidly assess and address barriers to adoption and informal interviews with executive leadership were conducted to align organizational goals. Interventions include rapid deployment of focused and data driven provider, staff and patient support bolstered by effective communication and resource management. Results: There was an increase in the number of patient portal activation codes by 75% during the month of March. The number of activation codes generated expectedly decreased in April as many patients now had activated patient portals. The video visit volume as a result of provider self-scheduling increased went from a baseline of 0 to over 600 clinical visits. Discussion: Experienced organizational development programs can facilitate adoption of change. The faculty practice of CUIMC has years of experience with supporting wide scale operational change centered on technology. In this case, providing engaged networks with tailored content that is focused on the process and available technology promoted rapid adoption and optimization. Conclusion: In the setting of profound external pressure, experience with the ability to focus on tailoring training and support to the culture of the organization helped to rapidly increase the availability and success of telehealth visits for a large scale academic medical center.","Touson Jonathan, C; Namita, Azad; Corinne, Depue; Timothy, Crimmins; Rosalie, Long",,,406
393087,From Crisis to Coordination: Challenges and Opportunities for Integrated Care posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) is critical in autonomic and endocrine control. Previous work has indicated that PVN dysregulation is associated with a variety of cardiometabolic diseases including those related to obesity. However, investigations have focused primarily on molecular alterations. Importantly, changes in the anatomical structure of brain networks also leads to functional alterations. While electron microscopy (EM) can provide nanometer resolution of normal/abnormal brain structures, an inherent limitation of traditional transmission EM is the random sampling of an object within a large region of interest (i.e. PVN). To overcome the inherent limitations of EM, we introduce an approach that utilizes large field of view high-resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the PVN. Six week old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) or normal chow for 10 weeks (n=4/group), and brains prepared for SEM imaging. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required social distancing, SEM imaging and analysis was conducted remotely (i.e. at home) using a virtual network computing approach. We first acquired interactive, zoomable maps of the PVN at a low magnification. This image was then used to navigate precisely to the PVN and acquire a high-resolution image encompassing ~30-40% of the nucleus (Figure). With this approach, we could rapidly scan for any visually apparent anatomical alterations. This initial evaluation revealed more electron dense regions within PVN neuronal nuclei, potentially indicative of heterochromatin clusters, in HFD mice relative to normal chow counterparts. Thus, we performed subsequent analysis on 80-120 neurons from each diet group by outlining neuronal nuclear envelopes and quantifying pixel distribution. This provided an indirect estimate of heterochromatin (i.e. dark pixels) and euchromatin (lighter pixels), with a shift towards darker pixels suggestive of increased chromatin ?clustering?. The area and perimeter of analyzed PVN neuronal nuclei between groups was similar (e.g. area: 4.0±2.9 vs 3.7±1.4 µm2x106, normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). However, histogram analysis of pixel intensities revealed positive kurtosis, indicating that HFD resulted in a redistribution of nuclear pixels to dark and light pixel intensities (-0.05±0.03 vs 0.12±0.03 a.u., normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). Measures of skew, an indicator of curve symmetry, further revealed a leftward pixel shift (i.e. more negative skew toward dark pixels) in diet-induced obese mice (-0.48±0.01 vs -0.64±0.01 a.u., normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). Finally, we created a PVN ?map? to examine where the most altered neurons were located. In short, following HFD feeding, ?altered? neurons were distributed throughout the entire PVN and not located in discrete PVN sub-nuclei. Collectively, these findings present an approach that allows for the precise placement of PVN cells within the overall region (i.e. locating a house within a city). Moreover, they suggest that HFD feeding may disrupt PVN neuronal chromatin structure, which may be reflective of epigenetic modifications and/or transcriptional alterations.","Arestakesyan, Hovhannes Blackmore Katherine Smith Hannah Popratiloff Anastas Young Colin",The FASEB Journal,,406

It was first identified associated with the surface of vitreous collagen fibrils and several other SLRPs are also known to bind collagen fibrils and it some cases alter fibril morphology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the binding of opticin to the collagen II-containing fibrils found in vitreous and cartilage. Electron microscopic studies using gold labelling demonstrated that opticin binds vitreous and thin cartilage collagen fibrils specifically at a single site in the gap region of the collagen D-period corresponding to the e2 stain band; this is the first demonstration of the binding site of a class III SLRP on collagen fibrils. Opticin did not bind thick cartilage collagen fibrils from cartilage or tactoids formed in vitro from collagen II, but shows high specificity for thin, heterotypic collagen fibrils containing collagens II, and XI or V/XI. Vitreous collagen fibrils from opticin null and wild-type mice were compared and no difference in fibril morphology or diameter was observed. Similarly, in vitro fibrillogenesis experiments showed that opticin did not affect fibril formation. We propose that when opticin is bound to collagen fibrils, rather than influencing their morphology it instead hinders the binding of other molecules to the fibril surfaces and/or act as an intermediary bridge linking the collagen fibrils to other non-collagenous molecules.","Hansen, Uwe; Holmes, David F; Bruckner, Peter; Bishop, Paul N",PLoS One,,406

However, existing studies rarely employed longitudinal designs, precluding the determination of the directionality between endorsement of conspiracy theories and its societal consequences. Also, relatively little research examined whether the association between protective health behaviour and the endorsement of conspiracy theories is affected by the content of a given theory. METHODS: A four-wave longitudinal panel survey on the association between belief in a wide range of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and protective behaviour was carried out on a representative sample of Polish citizens (T1 = 1130, T2 = 971, T3 = 818, T4 = 688). Analyses were performed using Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models. RESULTS: The results showed a reciprocal, bidirectional association between conspiracy mentality and protective behaviour. The same effect was also observed between protective behaviour and threat of authoritarianism. We did not find evidence that specific COVID-19 related conspiracy theories directly (and differently) predict within-person changes in protective behaviour over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the association between various conspiracy-related variables and anti-pandemic COVID-19 variables differs at within- and between-person levels. Changes in the adherence to pro-health measures were negatively predicted by conspiracy mentality and a feeling of threat that the solutions introduced by the government may limit civil rights. Specific conspiracy beliefs were significantly related to protective behaviour only at the between-person level.","Oleksy, Tomasz; Wnuk, Anna; Gambin, Malgorzata; Lys, Agnieszka",Soc Sci Med,,406
395544,The radiologist empowerment through virtual multidisciplinary tumor boards: The commitment of oncologic care during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a consequence of stay-at-home and other lockdown measures, such as social distancing, all health care service provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been affected, including the provision of speech therapy. Telehealth services can play a major role in maintaining access to health care, help speech and language pathologists (SLPs) overcome physical barriers by providing patients and caregivers with access to health care, and limit the discontinuity of patient care. To have a better understanding of the changes that have occurred in these services during COVID-19, this research was conducted to explore the nature and current situation of speech-language services in Saudi Arabia based on caregivers' perspectives. It also investigated whether changes have occurred in these services during the COVID-19 lockdown. The study also determined the perception of caregivers in delivering SLS sessions remotely. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 385 caregivers in Saudi Arabia. An online survey asked whether children were experiencing any SLS problems and if they had received any intervention. The survey also assessed the perception of changes in service during the COVID-19 lockdown and the perceptions, acceptance, and willingness of the caregivers to deliver telehealth speech services in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: About 50% of the respondents had or were suspected to have a child with SLS problems, and just over half of them had accessed SLS services. Most of the respondents reported suspension of therapy sessions as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the respondents had little experience using telehealth prior to the pandemic, they generally showed a willingness to use telehealth in therapy sessions, expressing a preference for video calls over other options. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that SLS services in Saudi Arabia are limited and that accessing these services is challenging. Alternative service delivery using remote services could help caregivers overcome such challenges. When telehealth was introduced as an option for service delivery, the caregivers showed welcoming responses, particularly with video calls.","Al Awaji, Nisreen Naser; Almudaiheem, Alanoud A; Mortada, Eman M",PLoS One,,406

METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 from 10 hospitals of Jiangsu province, China, were enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients with COVID-19 were included, and 39.39% and 13.47% of patients had overweight and obesity, respectively. The proportions of bilateral pneumonia (92.50% vs. 73.57%, P = 0.033) and type 2 diabetes (17.50% vs. 3.57%, P = 0.006) were higher in patients with obesity than lean patients. The proportions of severe illness in patients with overweight (12.82% vs. 2.86%, P = 0.006) and obesity (25.00% vs. 2.86%, P < 0.001) were significantly higher than lean patients. More patients with obesity developed respiratory failure (20.00% vs. 2.86%, P < 0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (5.00% vs. 0%, P = 0.024) than lean patients. The median days of hospitalization were longer in patients with obesity than lean patients (17.00 days vs. 14.00 days, P = 0.029). Overweight (OR, 4.222; 95% CI: 1.322-13.476; P = 0.015) and obesity (OR, 9.216; 95% CI: 2.581-32.903; P = 0.001) were independent risk factors of severe illness. Obesity (HR, 6.607; 95% CI: 1.955-22.329; P = 0.002) was an independent risk factor of respiratory failure.

398549,100 days on: the primary care response to COVID-19 in Singapore,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulants (OAC) with or without antiplatelet therapy (APT) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TVAR) in patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation therapy, the optimal antithrombotic strategy remains unknown in these population. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing the outcome of OAC alone versus OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through May 2020 to identify clinical trials that investigated OAC alone versus OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with AF. From each study, we extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios of major or life threatening bleeding, stroke, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: 1 randomized controlled trial and 3 observational studies were identified, which enrolled a total of 2032 patients with AF who underwent TAVR assigned to the OAC group (n = 722) or OAC with APT group (n = 1310). Pooled analyses demonstrated the rate of major or life threatening bleeding was significantly lower in the OAC group compared to the OAC with APT group (HR [95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.54 [0.38-0.77], P = .0006]). However, the rate of stroke was similar in both groups (HR [95% CI] = 1.22 [0.80-1.87], P = .36). All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were also similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that OAC with APT following TAVR in patients with AF increased the risk of bleeding compared to OAC alone without decreasing the risk of stroke.","Yokoyama, Yujiro; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Takagi, Hisato; Kuno, Toshiki",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,406

Relentless efforts for the development of effective pharmaco-therapeutics are in progress but the respite is the development of effective vaccines. However, monotherapy might not always exhibit complete efficacy and may culminate in the rapid evolution of drug-resistant viral strains. Hence, simultaneous modulation of multiple druggable targets not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also quell the prospects of mutant viruses. Currently, milk peptides have bloomed beyond just being a quintessential part of nutrition to prominent therapeutic implications in human health and diseases. Hence, we have focused on colostrum/milk peptides as they have already been acknowledged for their high potency, target specificity with significantly low or no side effects and bio-toleration. The results presented provide a conceptual strategy for the rational designing of prospective multitargeted peptide inhibitors for SARS-CoV2.","Pradeep, H; Najma, Umme; Aparna, H S",Protein j,,406

One such approach is the use of ultravioletC (UVC) radiation for surface decontamination in hospital settings. UVC is the most powerful of the UV wavelengths and, therefore, the most damaging. The radiation is used for sterilization of workplaces and objects, and although there is no current evidence, perhaps it may eradicate airborne coronavirus. Humans should not be subjected to this form of irradiation. This form of radiation comes with a health warning, and humans should not be in the vicinity when UVC sterilization is occurring. This case report deals with the unfortunate incidence of an operator affected by UVC radiation while working on a patient in an orthodontic clinic. The article will serve as a timely warning to clinicians that awareness of the safety protocols should be observed. Besides, we present some recommendations for the use of UVC depuration of dental operatories.","Gupta, Harshita Kaur Harneet Mahajan Payal Singh Gurkeerat",Journal of Indian Orthodontic Society,,406
400816,[Almost two-thirds of the elderly with covid-19 surviving in nursing homes],2020,"SARS-CoV-2is the causative agent for the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, and this virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity responsible for removing mismatches that arise during genome duplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3' nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of viral genome replication. Hence, ritonavir may potentiate the therapeutic properties of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin.","Narayanan, Naveen; Nair, Deepak T",Int J Biol Macromol,,406

METHODS: From 1 March to 10 May 2020, we retrospectively analyzed data from stroke patients in need of urgent neurointerventional treatment. Clinical presentation, demographics, and clinical history were collected along with procedural variables (door-to-needle time, needle-to-mTiCi time). Each patient underwent a nasal swab (polymerase chain reaction test), clinical screening, and chest CT scan to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Technical success, procedural safety (including staff SARS-CoV-2 infection), and clinical outcome at discharge were retrieved. A comparison was made with the same patient population treated between 1 March and 10 May 2019 to highlight possible differences in the characteristics or outcomes of the patients. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six ischemic stroke patients were admitted to our facility from 1 March to 10 May 2020. Of these, 12 patients (9%) were classified as ""high risk"" for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Radiological suspicion of COVID-19 was confirmed in all cases by pharyngeal swab. Five SARS-CoV-2 patients (42%) needed endovascular therapy. None of the staff members tested positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Compared to the same period in 2019, an increase in the mean interval from the first symptoms to hospital arrival was observed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of stroke presented several challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak. Within the hospital, special pathways can be used to maintain both procedural safety and procedural times.","Asteggiano, Francesco; Divenuto, Ignazio; Ajello, Daniele; Gennaro, Nicolò; Santonocito, Orazio; Marcheselli, Simona; Balzarini, Luca; Nuzzi, Nunzio Paolo; Politi, Letterio Salvatore",Neuroradiology,,406

As a consequence, the Swiss government decreed a public lock-down to reduce and restrict further infections. The aim of this investigation was to provide the impact of the COVID-19 lock-down on the presentations of patients in an interdisciplinary emergency department (ED). PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at an interdisciplinary Swiss ED during the lock-down period. All patients who presented to the ED were enrolled in this investigation and compared to a control cohort during the same time period in 2019. Data regarding patients' characteristics, medical specialty, time course of presentations during the observation period, outpatient or hospital admission were analyzed. RESULTS: In total 7072 patients were included in the final analysis. During the lock-down period the number of ED presentations significantly decreased by 29% in comparison to the control period in the previous year (pâ¯<â¯0.0001). The analysis of the time course revealed that in each week the number of patients was lower with 13-43% reduction. Irrespective of the medical specialty, the number of presentations decreased during the COVID-19 situation, whereas this decrease was higher in surgical diseases (31%, pâ¯<â¯0.0001) than in non-surgical presentations (3.6%, pâ¯= 0.4). CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic lock-down was associated with reduced number of presentations in an ED. Mainly, surgical diseases and injuries were affected in terms of a reduction of presentations during the COVID-19 lock-down period.","Fahrner, René; Bähler, Stefan; Lindner, Gregor",Wien. klin.

A Rapid Systematic Review,2021,"In this research, an electrically-polarized graphene-polylactic acid (E-GRP) spacer is introduced for the first time by a novel fabrication method, which consists of 3D printing followed by electrical polarization under a high voltage electric field (1.5 kV/cm). The fabricated E-GRP was tested in an osmotic-driven process (forward osmosis system) to evaluate its performance in terms of water flux, reverse solute flux, and ion attraction compared to a 3D printed non-polarized graphene-polylactic acid (GRP) spacer and a polylactic acid (PLA) spacer. The use of the developed E-GRP spacer showed>50% water flux enhancement (32.4 +- 2 LMH) compared to the system employing the GRP (20.5 +- 2.3 LMH) or PLA (20.8 +- 2.1 LMH) spacer. This increased water flux was attributed to the increased osmotic pressure across the membrane due to the ions adsorbed on the polarized (E-GRP) spacer. The E-GRP spacer also retarded the gypsum scaling on the membrane compared to the GRP spacer due to the dispersion effect of electrostatic forces between the gypsum aggregation and negatively charged surfaces. The electric polarization of the E-GRP spacer was shown to be maintained for>100 h by observing its salt adsorption properties (in a 3 M NaCl solution).","Yanar, Numan; Park, Hosik; Son, Moon; Choi, Heechul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07210v1.pdf,406

In March 2020, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized CCP under emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) exemption and an IRB-approved Expanded Access Program (EAP) to treat severe COVID-19. Hospital demand grew rapidly in the Southeastern U.S., resulting in backlogs of CCP orders. We describe a large U.S. blood center's (BC) rapid implementation of a CCP program in response to community needs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From April 2 to May 17, 2020, CCP was collected by whole blood or apheresis. Initial manual approaches to donor intake, collection, and distribution were rapidly replaced with automated processes. All CCP donors and products underwent FDA-required screening and testing. RESULTS: A total of 619 CCP donors (299 females, 320 males) presented for CCP donation (161 [25.7%] whole blood, 466 [74.3%] plasmapheresis) resulting in 1219 CCP units. Production of CCP increased as processes were automated and streamlined, from a mean of 11 donors collected/day for the first month to a mean of 25 donors collected/day in the subsequent 2 weeks. Backlogged orders were cleared, and inventory began to accumulate 4 weeks after project initiation. CONCLUSION: The BC was able to implement an effective de novo CCP collection program within 6 weeks in response to a community need in a global pandemic. Documentation of the experience may inform preparedness for future pandemics.","Reik, Rita; Gammon, Richard R; Carol, Nancy; Smith, Judith; Grable, Martin; Forbes, Susan; Wu, Yanyun; Reed, Lance; Rogers, Michael; Prichard, Alicia; Paul, Scott; Scholl, George",,,406

410042,Perspectives of US Youth During Initial Month of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gain access to the brain by using a route along the olfactory nerve. However, there is a general consensus that the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L. Nervus terminalis neurons therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal epithelium, possibly via innervation of Bowman's glands, to brain targets, including the telencephalon and diencephalon. This possibility needs to be examined in suitable animal models and in human tissues.","Bilinska, Katarzyna; von Bartheld, Christopher S; Butowt, Rafal",,,406

In each of these tasks, our participation focused on the use of query-focused extractive summarisation to obtain the ideal answers to medical questions. The Synergy Task is an end-to-end question answering task on COVID-19 where systems are required to return relevant documents, snippets, and answers to a given question. Given the absence of training data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained with the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to retrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the documents and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good quality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant documents and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split the snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence classification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as input and was trained to predict the likelihood of the candidate sentence being part of the ideal answer. The runs obtained either the best or second best ROUGE-F1 results of all participants to all batches of BioASQ9b. This shows that using BERT in a classification setup is a very strong baseline for the identification of ideal answers.","Moll'a, Diego; Khanna, Urvashi; Galat, Dima; Nguyen, Vincent; Rybinski, Maciej",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12189v2.pdf,406

414327,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Antibiotic Prescribing for Common Infections in The Netherlands: A Primary Care-Based Observational Cohort Study,2021,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interplay of deterministic and stochastic models for epidemic diseases. Deterministic models for epidemic diseases are prone to predict global stability. If the natural birth and death rates are assumed small in comparison to disease parameters like the contact rate and the recovery rate, then the globally stable endemic equilibrium corresponds to a tiny proportion of infected individuals. Asymptotic equilibrium levels corresponding to low numbers of individuals invalidate the deterministic results. Diffusion effects force frequency functions of the stochastic model to possess similar stability properties as the deterministic model. Particular simulations of the stochastic model are, however, oscillatory and predict oscillatory patterns. Smaller or isolated populations show longer periods, more violent oscillations, and larger probabilities of extinction. We prove that evolution maximizes the infectiousness of the disease as measured by the ability to increase the proportion of infected individuals. This hold provided the stochastic oscillations are moderate enough to remain in the vicinity of the deterministic equilibrium. We close our paper with a discussion of the herd-immunity concept and stress its close relation to vaccination-campaigns.","Lindstrom, Torsten",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03254v1.pdf,406

Here, we investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) as an alternative to RT-PCR in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 27,824 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection who underwent unenhanced low-dose chest CT from 20 February, 2020 to 21 May, 2020 were evaluated. Patients were recruited from seven specifically designated hospitals for patients with COVID-19 infection affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. In each hospital, images were interpreted by two independent radiologists. CT findings were considered as positive/negative for COVID-19 infection based on RSNA diagnostic criteria. Then, the correlation between the number of daily positive chest CT scans and number of daily PCR-confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in Tehran province during this three-month period was assessed. The trends of admission rate and patients with positive CT scans were also evaluated. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between the numbers of daily positive CT scans and daily PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (râ¯=â¯0.913, p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, in hospitals located in regions with a lower socioeconomic status, the admission rate and number of positive cases within this three-month period was higher as compared to other hospitals. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions. In addition, our study provides further evidence for considering patients' socioeconomic status as an important risk factor for COVID-19.","Zali, Alireza; Sohrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Mahdavi, Ali; Khalili, Nastaran; Taheri, Morteza Sanei; Maher, Ali; Sadoughi, Mohammadmehdi; Zarghi, Afshin; Ziai, Seyed Ali; Shabestari, Abbas Arjmand; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Haghighatkhah, Hamidreza; Salevatipour, Babak; Abrishami, Alireza; Raoufi, Masoomeh; Dehghan, Pooneh; Bagheri, Arash Khameneh; Khoshnoud, Reza Jalili; Hanani, Khatereh",Acad. radiol,,406

Clinical characteristics and follow-up data of MIS-C in infants have not been well described. We sought to describe the clinical course, laboratory findings, therapeutics and outcomes among infants diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS: Infants of age <12 months with MIS-C were identified by reports to the CDC's MIS-C national surveillance system. Data were obtained on clinical signs and symptoms, complications, treatment, laboratory and imaging findings, and diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. Jurisdictions that reported 2 or more infants were approached to participate in evaluation of outcomes of MIS-C. RESULTS: Eighty-five infants with MIS-C were identified and 83 (97.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; median age was 7.7 months. Rash (62.4%), diarrhea (55.3%) and vomiting (55.3%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. Other clinical findings included hypotension (21.2%), pneumonia (21.2%) and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (13.9%). Laboratory abnormalities included elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, d-dimer and fibrinogen. Twenty-three infants had follow-up data; 3 of the 14 patients who received a follow-up echocardiogram had cardiac abnormalities during or after hospitalization. Nine infants had elevated inflammatory markers up to 98 days postdischarge. One infant (1.2%) died after experiencing multisystem organ failure secondary to MIS-C.

419558,Medication shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic: Saving more than COVID lives,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Australia has fortunately had a low prevalence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and our healthcare system has not been overwhelmed. We aimed to determine whether, despite this, a decline in acute stroke presentations, imaging and intervention occurred during the pandemic at a busy stroke centre. METHODS: The number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and endovascular clot retrievals (ECRs) performed during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-5/10/2020) at a large comprehensive stroke centre was compared against the pre-pandemic period (3/1/2019-1/31/2019) using Z-statistics. Year-on-year comparison of the number of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and ECRs performed per month was also made. RESULTS: The number of 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CT per month decreased significantly (P < 0.0025) following lockdown on 29th March. The number of ECRs also decreased (P = 0.165). The nadir in the weekly number of CTs coincided with lockdown and the peak of new COVID-19 cases. The number of patients with LVOs and ECRs increased by 15% and 14%, respectively, in March but decreased by 55% and 48%, respectively, in April. CONCLUSIONS: The significant decrease in volume of 'code stroke' activations and acute stroke imaging following lockdown was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in patients with LVOs and ECRs. The decrease in imaging was therefore not driven purely by patients with mild strokes and stroke mimics, but also included those with severe strokes. Since Australia had a low prevalence of COVID-19, this observed decrease cannot be attributed to hospital congestion and is instead likely driven by patient fear.","Amukotuwa, Shalini A; Bammer, Roland; Maingard, Julian",J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,,406
420107,Younger and Older Adults’ Mood and Expectations Regarding Aging During COVID-19,2020,"We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake) for COVID-19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage to hospitalisation. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 ± 8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52-7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10-16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.","Hamer, Mark; Kivimäki, Mika; Gale, Catharine R; Batty, G David",Brain Behav Immun,,406

With increasing reports from clinical observations and autopsy findings, it became clear that the disease causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as a broad spectrum of systemic and multiorgan pathologies, including angiopathy, endothelialitis, and thrombosis. Coagulopathy is associated with the activity of megakaryocytes, which play crucial roles in modulating the platelet homeostasis. Only a few autopsy reports include findings on thrombosis formation and the presence of megakaryocytes. Here we review and summarize the possible involvement and the pathophysiology of the thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients based on post-mortem reports. We reviewed post-mortem reports from March 2020 to September 2020. Eleven autopsy reports that demonstrated thromboembolic involvement findings, either macroscopically or microscopically, were included in this review. All studies reported similar pulmonary gross findings. Not all studies described thrombi formation and megakaryocyte findings. Pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, severe endothelial injury, and widespread thrombosis are frequent in COVID-19 patients, following many patients with high-level D-Dimer, increased fibrinogen, abnormal prothrombic coagulation, and thrombocytopenia. Reports showed that thrombus was also found in the lower extremities' deep veins and the prostatic venous plexus. In conclusion, a complex interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion with platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, inflammation, immune response, and the possible involvement of megakaryocytes may increase the cumulative risk of thrombosis by a yet unclear cellular and humoral interaction.","Dwiputra Hernugrahanto, K; Novembri Utomo, D; Hariman, H; Budhiparama, N C; Medika Hertanto, D; Santoso, D; Hogendoorn, P C W",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,406

People &#8805;70 were deemed ""Clinically Vulnerable."" Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have a negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and provisions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional telephone survey. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older people, 76-97 years. OUTCOMES: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety (GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences. DATA ANALYSIS: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions. RESULTS: n = 142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as ""good"", ""very good"" or ""excellent"". < 10% met the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2). 42% were less active than before lockdown. 27% were lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression. Many were able to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than anticipated.

A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors",2020,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, is the predominant cause of severe enteropathogenic diarrhea in swine. A simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive method is critical for monitoring PEDV on pig farms. In this study, a simple and rapid lateral flow immunoassay detection system that integrates europium (Eu) (III) chelate microparticles was developed to identify PEDV in fecal swabs. This newly developed diagnostic sandwich immunoassay utilizes lateral flow test strips (LFTSs). The fluorescence peak heights of the test line (HT) and the control line (HC) were measured using a fluorescence strip reader, and the HT/HC ratio was used for quantitation. The limit of detection of PEDV with this LFTS was ??ten times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL??. Fecal swab samples were used to determine the cutoff value. Field samples, various PEDV strains and other viruses were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTSs, which were 97.8% and 100%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 0.05, as compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results were in high agreement with those obtained by RT-PCR. Epidemiological surveillance of PEDV using the LFTSs ??in areas threatened by African swine fever virus?? suggested that the PEDV positive rate on pig farms had significantly decreased, mainly due to the implementation of strict biosecurity measures. The results indicate that the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTS system is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.","Liu, Jianbo; Shi, Hongyan; Cong, Guangyi; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Da; Cao, Liyan; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Feng, Li",Arch Virol,,406

In this regard natural products could be a potential source of substances active against coronavirus infections. A systematic computer-aided virtual screening approach was carried out using commercially available natural products found on the Zinc Database in addition to an in-house compound library to identify potential natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPRO). The top eighteen hits from the screening were selected for in vitro evaluation on the viral protease (SARS-CoV-2 MPRO). Five compounds (naringenin, 2,3',4,5',6-pentahydroxybenzophenone, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, sennoside B, and acetoside) displayed high activity against the viral protein. Acteoside showed similar activity to the positive control GC376. The most potent compounds were tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 Egyptian strain where only naringenin showed moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at non-cytotoxic micromolar concentrations in vitro with a significant selectivity index (CC50/IC50 = 178.748/28.347 = 6.3). Moreover; a common feature pharmacophore model was generated to explain the requirements for enzyme inhibition by this diverse group of active ligands.

428016,The Impact of COVID-19 on Sexual Behavior and Psychosocial Functioning in a Clinical Sample of Men who have Sex with Men Using HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis,2021,"Objectives: Approximately 20–30% of patients with COVID-19 require hospitalization, and 5–12% may require critical care in an intensive care unit (ICU). A rapid surge in cases of severe COVID-19 will lead to a corresponding surge in demand for ICU care. Because of constraints on resources, frontline healthcare workers may be unable to provide the frequent monitoring and assessment required for all patients at high risk of clinical deterioration. We developed a machine learning-based risk prioritization tool that predicts ICU transfer within 24 h, seeking to facilitate efficient use of care providers’ efforts and help hospitals plan their flow of operations. Methods: A retrospective cohort was comprised of non-ICU COVID-19 admissions at a large acute care health system between 26 February and 18 April 2020. Time series data, including vital signs, nursing assessments, laboratory data, and electrocardiograms, were used as input variables for training a random forest (RF) model. The cohort was randomly split (70:30) into training and test sets. The RF model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set, and its predictive performance on the test set was then evaluated. Results: The cohort consisted of 1987 unique patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to non-ICU units of the hospital. The median time to ICU transfer was 2.45 days from the time of admission. Compared to actual admissions, the tool had 72.8% (95% CI: 63.2–81.1%) sensitivity, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.7–77.9%) specificity, 76.2% (95% CI: 74.6–77.7%) accuracy, and 79.9% (95% CI: 75.2–84.6%) area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Conclusions: A ML-based prediction model can be used as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of imminent ICU transfer within 24 h. This tool could improve the management of hospital resources and patientthroughput planning, thus delivering more effective care to patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Cheng, Fu-Yuan; Joshi, Himanshu; Tandon, Pranai; Freeman, Robert; Reich, David L.; Mazumdar, Madhu; Kohli-seth, Roopa; Levin, Matthew; Timsina, Prem; Kia, Arash",J.

In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious patients with compatible chest computed tomography features. Cardiac injury was defined as a rise of serum high sensitivity cardiac Troponin-I level above 99th percentile (men: > 26 ng/mL, women: > 11 ng/mL). A total of 386 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Cardiac injury was present among 115 (29.8%) of the study population. The development of cardiac injury was significantly associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those with normal troponin levels (40.9% vs 11.1%, p value < 0.001). It was shown that patients with cardiac injury had a significantly lower survival rate after a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset (p log-rank < 0.001). It was further demonstrated in the multivariable analysis that cardiac injury could possibly increase the risk of short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (HR = 1.811, p-value = 0.023). Additionally, preexisting cardiovascular disease, malignancy, blood oxygen saturation < 90%, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia at presentation were independently associated with a greater risk of developing cardiac injury. Development of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor in-hospital outcomes. Additionally, it was shown that development of cardiac injury was associated with a lower short-term survival rate compared to patients without myocardial damage and could independently increase the risk of short-term mortality by nearly two-fold.","Karbalai Saleh, Shahrokh; Oraii, Alireza; Soleimani, Abbas; Hadadi, Azar; Shajari, Zahra; Montazeri, Mahnaz; Moradi, Hedieh; Talebpour, Mohammad; Sadat Naseri, Azadeh; Balali, Pargol; Akhbari, Mahsa; Ashraf, Haleh",Intern Emerg Med,,406

431887,"How do we Find a ""New Normal"" for Industry and Business After COVID-19 Shut Downs?",2020,"In chalcocite (Cu2S) bioleaching, the lack of iron metabolism is a key restricting factor. As the most common sulfide mineral, pyrite (FeS2) can release Fe(â ¡) and compensate for the iron metabolism deficiency in chalcocite bioleaching. The bioleaching of chalcocite in an imitated industrial system was improved by enhancing the iron-sulfur metabolism simultaneously using pyrite and sulfur oxidizers based on the joint utilization of waste resources, while the bioleaching performance and community structure in the leachate were systematically investigated. Due to the active sulfur/iron metabolism, the pH reached 1.2, and Fe3+ was increased by 77.78%, while the biomass of planktonic cells was improved to 2.19 × 107 cells/mL. Fourier transform infrared reflection (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results showed that more iron-sulfur crystals were produced due to more active iron-sulfur metabolism. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that many derivative particles and corrosion marks appeared on the surface of the ore, implying that the mineral-microbe interaction was strengthened. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed the accumulation of cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the ore surface, indicating a stronger contact leaching mechanism. Furthermore, the community structure and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that the introduction of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and pyrite could maintain the diversity of dominant leaching microorganisms at a high level. Sulfobacillus (27.75%) and Leptospirllillum (20.26%) were the dominant sulfur-oxidizing and iron-oxidizing bacteria during the bioleaching process. With the accumulation of multiple positive effects, the copper ion leaching rate was improved by 44.8%. In general, this new type of multiple intervention strategy can provide an important guide for the bioleaching of low-grade ores.","Feng, Shoushuai; Yin, Yijun; Yin, Zongwei; Zhang, Hailing; Zhu, Deqiang; Tong, Yanjun; Yang, Hailin",Environ Res,,406

433671,"Letter to editor in response to ""COVID-19: From bench to bedside"" by Singh A et al",2020,"Automatic unreliable news detection is a research problem with great potential impact. Recently, several papers have shown promising results on large-scale news datasets with models that only use the article itself without resorting to any fact-checking mechanism or retrieving any supporting evidence. In this work, we take a closer look at these datasets. While they all provide valuable resources for future research, we observe a number of problems that may lead to results that do not generalize in more realistic settings. Specifically, we show that selection bias during data collection leads to undesired artifacts in the datasets. In addition, while most systems train and predict at the level of individual articles, overlapping article sources in the training and evaluation data can provide a strong confounding factor that models can exploit. In the presence of this confounding factor, the models can achieve good performance by directly memorizing the site-label mapping instead of modeling the real task of unreliable news detection. We observed a significant drop (>10%) in accuracy for all models tested in a clean split with no train/test source overlap. Using the observations and experimental results, we provide practical suggestions on how to create more reliable datasets for the unreliable news detection task.

434537,Experiences of nurses caring for perinatal women and newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic: A descriptive qualitative study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can cause severe extrahepatic manifestations, such as mixed cryoglobulins (MC), up to the development of B cell nonHodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Mechanisms transforming of HCV infection into lymphoproliferative and/or autoimmune disorders are still poorly understood. In course of HCV infection, the sustained virus-driven antigenic stimulation may probably induce a B-cell clonal expansion. Measurements of serum free light chains (FLCs) levels, considered as a direct marker of B cell activity, are analyzed with increasing interest in clinical practice, for diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up of plasma cell dyscrasia. Syndecan-1 (CD138) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed and actively shed by most myeloma cells. Membrane CD138 represents the major receptor protein for HCV attachment to the hepatocyte surface and high levels of circulating sCD138 levels are detected in patients at early stage of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study is aimed to evaluate sCD138 and FLC levels as diagnostic biomarkers of HCV-related MC with B-NHL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 35 HCV-MC-NHL patients, characterized for the specific type of cryoglobulins, and 25 healthy blood donors (HBD) as negative control. Serum sCD138 levels were determined using ELISA kits specific for human sCD138. Serum FLCs were assessed by means of the turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: We found that serum levels of sCD138, as well as FLCs, were significantly higher in patients than in HBD (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with the definition of HCV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders as the consequence of a multifactorial and multistep pathogenetic process, we suggest that sCD138 and FLCs could be considered putative independent markers of worsening progression of the disease.","Gulli, F; Marino, M; Napodano, C; Pocino, K; Pandolfi, F; Gasbarrini, A; Rapaccini, G L; Basile, U",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,406

434614,COVID-19: Shedding light on racial and health inequities in the USA,2020,"Since December 2019, the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications are evolving. As the number of COVID patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is increasing, so is the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema (SE). We report 10 patients of COVID-19, with SE and pneumomediastinum. The mean age of the patients was 59 ± 8 years (range, 23-75). Majority of them were men (80%), and common symptoms were dyspnoea (100%), fever (80%) and cough (80%). None of them had any underlying lung disorder. All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission, with a median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122.5. Eight out of ten patients had spontaneous pneumomediastinum on their initial chest x-ray in the emergency department. The median duration of assisted ventilation before the development of SE was 5.5 days (interquartile range, 5-10 days). The highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 10 cmH2O for patients recieving invasive mechanical ventilation, while 8 cmH2O was the average PEEP in patients who had developed subcutaneous emphysema on non-invasive ventilation. All patients received corticosteroids while six also received tocilizumab, and seven received convalescent plasma therapy, respectively. Seven patients died during their hospital stay. All patients either survivor or non-survivor had prolonged hospital stay with an average of 14 days (range 8-25 days). Our findings suggest that it is lung damage secondary to inflammatory response due to COVID-19 triggered by the use of positive pressure ventilation which resulted in this complication. We conclude that the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and SE whenever present, is associated with poor outcome in critically ill COVID-19 ARDS patients.","Sethi, S M; Ahmed, A S; Hanif, S; Aqeel, M; Zubairi, A B S",Epidemiol Infect,,406

In this study, the molecular docking method was used to test 248 drugs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for viral entry into the host cell. Among the top-ranked ligands are drugs that are used for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments (paritaprevir, ledipasvir, simeprevir) and a natural biflavonoid amentoflavone. The binding sites of the HCV drugs and amentoflavone are different. Therefore, the ternary complexes of the HCV drug, amentoflavone, and RBD can be created. For the 5 top-ranked ligands, the validating molecular dynamics simulations of binary and ternary complexes with RBD were performed. According to the MMPBSA-binding free energies, the HCV drugs ledipasvir and paritaprevir (in a neutral form) are the most efficient binders of the RBD when used in combination with amentoflavone.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

436488,Impact of lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic in Indian children and youth with type 1 diabetes from different socio-economic classes,2020,"BACKGROUND: The INTERCEPT Blood System pathogen reduction technology (PRT), which uses amotosalen and ultraviolet A light treatment (amotosalen/UV-PRT), inactivates pathogens in plasma and platelet components (PCs). This review summarizes data describing the inactivation efficacy of amotosalen/UVA-PRT for a broad spectrum of viruses and parasites. METHODS: Twenty-five enveloped viruses, six nonenveloped viruses (NEVs), and four parasites species were evaluated for sensitivity to amotosalen/UVA-PRT. Pathogens were spiked into plasma and PC at high titers. Samples were collected before and after PRT and assessed for infectivity with cell cultures or animal models. Log reduction factors (LRFs) were defined as the difference in infectious titers before and after amotosalen/UV-PRT. RESULTS: LRFs of &#8805;4.0 log were reported for 19 pathogens in plasma (range, &#8805;4.0 to &#8805;7.6), 28 pathogens in PC in platelet additive solution (PC-PAS; &#8805;4.1-&#8805;7.8), and 14 pathogens in PC in 100% plasma (PC-100%; (&#8805;4.3->8.4). Twenty-five enveloped viruses and two NEVs were sensitive to amotosalen/UV-PRT; LRF ranged from >2.9 to &#8805;7.6 in plasma, 2.4 or greater to greater than 6.9 in PC-PAS and >3.5 to >6.5 in PC-100%. Infectious titers for four parasites were reduced by >4.0 log in all PC and plasma (&#8805;4.9 to >8.4). CONCLUSION: Amotosalen/UVA-PRT demonstrated effective infectious titer reduction for a broad spectrum of viruses and parasites. This confirms the capacity of this system to reduce the risk of viral and parasitic transfusion-transmitted infections by plasma and PCs in various geographies.","Lanteri, Marion C; Santa-Maria, Felicia; Laughhunn, Andrew; Girard, Yvette A; Picard-Maureau, Marcus; Payrat, Jean-Marc; Irsch, Johannes; Stassinopoulos, Adonis; Bringmann, Peter",Transfusion,,406

Here, we present two cases of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis seen within two weeks at a reference center for infectious diseases at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The patients did not present a common epidemiologic history for histoplasmosis, however both presented COVID-19 before the onset of histoplasmosis symptoms. Due to the difficulties in the diagnosis of acute histoplasmosis, novel laboratory methods such as Western Blot and PCR were included in the investigation of these cases. Both patients presented negative cultures for H. capsulatum and negative urinary galactomannan. However, they presented H and M bands in the Western blot as well as a positive H. capsulatum DNA detection in sputum. These results were available approximately 36 h after sample collection, fastening the beginning of treatment of one patient. Both patients progressed well with itraconazole treatment. These cases suggest that COVID-19 may facilitate the development of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and, therefore, clinicians must be aware of this differential diagnosis in patients from endemic areas with fever and coughing after recovery from COVID-19.","de Macedo, P.

Recently, it was found that the IL-6 plays a vital role in the progression of COVID-19, which is responsible for the high mortality rate. In order to facilitate the scientific community to fight against COVID-19, we have developed a method for predicting IL-6 inducing peptides/epitopes. The models were trained and tested on experimentally validated 365 IL-6 inducing and 2991 non-inducing peptides extracted from the immune epitope database. Initially, 9149 features of each peptide were computed using Pfeature, which were reduced to 186 features using the SVC-L1 technique. These features were ranked based on their classification ability, and the top 10 features were used for developing prediction models. A wide range of machine learning techniques has been deployed to develop models. Random Forest-based model achieves a maximum AUROC of 0.84 and 0.83 on training and independent validation dataset, respectively. We have also identified IL-6 inducing peptides in different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using our best models to design vaccine against COVID-19.

The findings revealed that without any previous history of CVD, the COVID-19 patients have developed some CVD complications like myocardial injury, cardiomyopathy, and venous thromboembolism after being infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and required for those patients an emergency clinical support to be aware to manage those complications. Though the association between DM and COVID-19-induced severe complications is still unclear, the limited data predict that different markers like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer linked with the severity of COVID-19 infection in diabetic individuals. Further studies on a large scale are urgently needed to explore the underlying mechanisms between CVD, DM, and COVID-19 for better treatment.","Roy, Sourav; Mazumder, Tanoy; Banik, Sujan",SN Compr Clin Med,,406

441762,Effects of Emergency Care-related Health Policies during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea: a Quasi-Experimental Study,2021,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an abundant cofactor that plays crucial roles in several cellular processes. NAD can be synthesized de novo starting with tryptophan, or from salvage pathways starting with NAD precursors like nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), referred to as niacin/B3 vitamins, arising from dietary supply or from cellular NAD catabolism. Given the interconversion between its oxidized (NAD+ ) and reduced form (NADH), NAD participates in a wide range of reactions: regulation of cellular redox status, energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, NAD acts as a signalling molecule, being a cosubstrate for several enzymes such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs) and some ectoenzymes like CD38, regulating critical biological processes like gene expression, DNA repair, calcium signalling and circadian rhythms. Given the large number of mitochondria present in cardiac tissue, the heart has the highest NAD levels and is one of the most metabolically demanding organs. In several models of heart failure, myocardial NAD levels are depressed and this depression is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic remodelling and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that regulating NAD homeostasis by NAD precursor supplementation has therapeutic efficiency in improving myocardial bioenergetics and function. This review provides an overview of the latest understanding of the different NAD biosynthesis pathways, as well as its role as a signalling molecule particularly in cardiac tissue. We highlight the significance of preserving NAD equilibrium in various models of heart diseases and shed light on the potential pharmacological interventions aiming to use NAD boosters as therapeutic agents.","Tannous, Cynthia; Booz, George W; Altara, Raffaele; Muhieddine, Dina H; Mericskay, Mathias; Refaat, Marwan M; Zouein, Fouad A",Acta Physiol (Oxf),,406

However, this is not taking into account memory (correlation) effects and discrete interactions that have been identified as relevant in social, transportation, and disease dynamics. We introduce a novel framework to model (non-)Markovian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) stochastic processes that are evolving either in continuous or discrete time on networks. We apply our simulation framework to study hybrid SIR processes that describe infections as discrete-time Markovian and recovery events as continuous-time non-Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of cell-cycle times. Our results suggest that the effective-spreading-rate description of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general non-Markovian disease dynamics. Providing a unifying description of general Markovian and non-Markovian disease outbreaks, we instead show that the mean transmissibility produces the same phase diagrams independent of the underlying inter-event-time distributions.","Bottcher, Lucas; Antulov-Fantulin, Nino",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11765v1.pdf,406
442615,"COVID-19, anorexia nervosa and obese patients with an eating disorder - some considerations for practitioners and researchers",2021,"BACKGROUND: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. METHODS: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.","de Souza, Fernanda Sumika Hojo; Hojo-Souza, Natália Satchiko; Batista, Ben Dêivide de Oliveira; da Silva, Cristiano Maciel; Guidoni, Daniel Ludovico",PLoS One,,406

Even people who would usually trust vaccines and experts now prefer to wait for more information. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Slovenia in December 2020 to find out the attitudes of the population regarding COVID-19 vaccination and the factors that affect these attitudes. Based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from COVID-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. Nurses and technicians were less likely to get vaccinated. In answers to an open question, sceptics were split into those doubting the quality due to the rapid development of the vaccine and those that reported personal experiences with side effects of prior vaccinations. Although the Slovenian population is diverse in its attitudes towards vaccination, the results are comparable to those found in other countries. However, there are potential limitations to the generalizability of the findings that should be addressed in future studies.","Petravic, Luka; Arh, Rok; Gabrovec, Tina; Jazbec, Lucija; Rupcic, Nika; Staresinic, Nina; Zorman, Lea; Pretnar, Ajda; Srakar, Andrej; Zwitter, Matjaz; Slavec, Ana",,,406

The rapid and extensive use of this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, while benefiting the public well-being by providing information about people's mobility and movements to control the spread of the virus, raised several ethical concerns for the post-COVID-19 era. To investigate these concerns for the post-pandemic situation and provide direction for future events, we analyzed the current ethical frameworks, research, and case studies about the ethical usage of tracing app technology. The results suggest there are seven essential ethical considerations, namely privacy, security, acceptability, government surveillance, transparency, justice, and voluntariness in the ethical use of contact tracing technology. In this paper, we explain and discuss these considerations and how they are needed for the ethical usage of this technology. The findings also highlight the importance of developing integrated guidelines and frameworks for implementation of such technology in the post-COVID-19 world.","Afroogh, Saleh; Esmalian, Amir; Mostafavi, Ali; Akbari, Ali; Rasoulkhani, Kambiz; Esmaeili, Shahriar; Hajiramezanali, Ehsan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12673v3.pdf,406

The findings strongly support the hypothesis that smoking may have a protective effect against HP. However, no likely putative immunological mechanism has been postulated for this. This may be due to a reluctance to fund studies investigating a possible protective role of smoking. Smoking has adverse effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and is a category 1 IARC carcinogen. Suggesting that smoking may have positive health effects is a provocative concept. As being an active smoker may protect against SARS-CoV-2, it would be useful to better understand the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2. However, it is difficult to carry out in vitro or in vivo experiments for non-specialized teams. In contrast, in vitro and in vivo experiments with fungi or bacteria involved in farmer's lung are accessible to all research teams. We chose to highlight the most obvious similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and farmer's lung but there are probably others, especially concerning the hyperactive immune response described as 'cytokine storm'. The lack of knowledge about the mode of action of smoking in farmer's lung disease limits comparisons with SARS-CoV-2 and more research is required.","Bellanger, A.

445689,Validation of the professional good care scale in nursing homes (GCS-NH),2021,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) is a global pandemic that started in China in 2019 and has negatively affected all economic sectors of the world, including agriculture. However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector.","Pirasteh-Anosheh, Hadi; Parnian, Amir; Spasiano, Danilo; Race, Marco; Ashraf, Muhammad",Environ Res,,406

How SARS-CoV2 affects the mothers, the neonates and the placental pathology remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of maternal SARS-CoV2 infection on the neonates and placental pathology in comparison to those from the normal pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal, neonatal and placental pathology data were collected from medical records between March and August 2020 from New York Presbyterian- Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. The data from a total 142 neonates and 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers were compared with those from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers. RESULTS: There were 142 SARS-CoV2 positive mothers within the study group, and 43 (36%) of them showed various degrees of COVID19 related clinical symptoms including fever (13.8%), cough (5.7%), loss of taste/smell (anosmia)(5.6%), shortness of breath (2.4%), muscle ache (2.4%), headache (1.6%) and pneumonia (0.8%). A total 142 neonates were born to the SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, and only 1 neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV2 in the first 24 h. Two additional neonates were initially tested negative in first 24 h, and later tested positive on day 7 and the 1 month visit, and all these neonates were asymptomatic and had no sequelae. There was no increase of pre-term labor and delivery or NICU admissions from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Examination of 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers and 121 placentas from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers revealed no increase of placental pathologic features. There were more vaginal deliveries and more meconium stain of fetal membranes from the SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Previous reports of more maternal vascular malperfusion and fetal vascular malperfusion were not demonstrated in our current data. CONCLUSION: Although SARS-CoV2 is a significant risk to the pregnant women (mothers) and general population, there is no increased risk for neonates. Vertical transmission is rare, and perinatal transmission can also occur. There is no increased frequency of placental abnormalities in both maternal and fetal circulation.","Zhang, Peilin; Heyman, Taryn; Greechan, Marisa; Dygulska, Beata; Al Sayyed, Farah; Narula, Pramod; Lederman, Sanford",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,406

Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the associations between demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and systemic factors, with COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, preparedness, well-being and digital health service acceptance. The average perception score on the seriousness of COVID-19 was 7.6 ± 2.4 (out of 10). 75.5% of participants were aware that COVID-19 carriers can be asymptomatic. Nearly all (&#8805; 90%) were aware of major prevention methods for COVID-19 (i.e. wearing of mask, social distancing). 66.2% felt prepared for the pandemic, and 86.8% felt confident with government's handling and measures. 78.4% felt their daily routine was impacted. 98.1% reported no prior experience in using digital health services, but 52.2% felt these services would be helpful to reduce non-essential contact. 77.8% were uncomfortable with artificial intelligence software interpreting their medical results. In multivariable analyses, Chinese participants felt less prepared, and more likely felt impacted by COVID-19. Older and lower income participants were less likely to use digital health services. In conclusion, we observed a high level of awareness and knowledge on COVID-19. However, acceptance towards digital health service was low.

Consensus of experts of the National society of evidence-based pharmacotherapy and the Russian society of the prevention of non-communicable diseases,2020,"Real-time detection of COVID-19 using radiological images has gained priority due to the increasing demand for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach for classifying chest X-ray images. Deep Learning (DL) methods fail to cover these aspects since training and fine-tuning the model's parameters consume much time. In this approach, the first phase comes to train a deep CNN working as a feature extractor, and the second phase comes to use Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for real-time detection. The main drawback of ELMs is to meet the need of a large number of hidden-layer nodes to gain a reliable and accurate detector in applying image processing since the detective performance remarkably depends on the setting of initial weights and biases. Therefore, this paper uses Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) to improve results and increase the reliability of the network while maintaining real-time capability. The designed detector is to be benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, and the results are verified by comparing it with the classic DCNN, Genetic Algorithm optimized ELM (GA-ELM), Cuckoo Search optimized ELM (CS-ELM), and Whale Optimization Algorithm optimized ELM (WOA-ELM). The proposed approach outperforms other comparative benchmarks with 98.25 % and 99.11 % as ultimate accuracy on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, respectively, and it led relative error to reduce as the amount of 1.75 % and 1.01 % as compared to a convolutional CNN. More importantly, the time needed for training deep ChOA-ELM is only 0.9474 milliseconds, and the overall testing time for 3100 images is 2.937s.","Hu, T.; Khishe, M.; Mohammadi, M.; Parvizi, G.

A brief overview",2020,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of pneumonia in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using chest radiographs to identify the characteristics of those with initially negative chest radiographs, who were positive for pneumonia on follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort data of 236 COVID-19 patients were reviewed. Chest radiography was performed on admission, with serial radiographs obtained until discharge. The 'positive conversion group' was defined as patients whose initial chest radiographs were negative but were positive for pneumonia during follow-up. Patients with initially positive chest radiographs were defined as the 'initial pneumonia group.' Patients with negative initial and follow-up chest radiographs were defined as the 'non-pneumonia group.' Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between groups, and predictors of positive conversion were investigated. RESULTS: Among 236 patients, 108 (45.8%) were in the non-pneumonia group, 69 (29.2%) were in the initial pneumonia group, and 59 (25%) were in the positive conversion group. The patients in the 'initial pneumonia group' and 'positive conversion group' were older, had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and lower absolute lymphocyte counts than those in the 'non-pneumonia group' (all p < 0.001). Among patients with negative initial chest radiographs, age &#8805; 45 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-8.75, p = 0.001), absolute lymphocyte count < 1500 cells/µL (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.03-4.89, p = 0.041), and CRP > 0.5 mg/dL (OR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.54-9.91, p = 0.004) were independent predictors for future development of pneumonia.

To understand the difficulties inherent to policymakers' sensemaking and learning processes during this unprecedented challenge, this article develops a perspective rooted in complexity theory.

452630,Behavioral changes and hygiene practices of older adults in Japan during the first wave of COVID-19 emergency,2021,"There are currently no antiviral therapies specific for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic disease COVID-19. To facilitate structure-based drug design, we conducted an x-ray crystallographic study of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2'-O-methyltransferase complex, which methylates Cap-0 viral mRNAs to improve viral protein translation and to avoid host immune detection. We determined the structures for nsp16-nsp10 heterodimers bound to the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), or the SAH analog sinefungin (SFG). We also solved structures for nsp16-nsp10 in complex with the methylated Cap-0 analog m7GpppA and either SAM or SAH. Comparative analyses between these structures and published structures for nsp16 from other betacoronaviruses revealed flexible loops in open and closed conformations at the m7GpppA-binding pocket. Bound sulfates in several of the structures suggested the location of the ribonucleic acid backbone phosphates in the ribonucleotide-binding groove. Additional nucleotide-binding sites were found on the face of the protein opposite the active site. These various sites and the conserved dimer interface could be exploited for the development of antiviral inhibitors.","Rosas-Lemus, Monica; Minasov, George; Shuvalova, Ludmilla; Inniss, Nicole L; Kiryukhina, Olga; Brunzelle, Joseph; Satchell, Karla J F",Sci. signal,,406

453934,Quality of life and occupational performance of children with cancer in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rehabilitation,2021,"Governments face difficulties in policy making in many areas such as health, food safety, and large-scale projects where public perceptions can be misplaced. For example, the adoption of the MMR vaccine has been opposed due to the publicity indicating an erroneous link between the vaccine and autism. This research proposes the “Parallel Evolution and Response Decision Framework for Public Sentiments” as a real-time decision-making method to simulate and control the public sentiment evolution mechanisms. This framework is based on the theories of Parallel Control and Management (PCM) and System Dynamics (SD) and includes four iterative steps: namely, SD modelling, simulating, optimizing, and controlling. A concrete case of an anti-nuclear mass incident that sparked public sentiment in China is introduced as a study sample to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results indicate the effects by adjusting the key control variables of response strategies. These variables include response time, response capacity, and transparency of the government regarding public sentiment. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method will be analyzed to determine how it can be used by policy makers in predicting public opinion and offering effective response strategies.","Xie, Tian; Wei, Yao-yao; Chen, Wei-fan; Huang, Hai-nan",Eur J Oper Res,,406
453935,Quality of life and occupational performance of children with cancer in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rehabilitation,2021,"The ongoing COVID19 pandemic has created havoc all over the world. Millions of lives have been gone and thousands are vulnerable. It has also affected the world economy due to lockdown. So, there is a need to develop a time-series forecasting model for predicting future cases so that necessary precautions can be taken. The aim is to help in coping up with the situation without affecting lifestyle any further. For forecasting, this paper has considered four models: exponential smoothing, ARIMA and SARIMA models, and identifies the suitability of the model for prediction purposes. Also, to incorporate the impact of festive seasons in India to measure the fluctuations in the new cases, SARIMAX model is used. The spread case data of the pandemic collected is of 47 weeks, from 30th January 2020 to 23 r d December 2020 for India. Data of the first 45 weeks (90%) is taken for training the model and that of the last 2 weeks (10%) is used for validation purposes. For evaluation purposes RMSE (root mean square error) and MAE (mean absolute error) are taken as parameters for model evaluation. The ARIMA (8,2,1) model performed best among all models based on the RMSE. Considering multiplicative trend and seasonality Triple Exponential Smoothing model gave the best result with respect to MAE. © 2021 IEEE.","Jain, A.; Sukhdeve, T.; Gadia, H.; Sahu, S.

454307,Nursing home oversight during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Identifying the optimal amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a formidable challenge when faced with a new contagion such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Unequivocally, there are dangers to health care workers (and by extension, their patients, colleagues, and communities) if not enough equipment is donned to safeguard them. And yet, there are also dangers to patients, colleagues, and the community if resources are overconsumed and result in hoarding, shortages, and inequitable distribution, all of which are occurring as the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues.Research to ascertain the precise PPE required to defend specifically against SARS-CoV-2 encompasses an area of active investigation that will likely remain unresolved for some time. While awaiting more definitive conclusions, we must look to past evidence to provide a reasonable basis on which protocols and policies might be refined. What follows is a narrative review of PPE efficacy and how existing evidence might apply to protecting health care workers against COVID-19. Findings are extrapolated from investigations in 4 general domains: early investigations into SARS-CoV-2, retrospective studies about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, prospective studies of influenza and other common respiratory viruses, and laboratory PPE studies.Available evidence suggests that contact and droplet precautions, in addition to eye protection and standard hygiene measures, should be adequate in the vast majority of clinical settings when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to guidelines promoting appropriate levels of PPE should safeguard practitioners while mitigating against resource overuse.","Sud, Sohil R",Hosp Pediatr,,406

All efforts have been marshalled towards testing different treatment approaches, obtaining clinical and epidemiological information, developing suitable diagnostic tests, and developing new vaccines. New ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based and viral vector-based vaccines have been developed and licensed under emergency use in many countries; however, there is a huge demand for vaccines, and it will take some time before a sufficient number of people are vaccinated to stop the circulation of the virus. Therefore, the proper diagnosis and identification of infected individuals are crucial for the isolation and treatment of these patients and tracing of their contacts. Many diagnostic tests and diag-nostic kits have been developed in a relatively short time. This review summarizes the principles of the available laboratory assays that are in use for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, antigens, or antibodies.","Alkharsah, Khaled R",Ger Med Sci,,406

Here, we analyzed results of RT-qPCR obtained for 3044 patients diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2-positive using four different molecular tests utilizing five RNA sequences. The analysis showed that patients' age inversely correlates with threshold cycle (Ct) values for RdRP gene (LightMix® Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene by Roche Diagnostics) and RdRP+S genes (MutaPLEX® Coronavirus RT-PCR kit by Immundiagnostic). At the same time, there was no correlation between age and Ct values for E, N, and ORF1ab genes. When patients were grouped by age, mean Ct values for RdRP gene in older patients were significantly lower compared with younger individuals. Collectively, our report indicates that older SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals exhibit higher viremia at diagnosis than younger patients, which may reflect impaired functioning of their immune response and predispose to more severe disease and worse prognosis.","Mikula-Pietrasik, Justyna; Ksiazek, Krzysztof",Exp Gerontol,,406

Rehabilitation interventions can help address the consequences of COVID-19, including medical, physical, cognitive, and psychological problems. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of rehabilitation following discharge from hospital for patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week exercise program on pulmonary fibrosis in patients recovering from COVID-19. A further aim will be to examine how Chinese herbal medicines as well as the gut microbiome and its metabolites regulate immune function and possibly autoimmune deficiency in the rehabilitation process. METHODS: In this triple-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial, we will recruit adult patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital in Hong Kong and are experiencing impaired lung function and pulmonary function. A total of 172 eligible patients will be randomized into four equal groups: (1) cardiorespiratory exercise plus Chinese herbal medicines group, (2) cardiorespiratory exercise only group, (3) Chinese herbal medicines only group, and (4) waiting list group (in which participants will receive Chinese herbal medicines after 24 weeks). These treatments will be administered for 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period. Primary outcomes include dyspnea, fatigue, lung function, pulmonary function, blood oxygen levels, immune function, blood coagulation, and related blood biochemistry. Measurements will be recorded prior to initiating the above treatments and repeated at the 13th and 25th weeks of the study. The primary analysis is aimed at comparing the outcomes between groups throughout the study period with an &#945; level of .05 (two-tailed). RESULTS: The trial has been approved by the university ethics committee following the Declaration of Helsinki (approval number: REC/19-20/0504) in 2020. The trial has been recruiting patients. The data collection will be completed in 24 months, from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022.

After course completion, 95% felt they better understood the work and lifestyle of the fields covered, 100% learned more about concepts of each field, and 74% agreed that the elective influenced the direction of their future careers to include some part of the fields emphasized. Although only a limited number of students enrolled in this course, these initial findings suggest that the MEE curriculum may have some utility in promoting awareness of and interest in these medical disciplines among students who attend the course. With continued student and faculty support, this course will likely be continued annually at our institution. We believe that certain aspects of this course may be useful in helping develop similar courses at other medical schools.","Babu, Gautam; Upchurch, Bradley D; Young, William H; Levine, Benjamin D",Wilderness Environ Med,,406

We set out to use remote sampling to ascertain vitamin D status and vitamin D supplementation in a cross-sectional study of people with MS across the UK. METHODS: People with MS and matched controls were recruited from across the UK. 1768 people with MS enrolled in the study; remote sampling kits were distributed to a subgroup. Dried blood spots (DBS) were used to assess serum 25(OH)D in people with MS and controls. RESULTS: 1768 MS participants completed the questionnaire; 388 MS participants and 309 controls provided biological samples. Serum 25(OH)D was higher in MS than controls (median 71nmol/L vs 49nmol/L). A higher proportion of MS participants than controls supplemented (72% vs 26%, p<0.001); people with MS supplemented at higher vD doses than controls (median 1600 vs 600 IU/day, p<0.001). People with MS who did not supplement had lower serum 25(OH)D levels than non-supplementing controls (median 38 nmol/L vs 44 nmol/L). Participants engaged well with remote sampling. CONCLUSIONS: The UK MS population have higher serum 25(OH)D than controls, mainly as a result of vitamin D supplementation. Remote sampling is a feasible way of carrying out large studies.","Vickaryous, Nicola; Jitlal, Mark; Jacobs, Benjamin Meir; Middleton, Rod; Chandran, Siddharthan; MacDougall, Niall John James; Giovannoni, Gavin; Dobson, Ruth",PLoS One,,406

Universities have become more digital in both the availability of e-resources and pervasive devices and how students communicate with lecturers and classmates. Learners adapted their study habits with a growing role of self-paced, internet-based strategies. Some flipped learning approaches have proven their efficacy under the remote-teaching physical constraints. This study aimed to appraise the outcomes from the implementation of various web-based, learning-aid tools on flipped teaching approaches in engineering modules. The open educational resources (OER) performed satisfactorily during the lockdown period in three universities from two countries with similar higher education models. Such resources encompassed classroom response systems and web-based exercise repositories, designed for diverse purposes such as autonomous learning, self-correction, flipped classroom, peer assessment, and guided study. The acquired experiences reveal that OER helped students to enhance their engagement, reach the deeper levels of the cone of learning, and widen their range of learning abilities. This procedure is easily attainable for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) courses and lifelong learning settings. Feedback from students, instructors’ perceptions, and learning outcomes show the suitability and effectiveness of the web-based learning assistant procedure presented here.","Mosquera Feijóo, Juan Carlos Suárez Fernando Chiyón Isabel Alberti Marcos García",Education Sciences,,406

Lessons from chess and the art of war,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has changed the approach to operating on breast cancer for the benefit of patients, staff and the general population. One approach involves the switch from operating under general to local anaesthetic. We assess whether diluational local anaesthetic is as effective as the current standard approach. METHODS: Postoperative pain was recorded in prospective, consecutive patients undergoing wide local excision under dilutional local anaesthetic (concentration < 1mg/ml). Pain scores were documented at 0, 30 and 60 minutes and compared to a control group consisting of combined general with local anaesthetic. RESULTS: Pain significantly increased in the control group during the postoperative recovery. This was not seen in the dilutional local anaesthetic group that was non-inferior to the standard approach at 0, 30 and 60 minutes. CONCLUSION: Dilutional local anaesthetic provides a safe and effective alternative approach to operating on breast cancer patients whilst avoiding risky general anaesthetic in a COVID-19 pandemic environment.","Batt, Jeremy; Cook, Nicola; Nadeem, Muhammad; Sahu, Ajay",J Perioper Pract,,406

In this study, nanoscale hydrophilic colloidal co-assemblies (80 ~ 150 nm) with excellent water solubility were prepared by hydrating RPs and CPs at pH 12 combined with neutralization. The solubility of RPs was boosted to over 90% (w/v), while most of the subunits in CPs became fully soluble. Structural analysis revealed that RPs and CPs non-covalently reacted, which triggered sheet-helix transitions and formed a compact core of RPs coated by a layer of CPs. Both proteins exposed significant hydrophilic motifs and buried hydrophobic moieties, contributing to the high water-dispersibility of their co-assemblies. Moreover, the co-assembled proteins acquired leveraged amino acid compositions between RPs and CPs. This study will enrich the processing technology of protein components, customizing their structural and nutritional characteristics.","Wang, Ren; Wang, Tingting; Feng, Wei; Wang, Qichu; Wang, Tao",Food Chem,,406

A behavioural economics perspective",2021,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China towards the end of 2019. The flue like condition spread rapidly. To contain the condition, several measures were put in place including but not limited to social or physical distancing, quarantine or isolation, lockdowns, travel restrictions, wearing of masks and personal protective clothing (PPE). Services moved to online/remote delivery where feasible. Those who fell ill were isolated but some required emergency hospital management, including supply of oxygen using respirators in emergency care units. When we made the call for this special issue in May 2020, the virus had killed over 350 000 people, infected over 5.5 million people in 215 countries with over 2.4 million recoveries. By the time of publication in December 2020, the virus had killed over 1,5 million people, infected over 68 million people in 215 countries with over 44 million recoveries. For Africa, infections stood at 2.2 million people with recorded deaths of 54,500. What could be the role of social work in particular, and social science in general during and after the pandemic, and in dealing with pandemics in future? Surely, the pandemic relates to developmental, indigenous, decolonial but also international and clinical social work as well as human rights, governance, culture, spirituality and other elements important for African social work. But we needed to find out more from African writers so a call for manuscripts for a special issue on COVID-19 was released. The response was overwhelming. Thirty-six abstracts were accepted. A decision was made to release two special issues, and this one is the first one. The major themes emerging from this special issue are the implications of COVID-19 on social policy, disability, teaching and learning, spirituality, occupational safety and mental health.

465048,COVID-19 pandemic moral injury in healthcare professionals: a systematic review,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is currently spreading worldwide and its propensity for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission makes it difficult to control. The control measures adopted in several countries aim at isolating individuals once diagnosed, limiting their social interactions and consequently their transmission probability. These interventions, which have a strong impact on the disease dynamics, can affect the inference of the epidemiological quantities. We first present a theoretical explanation of the effect caused by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the mean serial and generation intervals. Then, in a simulation study, we vary the assumed efficacy of control measures and quantify the effect on the mean and variance of realized generation and serial intervals. The simulation results show that the realized serial and generation intervals both depend on control measures and their values contract according to the efficacy of the intervention strategies. Interestingly, the mean serial interval differs from the mean generation interval. The deviation between these two values depends on two factors. First, the number of undiagnosed infectious individuals. Second, the relationship between infectiousness, symptom onset and timing of isolation. Similarly, the standard deviations of realized serial and generation intervals do not coincide, with the former shorter than the latter on average. The findings of this study are directly relevant to estimates performed for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effective reproduction number is often inferred using both daily incidence data and the generation interval. Failing to account for either contraction or mis-specification by using the serial interval could lead to biased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Consequently, this might affect the choices made by decision makers when deciding which control measures to apply based on the value of the quantity thereof.","Torneri, Andrea; Libin, Pieter; Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo; Faes, Christel; Wood, James G; Hens, Niel",PLoS Comput Biol,,406

465424,Reflecting on the challenges of sustaining emergency care research during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"It has been widely recognized that access to mental health treatment is imperative to address current and long-term stressors for children and parents during COVID-19. Internet-delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (iPCIT, previously referred to as I-PCIT) is a strong model for remote service delivery during social distancing restrictions due to its empirical base. However, this treatment modality was not widely implemented before COVID-19, likely due to barriers to providing telehealth services. This mixed methods study conducted a follow-up survey to gather therapist experiences (N = 223) in delivering iPCIT during COVID-19, including qualitative data on the benefits and challenges to delivering iPCIT. The vast majority of therapists (82%) indicated that they transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth in response to COVID-19. PCIT caseloads decreased slightly from the first survey to the COVID-19 follow-up survey, but the racial and ethnic composition of caseloads were not significantly different between the two surveys. Of the 183 therapists who transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth, 82% expressed interest in continuing to provide iPCIT following the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported benefits of iPCIT included decreased barriers to access and the ability to practice skills within the naturalistic home environment. Challenges to iPCIT were primarily issues with technology as well as other logistical barriers, which could limit engagement for some families. Findings from this study may be beneficial in improving future implementation of iPCIT during and post-COVID-19.","Barnett, Miya L; Sigal, Marika; Green Rosas, Yessica; Corcoran, Frederique; Rastogi, Medini; Jent, Jason F",,,406

In the present study, two spices, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum verum, been identified as excellent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) sources that play significant role in the regulation of cell signal transduction and developmental processes in plants as well as animals, being lucrative and potential targets for pharmacological modulation. PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70°C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Mn2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics. In addition to these properties, the thermostability of PTPases from two spices enhances their significance in industries with therapeutically vital products. Although the source of PTPases is culinary spices, further studies are required to establish the utilization of PTPases as nutraceuticals and in therapeutic formulations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: For a healthy lifestyle, awareness needs to be created by humankind towards food habits to minimize illnesses. Numerous studies have explored the consumption of nutraceutical products acts as a natural barrier and immune booster for various human ailments including SARS-COV-2. PTPases play important roles in regulating intracellular signaling and, ultimately, biological function along with their structural features. The importance of PTPases and their inhibitors has been implicated in various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Further investigations need to be undertaken to explore the therapeutic properties of PTPases in both in vivo and in vitro for their clinical significance.","Selvaraj, Kanagarethinam; Katare, Deepshikha Pande; Chand, Subhash; Chaudhary, Nidhee",J Food Biochem,,406

OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of mental health indicators and stressors for US adults by disability status during April and May 2020, shortly following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed data from Porter Novelli View 360 opt-in Internet panel survey conducted during the weeks of April 20th and May 18th, 2020 among 1004 English-speaking adults aged &#8805;18 years without and with disabilities (serious difficulty with hearing, vision, cognition, or mobility; any difficulty with self-care or independent living). Weighted logistic regression was used to test for significant differences between calculated prevalence estimates at the P &#8804; .05 level. RESULTS: One in four adults reported any disability. Adults with any disability were significantly more likely than adults without disability to report current depressive symptoms, frequent mental distress, suicidal ideation, and COVID-19-related initiated or increased substance use (all p values < .0001). Adults with disabilities also reported significantly higher levels of stressors, such as access to health care services (p < .0001), difficulty caring for their own (or another's) chronic condition (p < .0001), emotional or physical abuse from others (p < .001), and not having enough food (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The disproportionately high levels of poor mental health indicators among adults with disabilities as compared to those without highlight the importance of delivering timely mental health screening and treatment/intervention during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to persons with disabilities.","Okoro, Catherine A; Strine, Tara W; McKnight-Eily, Lela; Verlenden, Jorge; Hollis, NaTasha D",Disabil Health J,,406

Also how it can become a more inclusive partner in, and collaborative conduit of, knowledge-one capable of both informing intellects and transforming hearts. It needs to feel the pulse of the ""fierce urgency of now,"" and perhaps nothing can reveal this pulse more than the creative power of art-especially poetry.

I posit that, as praxis rooted in lived realities, poetry becomes experiential excavation and illumination; a practice of community, communion, and solidarity; a site and source of healing; and a space to create new narratives of health to forge new paths toward its promotion. I accordingly suggest a need to view and value poetry as a critical scholarship format to advance health promotion knowledge, discourse, and action toward a more humanized pursuit-and narrative-of health equity.","Petteway, Ryan J",Health Promot Pract,,406
471618,The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and their associations with quality of life among clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Aim To provide an international perspective on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) safety measures and discuss the medico-legal perspective of providing dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic.Data sources This paper is a narrative review. The authors are drawn from academic dentistry and academic law.COVID-19 safety measures in dental clinics Dental care professionals are considered to be at high risk of exposure and subsequent transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, it is of great importance that dental professions put in place measures to prevent cross infection from the virus. These measures include screening patients and spacing of appointments to allow fallow time. Within the clinic, there is a requirement for adequate ventilation (perhaps aided by air cleaners and disinfection air fogging devices) together with cleaning and use of alcohol gels to ensure hands are clean. With regards to dental treatment, the measures expected are also itemised, such as the use of virucidal antiseptic mouthwash, use of personal protective equipment, rubber dam and moving to non-aerosol generating procedures wherever possible.COVID-19 safety measures and the law The point is made that the need for the implementation of these precautions is not only necessary for cross-infection prevention but also for the avoidance of legal issues. The paper discusses the liability of a dentist, both criminal and civil, should a person contract COVID-19 as a result of attending for dental treatment. Although opinion varies across legal jurisdictions, the general consensus is that a practitioner would only be liable if they had been negligent. This is not just the case when guidelines are available, whether legally enforced or not, as the practitioner is required to deliver care in an up-to-date and evidence-based manner. There is a need to document persuasions taken to protect the practitioner from litigation.Conclusion Dentists should follow the scientific evidence to reduce as much as possible the risk of them contracting or spreading COVID-19. In addition, to avoid criminal or civil legal consequences, all procedures to avoid cross infection should be documented, as in not doing so, the practitioner will not be able to prove they were carried out.","Deery, Chris",Evid Based Dent,,406

472349,Prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression in students at a Greek university during COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Identifying isoform-specific inhibitors for closely related kinase family members remains a substantial challenge. The necessity for achieving this specificity is exemplified by the RSK family, downstream effectors of ERK1/2, which have divergent physiological effects. The natural product, SL0101, a flavonoid glycoside, binds specifically to RSK1/2 through a binding pocket generated by an extensive conformational rearrangement within the RSK N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD). In modelling experiments a single amino acid that is divergent in RSK3/4 most likely prevents the required conformational rearrangement necessary for SL0101 binding. Kinetic analysis of RSK2 association with SL0101 and its derivatives identified that regions outside of the NTKD contribute to stable inhibitor binding. An analogue with an n-propyl-carbamate at the 4"" position on the rhamnose moiety was identified that forms a highly stable inhibitor complex with RSK2 but not with RSK1. These results identify a SL0101 modification that will aid the identification of RSK2 specific inhibitors.","Wright, Eric B; Fukuda, Shinji; Li, Mingzong; Li, Yu; O039,; Doherty, George A; Lannigan, Deborah A",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,,406
472405,Planning and clinical role of acute medical home care services for COVID-19: consensus position statement by the Hospital-in-the-Home Society Australasia,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 can be disinfected using ultraviolet-C (UVC) light. For effective inactivation strategies, design and implementation, knowledge of UVC wavelength sensitivity, and disinfection rate of the relevant pathogen are required. This study aimed to determine the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC irradiation with different wavelengths. Specifically, the study determined dosage, inactivation levels, and wavelength sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA/WA1-2020) inactivation at peak wavelengths of 259, 268, 270, 275 and 280 nm was performed using a plaque assay method. A UVC dose of 3.1 mJ/cm2 using 259 and 268 nm arrays yielded log reduction values (LRV) of 2.32 and 2.44, respectively. With a dose of 5 mJ/cm2, arrays of peak wavelengths at 259 and 268 nm obtained similar inactivation levels (LRV 2.97 and 2.80 respectively). The arrays of longer wavelength (270, 275 and 280 nm), demonstrated lower performances ([≤]LRV 2.0) when applying an irradiation dose of 5 mJ/cm2. Additional study with the 268 nm array revealed that a dose of 6.25 mJ/cm2 is enough to obtain a LRV of 3. These results suggest that 259 and 268 nm are the most efficient wavelengths for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation compared to longer UVC wavelengths, allowing the calculation of disinfection systems efficacy.","Mariita, Richard M; Miller, Amy C Wilson; Randive, Rajul V; McKay, Lindsay G.

We aimed to examine the incidence of ACS after national lock-down. METHODS: The Danish government announced national lock-down on March 11, 2020 and first phase of reopening was announced on April 6. Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified first-time ACS admissions in (1) January 1 to May 7, 2017-2019, and (2) January 1, 2020 to May 6, 2020. Incidence rates of ACS admissions per week for the 2017 to 2019 period and the 2020 period were computed and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of ACS admissions were 8,204 (34.6% female, median age 68.3 years) and 2,577 (34.0% female, median age 68.5 years) for the 2017 to 2019- and 2020 period, respectively. No significant differences in IRRs were identified for weeks 1 to 9 (January 1 to March 4) for 2020 compared with week 1 to 9 for 2017 to 2019. In 2020, significant lower IRRs were identified for week 10 (March 5 to 11) IRRâ¯=â¯0.71 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.58 to 0.87), week 11 (12 to 18 March) IRRâ¯=â¯0.68 (0.56 to 0.84), and week 14 (April 2 to April 8) IRRâ¯=â¯0.79 (0.65 to 0.97). No significant differences in IRRs were identified for week 15 to 18 (April 9 to May 6). In subgroup analysis, we identified that the main result was driven by male patients, and patients &#8805;60 years. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic with an established national lock-down we identified a significant decline around 30% in the incidence of ACS admissions. Along with the reopening of society, ACS admissions were stabilized at levels equal to previous years.","Østergaard, Lauge; Butt, Jawad Haider; Kragholm, Kristian; Schou, Morten; Phelps, Matthew; Sørensen, Rikke; Lamberts, Morten; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Fosbøl, Emil L",Am Heart J,,406
473413,Transmission routes of COVID-19 in the dental practice,2020,"COVID-19, the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 is a major threat to the entire human race. It is reported that SARS-CoV2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS-CoV. To explore the reason of increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV2 compared to SARS-CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)at the beginning of membrane-fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS-CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting Molecular Recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS-corona virus. These analyses may help in epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

First, we designed and validated ten multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps among healthcare workers. Within one month of the online test and curriculum offering, 5533 staff had completed the test, with a completion rate of 84.97%. There were 2618 healthcare workers who answered the pre-test 100% correctly. Those who did not answer the pre-test 100% correctly took multiple tests after learning through the online teaching materials. Eventually, 5214 staff passed the test (pre-test or post-test with 100% correct answers). The result showed that all staff had a low correct rate for personal protective equipment (PPE) use recommendations. The Infection Control Center conducted training sessions for hospital staff on how to wear protective clothing. Information on the selection and use of PPE for infection prevention was provided, and participants were allowed time to practice and familiarize themselves with the correct way to wear PPE. Moreover, the Department of Education and Research continued updating the online learning materials based on the most important updated peer-reviewed published articles. The attending teaching physicians helped to search, translate, and take notes on articles in the local language (traditional Chinese) for other colleagues to read easily. We expect to increase learning opportunities for healthcare workers, even during uncertain times such as the current coronavirus pandemic through (1) the hospital-wide course announcements, (2) the continuous placement of test questions and learning files on the digital learning platform, (3) the placement of journal highlights in cloud folders, and (4) the use of the digital learning platform on mobile phones accessible outside the hospital.","Chiu, Ting-Fang; Chu, Dachen; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Chang, Mengju; Liu, Yining; Lee, Jason Jiunshiou",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,406
477476,Using Telehealth Groups to Combat Loneliness in Older Adults Through COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of healthcare morbidity, utilization, and expenditures nationally, and caring for late-stage CKD populations is complex. Improving health system efficiency could mitigate these outcomes and, in the COVID-19 era, reduce risks of viral exposure. OBJECTIVE: As part of a system-wide transformation to improve healthcare value among populations with high healthcare utilization and morbidity, UCLA Health evaluated a new patient-centered approach that we hypothesized would reduce inpatient utilization for CKD patients. DESIGN: For 18 months in 2015-2016 and 12 months in 2017, we conducted an interrupted time series regression analysis to evaluate the intervention's impact on inpatient utilization. We used internal electronic health records and claims data across six payers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1442 stage 4-5 CKD patients at a large academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Between October and December 2016, the organization implemented a Population Health Value CKD intervention for the CKD stages 4-5 population. A multispecialty leadership team risk stratified the population and identified improvement opportunities, redesigned multispecialty care coordination pathways across settings, and developed greater ambulatory infrastructure to support care needs. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included utilization of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient bed days, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. KEY RESULTS: During the 12 months following intervention implementation, the monthly estimated rate of decline for hospitalizations was 5.4% (95% CI: 3.4-7.4%), which was 3.4 percentage points faster than the 18-month pre-intervention decline of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-2.2%) per month (p = 0.004). Medicare CKD patients' monthly ED visit rate of decline was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.2-4.8%) after intervention, which was 2.6 percentage points faster than the pre-intervention decline of 0.4% (95% CI: - 0.8 to 1.6%) per month (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: By creating care pathways that link primary and specialty care teams across settings with increased ambulatory infrastructure, healthcare systems have potential to reduce inpatient healthcare utilization.","Gupta, R; Skootsky, S A; Kahn, K L; Chen, L; Abtin, F; Kee, S; Nicholas, S B; Vangala, S; Wilson, J",J. gen. intern. med,,406

Information regarding prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. RESULTS: As of July 5 th, 2020, 35,095 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 11,226 were confirmed (31.9%). Overall, 4,322 were nurses (38.5%), 3,324 physicians (29.6%), 131 dentists (1.16%) and 3,449 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.8%). After follow-up, 1,009 HCWs required hospitalization (9.00%), 203 developed severe outcomes (1.81%), and 93 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82%). Lethality was recorded in 226 (2.01%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 341 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.04%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcomes compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.","Antonio-Villa, Neftali Eduardo; Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen; Vargas-Vázquez, Arsenio; Fermín-Martínez, Carlos A; Márquez-Salinas, Alejandro; Bahena-López, Jessica Paola",Clin. infect. dis,,406

China, and subsequently, across the world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been asked by the public is""Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?"". While different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases, the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands. On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best medical outcome.","Yi, Grace; He, Wenqing; Lin, Dennis Kon-Jin; Yu, Chun-Ming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01252v1.pdf,406
488001,COVID-19 and Long-Term Care Policy for Older People in Japan,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.","Ho, Hui Ching; Hughes, Thomas; Bozlu, Murat; Kadioglu, Ates; Somani, Bhaskar K",Turk J Urol,,406
488079,Gynecology and women's health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Patient safety in surgery and prevention,2020,"AIMS: The minimally invasive procedures used in the diagnostic workup of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often provide poor yields of pathological material suitable for molecular analyses. Not infrequently, the DNA yield from small biopsies/cytological samples is insufficient for the assessment of genomic biomarkers that inform personalised therapies. The Idylla EGFR mutation test (IEMT) has been specifically designed to process formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections without requiring preliminary DNA extraction.This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IEMT when used to analyse archival histopathology material. More specifically, our objective was to establish whether or not different staining procedures could affect assay performance. METHODS: Twenty NSCLC samples were selected accordingly to EGFR mutational status. To mimic archived stained material, sections were subjected to H&E staining, fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses or immunodetection by immunohistochemistry before being processed for IEMT. RESULTS: Parallel assessment of EGFR mutational status by IEMT on stained sections and next-generation sequencing on DNA yielded a concordant result in 50 out of 60 tests (83.3%). The discoloration of H&E of the archived sample was found to be the optimal procedure to highlight all the actionable alterations of EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: IEMT can provide remarkable diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of EGFR mutational status also when the only source of pathological material available for molecular analyses is represented by H&E stained sections. Ad hoc supervision by a qualified molecular biologist is in any case recommended.","Ercolani, Cristiana; Di Benedetto, Anna; Bonomo, Claudia; Visca, Paolo; Palange, Aldo; Assisi, Daniela; Forcella, Daniele; Terrenato, Irene; Pescarmona, Edoardo; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Cecere, Fabiana Letizia; Cappuzzo, Federico; Buglioni, Simonetta",J. clin. pathol,,406

489201,Low-Income and Communities of Color at Higher Risk of Serious Illness If Infected with Coronavirus,2020,"Knowledge management tools that assist in systematic review and exploration of scientific knowledge generally are of obvious potential importance in evidence based medicine in general, but also to the design of therapeutics based on the protein subsequences and fold motifs of virus proteins as considered here. Rapid access to bundles (clusters) of related elements of knowledge gathered from diverse sources on the Internet and from growing knowledge repositories seem particularly helpful when exploring less obvious therapeutic targets in viruses (for which knowledge new to the researcher is important), and when using the following concept. Subsequences of amino acid residue sequences of proteins that are conserved across strains and species are (a) more likely to be important targets and (b) less likely to exhibit escape mutations that would make them resistant to vaccines and therapeutic agents. However, the terms ""conserved"" and even ""highly conserved"" used by authors are matters of degree, depending on how distant from SARS-CoV-2 they wished to go in comparing other sequences. The binding site to the human ACE2 protein as virus receptor and human antibody CR3022 binding site on the spike glycoprotein are rather variable by the criteria used in the present and preceding studies. To look for more strongly conserved targets, open reading frames of SARS-CoV-2 were examined for extremely highly conserved regions, meaning recognizable across many viruses and organisms. Most prominent is a motif found in SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3). It relates to a fold called type called the macro domain and has remarkably wide distribution across organisms including humans with significant homologies involving three especially conserved subsequences (a) VVVNAANVYLKHGGGVAGALNK, (b) LHVVGPNVNKG, and (c) PLLSAGIFG. Careful study of the variations of these and of the more variable sequences between and around them might provide a finer ""scalpel"" to ensure inhibition of a vital function of the virus without impairing the functions of related host macro domains.","Robson, B",Comput Biol Med,,406

In times of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, patients underwent 6MWTs wearing a surgical mask in ambulatory care. We investigated the impact of wearing a mask on 6-minute walk distances (6MWDs). METHOD: 6MWDs of 64 patients with end-stage lung diseases wearing an oronasal surgical mask were retrospectively compared to previously investigated 6MWDs of the same cohort, in a pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, without wearing a mask. Four patients were excluded due to a primary vascular disease, 29 patients due to clinically unstable pulmonary functions, and 1 patient due to a psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: The median age of the patients included was 55 (46-58) years; 15 (48%) were male. Ten (32.2%) were on the Eurotransplant lung transplant waiting list with a median LAS of 34.3 (31.9-36.2). Twenty (64.5%) patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, 7 (22.6%) had interstitial lung diseases, and 4 (12.9%) had other end-stage lung diseases. The mean 6MWD without versus with wearing a mask was 306.9 (101.9) versus 305.7 (103.8) m, with a mean difference of -1.19 m (95% confidence interval -13.4 to 11.03). The observed difference is statistically equivalent to zero (p < 0.001). No significant differences in 6MWDs were observed between the clinical groups.

490334,Correction,2021,"ABSTRACT: Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to contribute significantly to increased postoperative complications and mortality after emergency surgical procedures. Additionally, the fear of COVID-19 contagion delays the consultation of patients, resulting in the deterioration of their acute diseases by the time of consultation. In the specific case of urgent digestive surgery patients, both factors significantly worsen the postoperative course and prognosis. Main working hypothesis: infection by COVID-19 increases postoperative 30-day-mortality for any cause in patients submitted to emergency/urgent general or gastrointestinal surgery. Likewise, hospital collapse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic increased 30-day-mortality for any cause. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30-days-after-surgery. Secondary objectives are: to estimate the cumulative incidence of postoperative complications and to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for COVID-19-infected patients.A multicenter, observational retrospective cohort study (COVID-CIR-study) will be carried out in consecutive patients operated on for urgent digestive pathology. Two cohorts will be defined: the ""pandemic"" cohort, which will include all patients (classified as COVID-19-positive or -negative) operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2020; and the ""control"" cohort, which will include all patients operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2019. Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics, clinical and analytical parameters, scores on the usual prognostic scales for quality management in a General Surgery service (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and LUCENTUM scores), prognostic factors applicable to all patients, specific prognostic factors for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, postoperative morbidity and mortality (at 30 and 90 postoperative days). The main objective is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30âdays after surgery. As secondary objectives, to estimate the cumulative incidence of postoperative complications and to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.The protocol (version1.0, April 20th 2020) was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Ethic-and-Clinical-Investigation-Committee, code PR169/20, date 05/05/20).

One approach focuses on designing a novel variant of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that binds more tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and diverts it from human cells. Here we formulate a novel protein design framework as a reinforcement learning problem. We generate new designs efficiently through the combination of a fast, biologically-grounded reward function and sequential action-space formulation. The use of Policy Gradients reduces the compute budget needed to reach consistent, high-quality designs by at least an order of magnitude compared to standard methods. Complexes designed by this method have been validated by molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their increased stability. This suggests that combining leading protein design methods with modern deep reinforcement learning is a viable path for discovering a Covid-19 cure and may accelerate design of peptide-based therapeutics for other diseases.","Skwark, Marcin J.; Carranza, Nicol'as L'opez; Pierrot, Thomas; Phillips, Joe; Said, Slim; Laterre, Alexandre; Kerkeni, Amine; cSahin, Uugur; Beguir, Karim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01736v1.pdf,406

The disease called COVID-19 threatens health and life in patients with comorbid disease, especially in patients with kidney failure. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical findings, laboratory parameters, and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in end-stage renal patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. METHODS: We included the hemodialysis patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 disease and received inpatient treatment between 11 Match 2020 and 24 April 2020 in hospital. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, clinical course, laboratory parameters, and treatments were recorded. FINDINGS: The study included 25 hemodialysis patients; 15 (60%) were female. The mean age was 60.5 ± 15 years. All patients had chest computed tomography findings compatible with COVID-19 disease. The findings were bilateral in 88% of patients. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test was positive in 48% of the patients. The most common symptoms were dyspnea (56%) and fever (52%). The most common comorbid disease was hypertension (76%). Leukocytosis in 12% of the patients while 72% had lymphopenia. All patients had a high C-reactive protein value. 64% of patients required oxygen support and 32% intensive care. 28% developed a secondary infection. 76% (19/25) of the patients has been discharged with cure and 20% (5/25) died. The inpatient follow-up of a patient (4%) continues. Secondary infection development was significantly associated with oxygen demand (P = 0.027) and need for intensive care (P = 0.001). DISCUSSION: The associated clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were similar in hemodialysis patients to those of patients without renal disease. However, it caused pneumonia in all hemodialysis patients. It was associated with a more severe disease and worse prognosis with a mortality rate of 20%. Our study suggests that COVID-19 disease has a significantly more severe course and worse prognosis in hemodialysis patients.","Aydin Bahat, Kubra; Parmaksiz, Ergun; Sert, Serap",Hemodial. int,,406

Data consists of 97 stories that were collected during the peak of COVID-19 in April 2020 using the story completion method. The stories were thematically analysed. Most of the participants were university-educated women. The themes demonstrate the power of neoliberal discourses in framing parenting. Parenting during a pandemic, especially mothering, is constructed as an overwhelming project that requires detailed organization and management. There is also resistance to neoliberal governmentality through redefining successful parenthood. Furthermore, the gendered nature of domestic work is questioned, especially the traditional, inactive father who prioritizes his own needs only to fail comically in the domestic sphere.

496385,The proportion and associated factors of anxiety in Chinese adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The bending fracture behaviors of long bone have gained great attention due to the high bending fracture risk during traffic accidents, etc. For evaluating bone bending behavior, most of the previous studies use an impactor in 3-pints bending experiments while the impactor rigidity was never considered. In this work, using the porcine long bones, the 3-point bending tests were conducted to explore the bone fracture behaviors under the rigid impactor. The bone fracture dynamic process was recorded by high-speed photography and the fracture surface profile was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the CT scanning, their cross-section properties were calculated by a homemade MATLAB script for correlating with their strengths. Also, a subject-specific finite element (FE) model was developed to identify the influence on simulation. Findings led to conclusions as follows: 1) The tension fracture came with fracture path deflection, which was caused by the bone indentation induced mesoscale crack-opening. Due to this damage before the whole bone fracture, a bone fracture moment correction was defined to compensate experimental data. 2) The plastic indentation caused the impact force fluctuation. 3) The bone failure moment is higher correlated with the inertial moment of the bone cross-section than the traditional cross-section area. 4) In the subject-specific simulation, the indentation caused compression fracture and a much lower failure force. To reject the element erosion on impact location during only validation was verified as a good option to solve this issue.","Du, Xianping; Jiang, Binhui; Zhang, Guanjun; Chou, Clifford; Bai, Zhonghao",J. biomech. eng,,406

We (i)assessed patient perceptions on quality of care by tele-survey(cohort 1) and written questionnaire(cohort 2) and (ii)analyzed trends in elective and non-elective admissions prior to (12/2019-02/2020) and during (03/2020-05/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. Methods: Two-hundred seventy-nine outpatients were recruited into cohort 1 and 138 patients into cohort 2. All admissions from 12/2019 to 05/2020 to the Division of Gastroenterology/Hepatology at the Vienna General Hospital were analyzed. Results: Thirty-two point six percent (n=91/279) of cohort 1 and 72.5%(n=95/131) of cohort 2 had tele-medical contact, while 59.5%(n=166/279)and 68.2%(n=90/132) had face-to-face visits. 24.1%(n=32/133) needed acute medical help during healthcare restrictions, however, 57.3%(n=51/89) reported that contacting their physician during COVID-19 was difficult or impossible. Patient-reported satisfaction with treatment decreased significantly during restrictions in cohort 1 (visual analog scale[VAS] 0-10:9.0±1.6 to8.6±2.2;p<0.001) and non-significantly in cohort 2 (VAS0-10:8.9±1.6 to8.7±2.1;p=0.182).Despite fewer hospital admissions during COVID-19, the proportion of non-elective admissions (+6.3%) and ICU-admissions (+6.7%) increased. Cirrhotic patients with non-elective admissions during COVID-19 had significantly higher MELD (25.5[14.2]vs.17.0[IQR:8.8]; p=0.003) and &#916;MELD(difference to last MELD;3.9±6.3vs.8.7±6.4;p=0.008), required immediate intensive care more frequently (26.7%vs.5.6%;p=0.034) and had significantly increased 30-day liver-related mortality (30.0%vs.8.3%;p=0.028). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacts on quality of liver care as evident from decreased patient satisfaction, hospitalization of sicker ACLD patients and increased liver-related mortality. Strategies for improved tele-medical liver care and preemptive treatment of cirrhosis-related complications are needed to counteract the COVID-19-associated restrictions of in-hospital care.","Hartl, Lukas; Semmler, Georg; Hofer, Benedikt Silvester; Schirwani, Nawa; Jachs, Mathias; Simbrunner, Benedikt; Bauer, David Josef Maria; Binter, Teresa; Pomej, Katharina; Pinter, Matthias; Trauner, Michael; Mandorfer, Mattias; Reiberger, Thomas; Scheiner, Bernhard",,,406

498130,Utility and risk of dermatologic medications during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: As of March 18, 2020, 13â415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province-the epicentre of the outbreak-had been reported. Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible-infectious-recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave. FINDINGS: In all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82-1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73-6·09). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt >1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.

These policies ranged from closing most businesses to more controversial proposals, such as postponing primary elections. In this research note, we examine the role scientific knowledge and gender played in citizen perceptions of these virus containment policies both in the general population and among partisans. We find that while a gender gap persists in scientific knowledge, both in the general population and within the parties, women are generally more likely to use this knowledge to inform their policy views on necessary government action during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings shed light on how knowledge and gender intersect to drive support for government intervention during the time of a severe public health crisis in a partisan America.","Algara, Carlos; Fuller, Sam; Hare, Christopher",Polit.

The status updates are then sent to a destination node where the freshness of each status update is measured in terms of Age of Information (AoI). The status updates of each source and harvested energy packets are assumed to arrive at the transmitter according to independent Poisson processes, and the service time of each status update is assumed to be exponentially distributed. Unlike most of the existing queueing-theoretic analyses of AoI that focus on characterizing its average when the transmitter has a reliable energy source and is hence not powered by EH (referred henceforth as a non-EH transmitter), our analysis is focused on understanding the distributional properties of AoI in multi-source systems through the characterization of its moment generating function (MGF). In particular, we use the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) framework to derive closed-form expressions of the average/MGF of AoI under several queueing disciplines at the transmitter, including non-preemptive and source-agnostic/source-aware preemptive in service strategies. The generality of our results is demonstrated by recovering several existing results as special cases.","Abd-Elmagid, Mohamed A.; Dhillon, Harpreet S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07605v1.pdf,406

504539,Changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a systematic review,2021,"Downregulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters by proinflammatory mediators in hepatocytes, enterocytes and renal tubular epithelium is an established mechanism affecting pharmacokinetics. Emerging evidences indicate that vascular endothelial cell expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters may regulate pharmacokinetic pathways in heart to modulate local drug bioavailability and toxicity. However, whether inflammation regulates pharmacokinetic pathways in human cardiac vascular endothelial cells remains largely unknown. The lipid modified protein Wnt5A is emerging as a critical mediator of proinflammatory responses and disease severity in sepsis, hypertension and COVID-19. In the present study, we employed transcriptome profiling and gene ontology analyses to investigate the regulation of expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters by Wnt5A in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Our study shows for the first time that Wnt5A induces the gene expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes involved in phase I metabolism of a broad spectrum of drugs including chloroquine (the controversial drug for COVID-19) that is known to cause toxicity in myocardium. Further, the upregulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression is preserved even during inflammatory crosstalk between Wnt5A and the prototypic proinflammatory IL-1 beta in human coronary artery endothelial cells. These findings stimulate further studies to test the critical roles of vascular endothelial cell CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, and the potential of vascular-targeted therapy with CYP1A1/CYP1B1 inhibitors in modulating myocardial pharmacokinetics in Wnt5A-associated inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.","Skaria, T.; Bachli, E.; Schoedon, G.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,406

Most prior robotic trolley collection solutions only detect trolleys with 2D poses or are merely based on specific marks and lack the formal design of planning algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel mobile manipulation system with applications in luggage trolley collection. The proposed system integrates a compact hardware design and a progressive perception and planning framework, enabling the system to efficiently and robustly collect trolleys in dynamic and complex environments. For the perception, we first develop a 3D trolley detection method that combines object detection and keypoint estimation. Then, a docking process in a short distance is achieved with an accurate point cloud plane detection method and a novel manipulator design. On the planning side, we formulate the robot's motion planning under a nonlinear model predictive control framework with control barrier functions to improve obstacle avoidance capabilities while maintaining the target in the sensors' field of view at close distances. We demonstrate our design and framework by deploying the system on actual trolley collection tasks, and their effectiveness and robustness are experimentally validated.","Xiao, Anxing; Luan, Hao; Zhao, Ziqi; Hong, Yue; Zhao, Jieting; Wang, Jiankun; Meng, Max Q.-H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06648v1.pdf,406

Case report: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient's HScore [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Results: The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24â¯h. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48â¯h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11â¯days feeling fit and well. Conclusion: This case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question - is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.","Haigh, Kathryn; Syrimi, Zoe Joanna; Irvine, Sharon; Blanchard, Tom J; Pervaiz, Muhammad Sajid; Toth, Arpad G; Ratcliffe, Libuse",Clin Infect Pract,,406

509825,"The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Women: Perceived Stress, Social Support and Sleep Quality",2020,"BACKGROUND: In Lebanon, HIV is concentrated in both native and refugee communities of men who have sex with men (MSM). For over 10 years, the National AIDS Program (NAP) has offered HIV voluntary counselling and testing through a partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In 2018, implementation of HIV self-tests (HIVST) was introduced, and this self-care intervention has been further scaled up during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper (1) describes the effectiveness of implementing HIVST in Lebanon, and (2) discusses how the success of HIVST implementation has been reflected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The NAP conducted a series of workshops (July-November 2018) to introduce HIVST services for healthcare workers working at different NGOs. The workshops highlighted that HIVST would be distributed for free, that it would be confidential and voluntary, and that participants were encouraged to notify the NGOs of their results, which would be kept strictly confidential. NGOs collected data anonymously and confidentially from beneficiaries (age, consistency of condom use and HIV testing history), who were asked to call back with the results of their HIVST. At the NAP, data were combined, aggregated and analysed. RESULTS: In 2019, the NGOs distributed 1103/1380 (79.9%) HIVST kits to their beneficiaries. The NGOs collected feedback on 111 kit results, of which two were HIV-positive. Feedback about HIVST results from beneficiaries was low (111/1103) due to noncompliance of beneficiaries and the lack of human and financial resources in the NGOs. From January through May 2020, a total of 625/780 HIVST kits (80.1%) were distributed. This period was divided into pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. The follow-up with the beneficiaries during COVID-19 was much improved because of the absence of on-site activities, shifting more efforts towards HIVST (449/625). There have been no reports of social harm related to HIVST. CONCLUSION: HIVST implementation in Lebanon serves as an example of introducing a self-care intervention as part of a community-led effort. In order to maintain HIVST services at the same improved level, reorganization of care is needed within each NGO following the adaptation process due to COVID-19, along with continuous monitoring and evaluation of HIVST reported data.","Maatouk, Ismael; Nakib, Mostafa El; Assi, Moubadda; Farah, Patrick; Makso, Bertho; Nakib, Clara El; Rady, Alissar",Health Res Policy Syst,,406

In the last decade, increased interest has been shown in its usage via the oesophagus for sampling lesions inaccessible via the airways. We describe three cases in which we used this modality to biopsy lesions not visualised via conventional EBUS and which would be too risky to be attempted via a CT-guided biopsy with a high likelihood of complications. More focused education on using EBUS via the oesophagus for respiratory trainees could greatly improve overall clinical practice. It improves the diagnostic yield of lesions and prevents subsequent referral to gastrointestinal colleagues which may delay diagnosis especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as was the case in our patient cohort where services are already limited. EBUS, due to its smaller size, is less irritant to the upper airways and requires less sedation than endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scopes. It is also shorter than an EUS scope improving manoeuvrability. Each of our cases resulted in early histological diagnosis and subsequent appropriate treatment.","Quigley, David; Nadarajan, Parthiban; O Connell, Finbar",BMJ case reports,,406

We estimate serial interval (SI) and temporal reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 in Tunisia. METHODS: We collected data of investigations and contact tracing between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020 as well as illness onset data during the period February 29-May 5, 2020 from National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases of Tunisia. Maximum likelihood (ML) approach is used to estimate dynamics of Rt. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-one of infector-infectee pairs were involved, with 14.46% reported pre-symptomatic transmission. SI follows Gamma distribution with mean 5.30 days [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.66-5.95] and standard deviation 0.26 [95% CI 0.23-0.30]. Also, we estimated large changes in Rt in response to the combined lockdown interventions. The Rt moves from 3.18 [95% Credible Interval (CrI) 2.73-3.69] to 1.77 [95% CrI 1.49-2.08] with curfew prevention measure, and under the epidemic threshold (0.89 [95% CrI 0.84-0.94]) by national lockdown measure.

Neferine blocked host calcium channels, thus inhibiting Ca2+ -dependent membrane fusion and suppressing virus entry. This study provided experimental data to support that neferine may be a promising lead for pan-coronaviruses therapeutic drug development. This article is protected by copyright.

Although the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is predominantly centred on the respiratory system, some patients can develop an abnormal inflammatory reaction involving extrapulmonary tissues. The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion. Additional studies are required to learn about the mechanisms involved in the development of these manifestations and apply that knowledge to achieve early diagnosis and the most suitable therapy.","Ramos-Casals, Manuel; Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Mariette, Xavier",Nat Rev Rheumatol,,406

515959,The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Recently published graph neural networks (GNNs) show promising performance at social event detection tasks. However, most studies are oriented toward monolingual data in languages with abundant training samples. This has left the more common multilingual settings and lesser-spoken languages relatively unexplored. Thus, we present a GNN that incorporates cross-lingual word embeddings for detecting events in multilingual data streams. The first exploit is to make the GNN work with multilingual data. For this, we outline a construction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the node and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by merging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages. Non-English message representations are converted into English semantic space via the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then uniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken language needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation framework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads in English to make up for the paucity of annotated data. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the framework to be highly effective at detection in both multilingual data and in languages where training samples are scarce.","Ren, Jiaqian; Peng, Hao; Jiang, Lei; Wu, Jia; Tong, Yongxin; Wang, Lihong; Bai, Xu; Wang, Bo; Yang, Qiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03084v2.pdf,406

516840,The Role of Market Forces in U.S. Health Care,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for rapid high-throughput methods for sensitive and specific serological detection of infection with novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Multiplex serological testing can be particularly useful because it can simultaneously analyze antibodies to multiple antigens that optimizes pathogen coverage, and controls for variability in the organism and the individual host response. Here we describe a SARS-CoV-2 IgG 3-plex fluorescent microsphere-based assay that can detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-the spike (S) protein, spike angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (Nc). The assay was shown to have comparable performance to a SARS-CoV-2 reference assay for IgG in serum obtained at &#8805;21 days from symptom onset but had higher sensitivity with samples collected at &#8804;5 days from symptom onset. Further, using soluble ACE2 in a neutralization assay format, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD.","Angeloni, Stephen; Cameron, Andrew; Pecora, Nicole D; Dunbar, Sherry",J. vis. exp,,406

We aimed to estimate the unbiased CFR by age for Singapore and Japan and compare these estimates by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Age-specific CFRs for COVID-19 were estimated in real time, adjusting for the delay from illness onset to death. The SMR in Japan was estimated by using the age distribution of the Singapore population. Among cases aged 60-69 years and 70-79 years, the age-specific CFRs in Singapore were estimated as 1.84% (95% confidence interval: 0.46-4.72%) and 5.57% (1.41-13.97%), respectively, and those in Japan as 5.52% (4.55-6.62%) and 15.49% (13.81-17.27%), respectively. The SMR of COVID-19 in Japan, when compared with Singapore as the baseline, was estimated to be 1.46 (1.09-2.96). The overall CFR for Singapore is lower than that for Japan. It is possible that the circulating variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Singapore causes a milder clinical course of COVID-19 infection compared with other strains. If infection with a low-virulence SARS-CoV-2 variant provides protection against infection by high-virulence strains, the existence of such a strain is encouraging news for the many countries struggling to suppress this virus.","Kayano, Taishi; Nishiura, Hiroshi",,,406

We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. METHODS: Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control. RESULTS: Good correlation of Cq values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies. Low copies (<25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method. CONCLUSION: The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians.","Ishige, Takayuki; Murata, Shota; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Miyabe, Akiko; Kitamura, Kouichi; Kawasaki, Kenji; Nishimura, Motoi; Igari, Hidetoshi; Matsushita, Kazuyuki",Clin Chim Acta,,406

People with diabetes have been shown to be at higher risk of complications and death when exposed to pneumonia, influenza and other coronaviruses. Despite pandemic scale infection, there is currently limited understanding on the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on people with diabetes. AIMS: (1) To characterise the outcomes of COVID-19 for people with diabetes and (2) add value to current recommendations for healthcare providers and people with diabetes to encourage optimal management. METHODS: A search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE to March 2020 was undertaken, using search terms pertaining to diabetes, coronavirus and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We briefly reviewed the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of diabetes. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes are at greater risk of severe infection and death with COVID-19. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the daily lives of individuals living with diabetes through financial implications, food and medication scarcity and its burden on mental health. In Australia, delivery of medical care has been adapted to reduce the risk of transmission, with a particular emphasis on telehealth and remote monitoring.","Sacks, Lori J; Pham, Cecilia T; Fleming, Nicola; Neoh, Sandra L; Ekinci, Elif I",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,406

Design/methodology/approach Multistage sampling technique was used to select 385 respondents for the study. Descriptive statistics were used to present prospects of food banking. The probit regression model was used to analyse factors influencing food banking implementation whereas Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to analyse constraints in implementing food banking. Findings Addressing food poverty, helping to provide food aid to respondents in times of pandemics (such as Covid 19) and also helping in reducing food wastage were the most notable prospects of food banking. Age, household size, food bank awareness and food poverty had a significant positive influence on food banking implementation, whereas residential status and employment status had a significant negative influence on food banking implementation. The most pressing constraint in implementing food banking is funding and support with the mean rank of 3.03 whiles the least pressing constraint is improper documentation of potential beneficiaries with the mean rank of 6.72. Social implications This study provides empirical contributions and practical implications for implementing food banks in Ghana. Thus, the government of Ghana through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) can enact policies that can help prevent food losses and wastage. In this vain, food which could have been wasted would be redirected to food banks. This can serve as a tool for social intervention, poverty alleviation and prevention of hunger among the vulnerable in Ghana. Originality/value Despite several studies on food banking in affluent countries, food banking research in developing countries such as Ghana remains scanty. Thus, this paper makes significant contributions to the literature on prospects and constraints in implementing food banking and the factors influencing food banking implementation.","Mensah, N.

522909,Delay in Emergency Medical Service Transportation Responsiveness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Minimally Affected Region,2020,"Since its first discovery in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly worldwide. While African countries were relatively spared initially, the initial low incidence of COVID-19 cases was not sustained for long due to continuing travel links between China, Europe and Africa. In preparation, Zambia had applied a multisectoral national epidemic disease surveillance and response system resulting in the identification of the first case within 48 h of the individual entering the country by air travel from a trip to France. Contact tracing showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was contained within the patient's household, with no further spread to attending health care workers or community members. Phylogenomic analysis of the patient's SARS-CoV-2 strain showed that it belonged to lineage B.1.1., sharing the last common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from South Africa. At the African continental level, our analysis showed that B.1 and B.1.1 lineages appear to be predominant in Africa. Whole genome sequence analysis should be part of all surveillance and case detection activities in order to monitor the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages across Africa.","Simulundu, Edgar; Mupeta, Francis; Chanda-Kapata, Pascalina; Saasa, Ngonda; Changula, Katendi; Muleya, Walter; Chitanga, Simbarashe; Mwanza, Miniva; Simusika, Paul; Chambaro, Herman; Mubemba, Benjamin; Kajihara, Masahiro; Chanda, Duncan; Mulenga, Lloyd; Fwoloshi, Sombo; Shibemba, Aaron Lunda; Kapaya, Fred; Zulu, Paul; Musonda, Kunda; Monze, Mwaka; Sinyange, Nyambe; Mazaba, Mazyanga L; Kapin039,; a, Muzala; Chipimo, Peter J; Hamoonga, Raymond; Simwaba, Davie; Ngosa, William; Morales, Albertina N; Kayeyi, Nkomba; Tembo, John; Bates, Mathew; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Takada, Ayato; Nalubamba, King S; Malama, Kennedy; Mukonka, Victor; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kapata, Nathan",Int J Infect Dis,,406

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.","Andersen, Asger Lau; Hansen, Emil Toft; Johannesen, Niels; Sheridan, Adam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04630v1.pdf,406

For the general population, it refers to the quality of life, and for the athletes, is related to greater performance. In this study, a comparison was made between two different portable devices, MicroRPM (CareFusion, Kent, United Kingdom) and AirOFit PRO™ (AirOFit, Copenhagen, Denmark), assessing the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). Twenty-one male professional athletes were evaluated on a voluntary basis and randomly used the devices for RMS assessment, while all athletes underwent Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), pulmonary function tests and ergospirometry. All measurements of MIP and MEP were made with the same methodology and all participants after the efforts answered the question ""easy-operation device-information"" and dyspnea and/or respiratory fatigue during trials with the CR10 scale. Results showed statistical differences between VO(2max) and maximal respiratory strength both for AirOFit PRO™ (r=0.526, p=0.014) and in MicroPRM (r=0.567, p=0.007). The PSQI score showed statistical differences in % of predicted values in MEP with the AirOFit PRO™ device (r=0.478, p=0.028). Athletes reported that the AirOFit PRO™ device is easier in operation as a device and provides more information during trial comparisons to MicroPRM (p=0.001). Athletes reported that the AirOFit PRO™ device is easier in operation as a device and provides more information during the trial compared to MicroPRM.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study. Place & Duration of Study: Real Time PCR Diagnostic and Research Laboratory, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, from May to July 2020. METHODOLOGY A total of 94 blood specimens were collected from suspected COVID-19 patients. The antibody levels (IgG and IgM) were determined, using a COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM kit. RESULTS Out of a total 94 serum specimens, specimens were predominantly collected from males (70.2%, n=66) as compared to females (29.8%, n=28). Amongst six different age groups, the majority of the samples were found in the 31-45 years, 16-30 years, and 46-60 years groups, 42.6% (n=40), 23.4% (n=22) and 22.3% (n=21), respectively. Of the 94 suspected COVID-19 patients' serum specimens, IgG and IgM were detected in 29.8% (n=28) and 39.4% (n=37), specimens, respectively. The IgG antibodies were detected more in males (60.0%, n=18) than females (40.0%, n=12) samples. Similarly, IgM antibodies were also found more frequently in males (61.1%, n=22) as compared to females (38.9%, n=14). CONCLUSION Detection of antibodies in COVID-19 infected patients provides vital clinical information for clinicians and could be used for the identification of suspected cases. Moreover, males were more prone to disease compared to females, and the 31-45 years age group was also more affected.

After spreading around the world, a pandemic was declared by the WHO. Depending on the different involvement of the disease, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.","Borku Uysal, Betul; Ikitimur, Hande; Yavuzer, Serap; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Cengiz, Mahir",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563271/,406

What Do Older Adults Need To Know?,2020-03-01,"Patient: Female, 35-year-old Final Diagnosis: COVID-19 • rhabdomyolysis • transaminitis Symptoms: Cough • elevated liver enzymes • fever • myalgia Medication: — Clinical Procedure: — Specialty: General and Internal Medicine • Nephrology OBJECTIVE: Rare Disease BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyolysis is a skeletal muscle injury that has different etiologies and can be a manifestation of corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because it is a life-threatening condition, rapid diagnosis is necessary to prevent acute complications. Diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis are elevated serum creatine kinase, liver enzyme levels, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis can easily be missed in patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a female with rhabdomyolysis as a manifestation of acute COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old female was found to have rhabdomyolysis associated with COVID-19. Her creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels were significantly elevated. Ringer’s lactate infusion was administered at a controlled rate to treat the rhabdomyolysis along with boluses of normal saline, with close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and kidney function. The patient’s creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels peaked on Day 2 and then decreased. Her medical condition improved, and she was discharged on Day 4. CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the need to monitor the creatine kinase level of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Fluid management can be challenging in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 because of the risk of fluid overload and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Clinicians should be aware that a significant elevation in liver enzyme levels and myalgia can be the presenting features of rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19.","Alrubaye, Riyadh; Choudhary, Hasan",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801291/,406
593084,Technological interventions for loneliness and social isolation among older adults: a scoping review protocol,2021-08-07,"ADP-ribosylation is a protein modification responsible for biological processes such as DNA repair, RNA regulation, cell cycle and biomolecular condensate formation. Dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation is implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration and viral infection. We developed ADPriboDB (adpribodb.leunglab.org) to facilitate studies in uncovering insights into the mechanisms and biological significance of ADP-ribosylation. ADPriboDB 2.0 serves as a one-stop repository comprising 48 346 entries and 9097 ADP-ribosylated proteins, of which 6708 were newly identified since the original database release. In this updated version, we provide information regarding the sites of ADP-ribosylation in 32 946 entries. The wealth of information allows us to interrogate existing databases or newly available data. For example, we found that ADP-ribosylated substrates are significantly associated with the recently identified human protein interaction networks associated with SARS-CoV-2, which encodes a conserved protein domain called macrodomain that binds and removes ADP-ribosylation. In addition, we create a new interactive tool to visualize the local context of ADP-ribosylation, such as structural and functional features as well as other post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination). This information provides opportunities to explore the biology of ADP-ribosylation and generate new hypotheses for experimental testing.","Ayyappan, Vinay; Wat, Ricky; Barber, Calvin; Vivelo, Christina A; Gauch, Kathryn; Visanpattanasin, Pat; Cook, Garth; Sazeides, Christos; Leung, Anthony K L",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137182/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa941,406

However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related anxiety can interfere with nurses’ performance and reduce their self-efficacy. AIM: The primary aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment amongst nurses in Malawi. The secondary aim of the study was to determine reliability and validity of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale. SETTING: The study was conducted in Malawi. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that collected quantitative data from 102 nurses in Malawi online. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and receiver operating curve analysis. RESULTS: This study found that 25.5% (26) of respondents had COVID-19-related anxiety and 48% (49) functional impairment. There were significant differences in the numbers of respondents who had functional impairment in relation to workplace (Χ(2) = 8.7, p = 0.03), with many of those working in hospitals (58.6%, n = 34) having highest levels (mean = 20.6 ± 10.4). The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale proved to be an effective instrument (Sensitivity = 73.1%; Specificity = 60.5%; area under the curve = 0.73) for assessing COVID-19-related anxiety amongst nurses. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to screen nurses for COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment and provide them effective psychosocial interventions.

To begin addressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein interactions with both RNA and the host cell along with its dynamic behavior, we have specifically focused on the folded N-terminal domain (NTD) and its flanking regions using nuclear magnetic resonance solution studies. Studies performed here reveal a large repertoire of interactions, which includes a temperature-dependent self-association mediated by the disordered flanking regions that also serve as binding sites for host cell cyclophilin-A while nucleotide binding is largely mediated by the central NTD core. NMR studies that include relaxation experiments have revealed the complicated dynamic nature of this viral protein. Specifically, while much of the N-terminal core domain exhibits micro-millisecond motions, a central β-hairpin shows elevated inherent flexibility on the pico-nanosecond timescale and the serine/arginine-rich region of residues 176–209 undergoes multiple exchange phenomena. Collectively, these studies have begun to reveal the complexities of the nucleocapsid protein dynamics and its preferred interaction sites with its biological targets.","Redzic, Jasmina S.; Lee, Eunjeong; Born, Alexandra; Issaian, Aaron; Henen, Morkos A.; Nichols, Parker J.; Blue, Ashley; Hansen, Kirk C.; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Vögeli, Beat; Eisenmesser, Elan Zohar",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161778/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167108; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283621003326?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283621003326,406

By infecting transgenic lox-stop-lox reporter mice with a Cre-recombinase-expressing influenza B virus, we identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as a major viral cell target in the URT. These cells become infected, then eliminate the virus and survive in the host post-resolution of infection. OSN responses to infection are characterized by a strong induction of interferon-stimulated genes and more rapid clearance of viral protein relative to other cells in the epithelium. We speculate that this cell-type-specific response likely serves to protect the central nervous system from infection. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of evaluating antiviral responses across different cell types, even those within the same tissue, to more fully understand the mechanisms of viral disease.","Dumm, Rebekah E.; Wellford, Sebastian A.; Moseman, E.

The activation of Fcγ receptors usually leads to phagocytosis. Paradoxically, the ligation of monocyte or macrophage Fcγ receptors by IgG immune complexes, rather than aiding host defences, can suppress innate immunity, increase production of interleukin 10, and bias T-helper-1 (Th1) responses to Th2 responses, leading to increased infectious output by infected cells. This intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection modulates the severity of diseases as disparate as dengue haemorrhagic fever and leishmaniasis. Intrinsic ADE is distinct from extrinsic ADE, whereby complexes of infectious agents with non-neutralising antibodies lead to an increased number of infected cells. Intrinsic ADE might be involved in many protozoan, bacterial, and viral infections.

The response is from a K-12 educational environment perspective. Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s typology of different ethical approaches to learning analytics adds value to the special issue topic of shifting to digital as it provides different ways to view learning analytics as well as the type of approval(s) possibly needed for each view. K-12 educational institutions can utilize the manuscript as a starting place for review of their ethical oversights when analyzing student data as more schools are shifting to digital. A limitation of Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s manuscript in supporting the shift to digital is that the manuscript was published before the overwhelming shift to digital was mandated as a result of Covid-19. Future work related to the manuscript and with a focus on the K-12 educational environment could include K-12 education agencies deriving a K-12 specific typology from a review of ethical oversight protocols or analyzing the effects of the shift to digital in K-12 on the original typology. During the 2020 pandemic, K-12 schools in the United States moved to digital learning quickly and in large numbers. This move has resulted in a wealth of digital learning analytics available to be used in improving student learning outcomes. However, local education agencies must first make sure they have a clear framework for oversight of how digital learning analytics will be used. K-12 students are at risk of harm if local education agencies do not stop and carefully reflect on the potential risks to students resulting from decisions made as a result of using digital learning analytics.","Beerwinkle, Andrea L.",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09854-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281428/,406

Tocilizumab may provide clinical benefits for cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane published from March to October 2020 to evaluate optimal use and baseline criteria for administration of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Research involving patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated with tocilizumab and compared with the standard of care (SOC) was included in this study. We conducted a systematic review to find data about the risks and benefits of tocilizumab and outcomes from different baseline criteria for administration of tocilizumab as a treatment for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 26 studies, consisting of 23 retrospective studies, one prospective study, and two randomised controlled trials with 2112 patients enrolled in the tocilizumab group and 6160 patients in the SOC group, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the SOC, tocilizumab showed benefits for all-cause mortality events and a shorter time until death after first intervention but showed no difference in hospital length of stay. Upon subgroup analysis, tocilizumab showed fewer all-cause mortality events when CRP level ≥100 mg/L, P/F ratio 200-300 mmHg, and P/F ratio <200 mmHg. However, tocilizumab showed a longer length of stay when CRP <100 mg/L than the SOC. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that tocilizumab has a positive effect on all-cause mortality.

To characterize their viral and epidemiological properties in support of public health planning, we develop and apply a model-inference system to estimate the changes in transmissibility and immune escape for each variant, based on case and mortality data from the country where each variant emerged. Accounting for under-detection of infection, disease seasonality, concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions, and mass-vaccination, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3 - 54.6%) increase in transmissibility but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6 - 48.0%) increase in transmissibility and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6 - 85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3 - 65.3%) increase in transmissibility and 52.5% (95% CI: 0 - 75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could supplant B.1.1.7 dominance and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of B.1.351 and P.1, in addition to B.1.1.7, via continued preventive measures, prompt mass-vaccination of all populations, continued monitoring of vaccine efficacy, and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy.","Yang, W.; Shaman, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257476; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.19.21257476v1?rss=1,406

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-reported mental health parameters and the coping mechanisms of employees and students in a Saudi State University. METHODS: An online survey in both Arabic and English was launched targeting students, staff and faculty of King Saud University from May 11 to June 6, 2020, the peak of Saudi Arabia’s nationwide lockdown. A total of 1542 respondents (726 males and 816 females) aged 20-65 years old participated. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents claimed to have suffered from anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.2%) and insomnia (32.2%) during the lockdown. On average, 65.3% respondents agreed that family bond strengthened during lockdown. Those in the highest quartile of family bonding score (Q4) were 41% [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39-0.87), p<0.001] and 59% [OR 0.41 (CI 0.27-0.64), p<0.001] were less likely to be anxious and depressed, respectively, even after adjusting for covariates. This independent and significant inverse association was more apparent in females than males. Conclusion: Self-reported acute mental health disorders were common within the academic community during the COVID-19 lockdown. Strength of family bonding as a coping mechanism was instrumental in preserving mental well-being, especially in females.","Alfawaz, Hanan A; Wani, Kaiser; Aljumah, Abdulaziz A.; Aldisi, Dara; Ansari, Mohammed G.A.; Yakout, Sobhy M.; Sabico, Shaun; Al-Daghri, Nasser M.",J King Saud Univ Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288977/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S101836472030375X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S101836472030375X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2020.101262,406

Although Prone Positioning (PP) may improve oxygenation in COVID-19 non-intubated patients, the results on its clinical efficacy are controversial. The present study aims to prospectively investigate whether PP may reduce the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) in patients with COVID-19 receiving HFNO. Methods: All consecutive unselected adult patients with bilateral lung opacities on chest X-ray receiving HFNO after admission to a SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) were considered eligible. Patients who successfully passed an initial PP trial (success group) underwent PP for periods ≥ 2 h twice a day, while receiving HFNO. The study’s primary endpoint was the intubation rate during the stay in the RICU. Results: Ninety-three patients were included in the study. PP was feasible and safe in 50 (54%) patients. Sixteen (17.2%) patients received ETI and 27 (29%) escalated respiratory support, resulting in a mortality rate of 9/93 (9.7%). The length of hospital stay was 18 (6–75) days. In 41/50 (80%) of subjects who passed the trial and underwent PP, its use was associated with clinical benefit and survival without escalation of therapy. Conclusions: PP is feasible and safe in over 50% of COVID-19 patients receiving HFNO for hARF. Randomized trials are required to confirm that PP has the potential to reduce intubation rate.","Vianello, Andrea; Turrin, Martina; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Molena, Beatrice; Arcaro, Giovanna; Turato, Cristian; Braccioni, Fausto; Bertagna De Marchi, Leonardo; Lionello, Federico; Subotic, Pavle; Masiero, Stefano; Giraudo, Chiara; Navalesi, Paolo",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362185/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153404,406

Waste management have a massive impact on the environment and the economy. Every HD session produces above 1 kg of medical waste, which should be properly stored and destroyed. In particular in the pandemia time we should improve the dialysis unit budget as well as decrease CO(2) emission produced during the waste elimination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The checked the weight of different dialyzers used regularly in dialysis centers in Poland. The Kern CM 320-IN scale was used for the measurement. The measurement accuracy was 0.1 g. Also the filling volume of each dialyzer has been taken into consideration. RESULTS: The dialyzers were divided into four groups depending on the surface. 1,4m2 in group one, 1.5–1.6 m(2) in group two, 1.7–1.8 m(2) in group three and finally 2.0–2.2 m(2) in group four. FX class dialyzers were lightest in every group. The heaviest ones were Polyflux dialyzers. The difference between the lightest and heaviest dialyzers was about 95 g. The filling volume was lowest in FX dialyzers and the highest in Elisio dialyzers. The difference was 20 mL. CONCLUSIONS: The weight of different dialyzers available on the market differs. The decision-makers should take into account this fact as the additional quality feature. In extreme cases the weight difference reaches 95 g. In yearly perspective, the usage of the lighter dialysis set can cause the 17 million kg decrease of medical waste and significant savings.","Żebrowski, Paweł; Zawierucha, Jacek; Prystacki, Tomasz; Marcinkowski, Wojciech; Małyszko, Jolanta",Renal failure,https://doi.org/10.1080/0886022x.2020.1774900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530354/,406

METHODS: A global, volunteer consortium from 4 continents identified patients with ECGs obtained around the time of polymerase chain reaction–confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and age- and sex-matched controls from the same sites. Clinical characteristics, polymerase chain reaction results, and raw electrocardiographic data were collected. A convolutional neural network was trained using 26,153 ECGs (33.2% COVID positive), validated with 3826 ECGs (33.3% positive), and tested on 7870 ECGs not included in other sets (32.7% positive). Performance under different prevalence values was tested by adding control ECGs from a single high-volume site. RESULTS: The area under the curve for detection of acute COVID-19 infection in the test group was 0.767 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.778; sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 10%; positive predictive value, 37%; negative predictive value, 91%). To more accurately reflect a real-world population, 50,905 normal controls were added to adjust the COVID prevalence to approximately 5% (2657/58,555), resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780 (95% CI, 0.771 to 0.790) with a specificity of 12.1% and a negative predictive value of 99.2%. CONCLUSION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in electrocardiographic changes that permit the artificial intelligence–enhanced ECG to be used as a rapid screening test with a high negative predictive value (99.2%). This may permit the development of electrocardiography-based tools to rapidly screen individuals for pandemic control.","Attia, Zachi I.; Kapa, Suraj; Dugan, Jennifer; Pereira, Naveen; Noseworthy, Peter A.; Jimenez, Francisco Lopez; Cruz, Jessica; Carter, Rickey E.; DeSimone, Daniel C.; Signorino, John; Halamka, John; Chennaiah Gari, Nikhita R.; Madathala, Raja Sekhar; Platonov, Pyotr G.; Gul, Fahad; Janssens, Stefan P.; Narayan, Sanjiv; Upadhyay, Gaurav A.; Alenghat, Francis J.; Lahiri, Marc K.; Dujardin, Karl; Hermel, Melody; Dominic, Paari; Turk-Adawi, Karam; Asaad, Nidal; Svensson, Anneli; Fernandez-Aviles, Francisco; Esakof, Darryl D.; Bartunek, Jozef; Noheria, Amit; Sridhar, Arun R.; Lanza, Gaetano A.; Cohoon, Kevin; Padmanabhan, Deepak; Pardo Gutierrez, Jose Alberto; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Merlo, Marco; Zagari, Domenico; Rodriguez Escenaro, Brenda D.; Pahlajani, Dev B.; Loncar, Goran; Vukomanovic, Vladan; Jensen, Henrik K.; Farkouh, Michael E.; Luescher, Thomas F.; Su Ping, Carolyn Lam; Peters, Nicholas S.; Friedman, Paul A.",Mayo Clin Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.05.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619621004699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353468/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619621004699,406

In Japan, children between the ages of 6 and 18 were ordered to stay at home and observe social distancing for several months. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of quarantine due to COVID-19 on children belonging to different developmental stages in life. Data were collected from mothers of typically developing children aged between 6 and 18 years. The differences in psychological and behavioral changes following school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic were explored. A total of 535 children, including 145 students in lower grades of elementary school (6–9 years), 124 students in higher grades of elementary school (9–12 years), 132 students in junior high school (12–15 years), and 134 students in high school (15–18 years), were recruited. Children in lower grades of elementary school (lower grades group) gained significantly lower understanding about COVID-19 and the necessity of COVID-19 restrictions than children in the other groups. Moreover, they had more psychological problems: they easily cried and complained, were unable to keep calm, and were dependent on parents and family members. Changes in sleep patterns were more prevalent in junior and senior high school students. We concluded that mental health care should be provided based on the growth period of each child not only during school closure but also after school reopening.","Nakachi, Kiwamu; Kawabe, Kentaro; Hosokawa, Rie; Yoshino, Ayumi; Horiuchi, Fumie; Ueno, Shu-ichi",Psychiatry J,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5567732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476256/,406

RNA remnants purified from diagnostic nasopharyngeal specimens were used as the templates for RT-PCR-specific detection of SG E gene RNA. As controls, we also detected viral genomic RNA for the E gene and/or a human housekeeping gene (RNase P). We assessed the samples of 60 RT-PCR-positive cases with prolonged viral SARS-CoV-2 shedding (24 to 101 days) since the first diagnostic RT-PCR. SG viral RNA was detected in 12/60 (20%) of the persistent cases, 28 to 79 days after the onset of symptoms. The age range of the cases with prolonged viral shedding and the presence of SG RNA was quite wide (40 to 100 years), and the cases were equally distributed between males (42%) and females (58%). No case was HIV positive, although seven were immunosuppressed. According to the severities of the COVID-19 episodes, they were mild (40%), intermediate (20%), and severe (40%). In a percentage of persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases, the presence of actively replicating virus may be inferred, far beyond diagnosis. We should not assume a universal lack of infectiousness for COVID-19 cases with prolonged viral shedding.","Rodríguez-Grande, Cristina; Adán-Jiménez, Javier; Catalán, Pilar; Alcalá, Luis; Estévez, Agustín; Muñoz, Patricia; Pérez-Lago, Laura; García de Viedma, Darío",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02277-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239378/,406

Despite being a pan-3C protease inhibitor, rupintrivir activity is extremely weak against the homologous 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the crystal structures of rupintrivir were determined bound to enterovirus 68 (EV68) 3C protease and the 3C-like main protease (M(pro)) from SARS-CoV-2. While the EV68 3C protease–rupintrivir structure was similar to previously determined complexes with other picornavirus 3C proteases, rupintrivir bound in a unique conformation to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) splitting the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues. This bifurcation of the catalytic dyad may provide a novel approach for inhibiting cysteine proteases.","Lockbaum, Gordon J.; Henes, Mina; Lee, Jeong Min; Timm, Jennifer; Nalivaika, Ellen A.; Thompson, Paul R.; Kurt Yilmaz, Nese; Schiffer, Celia A.",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506130/,406

Comorbidities such as chronic degenerative diseases are frequently associated with complications in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory and procoagulant biomarkers in COVID-19 patients from a public hospital in Mexico. Blood was sampled within the first 48 h after admission in 119 confirmed COVID-19 patients that were classified in 3 groups according to oxygen demand, evolution and the severity of the disease as follows: 1) Non severe: nasal cannula or oxygen mask; 2) Severe: high flow nasal cannula and 3) Death: mechanical ventilation eventually leading to fatal outcome. Blood samples from 20 healthy donors were included as a Control Group. Analysis of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers including D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, PAI-1, P-selectin and VWF was performed in plasma.

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catapulted across the ever-evolving interface between humans and wild places relentlessly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) amongst humans and bringing immense suffering and death to the farthest reaches of our planet. What was immediately apparent was that the virus responsible for this outbreak originated in wild animals. A wildlife source does not come as a surprise as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic and two-thirds have their origin in wildlife. The commercial use of wildlife for consumption encompassing both legal and illegal trade is poorly regulated with porous boundaries between the two entities. This trade, particularly in live animals, creates super-interfaces along the food value chain co-mingling species from many different geographies and habitats while creating perfect conditions for the exchange and recombination of viruses. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003, broad scientific consensus exists that long term, structural changes, and wildlife trade and market closures will be required to prevent future epidemics. The pragmatic, most cost-effective action governments can take with immediate effect is to ban the commercial trade of wild birds and mammals for consumption. Most importantly, this reduces the risk of future zoonotic transmission while also safeguarding resources for those Indigenous Peoples and local communities who rely on wild meat to meet their nutritional requirements.","Walzer, Chris",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173796/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.582983,406

This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of current indicators representing the various fields of public mental health core topics. It was conducted as a first step to build up a Mental Health Surveillance for Germany. Methods: We conducted a systematic MEDLINE search via PubMed. This search was supplemented by an extensive examination of the websites of relevant national as well as international institutions in the context of public mental health and an additional internet search via Google. To structure the data, an expert-based focus group identified superordinate topics most relevant to public mental health to which the identified indicators could be assigned to. Finally, the indicator set was screened for duplicates and appropriate content to arrive at a final set. Results: Within the various search strategies, we identified 13.811 records. Of these records, a total of 365 records were processed for indicator extraction. The extracted indicators were then assigned to 14 topics most relevant to public mental health as identified by the expert-based focus group. After the exclusion of duplicates and those indicators not meeting criteria of specificity and target group, the final set consisted of 192 indicators. Conclusion: The presented indicator set provides guidance in the field of current concepts in public mental health monitoring. As a comprehensive compilation, it may serve as basis for future surveillance efforts, which can be adjusted and condensed depending on the particular monitoring focus. Our work provides insights into established indicators included in former surveillance work as well as recent, not yet included indicators reflecting current developments in the field. Since our compilation mainly concludes indicators related to mental health in adults, it should be complemented with indicators specific to children and adolescents.

METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in November 2020, about 9 months after starting the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, among 8000 Japanese men and women aged 25–64 years. Participants asked for the changes after starting the COVID-19 pandemic in health status, workload, daily life, and health behavior. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to elucidate factors associated with deterioration in general health status. RESULTS: A deterioration in general health status was reported by 17.0% of male and 19.4% of female. There has been a clear shift to sedentary life with decreasing moderate activity and increasing screen time. The multivariate analysis revealed that deteriorated work style, increased burden of housework, decreased moderate activity, increased digital media exposure, and increased body weight were significantly associated with deteriorating health status. CONCLUSION: Both men and women have experienced significant changes in workload and lifestyle since the COVID-19 pandemic started. People should be aware of the risks associated with their recent life changes and take self-care measures to prevent serious health consequences.

However, incorporating technology is meaningful only if the resulting strategy is usable and useful. Hence, we must systematically assess technological strategies' usability and usefulness before employing them. Our objective was therefore to adapt the effort-vs-impact assessment (commonly used in systems science and operations planning) to decision-making for technological implementation strategies. The approach includes three components – assessing the effort needed to make a technological implementation strategy usable, assessing its impact (i.e., usefulness regarding performance/efficiency/quality), and deciding whether/how to use it. The approach generates a two-by-two effort-vs-impact chart that categorizes the strategy by effort (little/much) and impact (small/large), which serves as a guide for deciding whether/how to use the strategy. We provide a case study of applying this approach to design a package of technological strategies for implementing a 5 A's tobacco cessation intervention at a Federally Qualified Health Center. The effort-vs-impact chart guides stakeholder-involved decision-making around considered technologies. Specification of less technological alternatives helps tailor each technological strategy within the package (minimizing the effort needed to make the strategy usable while maximizing its usefulness), aligning to organizational priorities and clinical tasks. Our three-component approach enables methodical and documentable assessments of whether/how to use a technological implementation strategy, building on stakeholder-involved perceptions of its usability and usefulness. As technology advances, results of effort-vs-impact assessments will likely also change. Thus, even for a single technological implementation strategy, the three-component approach can be repeatedly applied to guide implementation in dynamic contexts.","Kim, Bo; Wilson, Sarah M.; Mosher, Tiffany M.; Breland, Jessica Y.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.640240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079479/,406

Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16(th) March and 26(th) April 2020. RESULTS: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function – verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend ≤0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). CONCLUSIONS: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function, a marker of health literacy, was most robust.","Batty, G.D.; Deary, I.J.; Luciano, M.; Altschul, D.M.; Kivimäki, M.; Gale, C.R.",Brain Behav Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561221/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912031309X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912031309X,406

609653,The Impact of COVID-19 on Italy: A Lesson for the Future,2020-07-01,"The recently discovered novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus), has brought the whole world to standstill with critical challenges, affecting both health and economic sectors worldwide. Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.","Archie, Sabrina Rahman; Cucullo, Luca",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21113916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486196/,406

The role of smoking habit in the susceptibility to infection is still controversial. In this study we correlated lung ACE-2 gene expression with several clinical/pathological data to explore susceptibility to infection. This is a retrospective observational study on 29 consecutive COVID-19 autopsies. SARS-CoV-2 genome and ACE-2 mRNA expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in lung tissue samples and correlated with several data with focus on smoking habit. Smoking was less frequent in high than low ACE-2 expressors (p = 0.014). A Bayesian regression also including age, gender, hypertension, and virus quantity confirmed that smoking was the most probable risk factor associated with low ACE-2 expression in the model. A direct relation was found between viral quantity and ACE-2 expression (p = 0.028). Finally, high ACE-2 expressors more frequently showed a prevalent pattern of vascular injury than low expressors (p = 0.049). In conclusion, ACE-2 levels were decreased in the lung tissue of smokers with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results point out complex biological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 particularly concerning the aspect of smoking habit and need larger prospective case series and translational studies.","Lunardi, Francesca; Fortarezza, Francesco; Vedovelli, Luca; Pezzuto, Federica; Boscolo, Annalisa; Rossato, Marco; Vettor, Roberto; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Crisanti, Andrea; Navalesi, Paolo; Gregori, Dario; Calabrese, Fiorella",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11060796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073591/,406
611565,"Changes in Alcohol Use Habits in the General Population, during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Greece",2020-09-22,"The advent of reverse genetics revolutionized the study of positive-stranded RNA viruses that were amenable for cloning as cDNAs into high-copy-number plasmids of Escherichia coli. However, some viruses are inherently refractory to cloning in high-copy-number plasmids due to toxicity of viral sequences to E. coli. We report a strategy that is a compromise between infectivity of the RNA transcripts and toxicity to E. coli effected by introducing frameshift mutations into “slippery sequences” near the viral “toxicity sequences” in the viral cDNA. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) has cDNA sequences that are toxic to E. coli. The original full-length infectious cDNA of CTV and a derivative replicon, CTV-ΔCla, cloned into pUC119, resulted in unusually limited E. coli growth. However, upon sequencing of these cDNAs, an additional uridinylate (U) was found in a stretch of U’s between nts 3726 and 3731 that resulted in a change to a reading frame with a stop codon at nt 3734. Yet, in vitro produced RNA transcripts from these clones infected protoplasts, and the resulting progeny virus was repaired. Correction of the frameshift mutation in the CTV cDNA constructs resulted in increased infectivity of in vitro produced RNA transcripts, but also caused a substantial increase of toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to develop visible colonies. Frameshift mutations created in sequences not suspected to facilitate reading frame shifting and silent mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions resulted in complete loss of infectivity, suggesting that the oligo(U) region facilitated the repair of the frameshift mutation. Additional frameshift mutations introduced into other oligo(U) regions also resulted in transcripts with reduced infectivity similarly to the original clones with the +1 insertion. However, only the frameshift mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions that were near and before the toxicity region improved growth and stability in E. coli. These data demonstrate that, when hosts are sufficiently susceptible for infection by transcripts of reduced specific infectivity, introduction of frameshift mutations at “slippery sequences” near toxic regions of viral cDNAs can be used as an additional strategy to clone recalcitrant viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids for reverse genetics.","Satyanarayana, Tatineni; Gowda, Siddarame; Ayllón, María A; Dawson, William O",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12954215/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203003878; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203003878,406

In patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is considered a rescue therapy that provides adequate gas exchange. The way in which mechanical ventilation is applied during VV-ECMO is not clear, however it is associated with prognosis. Currently, the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients that receive VV-ECMO stands at approximately 50%. Here, we report three patients that successfully recovered from COVID-19-induced ARDS after VV-ECMO and implementation of an ultra-protective ventilation. This ventilation strategy involved maintaining a peak inspiratory pressure of ≤20 cmH(2)O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of ≤ 10 cmH(2)O, which are lower values than have been previously reported. Thus, we suggest that this ultra-protective ventilation be considered during VV-ECMO as it minimizes the ventilator-induced lung injury.","Park, Mi Hwa; Kim, Ah Jin; Lee, Man-Jong; Kim, Young Sam; Kim, Jung Soo",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137936/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56110570,406

However, a substantial fraction of patients do not respond adequately to TNFi therapies. A test with the ability to predict response would inform therapeutic decision-making and improve clinical and financial outcomes. A 32-question decision-impact survey was conducted with 248 rheumatologists to gauge the perceived clinical utility of a novel test that predicts inadequate response to TNFi therapies in RA patients. Participants were informed about the predictive characteristics of the test and asked to indicate prescribing decisions based on four result scenarios. Overall, rheumatologists had a favorable view of the test: 80.2% agreed that it would improve medical decision-making, 92.3% said it would increase their confidence when making prescribing decisions, and 81.5% said it would be useful when considering TNFi therapies. Rheumatologists would be more likely to prescribe a TNFi therapy when the test reported that no signal of non-response was detected (79.8%) and less likely to prescribe a TNFi therapy when a signal of non-response was detected (11.3%–25.4%). Rheumatologists (84.7%) agreed that payers should provide coverage for such a test. This study shows that rheumatologists support the clinical need for a test to predict inadequate response to TNFi therapies.

In this application, frontline service delivery is defined as Aboriginal people who are paid employees in the health, ageing, and disability service sectors in roles that involve direct client, participant, or patient contact. There is a need to identify the factors that inhibit (push) and promote (pull) staff retention or departure of this workforce from the sectors. This study will provide additional insight about this topic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to uncover the factors that influence the retention of frontline Aboriginal workers in the health, ageing, and disability workforces in New South Wales (NSW) who do not have university qualifications. The aim of the proposed project aims to discover the push and pull factors for the retention of the frontline Aboriginal workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW in relation to their role, employment, and community and design evidence-based strategies for retaining the Aboriginal frontline workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW. METHODS: The proposed research will use a mixed methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data via surveys and interviews to capture and represent the voices and perspectives of Aboriginal people in a way that the participants chose. RESULTS: Indigenous research methodologies are a growing field in Aboriginal health research in Australia. A key strength of this study is that it is led by Aboriginal scholars and Aboriginal controlled organizations that apply an Indigenous methodological framework throughout the research process. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses a mixed methods design. The survey and interview questions and model were developed in partnership with Aboriginal health, ageing, and disability service workers rather than relying only on research publications on the workforce, government policies, and human resources strategies. This design places a strong emphasis on generalizable findings together with an inductive approach that explores employers and workers’ lived experience of the Aboriginal health workforce in NSW. Excluding workers who have graduated from university places a strong focus on the workforce who have obtained either school or Technical and Further Education or registered training organizations qualifications. Data collection was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results will include the unique experiences of Aboriginal workers and employers delivering services in an extremely challenging organizational, community, and personal context.

We sought to investigate the presence and duration of Sars‐CoV‐2 serum antibodies in obstetrical healthcare workers (HCW) on serial assessments over a 6‐month period, and to assess rates of vaccine acceptance and reported vaccine side effects among this cohort. METHOD OF STUDY: A prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of obstetrical HCWs at a tertiary hospital. Serum Sars‐CoV‐2 antibodies for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) were measured longitudinally at four intervals: baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Participants completed voluntary surveys on COVID19 testing, high‐risk exposures, vaccine acceptance, and vaccine side effects. RESULTS: One hundred twenty‐six of 150 (84%) HCWs who volunteered for participation completed all four blood draws. Prevalence of seropositive HCWs based on positive Sars‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies increased from 2% at baseline to 31% at 12 weeks but declined to 21% by 6 months. Forty‐two percent (19/43) of the participants considered seropositive for Sars‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies at any of the initial three blood draws converted to seronegative status at the 6‐month follow‐up. Eighty‐seven percent (72/83) of participants who responded to a follow‐up survey were willing to accept the COVID19 vaccine. Rates of acceptance did not differ by participant antibody status. Those that experienced symptoms with the first injection were more likely to have positive Sars‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies (36.8% vs. 9.6%, p = .01). CONCLUSION: Sars‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies wane over time and may not provide prolonged and robust immune protection.

The objective of the present work is to describe the experience during the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a hemodialysis (HD) unit from a hospital in Madrid serving the 2nd district with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (almost 1,000 patients in 100,000 inhabitants). The information presented includes the actions carried out, the incidence of COVID-19 in HD patients and in health personnel, clinical characteristics and the result of a screening of all patients from the HD unit. At the beginning, we had 90 HD patients: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of which 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed by symptoms detected in the triage or during the HD session, and 15 (40.5%) were diagnosed in a subsequent screening of patients in whom the diagnostic test by PCR-SARS-CoV-2 had not been done previously. The most frequent symptom was fever, 50% presented lymphopenia and in 18.4% the O2 saturation was <95%. Hospital admission was required in 16 patients (43.2%) and 6 died (16.2%). We found that contagion was clustered in turns of HD sessions and also in patients using collective transportation. Out of the 44 staff personnel, 15 (34%) presented compatible symptoms and 4 (9%) had SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by PCR performed by the personnel health service, 9 (20%) required some transitory sick leave (TSL) and 5 were considered probable cases of Covid-19. Conclusions We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage being diagnosed by screening and therefore it is necessary to be proactive in the diagnosis to stop the pandemic. Most patients positive for COVID-19 are being managed on an outpatient basis, although severe cases may occur and the mortality so far is 16.2%. Regarding the staff, 20% have required TSL in relation to COVID-19.","Albalate, Marta; Arribas, Patricia; Torres, Esther; Cintra, Melissa; Alcázar, Roberto; Puerta, Marta; Ortega, Mayra; Procaccini, Fabio; Martin, Juan; Jiménez, Eva; Fernandez, Isabel; de Sequera, Patricia; Perez-Villar, M.

There has been a large focus on identifying processes to safely, efficiently, and effectively vaccinate large populations. We aimed to describe the development and operationalization of a drive-in COVID-19 vaccine site in a parking garage adjacent to outpatient clinics at University of Florida (UF) Health Physicians and how it was informed by the roll-out of SARS-CoV-2 testing and administration of respiratory vaccinations. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A technical description and analysis of a drive-in COVID-19 vaccine site. FINDINGS: We incrementally increased the number of vaccines performed per day from 300 in the first 2 weeks to 700 an additional 2 weeks later. By the end of January, we completed nearly 14 000 vaccinations. At this capacity, we estimate the site could performed 5000 vaccinations per week. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This manuscript provides step-by-step guidance how to develop, operationalize, and implement a sustainable drive-in COVID-19 vaccination site. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: To our knowledge, this is the first description of a drive-in approach to COVID-19 vaccination. Our findings can help inform other health entities as they develop or expand vaccination efforts that may serve as a template for other sites to adapt.","Reise, Rachel; Huang, Yushi; Usmani, Silken A; Gruber, Laura; Patel, Natasha; Green, Tracy; Swilley, Lindsay; Dewar, Marvin A; Gums, John",Health Serv Insights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526774/; https://doi.org/10.1177/11786329211042769,406
614754,Pharmacist-Led Chronic Care Management for Medically Underserved Rural Populations in Florida During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections in children. Palivizumab (PZ) is the only RSV-specific immunoprophylaxis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions in the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein have been associated with breakthrough RSV infections in patients receiving PZ. OBJECTIVE: To detect PZ resistance conferring mutations in RSV strains from children who received PZ. STUDY DESIGN: Children aged ≤24 months on October 31 who were hospitalized or had outpatient visits for respiratory illness and/or fever during October–May 2001–2008 in 3 US counties were included. PZ receipt was obtained from parent interviews and medical records among children subsequently infected with RSV. Archived nasal/throat swab specimens were tested for RSV by real-time RT-PCR. The coding region of the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein was sequenced using both Sanger and pyrosequencing methods. RESULTS: Of 8762 enrolled children, 375 (4.3%) were tested for RSV and had a history of PZ receipt, of which 56 (14.9%) were RSV-positive and 45 of these had available archived specimens. Molecular typing identified 42 partial F gene sequences in specimens from 39 children: 19 single RSV subgroup A, 17 subgroup B and 3 mixed infections. Nucleotide substitutions were identified in 12/42 (28.6%) RSV strains. PZ resistance mutations were identified in 4 (10.2%) of the 39 children, of which one had documented PZ receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Although RSV PZ resistance mutations were infrequent, most RSV-associated illnesses in children with a history of PZ receipt were not due to strain resistance.","Oliveira, Danielle B.L.; Iwane, Marika K.; Prill, Mila M.; Weinberg, Geoffrey A.; Williams, John V.; Griffin, Marie R.; Szilagyi, Peter G.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Staat, Mary A.; Hall, Caroline B.; Durigon, Edison L.; Erdman, Dean D.",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766983/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321500030X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321500030X,406

616136,Response to Damiani and colleagues,2020-10-14,"Coronavirus pandemic is burdening healthcare systems around the world to the full capacity they can accommodate. There is an overwhelming need to find a treatment for this virus as early as possible. Computer algorithms and deep learning can participate positively by finding a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, a deep learning model and machine learning methods for the classification of potential coronavirus treatments on a single human cell will be presented. The dataset selected in this work is a subset of the publicly online datasets available on RxRx.ai. The objective of this research is to automatically classify a single human cell according to the treatment type and the treatment concentration level. A DCNN model and a methodology are proposed throughout this work. The methodical idea is to convert the numerical features from the original dataset to the image domain and then fed them up into a DCNN model. The proposed DCNN model consists of three convolutional layers, three ReLU layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The experimental results show that the proposed DCNN model for treatment classification (32 classes) achieved 98.05% in testing accuracy if it is compared with classical machine learning such as support vector machine, decision tree, and ensemble. In treatment concentration level prediction, the classical machine learning (ensemble) algorithm achieved 98.5% in testing accuracy while the proposed DCNN model achieved 98.2%. The performance metrics strengthen the obtained results from the conducted experiments for the accuracy of treatment classification and treatment concentration level prediction.","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen M.; Taha, Mohamed Hamed N.; Manogaran, Gunasekaran; Loey, Mohamed",J Nanopart Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-020-05041-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100894/,406
616480,"COVID 19: Evaluating the Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive Practices of Healthcare Workers in Northern Nigeria",2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused disruption to health, social interaction, travel and economies worldwide. In New Zealand, the government closed the border to non‐residents and required all arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. They also implemented a strict contact‐restriction system to eliminate COVID‐19 from the community. These measures also reduced the circulation of other respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. We assessed the impact of these measures on hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiac diseases. METHODS: National data on hospital admissions for each week of 2020 were compared to admissions for the previous 5 years. Analyses were curtailed after week 33, when a COVID‐19 outbreak in Auckland led to different levels of pandemic restrictions making national data difficult to interpret. RESULTS: The numbers of acute infectious respiratory admissions were similar to previous years before the introduction of COVID‐19 restrictions, but then fell lower and remained low after the pandemic restrictions were eased. The usual winter peak in respiratory admissions was not seen in 2020. Other than small reductions during the period of the strictest contact restrictions, non‐infectious respiratory and cardiac admissions were similar to previous years and the usual winter peak in heart failure admissions was observed. CONCLUSION: The observed patterns of hospital admissions in 2020 are compatible with the hypothesis that circulating respiratory viruses drive the normal seasonal trends in respiratory admissions. By contrast, these findings suggest that respiratory viruses do not drive the winter peak in heart failure.","Fairweather, Sarah M.; Chang, Catherina L.; Mansell, Christopher J; Shafuddin, Eskandarain; Hancox, Robert J.",Respirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365699/; https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14119,406
616538,Lack of MERS-CoV Co-infection among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in Saudi Arabia,2020-09-11,"INTRODUCTION: With the widespread spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia, more and more countries have been affected. Some research reports have shown that traditional Chinese medicine has a significant effect on COVID-19 infection, and the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine is used in some special people, such as children. At present, there is a lack of high-quality systematic reviews on the safety and efficacy of using Chinese medicine to treat children with novel coronavirus pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will search Cochran library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), China Biomedical Database (CBM), VIP Database (VIP), and Wanfang database for research. This study includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, and uses the Cochrane systematic review to review the safety and efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in preventing and treating children with novel coronavirus pneumonia. RCT research tools and quantitative research quality assessment tools for non-randomized studies will be used to assess the risk of bias in studies included in the systematic review. We will use Revman 5.3 software for meta-analysis, the main result is odds ratio, and then a subgroup analysis will be performed based on the age, intervention degree, and disease severity of the patients reviewed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review protocol is designed to provide evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of children with COVID-19, such evidence may be useful and important for clinical treatment decisions. The results should be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Since the data and results used in the systematic review will be extracted exclusively from published studies, approval from an ethics committee will not be required.

617340,Implementation of a ureteric colic telemedicine service: a mixed methods quality improvement study,2020-10-20,"INTRODUCTION: The 21st century has seen a series of viral pandemics that have collectively infected millions of individuals. To understand factors that may contribute to viral spread and address long-term health sequelae for survivors, it is important to review evidence regarding viral presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and possible effects on fertility. AIM: To review the current literature regarding the sexual transmissibility of recent viral pandemics and their effects on semen parameters and fertility. We review evidence for the following viruses: Ebola, Zika, West Nile, pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance. References from identified articles were searched and included, if appropriate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure of this study was reviewing of peer-reviewed literature. RESULTS: Both the Ebola virus and Zika virus are present in semen, but only the Zika virus shows consistent evidence of sexual transmission. Current evidence does not support the presence of the West Nile virus, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The Zika virus appears to alter semen parameters in a way that diminishes fertility, but the effect is likely time limited. The West Nile virus and SARS have been associated with orchitis in a small number of case reports. Viruses that cause febrile illness, such as pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, are associated with decreased sperm count and motility and abnormal morphology. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors present in the testes, which could impact spermatogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have reported the presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and fertility side effects of recent viral pandemics. Overall, semen studies and fertility effects are highly understudied in viral pandemics, and rigorous study on these topics should be undertaken as novel pandemics emerge.

617430,Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review,2021-03-15,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency clinicians on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic experience a range of emotions including anxiety, fear, and grief. Debriefing can help clinicians process these emotions, but the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to create a physically and psychologically safe space in the emergency department (ED) to perform this intervention. In response, we piloted a video-based debriefing program to support emergency clinician well-being. We report the details of our program and results of our evaluation of its acceptability and perceived value to emergency clinicians during the pandemic. METHODS: ED attending physicians, resident physicians, and non-physician practitioners (NPP) at our quaternary-care academic medical center were invited to participate in role-based, weekly one-hour facilitated debriefings using Zoom. ED attendings with experience in debriefing led each session and used an explorative approach that focused on empathy and normalizing reactions. At the end of the pilot, we distributed to participants an anonymous 10-point survey that included multiple-answer questions and visual analogue scales. RESULTS: We completed 18 debriefings with 68 unique participants (29 attending physicians, 6 resident physicians, and 33 NPPs. A total of 76% of participants responded to our survey and 77% of respondents participated in at least two debriefings. Emergency clinicians reported that the most common reasons to participate in the debriefings were “to enhance my sense of community and connection” (81%) followed by “to support colleagues” (75%). Debriefing with members of the same role group (92%) and the Zoom platform (81%) were considered to be helpful aspects of the debriefing structure. Although emergency clinicians found these sessions to be useful (78.8 +/− 17.6) interquartile range: 73–89), NPPs were less comfortable speaking up (58.5 +/− 23.6) than attending physicians (77.8 +/− 25.0) (p = < 0.008). CONCLUSION: Emergency clinicians participating in a video-based debriefing program during the coronavirus pandemic found it to be an acceptable and useful approach to support emotional well-being. Our program provided participants with a platform to support each other and maintain a sense of community and connection. Other EDs should consider implementing a debriefing program to safeguard the emotional well-being of their emergency clinician workforce.","Monette, Derek L.; Macias-Konstantopoulos, Wendy L.; Brown, David F.M.; Raja, Ali S.; Takayesu, James K.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.8.48579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052815/,406
617936,COVID-19: A 21st Century Cataclysmic Pandemic,2021-08-28,"One of the key drivers of antibiotic resistance (ABR) and drug-resistant bacterial infections is the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human populations. Infection management and antibiotic decision-making are multifactorial, complex processes influenced by context and involving many actors. Social constructs including race, ethnicity, gender identity and cultural and religious practices as well as migration status and geography influence health. Infection and ABR are also affected by these external drivers in individuals and populations leading to stratified health outcomes. These drivers compromise the capacity and resources of healthcare services already over-burdened with drug-resistant infections. In this review we consider the current evidence and call for a need to broaden the study of culture and power dynamics in healthcare through investigation of relative power, hierarchies and sociocultural constructs including structures, race, caste, social class and gender identity as predictors of health-providing and health-seeking behaviours. This approach will facilitate a more sustainable means of addressing the threat of ABR and identify vulnerable groups ensuring greater inclusivity in decision-making. At an individual level, investigating how social constructs and gender hierarchies impact clinical team interactions, communication and decision-making in infection management and the role of the patient and carers will support better engagement to optimize behaviours. How people of different race, class and gender identity seek, experience and provide healthcare for bacterial infections and use antibiotics needs to be better understood in order to facilitate inclusivity of marginalized groups in decision-making and policy.","Charani, Esmita; Mendelson, Marc; Ashiru-Oredope, Diane; Hutchinson, Eleanor; Kaur, Manmeet; McKee, Martin; Mpundu, Mirfin; Price, James R; Shafiq, Nusrat; Holmes, Alison",JAC Antimicrob Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604747/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlab123,406

Ses effets indésirables étant connus pour être fréquents et dose-dépendants lors du traitement du VIH, le but fut de réaliser un suivi étroit incluant des dosages sanguins. Matériels et méthodes De mars à juin, le référentiel thérapeutique du CHU positionnait le LPV/r comme une possibilité thérapeutique en cas de pneumopathie sévère (O2 >3L/min) avant le 12e jour d’évolution chez les patients non en fin de vie, en l’absence de contre-indication et d’interaction médicamenteuse importante. La posologie était 400/100mg bid pendant 10 à 14 j adaptée à un dosage à j3 avec vallée (H0) et pic (H4). Ce dosage était réalisé par LC-MS/MS selon un protocole développé par le laboratoire de pharmacologie et validé conformément aux normes d’accréditation ISO15189. Les valeurs cibles étaient celles recommandées pour le VIH : 1000–8000ng/mL à H0 et 9000–14 000ng/mL à H4. Afin d’évaluer les pratiques, les dossiers pour lesquels un dosage de LPV/r était réalisé furent analysés. Résultats Sur les 69 patients traités par LPV/r pendant cette période, 39 dosages furent réalisés chez 21 patients hospitalisés. L’âge moyen était de 64 ans, 11 (52 %) étaient des femmes, l’IMC médian de 27kg/m2 (33 % de surpoids, 33 % d’obésité). Au moment du dosage, le débit médian d’O2 était de 4 L/min, 10 (47 %) avaient une atteinte scanographique sévère ou étendue, 2 patients étaient en réanimation, et la CRP moyenne était de 59mg/L [5 ; 234]. Le LPV/r était débuté en moyenne à j8 du début des symptômes, en comprimés pour 16 patients (76 %), en sirop pour 5 (24 %). Les posologies reçues étaient 400/100mg bid pour 12 patients (57 %), 200/50mg bid pour 5 (23 %) et une posologie intermédiaire pour 4 (19 %). À 400/100mg bid, 12/12 patients étaient sur-dosés, avec un H0 moyen à 18 154ng/mL et un H4 moyen à 21 250ng/mL, 5 ont eu un 2e dosage : après réduction de moitié de la posologie 2 étaient bien dosés et 1 restait sur-dosé (H0 à 13 000ng/mL), sans modification de posologie 2 étaient bien dosés. À 200/50mg bid, 4/5 patients étaient sur-dosés mais avec un H0 moyen à 9401ng/mL avoisinant la normale haute et 1/5 était bien dosé. À dose intermédiaire, 2/4 patients étaient sur-dosés avec un H0 moyen à 22 736ng/mL, 1/4 était bien dosé et 1/4 était sous-dosé. Sur 18 patients sur-dosés, 7 (39 %) avaient de la diarrhée et 2 (11 %) développaient une cytolyse (jusqu’à 5 fois la normale). Dix-sept patients (80 %) ont reçu la durée totale du traitement, aucun traitement ne fut arrêté pour effet secondaire, 2 (9,5 %) sont décédés dont un en cours de traitement. Conclusion Réduire les effets indésirables du traitement par LPV/r reste primordial a fortiori en l’absence d’efficacité démontrée. Dans la limite de petits effectifs notre série montre des surdosages constants à 400/100mg bid, associés à des effets secondaires cliniques et biologiques, malgré un poids des patients élevé. Sauf s’il se dégageait un rationnel pour de très fortes concentrations à visée antivirale, initier le traitement à demi-dose est à considérer.","Stoldick, M.; Lamoureux, F.; Robert, M.; Caron, F.; Étienne, M.; Gueit, I.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303498; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303498,406

It is made available under a CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, from parents to early embryos during conception could be catastrophic, but is contingent on the susceptibility of cells of the embryo to infection. Because presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported in the human reproductive system, we assessed whether pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARSCoV-2 entry. RNA-seq and immunostaining studies revealed presence of two key entry factors in the trophectoderm of blastocyst-stage embryos, the ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease. Exposure of blastocysts to fluorescent reporter virions pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein revealed S-ACE2 dependent entry and fusion. These results indicate that human pre-implantation embryos can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, a finding pertinent to natural human conceptions and assisted reproductive technologies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Viotti, Manuel; Montano, Mauricio; Victor, Andrea; Griffin, Darren K.; Duong, Tommy; Bolduc, Nathalie; Farmer, Andrew; Gonzalez, Isabel; Barnes, Frank; Zouves, Christo; Greene, Warner C.",Fertility and Sterility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.127; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028220323281; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0015028220323281,406
618498,Should people with severe mental illness be prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccination?,2021-04-10,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are among the professionals at serious risk for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health. In this sense, the next public health challenge globally will be to preserving healthy HCWs during this pandemic. AIM: The present study has the aim of investigating the relationship among concerns, perceived impact, preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of Italian physicians. METHODS: From March 29th to April 15th 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques through Limesurvey platform. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for perceived job stress were concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR = 3.18 [95% CI = 2.00-5.05] P < .001), perceived impact on job demands (OR = 1.63 [95% CI = 1.05-2.52] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 2.50 [95% CI = 1.60-3.90] P < .001), and non-working concerns (OR = 1.86 [95% CI = 1.15-3.03] P < .05). With respect to the risk factors for rumination about the pandemic emerged concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR 1.74, [95% CI = 1.12-2.71] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 1.68 [95% CI = 1.12-2.52] P < .05), and impact on personal life (OR = 2.04 [95% CI = 1.08-3.86] P < .05).

In this study, using the baculovirus system, we generated recombinant viruses that expressed S, E, M and N structural proteins of SARS-CoV either individually or simultaneously. The expression level, size and authenticity of each recombinant SARS-CoV protein were determined. In addition, immunofluorescence and FACS analysis confirmed the cell surface expression of the S protein. Co-infections of insect cells with two recombinant viruses demonstrated that M and E could assemble readily to form smooth surfaced VLPs. On the other hand, simultaneous high level expression of S, E and M by a single recombinant virus allowed the very efficient assembly and release of VLPs. These data demonstrate that the VLPs are morphological mimics of virion particles. The high level expression of VLPs with correct S protein conformation by a single recombinant baculovirus offers a potential candidate vaccine for SARS.","Mortola, Eduardo; Roy, Polly",FEBS Lett,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579304011238; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579304011238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15474033/,406

The 7-day-old chickens were immunized intramuscularly with multi-epitope DNA vaccine encapsulated by liposome and boosted two weeks later, and were challenged by virulent IBV strain five weeks post booster. The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 80.0% rate of immune protection. The novel immunogenic chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine revealed in this study provided a new candidate target for IBV vaccine development.","Tian, Lang; Wang, Hong-ning; Lu, Dan; Zhang, Yun-fei; Wang, Ting; Kang, Run-ming",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18840402/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X08018822; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.09.125; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X08018822,406

However, the fact that strict government mandates focus on physical distancing does not mean that social connectedness for voluntary risk communication among citizens should be sacrificed. Furthermore, we lack an understanding of citizens’ behaviors regarding the voluntary adoption of public health measures and the control of mental wellbeing in the age of physical distancing. Key variables in the response to the global pandemic are the emergence of risk deliberation networks, voluntary compliance with government guidelines, and the restoration of citizens’ subjective health. However, little is known about how citizens’ health-related behaviors coevolve with social connections for sharing information and discussing urgent pandemic issues. The findings show that selection and social influence mechanisms coexist by affecting each citizen’s health-related behaviors and community-led risk discourses in the face of the urgent health crisis.","Lim, Seunghoo; Nakazato, Hiromi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17114148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532029/,406

As effective vaccines and treatments begin to emerge, it will become increasingly important to identify and proactively manage the long-term respiratory complications of severe disease. The patterns of imaging abnormalities coupled with data from prior coronavirus outbreaks suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are likely at an increased risk of progression to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic pulmonary vascular disease. In this paper, we briefly review the definition, classification, and underlying pathophysiology of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We then review the current literature on the proposed mechanisms of lung injury in severe COVID-19 infection, and outline potential viral- and immune-mediated processes implicated in the development of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF). Finally, we address patient-specific and iatrogenic risk factors that could lead to PCPF and discuss strategies for reducing risk of pulmonary complications/sequelae.","Ambardar, Shiva Rattan; Hightower, Stephanie L.; Huprikar, Nikhil A.; Chung, Kevin K.; Singhal, Anju; Collen, Jacob F.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205928/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112452,406

In March 2020, this disease spread to different parts of the world causing a global pandemic. Although this disease is still increasing exponentially day by day, early diagnosis of this disease is very important to reduce the death rate and to reduce the prevalence of this pandemic. Since there are sometimes human errors by physicians in the diagnosis of this disease, using computer-aided diagnostic systems can be helpful to get more accurate results. In this paper, chest X-ray images have been examined using a new pipeline machine vision-based system to provide more accurate results. In the proposed method, after preprocessing the input X-ray images, the region of interest has been segmented. Then, a combined gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features have been extracted from the processed images. Finally, an improved version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the Red Fox Optimization algorithm is employed for the classification of the images based on the features. The proposed method is validated by performing to three datasets and its results are compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

622190,COVID‐19 suicide and its causative factors among the healthcare professionals: Case study evidence from press reports,2021-02-05,"INTRODUCTION: Early evidence confirms lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake in established ethnic minority populations, yet there has been little focus on understanding vaccine hesitancy and barriers to vaccination in migrants. Growing populations of precarious migrants (including undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees) in the UK and Europe are considered to be under-immunised groups and may be excluded from health systems, yet little is known about their views on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, which are essential to identify key solutions and action points to strengthen vaccine roll-out. METHODS: We did an in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview study of recently arrived migrants (foreign-born, >18 years old; <10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake. We used the ‘Three Cs’ model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising. The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630). RESULTS: We approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (n = 3), asylum seekers (n = 19), undocumented migrants (n = 8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (n = 2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions). 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need. Participants reported a range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine and expressed concerns that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out. Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine. All participants (n = 10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this. Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Precarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake. Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities. These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social distance, can slow the transmission. However, both mask and social distance have not prevented the spread of respiratory viruses SARS-CoV2 within the US. There is an urgent need to develop an intervention that could reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. The key to preventing transmission is to eliminate the emission of SARS-CoV2 from an infected person and stop the virus from propagating in the human population. Rhamnolipids are environmentally friendly surfactants that are less toxic than the synthetic surfactants. In this study, rhamnolipid products, 222B, were investigated as disinfectants against enveloped viruses, such as bovine coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The 222B at 0.009% and 0.0045% completely inactivated 6 and 4 log PFU/mL of HSV-1 in 5–10 min, respectively. 222B at or below 0.005% is also biologically safe. Moreover, 50 μL of 222B at 0.005% on ~1 cm(2) mask fabrics or plastic surface can inactivate ~10(3) PFU HSV-1 in 3–5 min.

The same is true for predicting times from hospital admission of COVID-19 patients to intensive care or from start of ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) to extubation. This logical restriction of the data to the period of hospitalisation is associated with a substantial risk that inappropriate methods are used for analysis.

Use of personal respiratory protective equipment was the main method used by HCWs to avoid nosocomial transmission. This paper describes the technology used to evaluate the filtration efficiency of the half-face medical protection mask (N99), manufactured by Firmshield Biotechnology, against viral aerosol. Viral aerosol was generated and then sampled simultaneously with and without the test mask. This enables a percentage efficiency value to be calculated against test phage f2 aerosols (surrogates of viral pathogen aerosols). At the same time the mask filtration efficiency against NaCl particle aerosol was determined by use of TSI8130 equipment and face-fit factor was tested by use of TSI8020 equipment. The half-face medical protection mask (N99) evaluated by use of the viral aerosol had a filtration efficiency >99%. The mask filtration efficiency against NaCl particle aerosol was 99.634 ± 0.024% and it had a good face-fit factor. This half-face medical protection mask (N99) can protect the wearer from viral aerosol disease transmission.

METHODS This study utilized health records from hospitals and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) covering 46 % of the Danish population (n=2,693,924). In an time-trend study, we compared the number of psychiatric in-patients, referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior in years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to levels during the first lockdown (March 11 - May 17, 2020), inter-lockdown period (May 18 - December 15, 2020) and second lockdown (December 16, 2020 - February 28, 2021). RESULTS During the pandemic, the rate of psychiatric in-patients declined compared to pre-pandemic levels (RR = 0.95, 95 % CI = 0.94 - 0.96, p < 0.01), with the largest decrease of 19 % observed three weeks into the first lockdown. Referrals to mental health services were not significantly different (RR = 1.01, 95 % CI = 0.92 - 1.10, p = 0.91) during the pandemic; neither was suicidal behavior among hospital contacts (RR = 1.04, 95 % CI = 0.94 - 1.14, p = 0.48) nor EMS contacts (RR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.00 - 1.18, p = 0.06). Similar trends were observed across nearly all age groups, sexes and types of mental disorders examined. In the age group <18, an increase in the rate of psychiatric inpatients (RR = 1.11, 95 % CI = 1.07 - 1.15, p < 0.01) was observed during the pandemic; however, this did not exceed the pre-pandemic, upwards trend in psychiatric hospitalizations in the age group <18 (p = 0.78). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a decrease in psychiatric hospitalizations, while no significant change was observed in referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior. Psychiatric hospitalizations amongst children and adolescents increased during the pandemic; however, this appears to be a continuation of a pre-pandemic trend.","Rømer, Troels Boldt; Haubo Bojesen Christensen, Rune; Blomberg, Stig Nikolaj; Folke, Fredrik; Christensen, Helle Collatz; Benros, Michael E",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34525216/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13369,406
624495,"Civil unrest, COVID-19 stressors, anxiety, and depression in the acute phase of the pandemic: a population-based study in Hong Kong",2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 related research has increased in importance worldwide since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately. RESULTS: Due to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HAVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants of Concern). HAVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: HAVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HAVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. We did not identify Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage. At arrival, the prevalence of several viruses was clearly dependent on the pilgrim's country of origin. After Hajj participation, these viruses were isolated among pilgrims from all countries, with few exceptions. No significant differences were observed between paired and nonpaired cohort results. Our results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, face mask use and hand hygiene should be considered in the context of the Hajj.","Memish, Z.A.; Assiri, A.; Turkestani, A.; Yezli, S.; al Masri, M.; Charrel, R.; Drali, T.; Gaudart, J.; Edouard, S.; Parola, P.; Gautret, P.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25700892/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15002967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2015.02.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15002967,406

Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection. Discussion Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19 positive patients. Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites. Conclusions All healthcare professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment (PPE) for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks both by the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.","Dockery, Dominique M.; Rowe, Susannah G.; Murphy, Marjorie A.; Krzystolik, Magdalena G.",J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073646792030398X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073646792030398X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456959/,406
625911,Adapting Coordinated Specialty Care in the Post-COVID-19 Era: Study Protocol for an Integrative Mixed-methods Study,2021-04-26,"INTRODUCTION: Adolescents and young people comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections globally, yet current approaches do not effectively engage this group, and adolescent HIV‐related outcomes are the poorest among all age groups. Providing psychosocial interventions incorporating psychological, social, and/or behavioural approaches offer a potential pathway to improve engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes among adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV). METHODS: A systematic search of all peer‐reviewed papers published between January 2000 and July 2020 was conducted through four electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). We included randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions aimed at improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes of AYPLHIV aged 10 to 24 years. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty relevant studies were identified. Studies took place in the United States (n = 18, 60%), sub‐Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe) and Southeast Asia (Thailand). Outcomes of interest included adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART knowledge, viral load data, sexual risk behaviours, sexual risk knowledge, retention in care and linkage to care. Overall, psychosocial interventions for AYPLHIV showed important, small‐to‐moderate effects on adherence to ART (SMD = 0.3907, 95% CI: 0.1059 to 0.6754, 21 studies, n = 2647) and viral load (SMD = −0.2607, 95% CI −04518 to −0.0696, 12 studies, n = 1566). The psychosocial interventions reviewed did not demonstrate significant impacts on retention in care (n = 8), sexual risk behaviours and knowledge (n = 13), viral suppression (n = 4), undetectable viral load (n = 5) or linkage to care (n = 1) among AYPLHIV. No studies measured transition to adult services. Effective interventions employed various approaches, including digital and lay health worker delivery, which hold promise for scaling interventions in the context of COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions in improving health outcomes in AYPLHIV. However, more research needs to be conducted on interventions that can effectively reduce sexual risk behaviours of AYPLHIV, as well as those that can strengthen engagement in care. Further investment is needed to ensure that these interventions are cost‐effective, sustainable and resilient in the face of resource constraints and global challenges such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Laurenzi, Christina A; du Toit, Stefani; Ameyan, Wole; Melendez‐Torres, GJ; Kara, Tashmira; Brand, Amanda; Chideya, Yeukai; Abrahams, Nina; Bradshaw, Melissa; Page, Daniel T; Ford, Nathan; Sam‐Agudu, Nadia A; Mark, Daniella; Vitoria, Marco; Penazzato, Martina; Willis, Nicola; Armstrong, Alice; Skeen, Sarah",J Int AIDS Soc,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338417/,406

However, little is known about the effectiveness of digital interventions integrated in psychosomatic rehabilitation processes. Data from 724 patients from psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics were analyzed with regard to the effectiveness of digital trainings indicated by a change in symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness from pre– to post–rehabilitation. Rehabilitation satisfaction was examined in association with reaching rehabilitation goals and satisfaction with communication. A mixed repeated measures analyses of covariance, analyses of covariance, and hierarchical stepwise regression analyses were performed. Results indicated a superior effectiveness for the intervention group receiving all offered digital treatments in addition to the regular face-to-face rehabilitation program with regard to symptoms of depression (F (2674) = 3.93, p < 0.05, η(p)(2) = 0.01), anxiety (F (2678) = 3.68, p < 0.05, η(p)(2) = 0.01) post-rehabilitation, with large effect sizes for both depression (d = 1.28) and anxiety (d = 1.08). In addition, rehabilitation satisfaction was positively associated with reaching rehabilitation goals and perceived communication with healthcare workers. Digital interventions appeared effective in supporting mental health of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients’ post-rehabilitation. These findings support the inclusion of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary digital and face-to-face treatment programs and call for more implementations of new technologies in a context of complexity to improve health and healthcare service.","Keller, Franziska Maria; Dahmen, Alina; Derksen, Christina; Kötting, Lukas; Lippke, Sonia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501524/,406

We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply constraints. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made available will determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in the US.","Kohli, Michele; Maschio, Michael; Becker, Debbie; Weinstein, Milton C.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2031690X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X2031690X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483216/,406

We aimed to investigate if patients treated with hydroxychloroquine for a non-SARS-CoV-2-indication had a lower risk of verified infection with SARS-CoV-2, compared with matched controls. Methods A cohort comprising all persons in Denmark collecting hydroxychloroquine prescriptions in 2020 and 2019 (i.e. both during and before SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Denmark) matched by age and sex with controls. Data were collected using the Danish national registries containing complete information on patient health data, prescriptions and microbiological test results. The main outcome was microbiologically verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 5,488 hydroxychloroquine-users were matched with 54,486 non-users. At baseline the groups differed on diagnoses of pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal,gastrointestinal / metabolic disease and dementia as well as treatment with antirheumatic drugs. The final model was adjusted for these potential confounders. Use of hydroxychloroquine for non-COVID-19 indication was not associated with any change in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 [HR of 0.90 (95% Confidence Interval 0.76-1.07)] This result was robust in the propensity-score matched sensitivity analysis.

Either several linear amino acids or their conformational fit may be shared, even though their origins are separate. Hence, during a viral or microbe infection, if that organism shares cross-reactive epitopes for B or T cells with the host, then the response to the infecting agent will also attack the host, causing autoimmune disease. A variation on this theme is when a second, third, or repeated infection(s) shares cross-reactive B or T cell epitopes with the first (initiating) virus but not necessarily the host. In this instance, the secondary infectious agents increase the number of antiviral/antihost effector antibodies or T cells that potentiate or precipitate the autoimmune assault. The formation of this concept initially via study of monoclonal antibody or clone T cell cross-recognition in vitro through its evolution to in vivo animal models and to selected human diseases is explored in this mini-review.","Oldstone, M.

632224,Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric syndromes and COVID-19,2020-08-20,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Eosinophil granulocytes (eosinophils) belong to the family of white blood cells that play important roles in the development of asthma and various types of allergy. Eosinophils are cells with a diameter of 12–17 µm and they originate from myeloid precursors. They were discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1879 in the process of staining fixed blood smears with aniline dyes. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is the process by which cells lose their functionality. Therefore, it is very important to study the apoptosis of eosinophils and their survival factors to understand how to develop new drugs based on the modulation of eosinophil apoptosis for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases. ABSTRACT: In the past 10 years, the number of people in the Czech Republic with allergies has doubled to over three million. Allergic pollen catarrh, constitutional dermatitis and asthma are the allergic disorders most often diagnosed. Genuine food allergies today affect 6–8% of nursing infants, 3–5% of small children, and 2–4% of adults. These disorders are connected with eosinophil granulocytes and their apoptosis. Eosinophil granulocytes are postmitotic leukocytes containing a number of histotoxic substances that contribute to the initiation and continuation of allergic inflammatory reactions. Eosinophilia results from the disruption of the standard half-life of eosinophils by the expression of mechanisms that block the apoptosis of eosinophils, leading to the development of chronic inflammation. Glucocorticoids are used as a strong acting anti-inflammatory medicine in the treatment of hypereosinophilia. The removal of eosinophils by the mechanism of apoptosis is the effect of this process. This work sums up the contemporary knowledge concerning the apoptosis of eosinophils, its role in the aforementioned disorders, and the indications for the use of glucocorticoids in their related therapies.","Zustakova, Martina; Kratochvilova, Lucie; Slama, Petr",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9120457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321726/,406

Whereas most of them have no to limited selective advantage, some display increased transmissibility and/or resistance to immune response. To date, most of the mutations involved in the functional adaptation are found in the Receptor Binding Module (RBM), close to the interface with the human receptor ACE2. In this study, we thus developed and validated a fast and simple molecular assay allowing the detection and partial identification of the mutations in the RBM coding sequence. After the amplification of the region of interest, the amplicon is heat-denatured and hybridized with an amplicon of reference. The presence of a mutation in the heteroduplex can be cleaved by a mismatch-specific endonuclease and the cleavage pattern is analysed by capillary electrophoresis. The approach was first validated on viral RNA purified different SARS-CoV-2 variants produced in the lab before being implemented for clinical samples. The results highlighted the performance of the assay for the detection of mutations in the RBM from clinical samples. The procedure can be easily set up for high throughput identification of the presence of mutations and serve as a first-line screening to select the samples for full genome sequencing.","Lopez, E.; Barthelemy, M.; Baronti, C.; Masse, S.; Falchi, A.; Durbesson, F.; Vincentelli, R.; de Lamballerie, X.; Charrel, R.

METHODS: Five test-negative case–control studies were conducted from November to February during the 2004/2005 to 2008/2009 seasons. Sentinel physicians from the Viral Surveillance Network enrolled children aged 6–59 months with influenza-like illness to collect throat swabs. Through linking with a nationwide vaccination registry, we measured the VE with a logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, and week of symptom onset. Both fixed-effects and random-effects models were used in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four thousand four hundred and ninety-four subjects were included. The proportion of influenza test-positive subjects across the five seasons was 11.5% (132/1151), 7.2% (41/572), 23.9% (189/791), 6.6% (75/1135), and 11.2% (95/845), respectively. The pooled VE was 62% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48–83%) in both meta-analysis models. By age category, VE was 51% (95% CI 23–68%) for those aged 6–23 months and 75% (95% CI 60–84%) for those aged 24–59 months.

Positive percent agreement with the BioFire RP result for viruses ranged from 85.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2% to 88.9%) to 95.1% (95% CI, 89.0% to 97.9%), while negative percent agreement values ranged from 99.5% (95% CI, 99.1% to 99.7%) to 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5% to 99.9%). Additional testing of discordant targets (12%; 349/2,908) confirmed the results of ePlex RP for 38% (131/349) of samples tested. Reproducibility was 100% for all targets tested, with the exception of adenovirus, for which reproducibilities were 91.6% at low virus concentrations and 100% at moderate virus concentrations. The ePlex RP panel offers a new, rapid, and sensitive “sample-to-answer” multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.","Babady, N.

The current evidence base for video consultations is modest; hence, this study seeks to aid decision-makers by reporting on one large National Health Service mental health trust's video-consultation pilot project. Patients' choices/preferences were gathered via online forms; and staff's views, through a focus group. The typical patient was female, 26 years old, living in a deprived locality. Consultations typically lasted 37 minutes, saving patients 0–30 minutes of travel and £0–£3.00. Satisfaction was high, and the software was intuitive. Audio quality varied, but patients felt able to disclose “as if in person,” were willing to use video consultation again, and found them more preferable than home visits and clinic attendance. Staff could foresee benefits but were concerned for their therapeutic relationships and were avoidant without familiarization, training, clinical coaching, and managerial reassurances especially regarding high-risk patients/situations. They argued video consultation would not suit all patients and should be used according to individual need. We found COVID-19 is necessitating staff to adopt video consultation and that patients are satisfied. However, unless staff's concerns are resolved, enabling them to use their full repertoire of interpersonal skills, therapeutic relationships will trump efficiency and video consultations may not remain their treatment modality of choice.","Painter, Jon; Turner, James; Procter, Paula M.",Comput Inform Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1097/cin.0000000000000804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238832/,406

In addition, we determined the role of patient characteristics, treatment factors, and country on mortality risk using ERA-EDTA Registry data on patients receiving kidney replacement therapy in Europe between February 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Additional data on all patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were collected from seven European countries encompassing 4298 patients. COVID-19 attributable mortality was calculated using propensity-score matched historic controls and after 28 days of follow-up was 20.0% (95% confidence interval 18.7%-21.4%) in 3285 patients receiving dialysis, and 19.9% (17.5%-22.5%) in 1013 recipients of a transplant. We identified differences in COVID-19 mortality across countries, and an increased mortality risk in older patients receiving kidney replacement therapy and male patients receiving dialysis. In recipients of kidney transplants older than 75 years of age 44.3% (35.7%-53.9%) did not survive COVID-19. Mortality risk was 1.28 (1.02-1.60) times higher in transplant recipients compared with matched dialysis patients. Thus, the pandemic has had a substantial effect on mortality in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy; a highly vulnerable population due to underlying chronic kidney disease and high prevalence of multimorbidity.","Jager, Kitty J.; Kramer, Anneke; Chesnaye, Nicholas C.; Couchoud, Cécile; Sánchez-Álvarez, J.

634908,"Stress, resilience, and coping strategies in a sample of community-dwelling older adults during COVID-19",2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world’s mental health and health care systems. Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population’s mental health. Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool. RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19–specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Valdez, Danny; ten Thij, Marijn; Bathina, Krishna; Rutter, Lauren A; Bollen, Johan",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284783/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21418,406

While vaccines remain the primary option for COVID-19 prevention, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, have been shown to benefit certain subpopulations after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Unlike vaccine-derived immunity that develops over time, administration of neutralizing mAbs is an immediate and passive immunotherapy, with the potential to reduce disease progression, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and death. Bamlanivimab alone and together with etesevimab hold emergency use authorizations in several countries globally, with countries increasingly transitioning to the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and other authorized mAbs on the basis of their evolving variant landscape, regulatory authorizations, and access to drugs. The current guidelines for the administration of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab are informed by an iterative process of testing and development. Herein the rationale for these guidelines is provided by sharing the learnings that have been gathered throughout the development process of these mAbs. In addition, this review addresses the most common clinical questions received from health care professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding indicated population, dose, use with other medications and vaccines, duration of protection, and variants in clinical practice. As prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants can differ by country and state, prescribing HCPs should consider the prevalence of bamlanivimab and etesevimab resistant variants in their area, where data are available, regarding potential efficacy impact when considering treatment options.

College students are a special group, and there is no survey on insomnia among college students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and related factors of insomnia in college students during the period of COVID-19. Method: A total of 1,086 college students conducted a cross-sectional study through the questionnaire star platform. The survey time was from February 15 to February 22, 2020. The collected information included demographic informatics and mental health scale, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) to assess sleep quality, Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) to assess general psychological symptoms, Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS) to assess stress. We used logistic regression to analyze the correlation between related factors and insomnia symptoms. Results: The prevalence of insomnia, general psychological symptoms and stress were 16.67, 5.8, and 40.70%, respectively.

A phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene clustered ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 with the 793/B group; however, a pairwise comparison showed that the 5′ terminal of the S1 gene (containing hypervariable regions I and II) had high sequence identity with the H120 strain, while the 3′ terminal sequence was very similar to that of IBV 4/91 strain. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence, which was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide similarities using the corresponding gene fragments, suggested that isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 emerged from multiple recombination events between parental IBV strains 4/91 and H120. Although the isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 had slightly higher S1 amino acid sequence identity to strain 4/91 (88.2%) than to strain H120 (86%), the serotype of the virus was more closely related to that of the H120 strain (32% antigenic relatedness) than to the 4/91 strain (15% antigenic relatedness). Whereas, vaccination of specific pathogen-free chickens with the 4/91 vaccine provided better protection against challenge with ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 than did vaccination with the H120 strain according to the result of virus re-isolation. As the spike protein, especially in the hypervariable regions of the S1 domain, of IBVs contains viral neutralizing epitopes, the results of this study showed that recombination of the S1 domain resulted in the emergence of a new serotype.","Zhang, Tingting; Han, Zongxi; Xu, Qianqian; Wang, Qiuling; Gao, Mengying; Wu, Wei; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843651/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815001197; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815001197,406

Considering the high penetration rate of mobile phones in SSA, mobile health (mHealth) could be used to achieve universal health coverage. The proposed study will map evidence on the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by health workers in SSA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley’s scoping review framework and Levac et al’s recommendations and guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. A scoping review will be conducted to explore what is known about mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by health workers in SSA and to identify areas for future research. In addition to searching the grey literature, the following databases will be explored from PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL with full text via EBSCOhost and ScienceDirect databases. A search in Google Scholar will be considered as an additional information source. The literature search will involve published studies from 2000 to 2020 in any language. This review will cover mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by health workers in SSA. The primary investigator will conduct the title screening, and subsequently, two reviewers will independently conduct abstract and full article screening and data extraction. The results of this proposed review will be presented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis: Extension for Scoping Review guidelines.

METHODS AND RESULTS: All manuscripts published between March 1, 2019 to June 1, 2019 and March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 in 4 high‐impact cardiology journals (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Circulation, JAMA Cardiology, and European Heart Journal) were identified using bibliometric data. Authors' genders were determined by matching first name with predicted gender using a validated multinational database (Genderize.io) and manual adjudication. Proportions of women and men first, co‐first, senior, and co‐senior authors, manuscript types, and whether the manuscript was COVID‐19 related were recorded. In 2019, women were first authors of 176 (22.3%) manuscripts and senior authors of 99 (15.0%) manuscripts. In 2020, women first authored 230 (27.4%) manuscripts and senior authored 138 (19.3%) manuscripts. Proportions of woman first and senior authors were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019. Women were more likely to be first authors if the manuscript's senior author was a woman (33.8% for woman first/woman senior versus 23.4% for woman first/man senior; P<0.001). Women were less likely to be first authors of COVID‐19‐related original research manuscripts (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Representation of women as key authors of manuscripts published in major cardiovascular journals increased during the early COVID‐19 pandemic compared with similar months in 2019. However, women were significantly less likely to be first authors of COVID‐19‐related original research manuscripts. Future investigation into the gender‐disparate impacts of COVID‐19 on academic careers is critical.","DeFilippis, Ersilia M.; Sinnenberg, Lauren; Mahmud, Nadim; Wood, Malissa J.; Hayes, Sharonne N.; Michos, Erin D.; Reza, Nosheen",J Am Heart Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.019005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619980/,406

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. METHODS: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. RESULTS: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 – 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R(2)=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 – 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. CONCLUSION: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Zhou, Liangcai; Prosper, Olivia; Luo, Wei; Floyd, Jessica R; Wesolowski, Amy; Santillana, Mauricio; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yu, Hongjie; Tatem, Andrew J",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511601/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843,406

It is widely used for biological applications and is being harnessed to silence mRNAs encoding pathogenic proteins for therapy. Various methods — including delivering RNA oligonucleotides and expressing RNAi triggers from viral vectors — have been developed for successful RNAi in cell culture and in vivo. Recently, RNAi-based gene silencing approaches have been demonstrated in humans, and ongoing clinical trials hold promise for treating fatal disorders or providing alternatives to traditional small molecule therapies.

Seroepidemiologic studies have shown that these viruses are widely distributed throughout the world, but their incidence in Spain has not been determined. In transplant patients, early detection and treatment of viral infections may influence prognosis and survival, because they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including graft failure. Methods We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of WU and KI polyomaviruses among patients undergoing hematologic or solid organ transplant in the Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla (Santander, Spain). An in-house polymerase chain reaction with the use of specific primers was carried out in invasive lower respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with suspected respiratory infection and/or graft dysfunction and compared with asymptomatic transplant patients. Results Overall, we obtained 5.5% KI-positive samples and 1.4% WU-positive samples, with a higher prevalence of WU and KI polyomaviruses in the symptomatic population compared with the control group. Although the data suggest that their detection in respiratory samples is sporadic and often associated with other microorganisms, we should pay special attention to their association with cases of graft failure. Studies are needed with a larger number of samples to explore the potential clinical impact of these emerging polyomaviruses in transplant recipients.","Gozalo-Margüello, M.; Agüero-Balbín, J.; Martínez-Martínez, L.",Transplantation Proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.11.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004113451401269X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004113451401269X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25645772/,406

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population. As the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, quantifying the impact of interventions will be a vital consideration for the appropriate use of mitigation strategies.","Imai, Natsuko; Gaythorpe, Katy A.M.; Abbott, Sam; Bhatia, Sangeeta; van Elsland, Sabine; Prem, Kiesha; Liu, Yang; Ferguson, Neil M.",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15808.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529040/,406

Although oseltamivir resistance rates vary from region to region, 16% of isolates tested globally were found to be oseltamivir resistant by a histidine to tyrosine mutation of residue 275 of the neuraminidase gene of influenza A. In order to implement effective resistance testing locally a novel real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of the H275Y mutation. To evaluate this method, 40 oseltamivir resistant and 61 oseltamivir sensitive H1N1 influenza isolates were tested using Sanger sequencing, which is the reference method for detection of resistance, pyrosequencing and the novel H275Y RT-PCR assay. In comparison to Sanger sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity of the H275Y RT-PCR assay were 100% (40/40) and 100% (61/61) respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing were 100% (40/40) and 97.5% (60/61) respectively.

643066,An Unforeseen Hazard of Masks Being in Vogue,2020-10-26,"Background. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus. Although antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early during the infection, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed regarding magnitude and persistence of antibody titer against different viral proteins and their correlation with the strength of the immune response, as measured by serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods. An ELISA assay has been developed by expressing and purifying the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Soluble Ectodomain (Spike), and full length nucleocapsid protein (N protein). Sera from healthcare workers affected by non-severe COVID-19 were longitudinally collected over four weeks, and compared to sera from patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects for the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies as well as soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in the sera. Results. Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assays were high for anti-RBD IgG and IgA (92-97%) and slightly lower for IgM and the Spike and N proteins (70-85%). The ELISA allowed quantification of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody responses against all the viral antigens tested and showed a correlation between magnitude of the antibody response and disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects showed lower antibody titers and blood pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles as compared to patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), irrespective of the antibodies tested. Noteworthy, in non-severe COVID-19 infections, antibody titers against RBD and Spike, but not against the N protein, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased within a month after viral clearance. Conclusions. Rapid decline in antibody titers and in pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a common feature of non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that antibody-mediated protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is of short duration. These results suggest caution in use serological testing to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population.","Bruni, M.; Cecatiello, V.; Diaz-Basabe, A.; Lattanzi, G.; Mileti, E.; Monzani, S.; Pirovano, L.; Rizzelli, F.; Visintin, C.; Bonizzi, G.; Giani, M.; Lavitrano, M.; Faravelli, S.; Forneris, F.; Caprioli, F.; Pelicci, P.

The detailed biological features of this attenuated virus remain to be further investigated. Experimental inoculation with EIAV(DLV121) did not result in clinical symptoms even with immunosuppressive treatment in our previous studies. Here, we further investigated whether the replication of the vaccine strain EIAV(DLV121) in experimentally infected horses causes histopathological lesions to develop in the targeted organs. Both the lungs and the spleen have been demonstrated to support EIAV replication. By evaluating the gross macroscopic and histological changes, we found that EIAV(DLV121) did not cause detectable histopathological lesions and that it replicated several hundred times more slowly than its parental virulent strain, EIAV(LN40), in tissues. Immunochemical assays of these tissues indicated that the primary target cells of EIAV(DLV121) were monocytes/macrophages, but that EIAV(LN40) also infected alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, both of these viral strains promoted the up- and down-regulation of the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, implicating the potential involvement of these cellular factors in the pathological outcomes of EIAV infection and host immune responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the EIAV vaccine strain does not cause obvious histopathological lesions or clinical symptoms and that it induces a unique cytokine response profile. These features are considered essential for EIAV(DLV121) to function as an effective live vaccine.","Liu, Qiang; Ma, Jian; Wang, Xue-Feng; Xiao, Fei; Li, Li-Jia; Zhang, Jiao-Er; Lin, Yue-Zhi; Du, Cheng; He, Xi-Jun; Wang, Xiaojun; Zhou, Jian-Hua",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016524271630006X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016524271630006X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26832985/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.01.006,406

This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China. Methods: In this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter [≤] 2.5 m (PM2.5) and [≤] 10 m (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results. Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 g/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and 1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 g/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively.

However, for large and complex systems we usually have only partial knowledge about the network, the coupling functions, and the interactions with the environment governing the dynamic behavior. This incomplete knowledge induces structural model errors which can in turn be the cause of erroneous model predictions or misguided interpretations. Uncovering the location of such structural model errors in large networks can be a daunting task for a modeler. Here, we present a data driven method to search for structural model errors and to confine their position in large and complex dynamic networks. We introduce a coherence measure for pairs of network nodes, which indicates, how difficult it is to distinguish these nodes as sources of an error. By clustering network nodes into coherence groups and inferring the cluster inputs we can decide, which cluster is affected by an error. We demonstrate the utility of our method for the C. elegans neural network, for a signal transduction model for UV-B light induced morphogenesis and for synthetic examples.","Kahl, Dominik; Kschischo, Maik",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.612590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33505318/,406

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals may be asymptomatic or may experience mild, moderate, or severe symptoms with or without pneumonia. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects humans are largely unknown. Mouse hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1)-induced infection was used as a highly relevant surrogate animal model for this study. We further characterized this animal model and compared it with SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. MHV-1 inoculated mice displayed death as well as weight loss, as reported earlier. We showed that MHV-1-infected mice at days 7–8 exhibit severe lung inflammation, peribronchiolar interstitial infiltration, bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis and intra-alveolar necrotic debris, alveolar exudation (surrounding alveolar walls have capillaries that are dilated and filled with red blood cells), mononuclear cell infiltration, hyaline membrane formation, the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and interstitial edema. When compared to uninfected mice, the infected mice showed severe liver vascular congestion, luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, hepatocyte degeneration, cell necrosis, and hemorrhagic changes. Proximal and distal tubular necrosis, hemorrhage in interstitial tissue, and the vacuolation of renal tubules were observed. The heart showed severe interstitial edema, vascular congestion, and dilation, as well as red blood cell extravasation into the interstitium. Upon examination of the MHV-1 infected mice brain, we observed congested blood vessels, perivascular cavitation, cortical pericellular halos, vacuolation of neuropils, darkly stained nuclei, pyknotic nuclei, and associated vacuolation of the neuropil in the cortex, as well as acute eosinophilic necrosis and necrotic neurons with fragmented nuclei and vacuolation in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the widespread thrombotic events observed in the surrogate animal model for SARS-CoV-2 mimic the reported findings in SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, representing a highly relevant and safe animal model for the study of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 for potential therapeutic interventions.","Paidas, Michael J.; Mohamed, Adhar B.; Norenberg, Michael D.; Saad, Ali; Barry, Ariel Faye; Colon, Cristina; Kenyon, Norma Sue; Jayakumar, Arumugam R.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578284/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091703,406

Lapatinib and other pan-ErbB inhibitors suppress replication of SARS-CoV-2 and unrelated viruses with a high barrier to resistance. ErbB4, but not lapatinib’s cancer targets ErbB1 and ErbB2, is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry and encephalitis alphavirus infection and is a molecular target mediating lapatinib’s antiviral effect. In human lung organoids, lapatinib protects from SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of pathways implicated in non-infectious acute lung injury and fibrosis downstream of ErbBs (p38-MAPK, MEK/ERK, and AKT/mTOR), pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and epithelial barrier injury.

Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. DESIGN: DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. R(eff) and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. RESULTS: DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination.","Stapelberg, Nicolas J.

We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12,476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31, 2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein, a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients, individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold (a proxy for higher virus load) and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429 and B.1.427 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), and R.1) also increased rapidly, although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases (n=207) in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes, including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate, our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area, documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston, and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.","Olsen, Randall J.; Christensen, Paul A.; Long, S.

648843,A survey study of the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physician parents,2021-08-30,"Coronavirus disease 2019 has developed into a dramatic pandemic with tremendous global impact. The receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for infection. As ACE2 receptors are highly conserved within vertebrate species, SARS-CoV-2 can infect significant animal species as well as human populations. An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes isolated from human and significant animal species was conducted to compare and identify mutation and adaptation patterns across different animal species. The phylogenetic data revealed seven distinct phylogenetic clades with no significant relationship between the clades and geographical locations. A high rate of variation within SARS-CoV-2 mink isolates implies that mink populations were infected before human populations. Positions of most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes from the different hosts are mostly accumulated in the RBM region and highlight the pronounced accumulation of variants with mutations in the RBM region in comparison with other variants. These SNPs play a crucial role in viral transmission and pathogenicity and are keys in identifying other animal species as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The possible roles in the emergence of new viral strains and the possible implications of these changes, in compromising vaccine effectiveness, deserve urgent considerations.","Ghorbani, Abozar; Samarfard, Samira; Eskandarzade, Neda; Afsharifar, Alireza; Eskandari, Mohammad Hadi; Niazi, Ali; Izadpanah, Keramatollah; Karbanowicz, Thomas P",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885726/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab144,406

The rapid onset of a systemic pro-inflammatory state followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We performed a retrospective observational study to explore the capacity of different complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammation indexes to predict in-hospital mortality in this group. Methods. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR), neutrophil to lymphocyte × platelet ratio (NLPR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic inflammation index (SII), and the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI) were calculated on hospital admission in 119 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Results. Non-survivors had significantly higher AISI, dNLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI values when compared to survivors. Similarly, Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed significantly lower survival in patients with higher AISI, dNLR, MLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI. However, after adjusting for confounders, only the SII remained significantly associated with survival (HR = 1.0001; 95% CI, 1.0000–1.0001, p = 0.029) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusions. The SII on admission independently predicts in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients and may assist with early risk stratification in this group.","Fois, Alessandro G.; Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Scano, Valentina; Cau, Stefania; Babudieri, Sergio; Perra, Roberto; Ruzzittu, Giulia; Zinellu, Elisabetta; Pirina, Pietro; Carru, Ciriaco; Arru, Luigi B.; Fancellu, Alessandro; Mondoni, Michele; Mangoni, Arduino A.; Zinellu, Angelo",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25235725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291581/,406
650340,The Nutritional and Health Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Diabetes Mellitus,2020-09-30,"We present an approach to extend the Endemic-Epidemic (EE) modelling framework for the analysis of infectious disease data. In its spatiotemporal application, spatial dependencies have originally been captured by a power law applied to static neighbourhood matrices. We propose to adjust these weight matrices over time to reflect changes in spatial connectivity between geographical units. We illustrate this extension by modelling the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between Swiss and bordering Italian regions in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adjust the spatial weights with data describing the daily changes in population mobility patterns, and indicators of border closures describing the state of travel restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic. We use these time-dependent weights to fit an EE model to the region-stratified time series of new COVID-19 cases. We then adjust the weight matrices to reflect two counterfactual scenarios of border closures and draw counterfactual predictions based on these, to retrospectively assess the usefulness of border closures. We observed that predictions based on a scenario where no closure of the Swiss-Italian border occurred, yielded double the number of cumulative cases over the study period. Conversely, a closure of the Swiss-Italian border two weeks earlier than implemented, would have only marginally reduced the number of cases and merely delayed the epidemic spread by a couple weeks. Despite limitations in the current study, we believe it provides useful insight into modelling the effect of epidemic countermeasures on the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19.","Grimee, M.; Bekker-Nielsen Dunbar, M.; Hofmann, F.; Held, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257329; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.19.21257329v1?rss=1,406

Evidence-based interventions to address these risk factors exist, but often as a separate and overlapping package. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a common elements-based intervention to improve mother–infant interaction at 12 months post-partum. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, single-blinded, individual randomised controlled trial is being carried out in the community settings of the rural subdistrict of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. 250 pregnant women in third trimester with distress (Self-Reporting Questionnaire, cut-off score >9) have been randomised on 1:1 allocation ratio into intervention (n=125) and treatment-as-usual arms (n=125). The participants in the intervention arm will receive 15 individual sessions of intervention on a monthly basis by non-specialist facilitators. The intervention involves components of early stimulation, learning through play, responsive feeding, guided discovery using pictures, behavioural activation and problem solving. The primary outcome is caregiver–infant interaction at 12 months postpartum. The secondary outcomes include maternal psychological well-being, quality of life, social support and empowerment. Infant secondary outcomes include growth, nutrition and development. The data will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months postpartum. A qualitative process evaluation will be conducted to inform the feasibility of intervention delivery. ETHICS: Ethics approval for the present study was obtained from the Human Development Research Foundation Institutional Review Board, Islamabad Pakistan. DISSEMINATION: If proven effective, the study will contribute to scale-up care for maternal and child mental health in low resource settings, globally. The findings of the present study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and community forums.

There is no therapeutic FDA-approved drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection, although a combination of anti-viral drugs is directly being practiced in some countries. A broad-spectrum of antiviral agents are being currently evaluated in clinical trials, and in this review, we specifically focus on the application of Remdesivir (RVD) as a potential anti-viral compound against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) -CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. First, we overview the general information about SARS-CoV-2, followed by application of RDV as a nucleotide analogue which can potentially inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of COVs. Afterwards, we discussed the kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models which is significantly different compared to that in humans. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective on the application of RDV either alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents against CoVs infection were surveyed to determine the efficiency of RDV in preclinical trials. As a result, this paper provides crucial evidence of the potency of RDV to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

While quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) is the most reliable method to detect viral genes of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for specific antiviral antibodies are also important as they identify false negative qRT–PCR responses, track how effectively the patient’s immune system is fighting the infection, and are potentially helpful for plasma transfusion therapies. In this work, based on the principle of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), we develop an opto-microfluidic sensing platform with gold nanospikes, fabricated by electrodeposition, to detect the presence and amount of antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 1 [Formula: see text] L of human plasma diluted in 1 mL of buffer solution, within [Formula: see text] 30 min. The target antibody concentration can be correlated with the LSPR wavelength peak shift of gold nanospikes caused by the local refractive index change due to the antigen-antibody binding. This label-free microfluidic platform achieves a limit of detection of [Formula: see text] 0.08 ng/mL ([Formula: see text] 0.5 pM), falling under the clinical relevant concentration range.

Of the many technologies available, fusion deposition modelling (FDM) is considered of the lowest cost and higher reproducibility and accessibility, offering clear advantages in drug delivery. FDM requires in-house production of filaments of drug-containing thermoplastic polymers by hot-melt extrusion (HME), and the prospect of connecting the two technologies has been under investigation. The ability to integrate HME and FDM and predict and tailor the filaments’ properties will extend the range of printable polymers/formulations. Hence, this work revises the properties of the most common pharmaceutical-grade polymers used and their effect on extrudability, printability, and printing outcome, providing suitable processing windows for different raw materials. As a result, formulation selection will be more straightforward (considering the characteristics of drug and desired dosage form or release profile) and the processes setup will be more expedite (avoiding or mitigating typical processing issues), thus guaranteeing the success of both HME and FDM.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P < .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma.

Cumulative incidence is usually estimated from seroprevalence data, where seropositives are defined by an arbitrary threshold antibody level, and adjusted for sensitivity and specificity at that threshold. This does not account for antibody waning nor for lower antibody levels in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Mixture modelling can estimate cumulative incidence from antibody-level distributions without requiring adjustment for sensitivity and specificity. To illustrate the bias in standard threshold-based seroprevalence estimates, we compared both approaches using data from several Kenyan serosurveys. Compared to the mixture model estimate, threshold analysis underestimated cumulative incidence by 31% (IQR: 11 to 41) on average.

Although BL has existed for over a decade, there are still several challenges associated with it. For instance, the teachers’ and students’ individual differences, such as their behaviors and attitudes, might impact their adoption of BL. These challenges are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as schools and universities had to combine both online and offline courses to keep up with health regulations. This study conducts a systematic review of systematic reviews on BL, based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, to identify BL trends, gaps and future directions. The obtained findings highlight that BL was mostly investigated in higher education and targeted students in the first place. Additionally, most of the BL research is coming from developed countries, calling for cross-collaborations to facilitate BL adoption in developing countries in particular.

657727,Disaster management of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-24,"Assays to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies are important to monitor seroprevalence, to study asymptomatic infections and to reveal (intermediate) hosts. A recently developed assay, the surrogate virus-neutralization test (sVNT) is a quick and commercially available alternative to the 'gold standard' virus neutralization assay using authentic virus, and does not require processing at BSL-3 level. The assay relies on the inhibition of binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) by antibodies present in sera. As the sVNT does not require species- or isotype-specific conjugates, it can be similarly used for antibody detection in human and animal sera. In this study, we used 298 sera from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 151 sera from patients confirmed with other coronavirus or other (respiratory) infections, to evaluate the performance of the sVNT. To analyze the use of the assay in a One Health setting, we studied the presence of RBD-binding antibodies in 154 sera from nine animal species (cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, ferrets, rabbits, hamsters, cats, cattle, mink and dromedary camels). The sVNT showed a moderate to high sensitivity and a high specificity using sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients (91.3% and 100%, respectively) and animal sera (93.9% and 100%), however it lacked sensitivity to detect low titers. Significant correlations were found between the sVNT outcomes and PRNT50 and the Wantai total Ig and IgM ELISAs. While species-specific validation will be essential, our results show that the sVNT holds promise in detecting RBD-binding antibodies in multiple species.","Embregts, C. W.

This study aimed to determine whether B.1.617.2 was also displacing B.1.1.7 in the United States. We analyzed PCR testing results and viral sequencing results of samples collected across the United States, and showed that B.1.1.7 was rapidly being displaced and is no longer responsible for the majority of new cases. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases that are B.1.1.7 dropped from 70% in April 2021 to 42% in just 6 weeks. Our analysis showed rapid growth of variants B.1.617.2 and P.1 as the primary drivers for this displacement. Currently, the growth rate of B.1.617.2 was higher than P.1 in the US (0.61 vs. 0.22), which is consistent with reports from other countries. Lastly, we showed that B.1.617.2 was growing faster in counties with a lower vaccination rate.","Bolze, A.; Cirulli, E. T.; Luo, S.; White, S.; Cassens, T.; Jacobs, S.; Nguyen, J.; Ramirez, J.

METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 81 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. The texture features were extracted using LK2.1. The two-sample t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used to find the significant features. Minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR) method was performed to find the features with maximum correlation and minimum redundancy. These features were then used to construct a radiomics texture model to discriminate the severe patients using multivariate logistic regression method. Besides, a clinical model was also built. ROC analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of two models. The correlations of clinical features and textural features were analyzed using the Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: Of the total cases included, 60 were common and 21 were severe. (1) For textural features, 20 radiomics features selected by MRMR showed good performance in discriminating the two groups (AUC > 70%). (2) For clinical features, chi-square tests or Mann–Whitney U tests identified 16 clinical features as significant, and 12 were discriminative (p < 0.05) between two groups analyzed by univariate logistic analysis. Of these, 10 had an AUC > 70%. (3) Prediction models for textural features and clinical features were established, and both showed high predictive accuracy. The AUC values of textural features and clinical features were 0.93 (0.86–1.00) and 0.95 (0.95–0.99), respectively. (4) The Spearman correlation analysis showed that most textural and clinical features had above-moderate correlations with disease severity (> 0.4). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis can provide reliable and objective information for differential diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • CT texture analysis can well differentiate common and severe COVID-19 patients. • Some textural features showed above-moderate correlations with clinical factors. • CT texture analysis can provide useful information to judge the severity of COVID-19.

Objective Characterize the course of COVID-19 in psoriasis and identify factors associated with hospitalization. Methods Clinicians reported psoriasis patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 via an international registry, PsoProtect. Multiple logistic regression assessed the association between clinical/demographic characteristics and hospitalization. A separate patient-facing registry characterized risk-mitigating behaviours. Results Of 374 clinician-reported patients from 25 countries, 71% were receiving a biologic, 18% a non-biologic and 10% no systemic treatment for psoriasis. 348 (93%) fully recovered from COVID-19, 77 (21%) were hospitalized and nine (2%) died. Increased hospitalization risk was associated with older age (multivariable-adjusted OR 1.59 per 10 years, 95% CI 1.19-2.13), male sex (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.23-5.12), non-white ethnicity (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.24-8.03) and comorbid chronic lung disease (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.52-9.83). Hospitalization was more frequent in patients using non-biologic systemic therapy than biologics (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31-6.18). No significant differences were found between biologic classes. Independent patient-reported data (n=1,626 across 48 countries) suggested lower levels of social isolation in individuals receiving non-biologic systemic therapy compared to biologics (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.94). Conclusion In this international moderate-severe psoriasis case series, biologics use was associated with lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization than non-biologic systemic therapies, however further investigation is warranted due to potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding. Established risk factors (being older, male, non-white ethnicity, comorbidities) were associated with higher hospitalization rates. Clinical Implications We identify risk factors for COVID-19-related hospitalization in psoriasis patients, including older age, male sex, non-white ethnicity and comorbidities. Use of biologics was associated with lower hospitalization risk than non-biologic systemic therapies.","Mahil, Satveer K.; Dand, Nick; Mason, Kayleigh J.; Yiu, Zenas ZN.; Tsakok, Teresa; Meynell, Freya; Coker, Bola; McAteer, Helen; Moorhead, Lucy; Mackenzie, Teena; Rossi, Maria Teresa; Rivera, Raquel; Mahe, Emmanuel; Carugno, Andrea; Magnano, Michela; Rech, Giulia; Balogh, Esther A.; Feldman, Steven R.; De La Cruz, Claudia; Choon, Siew Eng; Naldi, Luigi; Lambert, Jo; Spuls, Phyllis; Jullien, Denis; Bachelez, Hervé; McMahon, Devon E.; Freeman, Esther E.; Gisondi, Paolo; Puig, Luis; Warren, Richard B.; Di Meglio, Paola; Langan, Sinéad M.; Capon, Francesca; Griffiths, Christopher EM.; Barker, Jonathan N.; Smith, Catherine H.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075408/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920314135?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920314135; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.10.007,406
660151,'Young saplings on fire' newly graduated nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pressing phenomenon whose consequences are associated with severe physical and mental health outcomes. Every minute, around 24 people in the United States are raped, physically injured, or emotionally abused by their intimate partner. Although having experienced IPV is not modifiable, emotional support is a protective factor to prevent victims from committing suicide. The psychological state of IPV victims is critical in post-traumatic events and this is evidenced in numerous qualitative interviews. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the association between IPV with emotional support, life satisfaction, and perceived health status in the United States. METHODS: This study analyzed the data from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for factors associated with IPV. Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25. RESULTS: The analyses show that there is a strong association between IPV experience and emotional support (AOR:1.810; 95% CI = 1.626–2.015). Participants who had either physical violence or unwanted sex with an intimate partner in the past 12 months have 2.28 higher odds to receive less emotional support and 2.05 higher odds to perceive poor life satisfaction. Also, participants who reported experiencing IPV were associated with (AOR: 3.12; 95% CI =2.68–3.62) times the odds of having ≥6 days more mentally unhealthy days in a month. For perceived health outcomes, people who had been threatened with violence by a sex partner have 1.74 (95% CI =1.54–1.96) times the odds of having poor perceived general health status. IPV survivors have 3.12 (95% CI =2.68–3.62) times the odds of having ≥6 days more mentally unhealthy days in a month. CONCLUSIONS: People reported with any IPV experience are more likely to receive less emotional support, perceive dissatisfaction in life, and poor health outcomes. This study shows the need for policies centered on the development of interventions that focus on mental health for those who have experienced IPV.","Hui, Vivian; Constantino, Rose Eva",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794819/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10665-4,406
660647,The COVID‐19 epidemic,2020-02-16,"While cardiovascular disease has been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no studies have described its clinical course in patients with aortic stenosis who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Numerous observational studies have reported an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their associations with the ABO blood group served as the main outcome measures. Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before 1 January 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Of them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariable analysis identified the A blood group (vs. others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio (OR) = 6.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.11−18.92; p = 0.001). The A blood group (vs. others; OR = 8.27; 95% CI = 1.83−37.43, p = 0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95% CI = 1.64−15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and/or death). We conclude that patients who have undergone TAVR frequently have a number of cardiovascular comorbidities that may work to increase the risk of COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to developing the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.","Kibler, Marion; Dietrich, Laurent; Kanso, Mohamad; Carmona, Adrien; Marchandot, Benjamin; Matsushita, Kensuke; Trimaille, Antonin; How-Choong, Cécile; Odier, Albane; Gennesseaux, Gabrielle; Schramm, Ophélie; Reydel, Antje; Hess, Sébastien; Sato, Chisato; Caillard, Sophie; Jesel, Laurence; Morel, Olivier; Ohlmann, Patrick",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266474/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113769,406

661689,Deaths in healthcare workers due to COVID‐19: the need for robust data and analysis,2020-05-23,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) infection is a recently emerged viral infection causing predominantly mild upper respiratory symptoms. However, in some instances, it might result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that poses a significant mortality risk. ARDS is postulated to be mediated by a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a dysregulated hyper inflammatory response. Colchicine being an anti-inflammatory agent, might mitigate this dysregulated response. Thus, in the absence of therapeutic options available to manage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is imperative to ascertain the effect of colchicine on improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: We will perform a systematic review including a search of the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and google scholar since inception. We will include randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of colchicine on the efficacy and safety outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Subsequently, we will perform a meta-analysis utilizing the random-effects to ascertain the effect of colchicine on reducing COVID-19 related mortality (primary endpoint) and other efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Our review results are anticipated in early 2021 (based on the completion of several ongoing randomized controlled trial). Our review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis, is exploring the effect of colchicine on the efficacy and safety outcomes of COVID-19 patients. If colchicine proved to be effective, it would be a significant milestone in the management of COVID-19, a disease with limited available therapeutic options.

These issues are even more felt and evident in fragile patients, as those affected by neuromuscular disease. An important help came from new digital technologies that allow clinicians to remotely monitor health status and any deterioration of chronically ill patients. METHODS: In this mini-review, an initiative of the “Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group” of the Italian Society of Neurology, we propose to analyze the approach to neuromuscular patients by looking over raising evidence on the main cornerstones of Telemedicine (TM): clinician-patient interaction, remote clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and digital therapeutics. In particular, we explored the strategies developed by researchers and their impact on the physical and emotional status of the patients, with particular focusing on their adherence to the program of virtual monitoring. RESULTS: TM plays an important role in each of four stages of approach to neuromuscular disease, having demonstrated validity in keep close clinical patient interaction, clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and telerehabilitation. Nevertheless, there is no remote alternative to electrophysiological testing neither validate tools to assess disability. CONCLUSION: The role of TM in neuromuscular care is yet underestimated but is crucial, beyond the pandemic era. Further development of TM is advisable, through making specific apps, remotely controlled by clinicians, and making more engaging clinicians-patients interaction.

Correspondence between self-attributions about changes in drinking and longitudinal changes in drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Medical insurance and social security cards are an important incentive for the floating population to live a stable life in their current residence, but there has been little studies on their effect on settlement intentions. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to study the impact of basic medical insurance for urban employees and application for personal social security cards on the settlement intentions of the floating population. With the increase of the desire to settle, the health management and the development of public health will be improved. METHODS: Based on the 2017 survey data from the dynamic monitoring of China's floating population, we explored the influence of basic medical insurance for urban employees and social security cards on the floating population's settlement intentions. Additionally, this study also examined the comprehensive causal relationship, with social integration as the mediator variable. We used SPSS 21.0 software. The input method was used to analyze the influence of the above variables by binary logistic regression. Then we used AMOS22.0 software to establish the structural equation model of the relationship between the above three independent variables. Finally, we used bootstrapping method to analyze the direct effect, indirect effect and total effect of independent variables on settlement intention. RESULTS: The settlement intention of members of the floating population after participating in basic medical insurance for urban employees was 23.2% higher than that of those who did not participate. The decision as to whether to apply for a personal social security card is related to their settlement intention. The standardized regression coefficients among social insurance and security, social integration, and settlement intention were positive values, and the Z values of the overall effect, indirect effect, and direct effect were all greater than 1.96; the confidence interval of the indirect effect did not include 0. We found that this model is a partial intermediary model, with an intermediary ratio of 10.66%. CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights the important impact of basic medical insurance for urban employees and individual social security cards on the floating population. The conclusions of this study provide suggestions for the government to use when designing policies to enhance the settlement intentions of the floating population and to improve the development of public health undertakings.","Li, Yulin; Huang, Lingling; Xiang, Li; Dou, Dongmei",Cost Eff Resour Alloc,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12962-021-00321-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627281/,406

In this work, we report the main glycosidic modifications that occur during the maturation of porcine tissues, involving the sialylation process as determined with lectins. Sialic acids were identified at several levels in a broad range of cell types of nervous, respiratory, genitourinary and lymphoid origin. Nevertheless, the most contrasting was the type of glycosidic linkage between 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and galactose (Gal) expressed in central nervous system (CNS). Newborn CNS abundantly expressed Neu5Acα2,3Gal, but weakly or scarcely expressed Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc. Maturation of CNS induced drastic changes in sialic acid expression. These changes include decrease or complete loss of NeuAcα2,3Gal residues, mainly in olfactory structures and brain cortex, which were replaced by their isomers Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc. In the brain cortex and cerebellum, the increase of Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc molecules was paralleled by an increase of 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). In addition, terminal Gal and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues also increased their expression in adult CNS tissues, but this was more significant in structures forming the encephalic trunk. Our results show that sialylation of porcine CNS is finely modulated throughout the maturation process.","Vallejo, Verónica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Hernández, Jesús; Ramírez, Humberto; Delannoy, Philippe; Zenteno, Edgar",Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007184/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049100002133; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305049100002133,406
664186,An implementation science approach to evaluating pathogen whole genome sequencing in public health,2021-07-28,"Introduction The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had deleterious effects on our healthcare system. Lockdown measures have decreased the number of patients presenting to the hospital for non-respiratory illnesses, such as strokes. Moreover, there appears to be a racial disparity among those afflicted with the virus. We sought to assess whether this disparity also existed for patients presenting with strokes. Methods The Get with the Guidelines National Stroke Database was reviewed to assess patients presenting with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or spontaneous/nontraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). The period of February - May 2020 was chosen given the surge of patients affected with the virus and national shutdowns. Data from this same time during 2019 was used as the control population. Our hospital numbers and four additional regions were assessed (California hospitals, Pacific State hospitals, Western Region hospitals, and all hospitals in the United States). Patients were categorized by race (White, Black/African American, Asian, Native American, Hispanic) in each cohort. The primary endpoint of this study is to compare whether there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients in each reported racial category presenting with stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results A downward trend in total number of patients was noted in all five regional cohorts assessed. A statistically significant increase in the number of Black and Hispanic patients presenting with strokes was noted in California, Pacific hospitals, Western hospitals, and all hospitals in the United States during various months studied comparing 2020 to 2019. A statistically significant increase in the Hispanic population was noted in February and March in all California hospitals (p=0.005 and 0.02, respectively) and Pacific Coast hospitals (p=0.005 and 0.039, respectively). The Western region and all national hospitals noted a significant increase in strokes in the Hispanic population in April (p=0.039 and 0.023, respectively). A statistically significant increase of strokes in the Black population was noted in April in Pacific hospitals, Western region hospitals, and all national hospitals (p=0.039, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected certain racial groups more than others. A similar increase is noted in patients presenting with strokes in these specific racial populations. Moreover, lack of testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be missing a possible link between racial disparity for patients infected with the virus and patients presenting with stroke. The authors advocate for widespread testing for all patients to further assess this correlation.","Ghanchi, Hammad; Patchana, Tye; Wiginton, James; Browne, Jonathan D; Ohno, Ai; Farahmandian, Ronit; Duong, Jason; Cortez, Vladimir; Miulli, Dan E",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062492/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10369,406

However, given the threat of nosocomial disease spread, the use of ultrasound is no longer risk-free. Objective of the Review: Here, we review the lung POCUS findings in patients with COVID-19. In doing so we present a scanning protocol for lung POCUS in COVID-19 which maximizes clinical utility and provider safety. Discussion In COVID-19 lung, POCUS findings are predominatly located in the posterior and lateral lung zones bilaterally. A 6-zone scanning protocol which prioritizes obtaining images in these locations optimizes provider positioning, and minimizes time spent scanning which can reduce risk to health care workers performing POCUS. Conclusions Lung POCUS can offer valuable clinical data when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Scanning protocols such as that presented here which target clinical utility and decreased nosocomial disease spread must be prioritized.","Duggan, Nicole M.; Shokoohi, Hamid; Liteplo, Andrew S.; Huang, Calvin; Goldsmith, Andrew J.",J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713618/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.06.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467920305825?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467920305825,406

Since then, more than eighty antiviral drugs have received FDA approval, half of which treat HIV infection. Here, we provide a retrospective analysis of approved antiviral drugs, including therapeutics against other major chronic infections such as hepatitis B and C, and herpes viruses, over the last thirty years. During this time, only a few drugs were approved to treat acute viral infections, mainly influenza. Analysis of these approved antiviral drugs based on molecular class and mode of action shows that a large majority are small molecules and direct-acting agents as opposed to proteins, peptides, or oligonucleotides and host-targeting therapies. In addition, approvals of combination therapies accelerated over the last five years. We also provide a prospective study of future potential antiviral therapies, based on current clinical research pipelines across the pharmaceutical industry. Comparing past drug approvals with current clinical candidates hints at the future evolution in antiviral therapies and reveals how antiviral medicines are often discovered. Overall, this work helps forecast future trends and innovation in the field of antiviral research and development.","Chaudhuri, Shuvam; Symons, Julian A.; Deval, Jerome",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29758235/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218301803; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218301803,406

As COVID-19 infection can affect multiple organ systems, treating many manifestations and complications requires clinical expertise across the healthcare professional spectrum. Therefore, interprofessional and multidisciplinary collaboration should form the cornerstone of every hospital’s COVID-19 management approach. In this manuscript, we discuss the non-microbial management strategies for our COVID-19 inpatient population. Specifically, through an inter-professional and collaborative approach to care delivery, we provide rationale and guidance on prone positioning, oxygen strategies, early mobilization, identifying and treating co-infections, anticoagulation and ensuring appropriate psychological support for patients and their families. It is our hope that these recommendations help supporting clinician management decisions to best care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the region and worldwide.","Abu Haleeqa, Mohamed; Alshamsi, Iman; Al habib, Ammar; Noshi, Mohamed; Abdullah, Shazia; Kamour, Ashraf; Ibrahim, Halah",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s264168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32943872/,406

METHODS: Forty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: artemisinin-piperaquine (AP) group (n=23) and control group (n=18). The primary outcome was the time taken to reach undetectable levels of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the percentage of participants with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 on day 7, 10, 14, and 28. The computed tomography (CT) imaging changes within ten days, the corrected QT interval changes, adverse events, and abnormal laboratory parameters were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean time to reach undetectable viral RNA (mean± standard deviation) was 10.6±1.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4-12.8) for AP group and 19.3±2.1 days (95% CI: 15.1-23.5) for the control group. The percentage of patients with undetectable viral RNA on day 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 were 26.1%, 43.5%, 78.3%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, in the AP group and 5.6%, 16.7%, 44.4%, 55.6% and 72.2%, respectively, in the control group. The CT imaging within ten days post-treatment showed no significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Both groups had mild adverse events.

667116,We should beware of ignoring uncomfortable possible truths (a reply to McManus et al),2020-06-08,"Publisher Summary This chapter explores the fundamental obligation of governments to protect health. This obligation extends not only to the provision of health care or to the control of infectious disease outbreaks, but also to the cessation of human rights violations that contribute to poor health or disease risk. The relationship between the health status of a population and the behavior of the government under which that population lives is important during war or civil crisis settings, and in the context of chronic health issues such as nutrition, famine, and child mortality. As measured by indicators such as accountability, stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, and the existence of an independent civil society, plays a significant role in health outcomes—a role independent of, and perhaps even superior to, host genetics, insect vectors, or individual behaviors. Famines stem not solely from bad weather or genetics, but also from the failure of governments to protect their populations from civil strife, or to equitably distribute food aid. Despite the widespread acceptance of these findings, the influence of governance on infectious disease spread has received far less attention. Both governance and health can be measured in many different ways, and one factor complicating efforts to measure the association between the two is the difficulty finding accurate, sensitive, and specific enough indicators for either variable. Broad measures of population health—such as life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality—have been chosen by a number of authors, in part because these indicators capture multiple specific diseases and are broadly distributed across the population.","Cohen, Jonathan; Amon, Joseph J.",The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704665500200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704665500200,406

However, the effect of syncytia in disease development is largely unknown. We established an in vitro cell-cell fusion system and used it to mimic the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with ACE2-expressing cells to form syncytia. We found that Caspase-9 was activated after syncytia formation, and Caspase-3/7 was activated downstream of Caspase-9, but it triggered GSDME-dependent pyroptosis rather than apoptosis. What is more, single cell RNA-sequencing data showed that both ACE2 and GSDME were expression in alveolar type 2 cells in human lung. We propose that pyroptosis is the fate of syncytia formed by SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells and ACE2-positive cells, which indicated that lytic death of syncytia may contribute to the excessive inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients.","Ma, Huabin; Zhu, Zhoujie; Lin, Huaipeng; Wang, Shanshan; Zhang, Peipei; Li, Yanguo; Li, Long; Wang, Jinling; Zhao, Yufen; Han, Jiahuai",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432853,406

METHODS: In this single‐centered retrospective study, demographic, clinical, and laboratory indicators on and during admission were compared among 74 participants with mild, moderate, critical severe, or severe classification. Risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed by multivariate analyses. The AUC and 95% CI of the ROC curve were calculated. RESULTS: The most common manifestations of these patients were fever and cough. Critical severe or severe group owned the longest length of stay (23 (19,31), p < 0.001). After multivariate logistic regression, independent influence factors on admission for severity of disease were CK‐MB (OR 0.674; 95% CI 0.489–0.928; p = 0.016), LDH (OR 1.111 or 1.107; 95% CI 1.026–1.204 or 1.022–1.199; p = 0.009 or 0.013), normal T‐BIL (OR 4.58 × 10(−8); 95% CI 3.05 × 10(−9)–6.88 × 10(−7); p < 0.001), LYM% (OR 0.008; 95% CI 0–0.602; p = 0.029), and normal ESR (OR 0.016; 95% CI 0–0.498; p = 0.019).

669602,Olfactory Virtual Reality: A New Frontier in the Treatment and Prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,2021-08-16,"Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is an economically important cattle disease with a world-wide distribution that is caused by BVD virus, a pestivirus of the flaviviridae family. BVD viruses are genetically highly variable. They are classified into two genetic species (BVDV-1 and -2) that are further divided into numerous subgroups, particularly for BVDV-1. The complexity of these viruses is also reflected in their interaction with the host animals. Infections are either transient or persistent and can cause a wide spectrum of clinical signs, from no or very mild disease to severe forms, reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers. In this work, we have analysed the clinical signs and the pathology of BVD viral infections in a cattle population where different subgroups of BVDV-1 genotype viruses are endemic. In addition, we have examined potential virulence properties of BVDV-1 subgroups during persistent infection by comparing the viral subgroups present in clinical cases with those detected in persistently infected (PI) animals sampled for epidemiological criteria, irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, the clinical and postmortem findings were compared with respect to genetic characteristics of the viruses isolated from these animals. Our results indicate that the BVDV positive animals fall roughly into two categories, depending on the primary organ affected and the age, with lung-centred pathology occurring mainly in young animals and mucosal pathology predominantly in older animals. Furthermore, we found a markedly higher proportion of representatives of the BVDV-1e subgroup in stillborn calves and aborted foetuses originating from epidemically unrelated cattle herds, suggesting that BVDV-1e may play a special role in prenatal and perinatal losses.","Bachofen, Claudia; Braun, Ueli; Hilbe, Monika; Ehrensperger, Felix; Stalder, Hanspeter; Peterhans, Ernst",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509004398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819088/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509004398,406

These are aspirational goals that together support a decent quality of life. Crossing monetary, ‘poverty thresholds’ may enable such goals. Most estimates of ‘where’ the monetary threshold lies derive the estimates circularly from monetary costs of living. The link to quality of living is thereby made by fiat, untested empirically in everyday human experience. We already know we can measure income independently of middle class quality of life, and probe for relationships between the two. Why not for poverty too? A quantity of money where quality of life changed would mark a genuine threshold required for example to escape from poverty traps. Using this approach, studies in quality of work–life, using multiple indicators, have identified at least three thresholds where quality of life ticked markedly upwards, including inter-threshold ranges where gradients went from zero to positive. The concept of work–life balance suggests that this approach may be usefully extended to include quality health care, education, and other SDGs in sustainability science.","Carr, Stuart Colin",Sustain Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00859-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32874354/,406

However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning 'trained immunity' has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any correlation. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any mandatory BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of Mycobacterium spp.(including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations is consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections per million population at all the time points evaluated [r(20): -0.5511 to -0.6338; p-value: 0.0118 to 0.0027].

672366,Psychiatric emergency services and non-acute psychiatric services utilization during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-08-08,"Introduction The current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak set new challenges to nearly all health plans and large health organizations worldwide, including movement restrictions, strict limitations in healthcare services, especially in the dental profession, and patient fears regarding potential infection. Telehealth can serve as an effective platform for remote connection between dental healthcare providers and patients, and can help reduce the risk of infection when social distancing is required. Objective The current study aimed to evaluate the quality of treatment provided via teledentistry, as perceived by patients using the service, as well as their willingness to use online distant medical consultation in the future. Methods Since March 2020, a new online service was implemented in the Oral Medicine Unit and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department in the Galilee Medical Center, to expand the range of services beyond merely emergency treatments. Results The current study examined the quality of teledentistry services as perceived by 89 patients participating in at least one teleconsultation, and their acceptance of remote healthcare. Satisfaction rates were high in patients who received both full and partial solution to their chief complaint. Moreover, acceptance of the teledentistry platform was high, even in the older age groups. Conclusions We propose to implement teledentistry services in current and future pandemics, as well as during routine times, to strengthen our health care system with digital technologies.","Watfa, Manal Obeid; Bernfeld, Nicole M.; Oren, Daniel; Shani, Tali; Zigron, Asaf; Sela, Eyal; Granot, Yigal; Dror, Amiel A.; Srouji, Samer",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667147621000182?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667147621000182,406

For such tasks, advanced IT infrastructures and intelligent AI systems are used, which allow supporting patients’ diagnosis and treatment. In our research, we also try to define efficient tools for coronavirus classification, especially using mathematical linguistic methods. This paper presents the ways of application of linguistics techniques in supporting effective management of medical data obtained during coronavirus treatments, and possibilities of application of such methods in classification of different variants of the coronaviruses detected for particular patients. Currently, several types of coronavirus are distinguished, which are characterized by differences in their RNA structure, which in turn causes an increase in the rate of mutation and infection with these viruses.","Ogiela, Marek R.; Ogiela, Urszula",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248290/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06286-y,406

Establishing the safety of new nanoparticle formulations is the first important step on the pathway to clinical translation. We have recently shown that plasma-polymerized nanoparticles (PPNs) are highly efficient nanocarriers and a viable, cost-effective alternative to conventional chemically synthesized nanoparticles. Here, we present the first comprehensive toxicity and biosafety study of PPNs using both established in vitro cell models and in vivo models. Overall, we show that PPNs were extremely well tolerated by all the cell types tested, significantly outperforming commercially available lipid-based nanoparticles (lipofectamine) used at the manufacturer’s recommended dosage. Supporting the in vitro data, the systemic toxicity of PPNs was negligible in BALB/c mice following acute and repeated tail-vein intravenous injections. PPNs were remarkably well tolerated in mice without any evidence of behavioral changes, weight loss, significant changes to the hematological profile, or signs of histological damage in tissues. PPNs were tolerated at extremely high doses without animal mortality observed at 6000 mg/kg and 48,000 mg/kg for acute and repeated-injection regimens, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the safety of PPNs in biological systems, adding to their future potential in biomedical applications.","Michael, Praveesuda L.; Lam, Yuen Ting; Hung, Juichien; Tan, Richard P.; Santos, Miguel; Wise, Steven G.",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11051176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947114/,406

Peptide immunotherapy focussing on the modulation of T cell responses by interfering with TCR-peptide-MHC complex formation requires the elucidation of the molecular basis of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions for an efficient design of modulatory peptides. In the Lewis rat most autoimmune-associated CD4+ T cell responses are MHC class II RT1.BL restricted. In this study, the characteristics of RT1.BL-peptide interactions were explored. A series of substitution analogs of two Lewis rat T cell epitopes was examined in a direct peptide-MHC binding assay on isolated RT1.BL molecules. Furthermore, other autoimmune-related as well as non-disease-related T cell epitopes were tested in the binding assay. This has led to the definition of an extended RT1.BL-peptide binding motif. The RT1.BL-peptide binding motif established in this study is the first described rat MHC-peptide binding motif based on direct MHC-peptide binding experiments. To predict good or intermediate RT1.BL binding peptides, T cell epitope search profiles were deduced from this motif. The motif and search profiles will greatly facilitate the prediction of modulatory peptides based on autoimmune-associated T cell epitopes and the identification of target structures in experimental autoimmune diseases in Lewis rats.","Wauben, M H; van der Kraan, M; Grosfeld-Stulemeyer, M C; Joosten, I",Int Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9040010/,406

The extent to which these disparities are related to socioeconomic versus biologic factors is largely unknown. We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID-19 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both black participants (odds ratio 3.4; 95%CI 2.4-4.9) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.1; 95%CI 1.5-3.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to white participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID-19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-4.8). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-white individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank. The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study.","Patel, A.

METHODS: For 5 weeks, we carried out a cross-sectional study consisting of telephone interviews of SLE patients. We collected epidemiological data, symptoms suggesting COVID-19, results of nasopharyngeal swabs, and ongoing treatments. In those patients who required hospital admission, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features, and outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Four hundred patients with SLE completed the survey. Overall, 4 (1.00%, 95%CI 0.02–1.98) patients were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26 (6.51%, 95%CI 4.08–8.94) as possible clinical cases. The incidence of confirmed cases in our series was similar to that of the Catalan population (1.00% versus 0.63%; p = 0.456), whereas the incidence of possible cases was higher in our series (6.51% versus 1.29%; p < 0.005). The only difference between SLE patients with confirmed and possible COVID-19 and those without was the percentage of patients who have had contact with a confirmed or possible case of COVID-19 (26.7% versus 9.2%; p = 0.003) CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients with inactive disease is low and, in our series, all cases with confirmed infection recovered.","Espinosa, Gerard; Prieto-González, Sergio; Llevadot, Mireia; Marco-Hernández, Javier; Martínez-Artuña, Antonio; Pérez-Isidro, Albert; Rifé, Elia; Cervera, Ricard",Clin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05675-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677725/,406

On this route, the virus is exposed to destructive fluids of the digestive tract, which are acidic and contain the proteases pepsin (gizzard) or chymotrypsin and trypsin (intestine). Only the latter enzyme activates virus by cleaving hemagglutinin (HA) into HA(1) and HA(2) subunits. We mimicked the passage of viruses through the gastrointestinal tract by treating them with digestive fluids from chicken and determined titers and integrity of HA by western-blot. Gizzard fluid completely inactivated virions and degrades HA even at a high dilution, but only if the pH was kept acidic. If the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer (mimicking virus uptake with seawater) particles were more resistant. Virions containing an uncleaved HA were even activated suggesting that gastric juice contains a trypsin-like protease. Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles and destroyed HA, but diluted fluid activated virions. A virus isolated from the duck´s intestine is more tolerant against intestinal fluid compared to fowl plague virus suggesting that the former is better adapted to grow in the intestine. We also demonstrate that influenza viruses replicate to high titers in a novel chicken epithelial gut cell line. While viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site require addition of trypsin, these cells effectively process HA with a polybasic cleavage site, which could be blocked with an inhibitor of the cellular furin protease.","Han, Xuejiao; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Veit, Michael",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351930968X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767100/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108462; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351930968X,406

The first step consists of conventional linear models and supervised machine learning alternatives. Those regression methods do more than predict health outcomes in the EU-27 and relate those predictions to independent variables. Linear regression and its machine learning equivalents also inform unsupervised machine learning methods such as clustering and manifold learning. Lower-dimension manifolds of this dataset’s feature space reveal the relationship among EU-27 countries and their success (or failure) in managing PM(2.5) morbidity and mortality. Principal component analysis informs further interpretation of variables along economic and health-based lines. A nonlinear environmental Kuznets curve may describe the fuller relationship between economic activity and premature death from PM(2.5) exposure.

Children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, and laboratory testing capacity remains limited. We, therefore, used a cross-sectional design and convenience sampling to characterize HIV subtypes and resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in these groups in Sierra Leone. In total, 96 children (age 2–9 years, 100% ART-experienced), 47 adolescents (age 10–18 years, 100% ART-experienced), and 54 pregnant women (>18 years, 72% ART-experienced) were enrolled. Median treatment durations were 36, 84, and 3 months, respectively, while the sequencing success rates were 45%, 70%, and 59%, respectively, among children, adolescents, and pregnant women. Overall, the predominant HIV-1 subtype was CRF02_AG (87.9%, 95/108), with minority variants constituting 12%. Among children and adolescents, the most common RAMs were M184V (76.6%, n = 49/64), K103N (45.3%, n = 29/64), Y181C/V/I (28.1%, n = 18/64), T215F/Y (25.0%, n = 16/64), and V108I (18.8%, n = 12/64).

Authorities are exploring complimentary approaches to monitor this infectious disease at the community level. Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal wastewater are being developed worldwide as an environmental surveillance approach to inform health authority decision-making. Owing to the extended excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool, WBE can surveil large populated areas with a longer detection window providing unique information on the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that are unlikely to be screened by clinical testing. Herein, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 63) from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia from 24th of February to 1st of May 2020. A total of 21 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 135 to 11,992 gene copies (GC)/100 mL of wastewater. Detections were made in a Brisbane South WWTP in late February 2020, up to three weeks before the first cases were reported there. Wastewater samples were generally positive during the period with highest caseload data. The positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater while there were limited clinical reported cases demonstrates the potential of WBE as an early warning system.

The diagnosis of ARDS was delayed or missed in two-thirds of patients, with the diagnosis missed entirely in 40% of patients, while ARDS recognition ranged from 51% in mild ARDS to 79% in severe cases. Failure to recognize ARDS in a timely fashion leads to failure to use strategies that improve survival in ARDS. Early diagnosis of ARDS may facilitate measures to abrogate progression of the lung injury, including protective mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and adjunctive measures proven to improve survival such as prone positioning. Information overload and a complex ‘syndrome’ diagnosis likely play key roles in ARDS under-recognition. Clinical under-recognition has important consequences particularly in terms of therapeutic options not considered.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2014 to December 2016 in the University Hospital of Martinique. Subjects aged ≥65 years admitted to the hospital were included. Baseline characteristics and concurrent manifestations at admission were collected. Subjects were followed up by phone for 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 687 old Afro-Caribbean subjects (80.4±8.0 years) were included: 467 positive for CVI (Chik+) and 220 negative for CVI (Chik-). During the follow-up, 180 (26.2%) died. The proportion of deaths was higher among Chik- (40.9%) than among Chik+ subjects (21.6%) (p<0.0001). By multivariable analysis, when adjusted for age polyarthralgia, neurological troubles, cardiovascular disorders, absence of neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and hospital stay, Chik+ subjects had significantly higher survival rates (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40–0.85) than Chik- ones. CONCLUSION: Within the two years following hospital admission of subjects aged ≥65 years or older, Chik+ subjects had significantly higher survival rates than Chik- ones.","Godaert, Lidvine; Nicolon, Camille; Najioullah, Fatiha; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; Césaire, Raymond; Dramé, Moustapha",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s253893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764997/,406
683263,Assessing COVID-19 preventive behaviours using the health belief model: A Sri Lankan study,2021-08-10,"A significant number of health care professionals subjected to high-risk situations have been infected by Covid-19 due to the lack of adequate protection equipment or the deficient safety margins that these present. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of a personal peripheral sealing device (PSD) on surgical face masks (SM) allows them to achieve double mask properties, by providing two-way protection to professionals or users. The proposed device is a thermoplastic resin ring composed of a reusable and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) designed to be used in a healthcare setting. Since it is a thermoplastic device, it can be molded and adapted to each individual, becoming personalized and ensuring a correct adjustment to the user’s face. First, a qualitative fit test was performed using a saccharin solution (SS) to evaluate respiratory protective equipment in recruited professionals exposed to high-risk situations of infection by Covid-19. Individuals were divided into an intervention group, who used SM with the PSD, and a control group, who used SM without the PSD. In addition, a quantitative inward air leakage fit test was performed using a 2% sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol in a sealed cabinet with probes sensitive to this substance, in order to validate the SM with the PSD as a Face Filtering Mask (FFP). Only 5% of the individuals who performed the qualitative fit test with the PSD perceived the sweet taste of the SS, while 100% of the individuals who performed the test without the PSD sensed it (p = 0.0001). In the quantitative fit test, the percentage of air leakage of 2% NaCl aerosol into the SM with the PSD was 6.5%, achieving the same range of air leakage as a FFP mask. Thus, the use of a personalized PLA thermoplastic PSD, together with an inexpensive and widely available SM, could have a significant impact in terms of preventive safety by providing bi-directional protection to its user.","Riutord-Sbert, Pere; Pereira, Thais Cristina; de Pedro-Gómez, Joan Ernest; González-Carrasco, Diego; López-Gónzalez, Angel Arturo; Barkvoll, Pål",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358250/,406

In silico studies using DS v20.1.0.19295 software have shown that these compounds behaved as PIs while interacting at the allosteric site of target Mpro enzyme (6LU7). The designed compounds have shown promising docking results, which revealed that all compounds formed hydrogen bonds with His41, His164, Glu166, Tyr54, Asp187, and showed &#960;-interaction with His41, the highly conserved amino acids in the target protein. Toxicity Prediction by Komputer Assisted Technology results confirmed that the compounds were found to be less toxic than the reference drug. Further, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on compound 5 and remdesivir with protease enzyme. Analysis of conformational stability, residue flexibility, compactness, hydrogen bonding, solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and binding free energy revealed comparable stability of protease:5 complex to the protease: remdesivir complex. The result of hydrogen bonding showed a large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between protein residues (Glu166 and Gln189) and ligand 5, indicating strong interaction, which validated the docking result. Further, compactness analysis, SASA and interactions like hydrogen-bonding demonstrated inhibitory properties of compound 5 similar to the existing reference drug. Thus, the designed compound 5 might act as a potential inhibitor against the protease enzyme.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Methods: A total of 44 consecutive patients (M: 32, F: 12, average age: 64), hospitalised in our department from April to September 2020 for SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS, who had a postdischarge CT scan, were enrolled into this retrospective study. We reviewed the electronic medical charts to collect laboratory, clinical, and demographic data. The CT findings were evaluated and classified according to lung segmental distribution. The imaging findings were correlated with spirometry results and included ground glass opacities (GGOs), consolidations, reticulations, bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis, linear bands, and loss of pulmonary volume. Results: Alterations in the pulmonary parenchyma were observed in 97.7% of patients at HRCT (median time lapse between ARDS diagnosis and HRCT: 2.8 months, range 0.9 to 6.7). The most common findings were linear bands (84%), followed by GGOs (75%), reticulations (34%), bronchiolectasis (32%), consolidations (30%), bronchiectasis (30%) and volume loss (25%). They had a symmetric distribution, and both lower lobes were the most affected areas. Conclusions: A reticular pattern with a posterior distribution was observed 3 months after discharge from severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and this differs from previously described postCOVID-19 fibrotic-like changes. We hypothesized that the systematic use of prolonged low-dose of corticosteroid could be the main reason of this different CT scan appearance.","Baratella, Elisa; Ruaro, Barbara; Marrocchio, Cristina; Starvaggi, Natalia; Salton, Francesco; Giudici, Fabiola; Quaia, Emilio; Confalonieri, Marco; Cova, Maria Assunta",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501430/,406

Methods This is a cross-sectional survey analysis of healthcare workers in our institution. Data were collected on demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms and test, disease status, anxiety level (assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory), and burnout level (measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory). Subscales of the burnout inventory were evaluated separately. Results A total of 104 participants completed the survey. Attending physicians, residents, and nurses constituted 25%, 33.7%, and 41.3% of the cohort, respectively. In comparison to untested participants, those tested for COVID-19 had a lower mean age (p = 0.02), higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores (p = 0.001, 0.004, respectively), and lower personal accomplishment scores (p = 0.004). Furthermore, moderate to severe anxiety was observed more frequently in tested participants than untested ones (p = 0.022). Moderate or severe anxiety was seen in 23.1% of the attending physicians, 54.3% of the residents, and 48.8% of the nurses (p = 0.038). Emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and depersonalization scores differed depending on the position of the healthcare workers (p = 0.034, 0.001, 0.004, respectively). Conclusion This study revealed higher levels of anxiety and burnout in younger healthcare workers and those tested for COVID-19, which mainly included residents and nurses.

686659,Proposed approach for reusing surgical masks in COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-26,"OBJECTIVES: Universities are exploring strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 prior to reopening their campuses. National guidelines do not currently recommend testing students prior to campus arrival. However, the impact of presemester testing has not been studied. DESIGN: Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission models are used to explore the effects of three presemester testing interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Testing of students 0, 1 and 2 times prior to campus arrival. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Number of active infections and time until isolation bed capacity is reached. SETTING: We set on-campus and off-campus populations to 7500 and 17 500 students, respectively. We assumed 2% prevalence of active cases at the semester start, and that one-third of infected students will be detected and isolated throughout the semester. Isolation bed capacity was set at 500. We varied disease transmission rates (R(0)=1.5, 2, 3, 4) to represent the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Without presemester screening, peak number of active infections ranged from 4114 under effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) to 10 481 under ineffective mitigation strategies (R(0)=4), and exhausted isolation bed capacity within 10 (R(0)=4) to 25 days (R(0)=1.5). Mandating at least one test prior to campus arrival delayed the timing and reduced the size of the peak, while delaying the time until isolation bed capacity was reached. Testing twice in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) was the only scenario that did not exhaust isolation bed capacity during the semester. CONCLUSIONS: Presemester screening is necessary to avert early and large surges of active COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we recommend testing within 1 week prior to and on campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the peak outbreak, presemester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to significantly reduce outbreak size and preserve isolation bed capacity.","Rennert, Lior; Kalbaugh, Corey Andrew; Shi, Lu; McMahan, Christopher",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323447/,406

Methods:We conducted a prospective cohort study in severe COVID-19 patients who had oxygen saturation <94% and were primarily admitted to hospital. We aimed to describe persistent gas exchange abnormalities at 4 months, defined as decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) and/or desaturation on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), along with associated mechanisms and risk factors Results: Of the 72 patients included, 76.1% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), while 68.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). 39.1% developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). At 4 months, 61.4% were still symptomatic. Functionally, 39.1% had abnormal carbon monoxide test results and/or desaturation on 6MWT; high-flow oxygen, MV, and VTE during the acute phase were significantly associated. Restrictive lung disease was observed in 23.6% of cases, obstructive lung disease in 16.7%, and respiratory muscle dysfunction in 18.1%. A severe initial presentation with admission to ICU (p=.0181), and VTE occurrence during the acute phase (p=.0089) were associated with these abnormalities. 41% had interstitial lung disease in computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Four patients (5.5%) displayed residual defects on lung scintigraphy, only one of whom had developed VTE during the acute phase (5.5%). The main functional respiratory abnormality (31.9%) was reduced capillary volume (Vc<70%). Conclusion: Among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to hospital, 61% were still symptomatic, 39% of patients had persistent functional abnormalities and 41% radiological abnormalities after 4 months. Embolic sequelae were rare but the main functional respiratory abnormality was reduced capillary volume.

687514,Self-efficacy in Insomnia Symptom Management after Digital CBT-I Mediates Insomnia Severity during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-09-12,"BACKGROUND: The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein functions as an ion channel, induces apoptosis and is important for viral pathogenesis. It is expressed on the cell surface and contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif and a di-acidic motif, which may be crucial for its intracellular trafficking. However the role of these motifs is not fully understood in the case of 3a protein. METHODS: The subcellular distribution of the 3a protein was studied by immunofluorescence staining of cells transfected with wild type and mutant constructs along with markers for different intracellular compartments. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to estimate the mRNA where as western blotting was carried out to detect protein levels of wild type and mutant 3a proteins. In vitro transcription- translation was performed to estimate cell free protein synthesis. RESULTS: While the wild type 3a protein is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, the protein with mutations in the tyrosine and valine residues within the YXXV motif (ΔYXXΦ) accumulated in the Golgi compartment. However the 3a protein with mutations within the EXD di-acidic motif (ΔEXD) showed an intracellular distribution similar to the wild type protein. Increased retention of the ΔYXXΦ protein in the Golgi compartment also increased its association with lipid droplets. The ΔYXXΦ protein also expressed at significantly lower levels compared to the wild type 3a protein, which was reversed with Brefeldin A and Aprotinin. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the YXXΦ motif of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is necessary for Golgi to plasma membrane transport, in the absence of which the protein is targeted to lysosomal degradation compartment via lipid droplets.","Minakshi, Rinki; Padhan, Kartika",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762043/,406

Nineteen complete TGEV genomes and a single strain of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) from the US were generated and compared to historical strains to investigate the evolution of these endemic coronaviruses. Sixteen of our TGEV strains share 8 unique deletions and 119 distinct amino acid changes, which might greatly affect the biological characteristics of the variant TGEV, and resulted in a “variant” genotype of TGEV. The “variant” genotype shared similar unique deletions and amino acid changes with the recent PRCV strain identified in this study, suggesting a recombination event occurred between the ‘‘variant’’ TGEV and PRCV. Moreover, the results indicate the “variant” genotype is the dominant genotype circulating in the US. Therefore, this study provides insight into the occurrence, origin, genetic characteristics, and evolution of TGEV and PRCV circulating in the US.","Chen, Fangzhou; Knutson, Todd P.; Rossow, Stephanie; Saif, Linda J.; Marthaler, Douglas G.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40564-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30850666/,406

At present, little is known about how viruses overcome IFITM restriction. In this study, we have utilized HIV-1 as a model and selected IFITM1-resistant viruses after multiple passages of HIV-1 in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. Sequencing the entire viral genome revealed several mutations in the vpu and envelope genes, among which mutations Vpu34 and EnvG367E together enable efficient HIV-1 replication in IFITM1-expressing cells. Vpu34 introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 35 of Vpu, whereas EnvG367E changes the G367 residue at the CD4-binding site of gp120. These two mutations do not appear to overcome the downregulation of viral p24 expression caused by IFITM1, but rather enhance HIV-1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission. Altogether, our data demonstrate that HIV-1 can mutate to evade IFITM1 restriction by increasing cell-to-cell transmission.","Ding, Shilei; Pan, Qinghua; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liang, Chen",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214000336; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214000336; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725927/,406

Aim of the Study: The present study reviewed CPMs recommended by the < Guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 (8(th) edition)> regarding evidence of their efficacy from clinical studies and the underlying mechanisms, which will lay the foundation for clinical use of these CPMs for COVID-19. Methods: The composition, efficacy, indications, history of use, and relevant clinical research on 14 recommended CPMs, including Huoxiangzhengqi capsules (pills, liquid, oral solution), Jinhuaqinggan granules, Lianhuaqingwen capsules (granules), Shufengjiedu capsules, Xiyanping injections, Xuebijing injections, Reduning injections, Tanreqing injections, Xingnaojing injections, Shenfu injections, Shengmai injections, Angongniuhuang pills, Suhexiang pills, were searched in both Chinese and English databases based on differences in stages of the disease and manifestations of such patients. Advantages of these CPMs over conventional treatments and their underlying mechanisms were explored by analyzing results from published articles and undergoing clinical trials. Results: Findings from clinical studies and Chinese experience in using these CPMs showed that CPMs, when used in combination with conventional treatments, were effective in managing COVID-19 with few side effects.

This work could contribute to the development of effective treatments against the initial stage of viral infection and provide mechanistic information that might aid the design of new drug combinations for clinical trials for COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Catherine Z.; Xu, Miao; Pradhan, Manisha; Gorshkov, Kirill; Petersen, Jennifer D.; Straus, Marco R.; Zhu, Wei; Shinn, Paul; Guo, Hui; Shen, Min; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Samuel G.; Zimmerberg, Joshua; Zheng, Wei; Whittaker, Gary R.",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330839/,406
690586,Comorbidities predict 30-day hospital mortality of older adults with COVID-19,2021-06-19,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-Cov-2 infection has multiple neurologic manifestations including encephalitis in multiple cases reported, however the psychosis as principal manifestation of this condition is infrequently. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 48-year-old woman with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 who developed paranoid and self-referential ideas with behavioural alteration and multiple findings on mental examination. Encephalitis associated with Covid-19 was suspected due to the neurological clinical presentation (persistent despite resolve hypoxaemia and systemic symptoms) and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) that showed asymmetric hippocampal hyperintensities, although cerebrospinal fluid and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. The patient received medical treatment with methylprednisolone for 5 days with complete resolution of her symptoms. DISCUSSION: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has neurological complications either by direct involvement or by para-infectious or post-infectious phenomena. Encephalitis occurs in a small proportion of the cases, while psychiatric symptoms have been described in a variable percentage of the events. However, a psychotic picture such as the one reported in our case is unusual. MRI, cerebrospinal fluid and EEG are important for the diagnostic evaluation of these patients but not obligatory to the diagnosis. The treatment of this condition with corticosteroids has been successful even in cases associated with Anti-NMDA. Our case is the second reported in Colombia, the first to be associated with psychosis.","Ariza-Varón, Michael; Beltrán, María Alejandra; Marín-Medina, Daniel S; González, Andrés Felipe; Ávila, Ana Milena",Infect Dis (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1977381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549667/,406
