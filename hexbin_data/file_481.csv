He developed fever with fatigue at the end of his US stay, and was hospitalized in Ostrava after his return on 3 September with fever (up to 39.5 °C), fatigue, anorexia, moderate laryngotracheitis, dizziness, insomnia, blurred speech, and a marked bradypsychism. EEG demonstrated a slow bifrontal theta–delta activity, and CT of the brain a slight hydrocephalus. A significant increase of antibodies neutralizing West Nile virus was detected between the first (1:16) and second (1:256) blood serum sample. The patient recovered gradually and was released from hospital on 16 September. This is the first recorded human case of West Nile fever (WNF) imported to the Czech Republic. Nine similar cases of WNF import from the USA have already been reported in other European countries – France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany.","Hubálek, Zdenek; Lukáčová, Lubomíra; Halouzka, Jiří; Širůček, Petr; Januška, Jiří; Přecechtělová, Jarmila; Procházka, Petr",Eur J Epidemiol,481,1

These plants were considered a tool to study adaptation of leaves to photoassimilate accumulation at the molecular level. By differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the transgenic plants 12 different cDNAs were isolated. By sequence analysis four cDNAs could be identified as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase and as three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-1b, PR-Q and SAR 8.2). Two cDNAs were homologous to a calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and a human ribosomal protein L19 while six cDNA clones remained unknown. One of these clones (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) displayed features similar to pathogenesis-related proteins: Hybridizing transcripts, 1.2 and 1.0 kb in length, were strongly inducible by salicylate and accumulated in tobacco plants after infection with potato virus Y (PVY) both in infected and uninfected systemic leaves. PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated in wildtype leaves upon floating on glucose and sucrose whereas sorbitol and polyethylene glycol had no effect. Rescreening of the ppa-1 cDNA library with the PAR-1 cDNA as probe resulted in 25 hybridizing cDNAs which by homology were found to fall into three classes (PAR-1a, b, c). The cDNAs coding for PAR-1a and b were 90.6% homologous on the DNA level while both were less related to the PAR-1c cDNA (70.5% and 75.2% homologous, respectively). One open reading frame was identified in all three PAR-1 cDNA classes. Translation would result in proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of about 20 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequences resemble a signal peptide which would direct the proteins to the secretory pathway. Using selective 3′ hybridization probes of the three PAR-1 cDNAs it was possible to discriminate the different transcripts. Both PAR-1a and PAR-1c mRNAs are induced in plants treated with PVY.","Herbers, Karin; Mönke, Gudrun; Badur, Ralf; Sonnewald, Uwe",Plant Mol Biol,481,1

In the C3HeB/FeJ mice, abnormalities of microcirculatory flow were noted as early as 12 hr after infection and by 24 hr, localized avascular foci appeared. Disturbances were characterized by granular blood flow, sinusoidal microthrombi, distortion of sinusoids by edematous hepatocytes and necrotic lesions. Following the acute infection, Day 10, two patterns of chronic disease were observed. Eighty percent of the mice developed chronic granulomatous hepatitis whereas in the remaining 20% a more severe chronic aggressive hepatitis was observed which was characterized by ongoing hepatocellular necrosis and a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate. In both cases, in vivo microcirculatory abnormalities were found predominantly around visible lesions. Onset of the microcirculatory abnormalities was found to be concomitant with a rise in monocyte related procoagulant activity. Procoagulant activity rose acutely and remained elevated throughout the chronic phase but was higher in animals with severe disease. In contrast to the above, normal blood flow and histology were seen in the resistant A/J mice at all times following infection, and procoagulant activity remained at basal levels despite active viral replication as demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies and recovery of infectious virus. These observations suggest a role for monocyte procoagulant activity in the development of microcirculatory abnormalities following mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection which may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.","Macphee, Peggy J.; Dindzans, Vincent J.; Fung, Lai‐Sum; Levy, Gary A.",Hepatology,481,1

In order to slow down the wave of infection, the state has severely restricted economic activity in Germany. As a result, GDP is expected to shrink by 4.2% this year. The recession is leaving clear traces on the labour market and the national budget. At its peak, the unemployment rate will soar to 5.9% and the number of short-time workers to 2.4 million. This year, the fiscal policy stabilisation measures will lead to a record deficit in the general government budget of 159 billion euro. After the shutdown, the economy will gradually recover. Accordingly, the increase in GDP next year will be strong at 5.8%. This forecast is associated with considerable downside risks, e.g. because the pandemic can be slowed faster or because the recovery of economic activity will be less successful than expected or there may be a new wave of infection.","Holtemöller, Oliver; Kooths, Stefan; Michelsen, Claus; Schmidt, Torsten; Wollmershäuser, Timo",Wirtschaftsdienst,481,1

The specificity of each AI model and the relationship between data characteristics and ground truth, allowing their guidance according to each situation, has not been given. Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy. From this work, we expect to significantly minimize risk in empirical applications, i.e., maintaining homeostasis or predicting abnormal situations to construct an opportune response.","Cho, Jae Hyuk; Lee, Hayoun",Micromachines (Basel),481,1

This article reports the development and examination of the psychometric properties of a measure of stress mindset: The Stress Control Mindset Measure (SCMM). The measure is consistent with theory on mindsets about self‐attributes and conceptualizes stress mindset as the extent to which individuals endorse beliefs that stress can be enhancing. METHODS: The study adopted a correlational cross‐sectional survey design in two student samples. Undergraduate students from an Australian university (Sample 1, N = 218) and a UK university (Sample 2, N = 214) completed the SCMM and measures of health and well‐being outcomes. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a four‐factor structure and strict measurement invariance across samples (ΔCFI < 0.01). Reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and concurrent validity of the overall SCMM were supported in both samples. Incremental validity was supported for most outcomes, accounting for significantly more variance (between 2.2% and 5.9%) in health and well‐being outcomes than an existing measure. CONCLUSIONS: Current data provide preliminary support for the SCMM as a reliable and valid measure with good psychometric properties and theoretically consistent relations with health outcomes under stress. Findings provide initial evidence supporting the potential utility of the SCMM in future research examining relations between stress mindsets and health and performance outcomes.","Keech, Jacob J.; Orbell, Sheina; Hagger, Martin S.; O’Callaghan, Frances V.; Hamilton, Kyra",Brain Behav,481,1

This efficient methodology provides new 1,2,5‐thiadiazolidine‐1,1‐dioxide derivatives 5a–d in one step and optimal conditions. The molecular structures of the novel compounds 4a–n and 5a–d were confirmed using various spectroscopic methods. All these compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram‐negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and Gram‐positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 27923) bacteria, in addition to three clinical strains (E. coli 1, P. aeruginosa 1, and S. aureus 1). Most of the tested compounds showed more potent inhibitory activities against both Gram‐positive and ‐negative bacteria compared with the sulfamethoxazole reference. The following compounds, 4n, 4f, 4g, 4m, 4l, 4d, and 4e, are the most active sulfamidophosphonate derivatives. Furthermore, these molecules gave interesting zones of inhibition varying between 28 and 49 mm, against all tested bacterial strains, with a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ranging from 0.125 to 8 μg/ml. All the synthesized derivatives were also evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activity against Fusarium oxyporum f. sp. lycopersici and Alternaria sp. The results revealed that all the synthesized compounds exhibited excellent antifungal inhibition and the compounds 4f, 4g, 4m, and 4i were the most potent derivatives with MIC values ranging from 0.25 to 1 µg/ml against the two tested fungal strains. The strongest inhibition of bacteria and fungi strains was detected by the effect of quinolone and sulfamide moieties.","Bazine, Ismahene; Bendjedid, Samira; Boukhari, Abbes",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),481,1

The aim of this study is to show the need of off-label surgery in an environment of low resources by means of typical examples. METHODS: Off-label treated fractures, the implant used instead, and the reason for off-label treatment were investigated in 367 injuries over a three month period in an NGO hospital in Sierra Leone. RESULTS: Twenty-seven fractures were treated off-label with mostly K-wires (88.89%) and external fixators (51.85%). Three reasons for off-label use could be defined: no suitable implants (N = 14), the condition of soft tissues that did not allow internal osteosyntheses (N = 10), and implants not ready for surgery due to logistic flaws (N = 3). The implants needed were mostly locking plates. CONCLUSION: Surgeons in similar settings must use K-wires and external fixators to treat complex fractures. Using implants off-label can help surgeons to treat fractures otherwise left untreated.","Wichlas, F.; Hofmann, V.; Strada, G.; Moursy, M.; Deininger, C.",Int Orthop,481,19

Continuous worry of facing aggression at workplace may seriously affect job satisfaction and intention to job turnover. However, the association between workplace safety and job satisfaction had not been studied earlier in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among doctors from November 2019 to April 2020 using a pre-tested, semi-structured, anonymous “Google forms” based questionnaire among doctors working in private and/or public healthcare settings across India. Perception of safety was assessed by scoring in a scale. Cronbach's coefficient of the scale was calculated to be 0.88. Job satisfaction was assessed using the 5-item Brayfield and Rothe measure of job satisfaction. Cronbach's coefficient of the scale was 0.76. The data was coded and analyzed with the help of STATA-12. RESULTS: 617 doctors practicing modern medicine participated in this study from all over India. 262 (42.5%) doctors were found to be satisfied at their job. Perception of safety at workplace was found to have 2.5 times greater influence on job satisfaction of doctors. 23.2% of the doctors expressed job turnover intention which was positively correlated with job satisfaction and perception of safety. CONCLUSION: Perception of safety from workplace violence was found to have significant effect on job satisfaction and turnover intention than actual violence. Appropriate strategy may be undertaken to address this apprehension at workplace.","Ahamed, Farhad; Kaur, Amandeep; Sengupta, Paramita; Ghosh, Tandra",J Family Med Prim Care,481,17

We sought to assess whether treatment with mannitol improves PE ratio in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). METHODS: We studied consecutive patients with TBI and brain edema on computed tomography scan and an external ventricular drain (EVD), admitted to the neurointensive care unit. PE ratio, defined as ICP prior to CSF drainage minus ICP after CSF drainage divided by ICP prior to CSF drainage minus EVD height, was measured as previously described. Patients were treated with mannitol for raised ICP based on clinical indication and PE ratio measured before and after mannitol administration. RESULTS: We studied 20 patients with severe TBI with raised ICP. Mean ICP prior to mannitol treatment was 29 ± 7 mm Hg. PE ratio rose substantially after mannitol treatment (0.62 ± 0.24 vs. 0.29 ± 0.20, p < 0.0001), indicating an improved ability to drain CSF and equalize ICP with the preset height of the EVD. The combination of mannitol and CSF drainage led to an improved reduction in ICP compared with that seen before mannitol therapy (11 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 6 ± 2 mm Hg, p < 0.01), and led to a decrease in ICP below the 20 mm Hg threshold in 77% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with mannitol leads to a substantial improvement in PE ratio that reflects the ability to achieve a greater decrease in ICP when CSF drainage is performed after mannitol administration. This preliminary study raises the possibility that PE ratio may be useful to follow response to therapy in patients with cerebral edema and raised ICP. Further studies to determine whether PE ratio may serve as an easily obtained and clinically useful surrogate marker for the extent of brain edema are warranted.","Doron, Omer; Hemphill, J.

To identify the structure of remote homologs, the structure-sequence alignment has to consider not only sequence similarity but also spatially conserved conformations caused by residue interactions, and consequently is computationally intractable. It is difficult to cope with the inefficiency without compromising alignment accuracy, especially for structure search in genomes or large databases. This paper introduces a novel method and a parameterized algorithm for structure-sequence alignment. Both the structure and the sequence are represented as graphs, where in general the graph for a biopolymer structure has a naturally small tree width. The algorithm constructs an optimal alignment by finding in the sequence graph the maximum valued subgraph isomorphic to the structure graph. It has the computational time complexity O(k (t) N (2)) for the structure of N residues and its tree decomposition of width t. The parameter k, small in nature, is determined by a statistical cutoff for the correspondence between the structure and the sequence. The paper demonstrates a successful application of the algorithm to developing a fast program for RNA structural homology search.","Song, Yinglei; Liu, Chunmei; Huang, Xiuzhen; Malmberg, Russell L.; Xu, Ying; Cai, Liming",Algorithms in Bioinformatics,481,17

The RV is highly compliant, and is able to accommodate a wide range of preload conditions. Yet, it is afterload-sensitive, and normal physiology is dependent on its association with the low resistance of the pulmonary vasculature. Changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance, either acutely or over time, provoke a series of adaptations that are designed to maintain a normal cardiac output, but ultimately lead to decompensation and RV failure. Through ventricular interdependence, RV failure may impair left ventricular diastolic and systolic function, further reducing cardiac performance. Both echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide detailed information about RV structure, with MRI providing better assessment of ventricular volumes and RV function. Right heart catheterization is often necessary for definitive diagnosis of the etiology of RV failure and for determining the best therapeutic options. The treatment of RV failure is highly dependent on the underlying etiology, which should be corrected if possible. Targeted medical therapy is particularly useful in cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and is under investigation for broader use in other causes of pulmonary hypertension.","Sayer, Gabriel; Semigran, Marc J.",Heart Failure,481,2

By the mid-1970s, China was already undergoing the epidemiologic transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status, and by 1980, life expectancy (67 years) exceeded that of most similarly low-income nations by 7 years. Almost 30 years later, China’s 2009 health reforms were a response to deep inequity in access to affordable, quality healthcare resulting from three decades of marketization, including de facto privatization of the health sector, along with decentralized accountability and, to a large degree, financing of public health services. The reforms are built on earlier, equity-enhancing initiatives, particularly the reintroduction of social health insurance since 2003, and are planned to continue until 2020, with gradual achievement of overarching objectives on universal and equitable access to health services. The second phase of reform commenced in early 2012. China’s health reforms remain encouragingly specific but not prescriptive on strategy; set in the decentralized governance structure, they avoid the issue of reliance on local government support for the national equity objective, leaving the detailed design of health service financing, human resource distribution and accountability, essential drug lists and application of clinical care pathways, etc. to local health authorities answerable to local government, not the Ministry of Health. Community engagement in government processes, including in provision of healthcare, remains limited.

In one postmortem study, 15 % of patients who died with malignancies were found to have malignant pleural effusions, and the annual incidence of malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in the United States is estimated to be >150,000 cases. The presence of a MPE often portends a poor prognosis; the mean survival after the diagnosis of a MPE ranges from 3 to 12 months, depending on the underlying tumor (lung cancer is generally associated with the shortest average survival time). Patients with MPE often have symptoms that impair their quality of life, such as dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, and chest discomfort, some or all of which can be improved with palliative therapeutic measures.","Villanueva, Andrew G.",Principles and Practice of Interventional Pulmonology,481,22

Software vulnerability detection can be carried out at the source code or binary level. However, the latter is more impactful and practical since when using commercial software, we usually only possess binary software. In this paper, we leverage deep learning and kernel methods to propose the Deep Cost-sensitive Kernel Machine, a method that inherits the advantages of deep learning methods in efficiently tackling structural data and kernel methods in learning the characteristic of vulnerable binary examples with high generalization capacity. We conduct experiments on two real-world binary datasets.

To this end, a number of tailored analytics forming the backbone of recommendation engines specialized for retrieving cultural content are proposed. Their strength derives directly from well-established principles of cognitive science and behavioral economics, both scientific fields exploring aspects of human decision making. Another novel contribution of this conference paper is that these analytics are implemented in Neo4j expressed as Cypher queries. Various aspects of the cultural content and digital consumers can be naturally represented by appropriately configured vertices, whereas edges represent various connections indicating content delivery preferences. Early experiments conducted over a synthetic dataset mimicking the distributions of preferences and ratings of well-known movie datasets are encouraging as the proposed analytics outperformed the baseline of a multilayer feedforward neural network of various configurations. The synthetic dataset contains enriched preferences of mobile digital consumers of cultural content regarding literature of the Greek region of Ionian Islands.","Drakopoulos, Georgios; Giannoukou, Ioanna; Mylonas, Phivos; Sioutas, Spyros",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,481,1

This translation is attained by the matching of a user’s sentence with an intent contained in an Agent. This paper introduces the first generation of the CERTH Intelligent Personal Agent (CIPA) which is based on the RASA (https://rasa.com/) framework and utilizes two machine learning models for NLU and dialogue flow classification. Besides the architecture of CIPA—Generation A, a novel dialogue-story generator that is based on the idea of adjacency pairs is introduced. By utilizing on this novel-generator, the agent is able to create all the possible dialog trees in order to handle conversations without training on existing data in contrast with the majority of the current alternative solutions. CIPA supports multiple intents and it is capable of classifying complex sentences consisting of two user’s intents into two automatic operations from the part of the agent. The introduced CIPA—Generation A has been deployed and tested in a real-world scenario at Centre’s of Research & Technology Hellas (CERTH) nZEB Smart Home (https://smarthome.iti.gr/) in two different domains, energy and health domain.","Alexiadis, Anastasios; Nizamis, Alexandros; Koskinas, Ioannis; Ioannidis, Dimosthenis; Votis, Konstantinos; Tzovaras, Dimitrios",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,481,16

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long‐term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using the internationally comparable Frey–Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long‐term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms. Some people will not be ready for a life‐long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term “nescience economy” and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital concentration, favourable business climate, high quality of life and ICT development. Based on these factors, some recommendations for authorities were proposed in the conclusion.","Zemtsov, Stepan",,481,22

Therefore, using interval-valued samples rather than point-valued ones is preferable in making variability forecasts. This study also computationally investigates the impacts of data aggregation methods and probability distributions on the entropy of interval-valued datasets. Computational results suggest that both min-max and confidence intervals can work well in aggregating point-valued data into intervals.

However, contrary to the instinctive reaction to tighten control, the quality of response depends on healthcare systems’ capacity to loosen control and, subsequently, enhance improvisation. Three factors critical to enhancing an organisation’s capacity for improvisation are highlighted; increasing autonomy, maintaining structure and creating a shared understanding. By drawing on the case of Christchurch Hospital’s response to a major earthquake, this paper demonstrates the vital role that improvisation can play within a clinical setting, when responding to a low-chance, high-impact event.","Lloyd-Smith, McKenzie",,481,22

The strategy is to express the resulting stochastic solution using [Formula: see text] terms of a polynomial chaos expansion and then derive and solve a deterministic, coupled system of PDEs with standard numerical techniques. One of the critical advantages of this approach is its provable convergence as M increases. The challenge is that the solution to the M system cannot easily reuse an already-existing computer solution to the [Formula: see text] system. We present a promising iterative strategy to address this issue. Numerical estimates of the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm (bluff-and-fix) demonstrate that it can be more effective than using monolithic methods to solve the whole M + 1 system directly.","Lyman, Laura; Iaccarino, Gianluca",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,481,1

Significant aspects of management in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the later course of aSAH such as ventilation and sedation (VST) remain unaddressed. aSAH patients present unique challenges not accounted for in general ICU recommendations and guidelines, which is why we attempted to further characterize ICU practices in aSAH patients in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey on ICU practices in aSAH in Germany. Secondarily, we assessed the existence of and compliance with current guidelines regarding ICU practices. The questionnaire was designed in interdisciplinary fashion and distributed online through the kwiksurvey(®) platform (Bristol, UK). RESULTS: A total of 50 responses were received, accounting for a response rate of 49%. Twenty-one were university hospitals (UH), 23 high-volume centers (HVC), 6 low-volume centers (LVC). Half of the participating centers do not take into consideration WFNS at presentation to indicate ventilation. While 42% of centers rely on the P/F ratio to indicate ventilation, 62% of them have a cutoff value of < 200, and 38% of < 100. While most UH and HVC used propofol for the first phase of sedation (95%), LVC employed benzodiazepines (100%). Sedation deepening was done with ketamine in UH (75%) and HVC (60%), whereas LVC used predominantly clonidine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that attitudes and practices pertaining to ICU management in aSAH are enormously heterogeneous, reflecting the lack of good quality evidence and differing interpretations thereof.

These possible scenarios frame the questions: What is the coupling between innovation and financing at inception, and what is the embeddedness of coupling in networks around the entrepreneur, specifically networks with investors and researchers? These questions are addressed with a globally representative sample of entrepreneurs interviewed at inception of their business. Innovation and financing are found to be decoupled, typically; less frequently to be loosely coupled, and rarely to be tightly coupled. Coupling is promoted by networking with both investors and researchers, with additive effects and with a synergy effect. By ascertaining coupling and its embeddedness in networks as a way for building capability in a startup, the study contributes to empirically supported theorizing about capability building.","Wang, Daojuan; Schøtt, Thomas",Int Entrep Manag J,481,22

For instance, compulsory licensing, through the facilitation of price reductions, was considered to be an important countermeasure. However, little is known about the extent to which compulsory licensing has actually been effective in reducing prices of much-needed patented drugs. To fill this gap, this paper undertakes a systematic-review of the existing evidence on the impact of compulsory licensing on drug prices. Retrieval and analysis of 51 observations of pre- and post-compulsory licensing prices indicate that a compulsory licensing event is likely to reduce the price of a patented drug, albeit with some caveats. Moreover, compulsory licensing procurement from the international market is likely to be more effective in reducing drug prices than contracts to local companies. These findings are reconfirmed in the race to improve access to Remdesivir for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Clearly, the future incidence and impact of compulsory licensing will depend on further possible procedural refinements to ease its implementation, the development of technological and manufacturing capabilities in developing countries, and the importance of biologics among life-saving drugs.","Urias, Eduardo; Ramani, Shyama V.",J Int Bus Policy,481,16

Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron; CAS No. 102-54-5) is a relatively volatile, organometallic compound used as a chemical intermediate, a catalyst, and as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344/N rats and B6C3F, mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had 10 times higher “ferrocene hydroxylating” activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidalion of cellular membranes.","SUN, J.

The use of probiotics has been shown to have a promising effect in many RCTs. Our systematic review and meta-analysis were thus planned to determine the effect of probiotic use in critically ill ventilated adult patients on the incidence of VAP, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, the incidence of diarrhea, and the incidence of oropharyngeal colonization and in-hospital mortality. METHODOLOGY: Systematic search of various databases (such as Embase, Cochrane, and Pubmed), published journals, clinical trials, and abstracts of the various major conferences were made to obtain the RCTs which compare probiotics with placebo for VAP prevention. The results were expressed as risk ratios or mean differences. Data synthesis was done using statistical software - Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020). RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criterion and were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of VAP (risk ratio: 0.70, CI 0.56, 0.88; P = 0.002; I(2) = 37%), duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference −3.75, CI −6.93, −0.58; P 0.02; I(2) = 96%), length of ICU stay (mean difference −4.20, CI −6.73, −1.66; P = 0.001; I(2) = 84%) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.73, CI 0.54, 0.98; P = 0.04; I(2) = 0%) in the probiotic group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Probiotic administration was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay (MD −1.94, CI −7.17, 3.28; P = 0.47; I(2) = 88%), incidence of oro-pharyngeal colonization (OR 0.59, CI 0.33, 1.04; P = 0.07; I(2) = 69%), and incidence of diarrhea (OR 0.59, CI 0.34, 1.03; P = 0.06; I(2) = 38%). DISCUSSION: Our meta-analysis shows that probiotic administration has a promising role in lowering the incidence of VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and in-hospital mortality.","Batra, Priyam; Soni, Kapil Dev; Mathur, Purva",J Intensive Care,481,5

FPRs are also known to detect a wide range of ligands, including host-derived peptides and lipids. FPRs are highly expressed not only in phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages but also in nonhematopoietic cells such as epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, the oral cavity, the eye, and the reproductive tract, separate the external environment from the host system. In mucosal surfaces, the interaction between the microbiota and host cells needs to be strictly regulated to maintain homeostasis. By sharing the same FPRs, immune cells and epithelial cells may coordinate pathophysiological responses to various stimuli, including microbial molecules derived from the normal flora. Accumulating evidence shows that FPRs play important roles in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the roles of FPRs at mucosal surfaces.","Jeong, Yu Sun; Bae, Yoe-Sik",Exp Mol Med,481,5

In Australia, the recent linkage of international gas markets with the electricity market provides a useful example to review these dynamics. RECENT FINDINGS: Using the intersections between gas and electricity markets in Australia, we explore how (1) supply constraints associated with commencement of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, and (2) market concentration due to closure of old coal plant, contributed to effect a doubling of wholesale electricity prices. The recent Australian experience highlights the disproportionate impact of gas generation on electricity prices due to its price-setting role. The price impact of the tightened gas market on electricity prices has been significantly exacerbated through the exercise of market power, especially via the practise of ‘shadow pricing’. In the Australian case, the potential adverse intersectional impacts of LNG exports could have been substantially adverted with enforced domestic reservation of about 6% of LNG export volumes. SUMMARY: Competition issues and gaming opportunities, which have accompanied the increased market concentration that accompanied the withdrawal of capacity, have exacerbated the price impacts of the supply-side shock stemming from the evolving gas market.","McConnell, Dylan; Sandiford, Mike",Curr Sustainable Renewable Energy Rep,481,1

In this work we explore the use of annotations for restricting memory access permissions in program synthesis, and show that they can make specifications much stronger while remaining surprisingly concise. Specifically, we enhance Synthetic Separation Logic (SSL), a framework for synthesis of heap-manipulating programs, with the logical mechanism of read-only borrows. We observe that this minimalistic and conservative SSL extension benefits the synthesis in several ways, making it more (a) expressive (stronger correctness guarantees are achieved with a modest annotation overhead), (b) effective (it produces more concise and easier-to-read programs), (c) efficient (faster synthesis), and (d) robust (synthesis efficiency is less affected by the choice of the search heuristic). We explain the intuition and provide formal treatment for read-only borrows. We substantiate the claims (a)–(d) by describing our quantitative evaluation of the borrowing-aware synthesis implementation on a series of standard benchmark specifications for various heap-manipulating programs.","Costea, Andreea; Zhu, Amy; Polikarpova, Nadia; Sergey, Ilya",Programming Languages and Systems,481,1

Examples are turbine vanes of hydropower plants or components of valves and pumps in hydraulic systems. Nickel-titanium shape memory alloys (NiTi) are attractive materials for cavitation-resistant coatings because of their pronounced intrinsic damping mitigating cavitation-induced erosion. In this work, NiTi coatings were produced by cold gas spraying. The phase transformation behaviors of the powder feedstock and the as-sprayed coatings were investigated. Regarding the obtained transformation temperatures, the measured substrate temperatures during spraying rule out that either the shape memory effect or the pseudoelasticity of NiTi could affect the deposition efficiency under the applied conditions of cold gas spraying. Another potential effect is stress-induced amorphization which could occur at the particle–substrate interfaces and impair particle bonding by stress relaxation. Moreover, also oxide formation can be significant. Thus, the presence of amorphous phases and oxides in the near-surface zone of particles bounced off after impact was investigated. Oxidation could be confirmed, but no indication of amorphous phase was found. Besides, also the evolution of local microstrains implies that the substrate temperatures affect the deposition efficiency. These temperatures were significantly influenced by the spray gun travel speed.","Mauer, Georg; Rauwald, Karl-Heinz; Sohn, Yoo Jung; Weirich, Thomas E.",J Therm Spray Tech,481,22

To realize this potential, devices should be designed in a way that ensures their correctness and robust operation. For this purpose, formal methods and tools can offer significant advantages by allowing investigation of design limitations and detection of errors before manufacturing and experimentation. Here we define a computational model for NBCs by providing formal semantics to NBC circuits. We present a formal verification-based approach and prototype tool that can assist in the design of NBCs by enabling verification of a given design’s correctness. Our tool allows verification of the correctness of NBC designs for several NP-Complete problems, including the Subset Sum, Exact Cover and Satisfiability problems and can be extended to other NBC implementations. Our approach is based on defining transition systems for NBCs and using temporal logic for specifying and proving properties of the design using model checking.

The patients were divided into three groups: the modern medicine control group (MMC group), patients treated with routine medical treatment; the control group combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine (CTW), patients treated with routine medical treatment plus the common TCM formula; and the treatment group of “TCM regulating liver regeneration” (RLR), patients treated with both routine medical treatment and the special TCM formula of RLR. After 8 weeks of treatment, the mortality of patients in the RLR group (12.31%) was significantly lower than those in the MMC (50%) and CTW (29.11%) groups. Total bilirubin level significantly decreased and albumin increased in the RLR group when compared with the MMC and CTW groups (P < 0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in the expression of several cytokines related to liver regeneration in the RLR group compared with the MMC group. RLR treatment can decrease jaundice, improve liver function, and significantly reduce the mortality in patients with HBV-related liver failure.

In this paper students’ opinion on some aspects of inclusion of webinar in higher education is studied and these opinions are statistically analysed. Perception of the students under study is assembled through questionnaire. Results illustrate that though students are well versed with the use of technology, there is a lack of awareness regarding webinars. Logistic regression exhibits how the factors like age, gender, location, stream of education, access of laptop, access of mobile, access of YouTube, experience of webinar, educational infrastructure affect in the opinion of the students to incorporate webinar in higher education in recent future. We have also identified the order of the students’ preference factors through a ranking process of their interest to include webinar for higher studies. The intermediate test shows that this preference probability is not uniform among the respondents.

It is frequently reported to be correlated with anxiety symptoms among University students. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been thoroughly studied. Whether the association between anxiety symptoms and PSU is mediated or moderated by self-efficacy remains unclarified. A cluster sampling cross-sectional study was thus conducted to explore the potential mediating or moderating effect of self-efficacy in Chinese University students. Participants (N = 1,113) were recruited from eight Universities in Shenyang, China. Of them, 146 did not effectively respond to the questionnaires. Thus, 967 participants were eligible for the final analysis. The mediating or moderating role of self-efficacy in the anxiety-PSU relationship was explored using hierarchical multiple regression. Then the mediation model was further verified using the SPSS macros program (PROCESS v3.0). Our results showed that anxiety symptoms was positively correlated with PSU (r = 0.302, P < 0.01), while self-efficacy was negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms and PSU (r = −0.271 and −0.181, P < 0.01). Self-efficacy partly mediated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and PSU, which accounted for ~17.5% of the total effect that anxiety symptoms have on PSU. However, the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the anxiety-PSU relationship was insignificant. In summary, our findings suggested that self-efficacy partly mediates but not moderates the link between anxiety symptoms and PSU among Chinese University students. Therefore, multicomponent interventions should be made to restrict the frequency of smartphone usage, enhance the level of self-efficacy, and thus promote the mental health status of University students.","Li, Ying; Li, Guang-Xiao; Yu, Ming-Li; Liu, Chun-Li; Qu, Yun-Ting; Wu, Hui",Front Psychiatry,481,1

Technology is seen as one option for supporting the elderly in maintaining social relationships, monitoring their health and living independently. One technological innovation that has been explored in various facets to support the elderly is Ambient Intelligence. This paper discusses the privacy implications of ambient intelligence based systems taking into account elderly users and adopters. Technological advancements and their applications should be understood from a socio-technical basis with regards to the potential impact on users and society at large. This research study adopted the systematic literature review method to identify, analyze and synthesize secondary data. This study appraises existing literature related to Ambient Intelligence, privacy concerns and the elderly over the past decade and contributes lessons and direction for practice and research.","Mawela, Tendani",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,481,7

This paper presents a machine learning ensemble framework to improve the accuracy and consistency of train delay prediction. The basic idea is to train many different types of machine learning models for each station along a chosen journey of train service using historical data and relevant weather data, and then with certain criteria to choose some models to build an ensemble. It then combines the outputs from its member models with an aggregation function to produce the final prediction. Two aggregation functions were devised to combine the outputs of individual models: averaging and weighted averaging. These ensembles were implemented with a framework and their performance was tested with the data from an intercity train service as a case study. The accuracy was measured by the percentages of correct prediction of the arrival time for a train and correct prediction within one minute to the actual arrival time. The mean accuracies and standard deviations are 42.3%([Formula: see text] ) from the individual models, 57.8%([Formula: see text] ) from the averaging ensembles, and 72.8%([Formula: see text] ) from the weighted ensembles. For the predictions within one minute of the actual times, they are 86.4%([Formula: see text] ), 94.6%([Formula: see text] ) and 96.0%([Formula: see text] ) respectively. So overall, the ensembles significantly improved not only the prediction accuracies but also the consistency and the weighted ensembles are clearly the best.","Al Ghamdi, Mostafa; Parr, Gerard; Wang, Wenjia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,481,24

This study aims to examine the relationship between job rotation and work-related low back pain (LBP), one of the typical work-related musculoskeletal symptoms of Korean workers. METHODS: We conducted this study using the data of the 5th Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS). As the subject of this study, 27,163 wage workers were selected, and classified into three groups according to occupational type (white-collar, service and sales, and blue-collar). In this study, job rotation means to change the work-related activities with other colleagues periodically and work-related LBP was defined as whether there was work-related LBP in the last 12 months. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between job rotation and work-related LBP. RESULTS: Out of 27,163 workers, 2,421 (8.9%) answered that they had job rotation and 2,281 (8.4%) answered that they experienced work-related LBP. According to the results from logistic regression, job rotation was significantly associated with low prevalence of work-related LBP among blue-collar workers (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58–0.88), whereas no significant relationship was observed among white-collar, service and sales groups. In addition, the negative association between job rotation and work-related LBP among blue-collar workers was more pronounced when exposed to ergonomic risk factors (uncomfortable posture OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.98; heavy work OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57–0.96; repetitive work OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60–0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Job rotation was associated with low prevalence of work-related LBP among workers in the blue-collar occupational group in Korea. It is necessary to evaluate the effect of job rotation by occupational type and introduce an appropriate method of job rotation to reduce workers' work-related musculoskeletal symptoms.","Shin, Ji-Su; Seo, Kwanghyun; Oh, Hyun-Jeong; Lim, MyeongSeob; Kang, Hee-Tae; Jeong, Kyeong-Sook; Koh, Sang-Baek; Kim, Sung-Kyung; Oh, Sung-Soo",Ann Occup Environ Med,481,1

The chapter concludes that though some personality differences have the tendency to exacerbate work–nonwork conflict (even when friendly policies are provided), such differences can still achieve work–life integration if the individuals adopt Self-Care behaviors that can compensate for the negative tendencies. It requires individuals to identify and recognize these negative tendencies and proactively work to mitigate them using Self-Care behaviors.","Amah, Okechukwu E.; Ogah, Marvel",Work-life Integration in Africa,481,1

There is a tension between those who experience and bemoan precariousness, intermittent and under-employment and those for whom all of life is centred around work. For some this had led to their expulsion from waged labour, whilst for others it has led to its intensification. The 4th IR is presented as inevitable, silencing the manner in which it relates to the development of capitalism and its articulation with class struggle.

In response to this success, we believe that it is time to shift our online attention onto creating a student experience that is equivalent to the entire on-campus experience, and increasing student well-being, success and satisfaction. In this chapter, we introduce a model of an online education hierarchy of student needs—a novel adaptation of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Online education is closing the gap between academic equivalence of on-campus and online education, and we contend that the next phase of meeting online student needs includes addressing academic and general well-being, and a strong sense of community, connection and belongingness, which may eventually result in online self-actualization.

Those outer islands of Tuvalu, long mythologised as the nation's real heartland, are being constructed as secure, while the capital is insecure against COVID‐19 risk. Rural place is thus constituted as nurturing and safe, particularly because of a renewed policy focus on customary practices of food security.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of physical activity on resilience, as well as the mediating effects of competence need, autonomy need, and relatedness need between physical activity and resilience. The study involved 2375 college students (1110 males and 1265 females), with an average age of 20.25 years (SD = 2.04). Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, Basic Needs Satisfaction in General Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results showed that physical activity was positively associated with resilience, and the three basic needs played significant mediating roles between physical activity and resilience. The indirect effect of competence need was significantly greater than that of autonomy need and relatedness need. To conclude, physical activity plays an important role in resilience among college students, and the satisfaction of competence, autonomy, and relatedness needs mediates the relationship between physical activity and resilience, among which, competence need appears as the strongest mediator.","Xu, Shanshan; Liu, Zongyu; Tian, Siyu; Ma, Zhiyao; Jia, Cunxian; Sun, Guoxiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,481,24

The Standard Model breaks charge conjugation parity (CP) symmetry, but not in a sufficient amount to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. Historically one of the first systems to be studied in the search of symmetry breaking within the Standard Model is the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The contribution to the neutron EDM coming from the SM is several order of magnitudes smaller than the current experimental bound, thus providing a unique, background-free window for potential discovery of physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The strong CP-violating [Formula: see text] term can also contribute to the neutron EDM, as can all the CP-violating effective operators describing, at energies below the electro-weak scale, the contributions from BSM. To constrain all these contributions to the neutron EDM we need to precisely determine the hadronic matrix elements of the corresponding renormalized operators. After a brief introduction on baryon asymmetry and baryogenesis, I summarize the current stuatus for experiments in search of a neutron EDM. I then describe in more details the different CP-violating sources, and some results in Chiral Perturbation Theory precede a discussion on the current status of Lattice QCD calculations. I will in particular focus on the 2 main challenges for these type of calculations: the signal-to-noise ratio and the renormalization. I will discuss several improvement techniques trying to improve these two aspects of the calculation and I will conclude with an optimistic view into the future.","Shindler, Andrea",Eur Phys J A Hadron Nucl,481,0

We sought to develop a virtual network to facilitate remote engagement and training in surgical research during COVID-19. RoboSurg aims to conduct a series of systematic reviews, to summarise and critique the reporting of studies of robot-assisted surgery across seven upper gastrointestinal procedures. METHODS: A protocol was developed based on previously published work. Searches were undertaken to identify studies evaluating robotic pancreas, liver, oesophagus, stomach, gallbladder, bariatric and anti-reflux surgery. Participants were identified through social media and collaborative research networks. Abstracts were screened for inclusion by two participants. Data extraction is completed by teams of collaborators, entered into a bespoke REDCap database and verified by senior team member. Changes are logged, with rationale and feedback provided to collaborators and reviewed by a third reviewer to assess consistency. Results of each review will be summarised in narrative syntheses. RESULTS: A total of 134 collaborators have registered, with 73 active participants. Collaborators range from second year medical students to surgical registrars across the UK. To date, 9444 abstracts and 1653 full texts have been screened with 422 eligible articles identified. Data extraction for two systematic reviews, including 193 articles, has been completed using this approach. CONCLUSION: RoboSurg has developed a network and methodological framework for the remote conduction of complex systematic reviews, which can be utilised to engage and train students and trainees in surgical research.","Jones, Conor S; Dada, Mo; Dewhurst, Max; Dewi, Ffion; Pathak, Samir; Main, Barry G; Blencowe, Natalie S; Jones, Conor",BJS Open,481,1

Women's health care is often acute and in continual demand, with poor health outcomes seen in women's health in particular in the recent Ebola and Swine flu epidemics. Regrettably, early reports globally and in the UK have shown a rise in the stillbirth rate. We aimed to evaluate the provision of obstetrics and gynaecology services in the UK during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We undertook an interview-based national survey of junior doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology in women’s healthcare units in the National Health Service using the network of the UK Audit and Research Collaborative in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. We sought responses on general training, labour ward care, antenatal and postnatal care, benign gynaecology and gynaecology oncology services. RESULTS: We received responses from 148/155 units (95%) contacted. Most completed speciﬁc training drills for managing obstetric and gynaecological emergencies (89/148, 60.1%) and two-person donning and dofﬁng of personal protective Equipment (PPE) (96/148, 64.9%). The majority of surveyed units implemented COVID-19-speciﬁc protocols (130/148, 87.8%), offered adequate PPE (135/148, 91.2%) and operated dedicated COVID-19 emergency theatres (105/148,70.8%). Most units suspended elective gynaecology services (131/148, 88.5%). The 2-week referral pathway for oncological gynaecology was not affected in half of the units (76/148,51.4%), but half reported a planned reduction in oncology surgery (82/148, 55.4%) DISCUSSION: Women's health care services have responded well to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, however further planning is required for the long term.","Rimmer, Michael P; Al Wattar, Bassel A; Barlow, Catriona; Black, Naomi; Carpenter, Ciara; Conti-Ramsden, Frances; Dalton, John A W; Davies, Rhianna; Davies, Rebecca; Dunlop, Cheryl; Guyett, Elvena; Jamison, Laura; Karavadra, Babu; Kasaven, Lorraine; Lattey, Katherine; Long, Emma; Macmahon, Caroline; Navaratnam, Kate; Nijjar, Simrit; O’Brien, Stephen; Ojukwu, Obi; Parnell, Laura; Raglan, Olivia; Ramcharn, Meera; Riches, Jenny; Stocker, Linden Jane; Wong, Siew Chee; Wyeth, Charlotte; Rimmer, Michael P",BJS Open,481,1

The theoretical results are verified by some numerical simulations. It is shown that the discrete systems exhibit more interesting behaviors, including the chaotic sets, quasi-periodic orbits, and the cascade of period-doubling bifurcation in orbits of periods 2, 4, 8, 16. Finally, corresponding to the two bifurcation behaviors discussed, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is numerically calculated, which further verifies the rich dynamic characteristics of the discrete system.","Jiang, Xiao-Wei; Chen, Chaoyang; Zhang, Xian-He; Chi, Ming; Yan, Huaicheng",Nonlinear Dyn,481,29

Α significant association between vitamin-D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity and inpatient mortality from COVID-19 disease was recently shown while a recent study has claimed lower COVID-19 cases in European countries with a better vitamin D status. Aims: To further elucidate the possible role of vitamin D population status in the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined the associations between published representative and standardized population vitamin D data on European population vitamin D status and the Worldometer COVID-19 data. Methods: Data from the Worldometer on 26 European countries populated >4 million (M) were analyzed. Results: On 19-June-2020, linear regression found no correlation between published representative-standardized population vitamin-D concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations predicting a reduction of 47-64-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 61-82-102.4% in deaths/M, further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L. On 15-August-2020 these correlations were sustained indicating a truthful association, yet not proving causality. Weighted ANOVA was performed to evaluate serious-critical/M (R(2)=0.22) by the vitamin-D population status (deficient-D <50, insufficient-IN 50–62.5, mildly insufficient-MIN >62.5–75 and sufficient-S >75 nmol/L) and ANCOVA the deaths/M (R(2)=0.629) after controlling for life expectancy (R(2)=0.47). Serious-critical showed a decreasing trend (p<0.001) from population status D (p<0.001) to IN: 9.2%, p<0.001, MIN: 47.6%, p<0.044 and S: 100% (reference). For deaths/M the respective decreasing trend (p<0.001) was 62.9% from D (p<0.001) to IN (p<0.001), 65.15% to MIN (p<0.001) and 78.8% to S (p=0.041). Conclusions: Following the Endocrine Society’s expert committee recommendations, without previous testing being necessary, reaching and maintaining a serum 25(OH)D of 100–150 nmol/L (40–60 ng/ml) could be achieved by an initial supplementation with the upper tolerable daily intake doses (IU/day) for up to two months: <1yr 2000, 1-18yrs 4000 and all adults 10,000 (obese x 2–3 times more) and then with the maintenance proposed doses that do not require medical supervision, practically identical with the IOM’s upper tolerable limits: 1000 <6m, 1500 6m-1yr, 2500 1-3yrs, 3000 4-8yrs, and 4000 >8yrs, with adults and adolescents requiring 4000–5000 (obese x 2). Vitamin D may not prevent SARS-CoV-2 from spreading but may protect, without any risk of toxicity, from serious-critical illness and death from COVID-19 disease. While awaiting well-designed prospective studies, following the proposed approach, the gain for global public health and not only against SARS-CoV-2 may just prove invaluable.","Papadimitriou, Dimitrios T; Vassaras, Alexandros K; Holick, Michael F",J Endocr Soc,481,21

This article reports on FV apparent in a study which explored the experiences of people with both ABI and justice system encounters in Victoria, Australia. One hundred interviews and one focus group consulted people with ABI, their families and carers, and various stakeholder groups in the Victorian justice system in Australia. Qualitative content analysis determined dominant themes and sub-themes and the less common themes. Inductive interpretive content analysis identified themes commonly found in previous published research and themes that appeared unique to, or unanticipated in, our data, such as the FV theme upon which this article focuses. Our findings reveal that FV has adversely affected many people with ABI who came into contact with Victoria’s justice system. Further, as ABI and FV often co-occur with substance abuse, mental health problems, socio-economic and many other significant disadvantages, for some FV perpetrators with an ABI, their ABI symptoms and characteristic co-morbidities may be a mitigating factor in their offending. The connection between ABI and family violence emerged as a troubling research theme. Indeed, the impact of FV on too many of our participants with an ABI compels us to call for further related research and secondary prevention programs targeted at FV victims, and offenders, living with ABI.

Similar coronavirus epidemics over the past years affected healthcare workers significantly. Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) presented a unique risk to ear, nose and throat (ENT) Surgeons. We introduce various methods of reducing risk in ENT AGPs. RECOMMENDATIONS: During trachesostomies we advocate the adoption of a specialist checklist based on ENT UK guidelines. We also advise the use of a clear drape to create a clear barrier between the patient and staff. For ear surgery we advise suturing 2 microscope pieces together end-to-end so that a clear drape can sperate the patient from surgeon. During nasal and sinus surgery, we advise attaching a clear drape to the sterile camera drape used in rigid nasal endoscopy to create a barrier between patient and surgeon. DISCUSSION: Our recommendations will create an extra barrier between the patient and the rest of healthcare team. This should reduce the risks to theatre staff from AGPs. CONCLUSIONS: COVID 19 is a serious health issue affecting healthcare workers, especially during AGPs in ENT surgery. We recommend several techniques to reduce risk.

We explored the effects on vitreoretinal and cataract surgeries, which constitute the commonest areas of ophthalmic surgery. METHOD: Literature searches were performed for the terms “vitreoretinal”, and “cataract”, each in combination with “surgery” and “Covid-19”. Relevant results were assessed to determine perceived impact on ophthalmic theatres. RESULTS: 36 search results were analysed; 25 and 11 for cataract and vitreoretinal surgery respectively. Efforts to reduce infection rates have significantly reduced non-urgent operations, with reports of just 5.7% of ophthalmologists in certain areas performing cataract surgeries. Furthermore, surgeons have been advised to perform bilateral cataract surgery, and to combine phacoemulsification with vitreoretinal surgery, thereby avoiding deferred operations and further exposure. Other recommended changes in surgical strategies to enhance safety include three-dimensional heads-up displays for vitreoretinal surgeries, novel microscope drapes, and virtual consultations for surgery follow-up. Various reports indicate a negative impact on junior surgeon training and mental well-being; indeed, The Royal College of Ophthalmology has recommended assigning operations to experienced surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic surgery rates and protocols have been impacted in the effort to reduce Covid-19 spread.

This study aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of long-term maintenance treatment with RTX, in a cohort of patients with AAV. METHOD: Retrospective, descriptive study of 62 patients with AAV. We included 42 patients, who received RTX maintenance treatment in a newly diagnosed or a relapsed disease. We recorded the duration, dosage, and adverse events (infections, infusion-related events, relapses, late onset leukopenia, malignancy and hypogammaglobulinemia). RESULTS: 43 patients (average age 60.33 years, 49% women) received fixed interval dosing with RTX maintenance 1000 mg every 6 months. The most frequent organ involvement (74%) was lung and/or kidney. 33% (14/43) of the patients received RTX maintenance in a relapsed disease. The RTX regimen was followed after induction treatment with rituximab (47%), cyclophosphamide (33%), combination cyclophosphamide and rituximab (14%) or methotrexate/MMF (6%). Median total duration of maintenance treatment was 24 months (range 6-72 months). The most frequent adverse event was serious infections in 23% of the patients, including SARS-CoV-2 in two patients, while four of these patients died. We also recorded: hypogammaglobulinemia in 14%, malignancy in 5% and infusion-related events in 2%. The rate of the major relapses in our cohort during RTX maintenance was quite low at 7% (3/43), the time between 24-60 months, and the rate of the major relapses dependent on the induction treatment was quite the same: cyclophosphamide group vs rituximab group (7 vs 10%, p=0.786). CONCLUSION: In our cohort long-term maintenance treatment in AAV with rituximab maintains remission for longer time, with a quiet safety profile. This could suggest that in selected patients, extended periods of rituximab treatment might be safe.","Chalkia, Aglaia; Thomas, Konstantinos; Kourniotis, Dimitrios; Panagiotopoulos, Alexandros; Alexakou, Zoe; Mpora, Margarita; Aggelis, George; Vasilopoulos, Dimitrios; Petras, Dimitrios",Nephrol Dial Transplant,481,24

Infections of parasitic blood flukes, known as schistosomes, cause the disease. No vaccine is available yet and thus there is a need to design an effective vaccine against schistosomiasis. Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium are the main pathogenic species that infect humans. In this research, core proteomics was combined with a subtractive proteomics pipeline to identify suitable antigenic proteins for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against human-infecting Schistosoma species. The pipeline revealed two antigenic proteins—calcium binding and mycosubtilin synthase subunit C—as promising vaccine targets. T and B cell epitopes from the targeted proteins were predicted using multiple bioinformatics and immunoinformatics databases. Seven cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL), three helper T cell lymphocytes (HTL), and four linear B cell lymphocytes (LBL) epitopes were fused with a suitable adjuvant and linkers to design a 217 amino-acid-long MEV. The vaccine was coupled with a TLR-4 agonist (RS-09; Sequence: APPHALS) adjuvant to enhance the immune responses. The designed MEV was stable, highly antigenic, and non-allergenic to human use. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) analysis were performed to study the binding affinity and molecular interactions of the MEV with human immune receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) and MHC molecules (MHC I and MHC II). The MEV expression capability was tested in an Escherichia coli (strain-K12) plasmid vector pET-28a(+). Findings of these computer assays proved the MEV as highly promising in establishing protective immunity against the pathogens; nevertheless, additional validation by in vivo and in vitro experiments is required to discuss its real immune-protective efficacy.","Rehman, Abdur; Ahmad, Sajjad; Shahid, Farah; Albutti, Aqel; Alwashmi, Ameen S.

Coronaviruses infect many animal species, but disease severity varies between strains. Viral accessory proteins are generally implicated in increased infectivity, pathogenicity, and virulence. The accessory protein open reading frame 8 (ORF8), although not essential for viral replication, appears to play a critical role in disease severity by inhibiting multiple pathways of the immune response. Furthermore, the ORF8 gene is found within a highly variable portion of the genome, increasing the possibility of dangerous mutant forms arising. Structure‐based design of therapeutics holds great promise for effective targeting of such rapidly evolving threats. Thus, we designed physical models and computer representations of ORF8, based on the published structure 7JTL, to better evaluate the structural features responsible for viral pathogenicity. ORF8 exists as a homodimer held together by amino acid residues that interact through hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, a salt bridge, and a disulfide bond. These interactions occur in a region referred to as the covalent interface. Another interface, referred to as the noncovalent interface, exists between separate homodimers and results in oligomerization. The homodimers in the oligomer are held together by an intermolecular beta sheet that is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic surface. These two dimerization interfaces are unique to SARS‐CoV‐2 and have been proposed to be involved in the protein's ability to evade and suppress the host immune response. The computer and physical representations allow for better visualization of the ORF8 structure to evaluate the role of the multimeric structure. ORF8 has been found to interact with various host proteins, including Interleukin‐17 Receptor A (IL17RA), a pro‐inflammatory cytokine. To further corroborate the existence of this interaction and to better understand the role oligomerization might play in pathogenicity, we assessed the possible interactions of ORF8 (7JTL) and IL17RA (5N9B) through theoretical modeling using available tools such as HDOCK. A better understanding of these inter‐subunit interactions may improve our understanding of the unique mechanism the virus uses to evade the immune system and may be instrumental in the development of effective therapeutics.","Robinson, Allison; Peterson, Ryan; Stearns, Leeann; Vazquetelles, Ryan; Wiles, Elizabeth; Hart, Bailey; Guzman, Karen",FASEB J,481,11

Advantages, such as safety and convenience of the ultrasonic technology, and measurement accuracy, make it more widely applied in the clinical anesthesia, and computed tomography (CT) multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) technology will certainly provide a more accurate measurement. For better application for thoracic surgery choice LDLT, relieving the injury to patients, and reducing the complications, this study will compare the two approaches. Methods: The first part, 120 cases of patients were selected according to the height and gender; recording the patient's optimum LDLT and measurement the transverse diameter of the cricoid cartilage (TD-C) by ultrasound and CT MPR, and then obtained the TD-C range measurement by ultrasound and CT MPR corresponding to different types of LDLT.

They are characterized by a chemical structure including the oxazolidone ring with the S configuration of substituent at C5, the acylaminomethyl group linked to C5 and the N-aryl substituent. The synthesis of oxazolidinones has gained increasing interest due to their unique mechanism of action that assures high antibiotic efficiency and low susceptibility to resistance mechanisms. Here, the main features of oxazolidinone antibiotics licensed or under development, such as Linezolid, Sutezolid, Eperezolid, Radezolid, Contezolid, Posizolid, Tedizolid, Delpazolid and TBI-223, are discussed. As they are protein synthesis inhibitors active against a wide spectrum of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, their biological activity is carefully analyzed, together with the drug delivery systems recently developed to overcome the poor oxazolidinone water solubility. Finally, the most employed analytical techniques for oxazolidinone determination in different matrices, such as biological fluids, tissues, drugs and natural waters, are reviewed. Most are based on HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) coupled with UV-Vis or mass spectrometer detectors, but, to a lesser extent are also based on spectrofluorimetry or voltammetry.","Foti, Claudia; Piperno, Anna; Scala, Angela; Giuffrè, Ottavia",Molecules,481,1

Dynamic stretch and recoil of the arterial wall during pulsation (in normal conduit arteries, stretch 20% above diastolic diameter) maintains homeostasis; a static arterial wall is associated with remodeling. PPHN is diagnosed by echocardiography as decreased pulmonary artery wall displacement during systole, causing decreased pulmonary arterial pressure acceleration time in a stiff artery. We hypothesized that a ‘normal’ amplitude of pulsatile stretch is protective against ER stress, while the loss of stretch is a trigger for hypoxia-induced stress responses. Using a novel in vitro model of pulmonary arterial myocytes subject to repetitive stretch-relaxation cycles within a normoxic or hypoxic environment, we examined the relative impact of hypoxia (pulmonary circuit during unresolved PPHN) and cyclic mechanical stretch (diminished in PPHN) on myocyte homeostasis, specifically on signaling proteins for autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Stretch induced autophagosome abundance under electron microscopy. Hypoxia, in presence or absence of pulsatile stretch, decreased unfolded protein response (UPR) hallmark BIP (GRP78) in contractile phenotype pulmonary arterial myocytes. Inositol requiring enzyme-1 α (IRE1α) was not activated; but hypoxia induced eif2α phosphorylation, increasing expression of ATF4 (activating transcription factor-4). This was sensitive to inhibition by autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1. We conclude that in the pulmonary circuit, hypoxia induces one arm of the UPR pathway and causes ER stress. Pulsatile stretch ameliorates the hypoxic UPR response, and while increasing presence of autophagosomes, does not activate canonical autophagy signaling pathways. We propose that simultaneous application of hypoxia and graded levels of cyclic stretch can be used to distinguish myocyte signaling in the deformable pulmonary artery of early PPHN, versus the inflexible late stage PPHN artery.","Hinton, Martha; Eltayeb, Elwasila; Ghavami, Saeid; Dakshinamurti, Shyamala",Biochem Biophys Rep,481,5

Construction workers are more directly and significantly affected by construction noise. Therefore, the construction noise situation within construction sites, the acoustic environment experience of construction workers, and the impact of noise on them are highly worthy of attention. This research conducted a 7-month noise level (L(Aeq)) measurement on a construction site of a reinforced concrete structure high-rise residential building in northern China. The noise conditions within the site in different spatial areas and temporal stages was analyzed. Binaural recording of 10 typical construction noises, including earthwork machinery, concrete machinery, and hand-held machinery, were performed. The physical acoustics and psychoacoustic characteristics were analyzed with the aid of a sound quality analysis software. A total of 133 construction workers performing 12 types of tasks were asked about their subjective evaluation of the typical noises and given a survey on their noise experience on the construction site. This was done to explore the acoustic environment on the construction site, the environmental experience of construction workers, the impact of noise on hearing and on-site communications, and the corresponding influencing factors. This research showed that the noise situation on construction sites is not optimistic, and the construction workers have been affected to varying degrees in terms of psychological experience, hearing ability, and on-site communications. Partial correlation analysis showed that the construction workers’ perception of noise, their hearing, and their on-site communications were affected by the noise environment, which were correlated to varying degrees with the individual’s post-specific noise, demand for on-site communications, and age, respectively. Correlation analysis and cluster analysis both showed that the annoyance caused by typical construction noise was correlated to its physical and psychoacoustic characteristics. To maintain the physical and mental health of construction workers, there is a need to improve on the fronts of site management, noise reduction, equipment and facility optimization, and occupational protection.","Yang, Xinhao; Wang, Yitong; Zhang, Ruining; Zhang, Yuan",Front Psychol,481,1

Despite its history of stigma, controversy and low accessibility, ECT is found to be beneficial and efficient in severe cases of depression where medication fails to bring results. Titration tables developed over time, based on evidenced-based medicine, have made this treatment technique safe and, in some cases, the first choice of treatment. The aim of the review was to summarize the research conducted on the efficacy of ECT on major depressive disorder and variables studied such as technique, comorbidities and medication as well as the effects and outcomes of this procedure. At the same time, the application and correlations with other psychiatric and neurological disorders, including catatonia, agitation and aggression in individuals with dementia, schizophrenia, and epilepsy were assessed. There are no statistically demonstrated effects due to the fact that a small number of moderate-quality studies have been published; however, the combination of ECT technique with standard medication and care, can improve patient outcome. Furthermore, with regard to ECT, widespread and robust volume changes in both cortical and subcortical regions have been shown.

Methods: The incidence data and epidemic information of COVID-19 reported in Ningbo as of 9 March, 2020 were collected, and based on the implementation of prevention and control strategies, we developed a SEIR epidemic dynamics model. The basic and real-time reproduction numbers were calculated to evaluate effectiveness of prevention and control. Results: A total of 157 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, without death, in Ningbo. The proportion of severe cases was 12.1%. The mean incubation period was estimated to be (5.7±2.9) days. The mean interval from illness onset to diagnosis was (5.4±3.7) days. The mean duration from diagnosis to hospital discharge was (16.6±6.5) days. A total of 105 339 contacts had been under medical observation. The infection rates in contacts with home quarantine and centralized quarantine were 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.

It may increase evaporative water loss (EWL). If significant, further investigation of warming modifications to minimize this impact would be warranted. OBJECTIVES To quantify EWL in two groups of children (warmed and nonwarmed) having surgical procedures under anesthesia. METHODS We performed an observational study of well children having general anesthesia for elective surgical procedures lasting ≥60 min. They were recruited sequentially to each of three age groups: 1-12 months, 13 months-5 years, and 5-12 years--with each age group divided into convectively warmed (43°C) and nonwarmed (21°C) subgroups. Evaporative heat loss (EHL) was calculated from accurate measurement of net EWL during the surgical period. RESULTS Sixty children were studied. As a percentage of body mass, mean EWLs were 0.29 (warmed) and 0.09 (nonwarmed). Using an ancova model, only procedure duration had a significant impact and explained why the extended procedural time in some convectively warmed children led to higher mean EWLs for that group. For the nonwarmed group, the mean Tcore drop was 1.27°C with a contribution from EWL of 0.6°C over ~70 min. CONCLUSIONS Within the age range 1 month-12 years, EHL is not significantly influenced by convective heating under anesthesia. There is no thermal advantage in exploring technique modifications such as humidifying the warming air. Previous estimates of the contribution of EHL to total heat loss in anesthetized children may require revision.","Cassey, John; Salter, Jo; Colyvas, Kim; Burstal, Richard; Stanger, Rohan",Paediatric anaesthesia,481,1

The final date of follow-up was March 21, 2020. RESULTS Age, comorbidities, higher neutrophil cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts and subsets, impairment of liver, renal, heart, coagulation systems, systematic inflammation and clinical scores at admission were significantly associated with disease severity. Ten (16.1%) moderate and 45 (47.9%) severe patients experienced deterioration after admission, and median time from illness onset to clinical deterioration was 14.7 (IQR 11.3-18.5) and 14.5 days (IQR 11.8-20.0) respectively.

Besides these structural roles, N protein associates with a component of the replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3, at a critical early stage of infection. N protein has also been proposed to participate in the replication and selective packaging of genomic RNA and the transcription and translation of subgenomic mRNA. Coronavirus N proteins contain two structurally distinct RNA-binding domains, an unusual characteristic among RNA viruses. To probe the functions of these domains in the N protein of the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we constructed mutants in which each RNA-binding domain was replaced by its counterpart from the N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Mapping of revertants of the resulting chimeric viruses provided evidence for extensive intramolecular interactions between the two RNA-binding domains. Through analysis of viral RNA that was packaged into virions we identified the second of the two RNA-binding domains as a principal determinant of MHV packaging signal recognition. As expected, the interaction of N protein with M protein was not affected in either of the chimeric viruses. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N substitutions did not alter the fidelity of leader-body junction formation during subgenomic mRNA synthesis. These results more clearly delineate the functions of N protein and establish a basis for further exploration of the mechanism of genomic RNA packaging. IMPORTANCE This work describes the interactions of the two RNA-binding domains of the nucleocapsid protein of a model coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus. The main finding is that the second of the two domains plays an essential role in recognizing the RNA structure that allows the selective packaging of genomic RNA into assembled virions.","Kuo, Lili; Koetzner, Cheri A; Hurst, Kelley R; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,481,1

Such molecular refinements are largely absent in heterogeneous, maturation-stalled, neocortical-like neurons (termed ""cortical"" here) spontaneously generated by established embryonic stem cell (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation. Building on recently identified central molecular controls over SCPN development, we used a combination of synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) for Fezf2, the central transcription factor controlling SCPN specification, and small molecule screening to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifiers might complement Fezf2 functions to promote SCPN-specific differentiation by mouse ES (mES)-derived cortical-like neurons. We find that the inhibition of a specific histone deacetylase, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), enhances refinement of SCPN subtype molecular identity by both mES-derived cortical-like neurons and primary dissociated E12.5 mouse cortical neurons. In vivo, we identify that SIRT1 is specifically expressed by CPN, but not SCPN, during late embryonic and postnatal differentiation. Together, these data indicate that SIRT1 has neuronal subtype-specific expression in the mouse cortex in vivo, and that its inhibition enhances subtype-specific differentiation of highly clinically relevant SCPN / CSN cortical neurons in vitro.","Sadegh, Cameron; Ebina, Wataru; Arvanites, Anthony C; Davidow, Lance S; Rubin, Lee L; Macklis, Jeffrey D",PloS one,481,1

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Ulsan University Hospital (tertiary teaching hospital), South Korea. Patients A total of 359 women underwent SPA-LAVH for the following conditions: benign uterine tumor, preinvasive uterine lesion, and microinvasive cervical cancer. Interventions The participants included 124 women with vault drains and 235 women without drains. Measurements Surgical outcomes, perioperative complications and morbidity, postoperative febrile morbidity. Results There were no differences in background features between drain and no-drain groups. In surgical outcomes, mean uterine weight (364.2 ± 184.9 g vs. 263.7 ± 138.6 g; p < 0.001), operation time (87.4 ± 21.5 min vs. 73.0 ± 17.6 min; p < 0.001), blood loss (225.3 ± 122.2 mL vs. 150.4 ± 95.2 mL; p < 0.001), and hemoglobin decline (1.97 ± 0.96 g/dL vs. 1.42 ± 0.89 g/dL; p < 0.001) were significantly larger for the drain group compared with the no-drain group. However, with regard to postoperative morbidity and complications, there were no group differences in the transfusion rates (6.5% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.300), intraoperative complications (2.4% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.420), perioperative complications (2.4% vs. 0.9%; p = 0.345), and febrile morbidity ≥ 37.5°C (8.9% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.477), although the drain group was more prone to the development of pelvic fluid collection and febrile morbidity than the no-drain group.

In this work GO nanosheets, synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite (patent N 102015000023739, Tor Vergata University), were investigated as possible carriers of an anticancer drug, the S29, an inhibitor of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (c-SRC) on a neuroblastoma cell line (SK N BE 2 cells). Neuroblastoma is a heterogenous tumor whose characteristics range from spontaneous regression to aggressive phenotypes that are due to different mutations that often occur in SRC family kinases. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases are currently investigated for their anti-tumoral effects on aggressive neuroblastomas, but their uptake in cells and pharmacokinetics needs to be improved. In this work S29 was stably conjugated with highly water-dispersible GO nanoparticles. S29/GO complex formation was induced by 1h sonication and its stability was analyzed by chromatography coupled with spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry. The synthesized composite (GO-S29) was delivered into SK N BE 2 cells and its effects on cell viability, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and migration were studied. The results show that the compound GO-S29 exerts anti-tumoral effects on the neuroblastoma cell line, higher than both GO and S29 do alone and that GO has an additive effect on S29.","Mardente, Stefania; Aventaggiato, Michele; Mari, Emanuela; Francioso, Antonio; Tafani, Marco; Mosca, Luciana; Zicari, Alessandra; Malyshev, Igor; Kuznetsova, Larisa; Valentini, Federica",International journal of molecular sciences,481,16

This elderly patient had a rapid postoperative recovery. A 2-year follow-up CT showed no recurrence of the hernia. DISCUSSION Recent trends in laparoscopic procedures have been toward minimizing the number of incisions to reduce invasiveness. This case indicated that the reduced port approach can be considered a suitable and safe procedure for treatment of Morgagni hernia.

We report on a demonstration case study of improvements made in the Family Health Center (FHC) of the JPS Health Network in a refugee patient population that illustrate features of QI in a CAS framework as opposed to a traditional QI approach. METHODS We report on changes in health system utilization by new refugee patients of the FHC from 2016 to 2017. We review the literature and summarize relevant theoretical understandings of quality management in complex adaptive systems as it applies to this case example. RESULTS Applying CAS principles in the FHC, utilization of the Emergency Department and Urgent Care Center by newly arrived refugee patients before their first clinic visit was reduced by more than half (total visits decreased from 31%-14% of the refugee patients). Our review of the literature demonstrates that traditional algorithmic top-down QI processes are most often unsuccessful in improving even a few single-disease metrics, and increases clinician burnout and penalizes clinicians who care for vulnerable patients. Improvement in a CAS occurs when front-line clinicians identify care gaps and are given the flexibility to learn and self-organize to enable new care processes to emerge, which are created from bottom-up leadership that utilize existing interdependencies and interact with the top levels of the organization through intelligent top-down causation. We give examples of early adapters who are better applying the principles of CAS change to their QI efforts. CONCLUSIONS Meaningful improvement in primary care is more likely achieved when the impetus to implement change shifts from top-down to bottom-up.","Young, Richard A; Nelson, Mark J; Castellon, Ricardo E; Martin, Carmel M",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,481,28

The aim of this study was to develop such a multi-lncRNAs signature. Optimal multiple candidate signature lncRNAs associated with DRFS were firstly identified by a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression survival analysis and a robust likelihood-based survival analysis of the GEO dataset GSE25055. A nine-lncRNA prognostic risk score model Risk Score = 0.0289 × EXPLOC100507388 - 0.0814 × EXPLINC00094 - 0.2422 × EXPSMG7-AS1 - 0.2433 × EXPPP14571 + 0.4690 × EXPASAP1-IT1 - 0.2483 × EXPLOC103344931 - 0.2464 × EXPFAM182A + 0.3349 × EXPHCG26 - 0.0216 × EXPLINC00963 was built according to the coefficients of multivariate survival analysis of the association between the candidate lncRNAs and survival. EXPlncRNA was the standardized log2-transformed expression level of the gene. According to this model, higher scores predicted lower survival probability. The area under Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.777 to 0.823 from 1- to 7- year survival rate. The model and its individual lncRNAs differentiated survival probability between the higher scores (expression) and the lower scores (expression). The nine-lncRNA signature had the robust prognostic power compared with ER, PR, tumor size (T), lymph node invasion (N), TNM stage, pathologic response, chemosensitivity prediction and PAM50 signature. These results were consistent with those based on the GEO dataset GSE25065. The predictive nomograms integrating both the nine-lncRNA signature classifier and clinical-pathological risk factors were robust in predicting 1-, 3- and 5- year survival probabilities. These results supported that the nine-lncRNA signature was a robust and effective model in predicting DRFS of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer following taxane and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Sun, Min; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Xia, Lingyun; Chen, Yuying; Kuang, Li; Gu, Xinsheng; Li, Tian",Biochemical pharmacology,481,7

Anecdotally, investigations for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been restricted, resulting in diagnosis with no histological confirmation and potential secondary morbidity. In this study, we detail practice across the UK to assess impact on services and document the impact of the pandemic. METHODS For the month of April 2020, 20 tertiary paediatric IBD centres were invited to contribute data detailing: (1) diagnosis/management of suspected new patients with IBD; (2) facilities available; (3) ongoing management of IBD; and (4) direct impact of COVID-19 on patients with IBD. RESULTS All centres contributed. Two centres retained routine endoscopy, with three unable to perform even urgent IBD endoscopy. 122 patients were diagnosed with IBD, and 53.3% (n=65) were presumed diagnoses and had not undergone endoscopy with histological confirmation. The most common induction was exclusive enteral nutrition (44.6%). No patients with a presumed rather than confirmed diagnosis were started on anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Most IBD follow-up appointments were able to occur using phone/webcam or face to face. No biologics/immunomodulators were stopped. All centres were able to continue IBD surgery if required, with 14 procedures occurring across seven centres. CONCLUSIONS Diagnostic IBD practice has been hugely impacted by COVID-19, with >50% of new diagnoses not having endoscopy. To date, therapy and review of known paediatric patients with IBD has continued. Planning and resourcing for recovery is crucial to minimise continued secondary morbidity.","Ashton, James John; Kammermeier, Jochen; Spray, Christine; Russell, Richard K; Hansen, Richard; Howarth, Lucy J; Torrente, Franco; Deb, Protima; Renji, Elizabeth; Muhammed, Rafeeq; Paul, Thankam; Kiparissi, Fevronia; Epstein, Jenny; Lawson, Maureen; Hope, Ben; Zamvar, Veena; Narula, Priya; Kadir, Ahmed; Devadason, David; Bhavsar, Hemant; Beattie, Robert Mark",Archives of disease in childhood,481,1

Unfortunately, a paucity of data exists regarding perfusion metrics over the course of donor site healing. Furthermore, there are no studies that interrelate indices of perfusion with the molecular and cellular processes of donor site healing. Male Duroc pigs were anesthetized and donor site wounds were created using a Zimmer dermatome at a depth of 0.060 inch (1.52 mm). Digital photographs, laser Doppler images, and punch biopsies were obtained before and after excision and on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 16 until wounds were healed. RNA isolation was performed and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine differential gene expression over the time course. Formalin-fixed biopsies were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained, and examined. Wound surfaces were 83% re-epithelialized by day 16. Perfusion peaked on day 2 then declined, but it remained significantly elevated compared to before excision (P < .05). From day 9 onward, mean perfusion units were not significantly different from baseline (P < .05). Twenty-two representative genes were selected for examination.

We describe a simple surgical technique for intracorporeal circular-stapled Billroth I gastroduodenostomy with transumbilical introduction of the instrument. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After standard laparoscopic mobilization of the distal stomach using a mini-loop retractor (diameter, 2 mm), a semi-circumference duodenotomy was made just distal to the pyloric ring. The anvil of a circular stapling device, secured with a Prolene suture with a needle, was introduced via the duodenotomy. The suture was advanced anteriorly such that an anvil shaft transfixed the anterior duodenal wall. The duodenum was staple-transected at this point, and the anvil shaft was removed from the duodenum by pulling the thread. The anvil shaft was advanced against the posterior wall of the stomach and tightly grasped by the mini-loop retractor to avoid slippage. After the cartridge-carrying instrument was introduced transumbilically with the pneumoperitoneum maintained using a surgical glove, the anvil shaft was connected with the center rod of the instrument under fine laparoscopic view. The instrument was fired to complete the circular-stapled gastroduodenostomy. RESULTS We employed this technique in 20 patients. Neither postoperative complications, including anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our modified technique for intracorporeal Billroth I reconstruction in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is safe and feasible. This technique could be an attractive surgical option for all laparoscopic reconstructive procedures using circular stapling devices.","Omori, Takeshi; Tanaka, Kouji; Tori, Masayuki; Ueshima, Shigeyuki; Akamatsu, Hiroki; Nishida, Toshirou",Surgical endoscopy,481,1

Inference with the aim to identify increased mortality at provincial level was a very important task when the Istat data were released in April, but the naïve aggregation of the selected municipalities was not sensible to due to the selection criteria of the municipalities used by Istat. DESIGN use of a permutation-based approach to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemics using the data made available from Istat and taking into account the biased inclusion criteria. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January was available for each year of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by municipality, sex and 21 age categories. The third data release (R3) included 1,686 of the 7,904 Italian municipalities with increased mortality in 2020, covering about 40% of the Italian population. Results were compared with those obtainable with the fifth data release (R5), made available in June, when the selection of the municipalities was no longer based on increased mortality and which included more than 90% of the Italian population. R5 was considered the gold standard. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES excess of deaths from any cause in the Italian provinces between 1 March and 4 April; relative risk (RR); permutation p-values; permutation-based adjusted relative risk; population coverage. RESULTS the results of this study, which are based on two different test statistics, identify 17 and 33 provinces (out of 103) with increased overall mortality, respectively, controlling the family-wise error rate at 0.05 level. Most of the identified provinces are neighbouring provinces in the northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Liguria, Marche and Tuscany, where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. The comparison with data from R5 shows that all the identified provinces had an increase in overall mortality, mostly (31/34) above 25%. On average, the adjusted RR slightly underestimates the RR from R5, underestimating the large RR and overestimating the small RR. CONCLUSIONS this was, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first attempt to aggregate the Istat data at province level and obtain a reliable and generalizable statistical inference. This permutation-based approach provides a feasible approach to take into account the selection bias that was present in the data and could be used for analysing other types of data that present some type of selection bias.","Lusa, Lara",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,481,28

Management of these hernias is challenging. The recurrence rate after surgical repair is high because of the difficulty of prosthetic material fixation; there is no consensus regarding the best method of repair. METHODS We introduced a novel combined laparoscopic-perineal dual fixation technique in the repair of perineal hernias after APR. This technique begins with a perineal approach under laparoscopic vision. After excision of the hernia sac, the mesh is introduced and fixed anteriorly to the urogenital diaphragm and laterally to the sacrotuberous ligament and the surrounding scar tissue. The perineal incision is then closed. Next, the mesh is fixed to the sacrum with ProTack® and is fixed again to the sacrotuberous ligament via a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS The dual fixation repair method is successful and without difficulties, with no recurrence at 13-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Our laparoscopic-perineal dual fixation method is a good alternative method for large perineal hernia repair after APR.","Li, J; Zhang, W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,481,1

Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 patients: distal migration of emboli in 5 patients and vessel perforation in 1. Three patients died. Good functional outcome (mRS ≤ 2) was achieved in 9 patients (50.0%) at 3 months. CONCLUSION Rescue intra-arterial injection of tirofiban through a temporarily deployed Solitaire stent may facilitate further recanalization in cases of failed mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Seo, Jung Hwa; Jeong, Hae Woong; Kim, Sung Tae; Kim, Eun-Gyu",Neurointervention,481,14

Its prognosis is usually very poor, with a high incidence of lung metastasis. Although radiation therapy has become a major therapeutic choice for canine osteosarcoma, the high costs and unexpected side effects prevent some patients from considering this treatment. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is an ionized gas with high energy at low temperatures, and it produces reactive oxygen species that mediate many signaling pathways. Although many researchers have used CAP as an anticancer therapeutic approach in humans, its importance has been neglected in veterinary medicine. In this study, D-17 and DSN canine osteosarcoma cell lines were treated with CAP to observe its anticancer activity. By high-content screening and flow cytometry, CAP-treated cells showed growth arrest and apoptosis induction. Moreover, the osteosarcoma cells exhibited reduced migration and invasion activity when treated with CAP. Overall, CAP exerted an anticancer effect on canine osteosarcoma cell lines. CAP may have the potential to be used as a novel modality for treating cancer in veterinary medicine.","Lee, Jaehak; Moon, Hyunjin; Ku, Bonghye; Lee, Keunho; Hwang, Cheol-Yong; Baek, Seung Joon",International journal of molecular sciences,481,24

Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the potential utility in assessing level of worry about COVID-19, a transdiagnostic construct, among combustible cigarette smokers to better understand cognitive-affective factors that may maintain smoking behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shepherd, Justin M; Fogle, Brienna; Garey, Lorra; Viana, Andres G; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cognitive behaviour therapy,481,1

This study examines CSF for biomarkers of CNS injury and other pathology in relation to neurological symptoms and disease severity in patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS Nineteen patients with neurological symptoms and mild to critical COVID-19 were prospectively included. Extensive analysis of CSF, including measurement of biomarkers of CNS injury (neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and total tau) was performed and related to neurological features and disease severity. RESULTS Neurological symptoms included altered mental status (42%), headache (42%), central (21%) and peripheral weakness (32%). Two patients demonstrated minor pleocytosis and four patients had increased immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Neuronal autoantibody testing using commercial tests was negative in all patients. Increased CSF levels of NfL, GFAp and total-tau protein were seen in 63%, 37%, and 16% of patients, respectively. Increased NfL correlated with disease severity, time in intensive care and level of consciousness. NfL in CSF was higher in patients with central neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION Although limited by small sample size, our data suggest that levels of NfL, GFAp and total tau in CSF are commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19 with neurological symptoms. This is in contrast to the standard CSF work-up where pathological findings are scarce. NfL in particular, is associated with central neurological symptoms and disease severity.","Virhammar, Johan; Nääs, Anja; Fällmar, David; Cunningham, Janet L; Klang, Andrea; Ashton, Nicholas J; Jackmann, Sven; Westman, Gabriel; Frithiof, Robert; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Kumlien, Eva; Rostami, Elham",European journal of neurology,481,16

Near-infrared spectroscopy can be utilized at the bedside to detect cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. This study aimed to calibrate and validate an advanced technology near-infrared cerebral oximeter for use in children with congenital heart disease. METHODS After institutional review board approval and parental consent, 100 children less than 12 years and less than 40 kg were enrolled. Phase I (calibration) measured arterial and jugular venous saturation (SaO(2), SjO(2)) by co-oximetry simultaneously with device signals to calibrate an algorithm to determine regional cerebral saturation against a weighted average cerebral saturation (0.7 SjO(2) + 0.3 SaO(2)). Phase II (validation) evaluated regional cerebral saturation from the algorithm against the weighted average cerebral saturation by correlation, bias, precision, and A(Root Mean Square) assessed by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS Of 100 patients, 86 were evaluable consisting of 7 neonates, 44 infants, and 35 children of whom 55% were female, 79% Caucasian, and 41% with cyanotic disease. The SaO(2) and regional cerebral saturation ranged from 34% to 100% and 34% to 91%, respectively. There were no significant differences in subject characteristics between phases. For the entire cohort, A(RMS), bias, precision, and correlation coefficient were 5.4%, 0.5%, 5.39%, and 0.88, respectively. Age, skin color, and hematocrit did not affect these values. CONCLUSIONS This cerebral oximeter accurately measures the absolute value of cerebral saturation in children over a wide range of oxygenation and subject characteristics, offering advantages in assessment of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in congenital heart disease.","Kreeger, Renee N; Ramamoorthy, Chandra; Nicolson, Susan C; Ames, Warwick A; Hirsch, Russel; Peng, Lynn F; Glatz, Andrew C; Hill, Kevin D; Hoffman, Joan; Tomasson, Jon; Kurth, C Dean",The Annals of thoracic surgery,481,1

Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains. Using the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV mouse model, an NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live attenuated coronavirus vaccines.IMPORTANCE Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations such as the aged and immunocompromised. This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the 2'O methyltransferase mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy. Importantly, the 2'O methyltransferase mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations. Coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogenesis, the study highlights the potential for 2'O methyltransferase attenuation as a major component of future live attenuated coronavirus vaccines.","Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Mitchell, Hugh D; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Leist, Sarah R; Yount, Boyd L; McAnarney, Eileen T; Graham, Rachel L; Waters, Katrina M; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,481,1

OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of endovascular therapy versus medical management in patients with large vessel occlusion strokes and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≤5. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis combining two large prospectively collected datasets including patients with (1) admission NIHSS score ≤5, (2) premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2, and (3) middle cerebral-M1/M2, intracranial carotid, anterior cerebral or basilar artery occlusions. Groups receiving (1) endovascular treatment and (2) medical management were compared. The primary and secondary outcome measures were NIHSS shift (discharge NIHSS minus admission NIHSS) and the rates of mRS 0-2 at discharge and 3-6 months, respectively. Univariate, multivariate, and matched analyses were performed. RESULTS Eighty-eight patients received medical management and 30 thrombectomy. Multivariable analysis indicated thrombectomy was the only predictor of favorable NIHSS shift (β -3.7, 95% CI -6.0 to -1.5, p=0.02), as well as independence at discharge (β -21.995% CI -41.4to -20.8, p<0.01) and 3-6-month follow-up (β -21.1, 95% CI -39.1 to -19.7, p<0.01). A matched analysis (based on age, baseline NIHSS and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator use) produced 26 pairs. Endovascular therapy was statistically associated with lower NIHSS at discharge (p=0.04), favorable NIHSS shift (p=0.03), and increased independence rates at discharge (p=0.03) and 3-6-month follow-up (p=0.04). CONCLUSION In patients presenting with minimal stroke symptoms (NIHSS score ≤5) and large vessel occlusion strokes, mechanical thrombectomy appears to be associated with a favorable shift of NIHSS at discharge, as well as higher rates of independence at discharge and long-term follow-up. Confirmatory prospective studies are warranted.","Haussen, Diogo C; Lima, Fabricio O; Bouslama, Mehdi; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Silva, Gisele S; Lev, Michael H; Furie, Karen; Koroshetz, Walter; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,481,25

Social touch is a common and mutual way of expressing affection, care, and intimacy. From an evolutionary perspective, affiliative and affectionate touch are considered necessary for social and cognitive development throughout life-stages and across species. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic as a public health threat has mandated social distancing as a measure to contain the global outbreak. Travel restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine have led to separation and segregation, giving rise to social touch deprivation that might have adverse biopsychosocial consequences. METHODS Affective touch has rarely been discussed within the purview of social psychiatry. We attempted to review the neurobiological, social, and behavioural correlates of social and sexual touch, as well as the neurophysiological models involved. RESULTS The unmyelinated peripheral C-fibre afferents projecting to insular cortex and somatosensory areas form the prime pathway for affective touch. 'Top-down' modulation via the periaqueductal grey area, rostroventral medulla and sub-cortical structures, and 'Bottom-up' approach via the dorsal horn of the spine form the two theoretical models of 'social touch' system. The mu - opioid receptor (MOR) implicated in the Brain Opioid Theory of Social Attachment (BOTSA) and social neuropeptides like oxytocin and vasopressin are the primary neurochemical substrates involved. Sexual intimacy involves other neurotransmitters, with increased oxytocin activity in the limbic structures, Nucleus Accumbens, Anterior Cingulate, and Prefrontal Cortex. The discrimination and amalgamation of touch senses, their affiliative value and emotional valence in humans are based on a complex interplay between psychobiological, environmental, and personal factors. CONCLUSION The neurobehavioral and emotional effects of 'touch hunger' and strategies to mitigate it during COVID-19 are discussed in the context of psychoneuroimmunity and stress.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Vasquez, Velmarini; Pecchio, Marisin; Hegde, Muralidhar L; Ks Jagannatha, Rao; Rao, Ts Sathyanarayana",The International journal of social psychiatry,481,19

The mechanism that controls D RNA biogenesis and the role of D RNA in virus accumulation was investigated by introducing deletions, insertions, and point mutations into the sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) of TGB1 and the 8-kilodalton (8K) protein that were identified as required for efficient production of the D RNA. Transient expression of RNA-TGB in the absence of RNA-Rep (which encodes the replicase) did not result in accumulation of D RNA, indicating that its production is dependent on PMTV replication. The D RNA could be eliminated by disrupting a predicted minus-strand stem-loop structure comprising complementary sequences of the 5' TGB1 ORF and the 3' 8K ORF, suggesting intramolecular template switching during positive-strand synthesis as a mechanism for the D RNA biogenesis. Virus accumulation was reduced when the 8K ORF was disrupted but D RNA was produced. Conversely, the virus accumulated at higher titers when the 8K ORF was intact and D RNA production was blocked. These data demonstrate that the D RNA interferes with virus infection and therefore should be referred to as a defective interfering RNA (DI RNA). The 8K protein was shown to be a weak silencing suppressor. This study provides an example of the interplay between a pathogen and its molecular parasite where virus accumulation was differentially regulated by the 8K protein and DI RNA, indicating that they play antagonistic roles and suggesting a mechanism by which the virus can attenuate replication, decreasing viral load and thereby enhancing its efficiency as a parasite.","Lukhovitskaya, Nina I; Thaduri, Srinivas; Garushyants, Sonya K; Torrance, Lesley; Savenkov, Eugene I",Journal of virology,481,1

At the same time, companies actually developing and producing COVID 19 vaccines have to navigate the patent landscape and have to deal with 3rd party patents. AREAS COVERED This article discusses these different aspects regarding patent protection of COVID 19 vaccines. Patent searches have been carried out in Espacenet and the ORBIT database. Different search strings were used by the author, based on his own background knowledge. EXPERT OPINION SARS CoV2 was for the first time fully described on January 10, 2020, so it is so far not possible to determine if, and by whom, patent applications were filed for respective vaccines. On that background, allegations that patents would be responsible for insufficient access to the vaccine in particular in developing countries are baseless. Even the key players are facing contraints caused by 3rd party patents, and legal disputes are already ongoing. Anyway, the bigger obstacle for world wide equitable vaccine distribution seems to reside in know how transfer and production capacities, as ramping up production requires considerable efforts.","Storz, Ulrich",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,481,17

During the first few months of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak quickly developed into a pandemic, with a mortality rate that was increasing at an exponential rate day by day. As a result, scientists have turned to a drug repurposing approach, to rediscover the potential use and benefits of existing approved drugs. Currently, there is no single drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19. Based on only in-vitro studies, several active drugs are already in the clinical pipeline, made possible by following the compassionate use of medicine protocols. This method of repurposing and the use of existing molecules like Remdesivir (GS-5734), Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, etc. has proven to be a landmark in the field of drug rediscovery.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of scope exchange from a long single balloon enteroscope (SBE) to a gastroscope during SBE-assisted ERCP (SBE-ERCP) in patients with SAA. Methods Patients who underwent SBE-ERCP between February 2019 and October 2020 were retrospectively identified. Intubation success, scope exchange success, cannulation success, and therapeutic success were analyzed along with complications. Results Fifty-six patients with various SAAs underwent SBE-ERCP procedures, including Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy (B-II, n=13), pylorus-preserving pancreato-duodenectomy (PPPD, n=6), Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (REY HJ, n=4), and total gastrectomy with REY anastomosis (TG REY, n=33). Overall intubation, cannulation, and therapeutic success rates were 89.3%, 82.1%, and 82.1%, respectively. Therapeutic success rates did not differ significantly among the type of SAA. Successful scope exchange rate after successful intubation was significantly higher in native papilla (B-II and TG REY, 83.3%, 35/42) compared to bilioenteric anastomosis (PPPD and REY HJ, 0%, 0/8, p<0.001). Intubation success, scope exchange, and cannulation success were associated with therapeutic success (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, successful scope exchange was the only factor related to cannulation success (p=0.02). The major complication rate was 1.8% (one perforation). Conclusions SBE-ERCP is a safe and effective procedure to treat biliary problems in patients with SAA. Successful scope exchange may lead to higher therapeutic success by way of cannulation success.","Cho, Eunae; Park, Chang Hwan; Kim, Youngjung; Cho, Seo Yeon",Gut and liver,481,24

A direct comparative analysis of angiographic outcomes with the 2 techniques has not been available. We compare the angiographic outcomes of wide-neck aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling versus balloon-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on 101 consecutive patients treated at our institution, 69 with stent-assisted coiling and 32 with balloon-assisted coiling. Two multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of aneurysm obliteration and predictors of progressive aneurysm thrombosis at follow-up. RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable with respect to all baseline characteristics with the exception of a higher proportion of ruptured aneurysms in the balloon-assisted coiling group (65.6%) than in the stent-assisted coiling group (11.5%, P < .001). Procedural complications did not differ between the stent-assisted coiling group (6%) and the balloon-assisted coiling group (9%, P = .5). The rates of complete aneurysm occlusion (Raymond score 1) at the most recent follow-up were significantly higher for the stent-assisted coiling group (75.4%) compared with the balloon-assisted coiling group (50%, P = .01). Progressive occlusion of incompletely coiled aneurysms was noted in 76.6% of aneurysms in the stent-assisted coiling group versus 42.8% in the balloon-assisted coiling group (P = .02). Retreatment rates were significantly lower with stent-assisted coiling (4.3%) versus balloon-assisted coiling (15.6%, P = .05). In multivariate analysis, stented aneurysms independently predicted both complete aneurysm obliteration and progression of occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted coiling may yield lower rates of retreatment and higher rates of aneurysm obliteration and progression of occlusion at follow-up than balloon-assisted coiling with a similar morbidity rate.","Chalouhi, N; Starke, R M; Koltz, M T; Jabbour, P M; Tjoumakaris, S I; Dumont, A S; Rosenwasser, R H; Singhal, S; Gonzalez, L F",AJNR.

Multiple modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled hyperglycemia, obesity, smoking, substance abuse, and nasal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus have been described for PJI. Preoperative recognition and mitigation of these risk factors along with optimization of nonmodifiable risk factors such as kidney, liver, or immune system insufficiency can considerably decrease the risk of PJI. A comprehensive perioperative protocol should involve optimization of the operative environment to reduce the number of bacteria and particulates in the air. Several surgical and nonsurgical details of intraoperative care such as maintenance of normothermia, skin preparation, surgical field irrigation, wound closure, and duration of surgical and anesthetic procedure can influence the occurrence of PJI. Prophylactic perioperative antibiotic administration is probably one of the most important strategies in preventing PJI. Implementation of surgical safety checklist can diminish the risk of perioperative complications, particularly surgical site infection. Controversy regarding efficacy, efficiency, and optimization of some preventive measures continues to exist due to inconsistency or inadequacy of available evidence. Novel research has focused on designing PJI-resistant implants and developing vaccines that target molecule components with major role in the process of bacterial adhesion to the implant or periprosthetic tissues.","Alijanipour, Pouya; Heller, Snir; Parvizi, Javad",The journal of knee surgery,481,17

The comorbid conditions included were type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemias (LPD), degenerative joint disease (DJD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. METHODS A retrospective chart review of the patients who underwent LSG or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding at our institution from July 2004 to July 2007 was performed. The resolution of comorbidities was determined via patient-completed questionnaires and objective data. RESULTS Of the 123 patients (29 men and 94 women) reviewed, 49 had undergone LSG, and 74 had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 52 kg/m(2) for the LSG patients and 44 kg/m(2) for the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding patients. The overall percentages of excess weight loss (%EWL) were respectively 50.6 and 40.3% (P = 0.03) during mean follow-up periods of 15 and 17 months. There was a greater resolution or improvement of DM after LSG (100% vs 46%), HTN (78% vs 48%), and LPD (87% vs. 50%) than after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Other comorbidities resolved or improved at a similar rate. CONCLUSIONS Although both LSG and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding resulted in postoperative improvement or resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity, LSG statistically showed a significantly higher rate of resolution or improvement of DM, HTN, and LPD. There was no significant difference between the groups for DJD, GERD, OSA, or asthma.","Omana, Juan J; Nguyen, Scott Q; Herron, Daniel; Kini, Subhash",Surgical endoscopy,481,31

In the halogenated base pairs (except the Cl-base pair, which has a very non-planar structure with no halogen bonds) and R-I ribbons (except the At trimer), the potential N-X•••O interaction is sacrificed to optimise the N-X•••N halogen bond. In the At trimer, the astatines originally bonded to N1 in the halogen bond donating guanines have moved to the adjacent O6 atom, enabling O-At•••N, N-At•••O, and N-At•••At halogen bonds. The brominated and chlorinated R-II trimers contain two N-X•••N and two N-X•••O halogen bonds, whereas in the iodinated and astatinated trimers, one of the N-X•••N halogen bonds is lost. The corresponding R-II dimers keep the same halogen bond patterns. The G-quartets display a rich diversity of symmetries and halogen bond patterns, including N-X•••N, N-X•••O, N-X•••X, O-X•••X, and O-X•••O halogen bonds (the latter two facilitated by the transfer of halogens from N1 to O6). In general, halogenation decreases the stability of the structures. However, the stability increases with the increasing atomic number of the halogen, and the At-doped R-I trimer and the three most stable At-doped quartets are more stable than their hydrogenated counterparts. Significant deviations from linearity are found for some of the halogen bonds (with halogen bond angles around 150°).","Thornton, Nicholas J; van Mourik, Tanja",International journal of molecular sciences,481,16

This approach preserves the native lymphaticovenous architecture, distributes free lymphatic tissue along the axis of the extremity, and allows for scar release. The additional vein serves to restore bidirectional physiologic drainage inherent in the omentum and providing further lymphaticovenous drainage. We present two cases of upper and lower extremity lymphedema as a result of malignancy treated using this method. The first case was a result of breast cancer in a 55-year-old female with orthotopically placed omentum, and the second case a result of malignant nodular fasciitis in the distal lower extremity in a 56-year-old female with distally placed omentum. No complications occurred. At 3 months follow up, there is a 25% and 28% reduction in lower and upper extremity volume, respectively, with no recurrent cellulitis episodes.

Despite the ubiquity of plastic pollution and thus plastic additive in the environment, plastic additives have been studied to a limited extend. As a prerequisite to a study aiming to evaluate the leaching of a common additive used as an antioxidant (Irgafos® 168) from polyethylene microparticles, an inventory of the potential background contamination of the laboratory workplace was done. In this study, Irgafos® 168 (tris(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl) phosphite) and its oxidized form (tris (2,4-ditert-butylphenyl) phosphate) were quantified in different laboratory reagents, including the plastic packaging and the powders, using Pyrolysis-GC/MS. At least one form of Irgafos® 168 was detected in all tested laboratory reagents with higher concentrations in caps and bottles as compared to the powders. Additionally, oxidized Irgafos® 168 was also found in the reverse osmosed and deionized water container used in the laboratory. The same profile of contamination, i.e. higher concentration of the oxidized form and higher concentrations in acidic reagents, was observed when comparing the reagent and their respective containers suggesting that the additive is leaching from the container into the powder. Overall, this study demonstrates that the antioxidant additive Irgafos® 168 is ubiquitous in the laboratory workplace. Plastic additives such as Irgafos® 168 can therefore largely interfere and biased ecotoxicological and toxicological studies especially using environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics. The source, fate and effects of plastic additive from plastic debris should be carefully considered in future studies that require setting up methods to overcome these contaminations.","Hermabessiere, Ludovic; Receveur, Justine; Himber, Charlotte; Mazurais, David; Huvet, Arnaud; Lagarde, Fabienne; Lambert, Christophe; Paul-Pont, Ika; Dehaut, Alexandre; Jezequel, Ronan; Soudant, Philippe; Duflos, Guillaume",The Science of the total environment,481,13

Whilst biologic therapy is traditionally regarded as immunosuppressive and capable to increase the infectious risk, Dupilumab does not display these characteristics and may be even protective in certain cases. We investigated the link between Dupilumab therapy and SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS We carried out a comprehensive data mining and disproportionality analysis of the WHO global pharmacovigilance database. One asymptomatic COVID-19 case, 106 cases of symptomatic COVID-19, and 2 cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were found. RESULTS Dupilumab treated patients were at higher risk of COVID-19 (with an IC0.25 of 3.05), even though infections were less severe (IC0.25 of -1.71). The risk of developing COVID-19 was significant both among males and females (with an IC0.25 of 0.24 and 0.58, respectively). The risk of developing COVID-19 was significant in the age-group of 45-64 years (with an IC0.25 of 0.17). CONCLUSIONS Dupilumab use seems to reduce COVID-19 related severity. Further studies are needed to better understand the immunological mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings. Remarkably, the heterogenous nature of the reports and the database structure did not allow to establish a cause-effect link, but only an epidemiologically decreased risk in the patients subset treated with dupilumab.","Mahroum, N; Damiani, G; Watad, A; Amital, H; Bragazzi, N L; Farah, R; Wu, J-H; Kong, J D; Bridgewood, C; McGonagle, D; Khamisy-Farah, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,481,1

In only a few months, it has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies. COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges to all aspects of health care, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications for health care. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than can humans. Methods In this article, we explore the potential for the simple and widely available chest X-ray (CXR) to be used with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision. Results Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. Conclusions We have used a readily available, commercial platform to demonstrate the potential of AI to assist in the successful diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR images. The findings have implications for screening and triage, initial diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the data, a website was created to demonstrate how such technologies could be shared and distributed to others to combat entities such as COVID-19 moving forward.","Borkowski, Andrew A; Viswanadhan, Narayan A; Thomas, L Brannon; Guzman, Rodney D; Deland, Lauren A; Mastorides, Stephen M","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",481,1

In fact, social anxiety more than quadruples the risk of developing cannabis use disorder, yet it is inconsistently related to more cannabis use. Inconsistent findings may be due to lack of attention to protective behavioral strategies (PBS) among socially anxious cannabis users. PBS are cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce cannabis use and related problems. Yet socially anxious persons may be less likely to use PBS for a variety of reasons (e.g., fear of negative evaluation for engaging in behaviors to reduce use), leading to heavier or more frequent use and related problems. The current study examined the mediating role of PBS in the relationships of social anxiety with past-month cannabis use and related problems among current (past-month) cannabis users (N = 102). Social anxiety was significantly positively related to past-month cannabis problems, but not directly related to cannabis use. Social anxiety was significantly negatively related to PBS. Social anxiety was indirectly (via PBS) related to more frequent use, greater peak use, and more cannabis problems. Serial mediation analyses indicated that social anxiety was indirectly related to more cannabis problems via the serial effects of PBS and cannabis use variables. Findings suggest that socially anxious persons may be vulnerable to heavier cannabis use and more cannabis problems due to PBS underutilization. Treatment implications are discussed.","Buckner, Julia D; Morris, Paige E; Zvolensky, Michael J",Addictive behaviors,481,1

Understanding the acute effects may help elucidate the mechanism(s). This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single bout of prolonged LV on knee extensor force production and corticospinal responsiveness of vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles in healthy young and old adults. Across two visits, 23 adult subjects (20-75 years old) performed pre- and post-test measurements, separated by 30-min of either rest (control; CON) or LV. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was assessed and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate cortical voluntary activation (VATMS) as well as the motor evoked potential (MEP) and silent period (SP). In 11 young adults, thoracic electrical stimulation was used to assess the thoracic motor evoked potential (TMEP). Although MVC decreased after both CON (-6.3 ± 4.4%, p = 0.01) and LV (-12.9 ± 7.7%, p < 0.001), the MVC loss was greater after LV (p = 0.001). Normalized maximal electromyographic (EMG) activity decreased after LV for both VL (-25.1 ± 10.7%) and RF (-20.9 ± 16.5%; p < 0.001), while it was unchanged after CON (p = 0.32). For RF, the TMEP and MEP/TMEP ratio decreased (p = 0.01) and increased (p = 0.01) after LV, respectively. Both measures were unchanged for VL (p = 0.27 and p = 0.15, respectively). No changes were reported for TMS-related parameters. These results confirm our hypothesis that modulations within the central nervous system would accompany the significant reduction of maximal voluntary force. A reduced motoneuron excitability seems to explain the decreased MVC after prolonged LV, as suggested by reductions in maximal EMG (all subjects) and TMEP area (data from 11 young subjects). A concomitant increased cortical excitability seems to compensate for lower excitability at the spinal level.","Souron, Robin; Besson, Thibault; McNeil, Chris J; Lapole, Thomas; Millet, Guillaume Y",Frontiers in human neuroscience,481,31

Recently, minimally invasive endoscopic techniques via a transorbital superior eyelid approach (ETOA) or endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) have been proposed as viable alternatives to transcranial approaches for orbital tumors. In this study, the authors investigated the feasibility of 360° circumferential access to orbital tumors via both ETOA and EEA. METHODS Between April 2014 and June 2019, 16 patients with orbital tumors underwent either ETOA or EEA at the authors' institution. Based on the neuro-topographic ""four-zone model"" of the orbit with its tumor epicenter around the optic nerve in the coronal plane, ETOA (n = 10, 62.5%) was performed for tumors located predominantly superolateral to the nerve and EEA (n = 6, 37.5%) for those located predominantly inferomedial to the nerve. Eight patients (50%) presented with intraconal tumors and 8 (50%) with extraconal ones. The orbital tumors included orbital schwannoma (n = 6), cavernous hemangioma (n = 2), olfactory groove meningioma (n = 1), sphenoorbital meningioma (n = 1), chondrosarcoma (n = 1), trigeminal schwannoma (n = 1), metastatic osteosarcoma (n = 1), mature cystic teratoma (n = 1), sebaceous carcinoma (n = 1), and ethmoid sinus osteoma (n = 1).

CONCLUSIONS Without transcranial approaches requiring temporalis muscle dissection and orbitozygomatic osteotomy, the selection of ETOA or EEA based on a concept of a four-zone model with its epicenter around the optic nerve successfully provides a minimally invasive 360° circumferential access to the entire orbit with acceptable morbidity.","Jeon, Chiman; Hong, Sang Duk; Woo, Kyung In; Seol, Ho Jun; Nam, Do-Hyun; Lee, Jung-Il; Kong, Doo-Sik",Journal of neurosurgery,481,16

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) has been shown to increase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression by up to 5-fold. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY These findings coupled with observations of the high prevalence and mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have led to a speculation that ACEIs/ARBs may predispose to higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES We searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medrxiv.org preprint server until June 18, 2020. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Ten studies (6 cohorts and 4 case control) that enrolled a total of 23,892 patients and 853,369 controls were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. One study was excluded from the analysis because of high risk of bias. Prior use of ACEIs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease, odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval (0.91-1.05), I2 = 15%. Similarly, prior use of ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (0.98-1.10), I2 = 0%. CONCLUSION Cumulative evidence suggests that prior use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. Our results provide a reassurance to the public not to discontinue prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of COVID-19.","Tleyjeh, Imad M; Bin Abdulhak, Aref A; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Al-Mallah, Mouaz H; Sohail, M Rizwan; Hassett, Leslie C; Siller-Matula, Jolanta M; Kashour, Tarek",American journal of therapeutics,481,16

However, the incidence of hernia increases with the aging process. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic hernia repair in elderly patients (≥75 years), we conducted a prospective case-matched control study to compare perioperative outcomes between patients older and younger than 75 years. Methods Between September 2008 and July 2015, 572 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic hernia repair were included in this prospective study. This case-matched control study was matched based on sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and body mass index between patients younger and ≥75 years. The propensity-score matching of two groups was carried out on a 1:1 basis. Perioperative data were prospectively recorded for all patients including demographic data, operation time, length of hospital stay, narcotic dose, and complications. Results In the final analysis, 54 patients who were <75 years were extracted to match the 54 patients ≥75 years. These two groups had similar baseline characteristics excluding age. They also had similar perioperative outcomes in hernia recurrence, metachronous contralateral hernia occurrence, complication rate and chronic pain. The patients ≥75 years of age had lower requirements for analgesics than those who were <75 years of age (p=0.047). Conclusion This is the first comparative cohort study investigating the impact of aging in an Asian hernia population. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is feasible and safe for older patients, with comparable perioperative outcomes to patients <75 years.","Liu, Ying-Buh; Yu, Chih-Chin; Wu, Chao-Chuan; Lin, Chia-Da; Chueh, Shih-Chieh; Tsai, Yao-Chou",Clinical interventions in aging,481,31

Consequently, there was a necessity to shift medical teaching and assessment online. Our challenge was to logistically organise and conduct an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) using a virtual, socially distanced approach. METHODS We found that Zoom offered the most suitable functionality in mimicking a physical OSCE online and its breakout rooms were used to represent different stations. One organiser manually transferred candidates between stations, allowing for the OSCE to operate punctually. Examiners screen shared to display an automated slideshow with station vignettes, investigation results, and viva questions. RESULTS Participants found the use of Zoom's features to be extremely beneficial with one candidate describing the experience as 'brilliant, very efficient and smooth'. Numerous aspects of the OSCE from decision making, to verbal communication, to medical knowledge were assessed, equivalent to a physical OSCE. DISCUSSION As the transformation of medical education is catalysed by the pandemic, it is important to ensure that peer to peer teaching and assessments are revolutionised with a quality similar to that of physical teaching. We have displayed how this may be achieved in an OSCE setting using Zoom teleconferencing.","Hannan, Tufayl A; Umar, Safwan Y; Rob, Zakaria; Choudhury, Rakin R",Medical teacher,481,1

Single access laparoscopy has recently gained interest, but single access laparoscopic splenectomy has not been reported to date. It has the possible benefits of less pain, faster recovery, better cosmesis, with theoretically similar costs to that of traditional trocars. METHODS A case is presented and the surgical technique of single access laparoscopic splenectomy is detailed. RESULTS The patient is an otherwise healthy 24-year-old male with medically refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and a platelet count of 15 000. A splenectomy was performed using a single incision laparoscopic technique. The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position, and a 2.5-cm left upper quadrant incision was made. A multi-instrument flexible single incision port was used that held 3 trocars. A standard splenectomy was performed through this port. A linear stapler was used to transect the splenic hilum. The procedure time was just over 2 hours. The patient did well, was happy with his incision, and was discharged with a platelet count of 108 000. CONCLUSIONS Single access laparoscopic splenectomy is feasible in select patients and may provide a less painful, better cosmetic result.","Malladi, Preeti; Hungness, Eric; Nagle, Alex",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,481,1

They are a unique model for aging research due to their physiology, extreme longevity, and, when compared to mice and rats, resistance to cancer. Published surveys of disease in NMRs are sparse. Captive colonies in zoological collections provide an opportunity to monitor spontaneous disease over time in a seminatural environment. This retrospective study describes common lesions of a zoo population over a 15-year period during which 138 adult NMRs were submitted for gross and histologic evaluation. Of these, 61 (44.2%) were male, 77 (55.8%) female, 45 (32.6%) died, and 93 (67.4%) were euthanized. The most frequent cause of death or reason for euthanasia was conspecific trauma (bite wounds) and secondary complications. Some common histologic lesions and their prevalence were renal tubular mineralization (82.6%), hepatic hemosiderosis (64.5%), bite wounds (63.8%), chronic progressive nephropathy (52.9%), and calcinosis cutis (10.1%). In sum, 104 (75.4%) NMRs had more than one of the most prevalent histologic lesions. No malignant neoplasms were noted; however, there was a case of renal tubular adenomatous hyperplasia with nuclear atypia and compression that in rats is considered a preneoplastic lesion. This retrospective study confirms the NMR's relative resistance to cancer in spite of development of other degenerative diseases and highlights the utility of zoological databases for baseline pathological data on nontraditional animal models.","Delaney, M A; Nagy, L; Kinsel, M J; Treuting, P M",Veterinary pathology,481,27

However, despite over 120 supplementary immunization activities in the last decade, polio eradication efforts in Pakistan have been unable to achieve their objective of halting polio transmission. Variable governance, and inconsistent leadership and accountability have hindered the success of the polio program and the quality of the campaigns. Insecurity and terrorism has interrupted polio activities, and community fears and misbeliefs about polio vaccinations continue to persist. AREAS COVERED : The article consists of a systematic review of the barriers and facilitators associated with the delivery of polio eradication activities in Pakistan. We also provide a comprehensive review of the policy and programmatic decisions made by the Pakistan Polio Programme since 1994. Searches were conducted on Embase and Medline databases and 25 grey literature sources. EXPERT OPINION Polio eradication efforts must be integrated with other preventive health services, particularly immunization services. Addressing the underlying causes of polio refusals including underdevelopment and social exclusion will help counteract resistance to polio vaccination. Achieving polio eradication will require building health systems that provide comprehensive community-centered care, and improving governance and systems of accountability.","Ataullahjan, Anushka; Ahsan, Hanaa; Soofi, Sajid; Habib, Muhammad Atif; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Expert review of vaccines,481,1

Rapid, accurate microbiological results may allow appropriate antibiotic therapy, withholding or adapting antibiotics, and thus reducing costs and risks of empirical antibiotic therapy. The objective of this proof-of-concept pilot study was to investigate the diagnostic yield of a new polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and microarray-based rapid molecular diagnostic assay and compare the results to conventional microbiology cultures and clinical judgment. METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were obtained from 35 patients undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnostic reasons. Cases (n = 22) consisted of patients with suspicion of pulmonary bacterial infection. Controls (n = 13) were identified among patients undergoing bronchoscopy for indications other than suspicion of infection. RESULTS Demographics were similar in cases and controls. The majority (73%) of patients with pulmonary infection were on empirical antibiotic therapy. Among the 22 cases, bacteria were identified by means of PCR in 77% (n = 17) as compared with 41% (n = 9) by culture (p = 0.030). In contrast, controls yielded a PCR positive result in 45% (n = 7), as compared with no positive cultures (p = 0.005). Compared with culture results, PCR had a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 47.4-97.9) and specificity of 28.6% (95% CI 8.6-58.1) to diagnose bacterial infection. Compared with clinical judgment, corresponding figures were 77.3% (95% CI 54.5-91.1) and 46.2% (95% CI 19.3-74.8), respectively. CONCLUSION The PCR- and microarray-based rapid molecular diagnostic assay offers an alternative to conventional cultures for detection of potentially pathogenic bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with pneumonia. However, the clinical relevance is unclear as it may also detect colonisers in patients without a corresponding infection.","Jahn, Kathleen; Kuisma, Marko; Mäki, Minna; Grendelmeier, Peter; Hirsch, Hans H; Tamm, Michael; Papakonstantinou, Eleni; Stolz, Daiana",Swiss medical weekly,481,31

This study compares retinal toxicity and ocular survival between two formulations, with and without propylene glycol (Alkeran vs. Evomela, respectively). METHODS A retrospective cohort study of retinoblastoma patients who received intravitreal injections of Alkeran and Evomela at 30 μg from September 2012 to January 2019 at a single tertiary care center were enrolled. Retinal toxicity was measured using electroretinogram (ERG) and compared using a multivariate analysis of 338 injections in 101 eyes of 96 patients. Ocular survival of 163 eyes in 150 patients was compared across formulations using Cox proportional hazards model. Eyes were censored at the time a patient received a dose other than 30 μg. RESULTS Overall, ERG decline (mean, 95% CI) for each injection was -5.58 μV (-7.17, -3.99). No significant differences in ERG decrement were found between Alkeran (with alcohol) -5.52uV (-6.99, -4.05). and Evomela (without alcohol) -5.65uV (-8.31 to -2.98) formulations (p = 0.93). Ocular survival at 24 months was 93.6% (95% CI 86.2, 97.1) with alcohol and 91.7% (95% CI 53.9, 98.8) without alcohol. The hazard ratio (HR) for without vs with alcohol was 0.50 (95% CI 0.06 to 4.07); no significant difference in ocular survival was found between formulations (p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No differences were found in retinal toxicity and ocular survival between 30 μg intravitreal injections of Alkeran or Evomela for intraocular retinoblastoma. Given the increased stability of Evomela, intravitreal treatment could be expanded to centers without the ability to supply Alkeran due to its shorter safety window; however, Alkeran is less expensive. For those with existing infrastructure, Alkeran is a comparable, cost-effective alternative.","Hsieh, Terry; Liao, Albert; Francis, Jasmine H; Lavery, Jessica A; Mauguen, Audrey; Brodie, Scott E; Abramson, David H",PloS one,481,1

Methods Twenty-six 3-month-old New Zealand rabbits, 2.0-2.5 kg in weight, were used to establish the model of intervertebral disc degeneration at L 3, 4, L 4, 5, and L 5, 6 by transabdominal needle puncture. At 4 weeks after operation, the 24 rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups after successful modeling, which checked by MRI. The target intervertebral discs of each group were injected with zinc finger protein A20 overexpressed adenovirus (Ov-A20 group), empty carrier adenovirus (NC group), phosphate buffer saline (control group), and shRNA-A20 adenovirus (Sh-A20 group). The biological responses of animals in each group were comprehensive scored before 1 day of injection and after 1, 2, 3, and 6 days of injection. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection, the animals in each group were observed by MRI to obtain the exact T2 relaxation time (T2 signal value). After MRI examination, the animals were killed to take the degenerative intervertebral disc tissue; and the tissue was detected by Alcian blue staining to observed the intervertebral disc degeneration. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, and aggrecan were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, nuclear factor κB binding protein [P65, phosphate P65 (P-P65), collagen Ⅱ, aggrecan], inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β)], autophagy-related protein [LC3 (LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ) and P62] were detected by Western blot. Results The comprehensive score of biological response in each group after injection was significantly lower than that before injection ( P<0.05). At 6 days after injection, the comprehensive score of biological response in the Sh-A20 group was significantly lower than that in other groups ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference among other groups ( P>0.05). The detection of MRI showed that the T2 signal value in the Ov-A20 group was the highest at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection ( P<0.05), and the T2 signal value in the Sh-A20 group was the lowest at 2 and 4 weeks after injection ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Alcian blue staining showed that the expression of aggrecan was the highest in Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group at 4 weeks ( P<0.05); the expression of aggrecan in Ov-A20 group was the highest at 8 weeks ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, and aggrecan were the highest in Ov-A20 group and lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). Western blot showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, aggrecan, and LC3 (LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ) proteins were the highest in the Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05), while the expressions of P-P65, TNF-α, IL-1β, and P62 proteins were the lowest in Ov-A20 group and the highest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of p65 protein between groups ( P>0.05).

Our objective was to describe adherence to cysteamine in NC patients, using electronic monitoring systems. METHODS Patients with confirmed NC, aged > 4 years and receiving oral cysteamine (short acting or delayed release formulation as standard of care) from 3 French reference centers, were included. Adherence to treatment was primarily assessed as the percentage of days with a good adherence score, adherence score rating from 0 (poor) to 2 (good). A descriptive analysis was performed after 1-year follow-up. RESULTS Seventeen patients (10 girls, median age: 13.9 (5.4-33.0) years) were included. Median age at diagnosis was 17.0 (3.0-76.9) months and age at start of cysteamine was 21.0 (15.5-116.3) months. Median daily dose of cysteamine was 1.05 (0.55-1.63) g/m2/day. Over the year, the median percentage of days with a good adherence score was 80 (1-99)% decreasing to 68 (1-99)% in patients > 11 years old. The median of average number of hours covered by treatment in a day was 22.5 (6.1-23.9) versus 14.9 (9.2-20.5) hours for delayed release versus short acting cysteamine. CONCLUSION Our data are the first describing a rather good adherence to cysteamine, decreasing in adolescents and adults. We described a potential interest of the delayed release formulation. Our data highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach including therapeutic education and individualized approaches in NC patients transitioning to adulthood.

We report on the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial/intravenous (IA/IV) glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban) infusion for treating thromboembolism during endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 242 patients with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms (n=264) who underwent endovascular coil embolization from January 2011 to June 2014. Thromboembolism occurred in 20 patients (7.4%), including 14 cases of ruptured aneurysms and 6 cases of unruptured aneurysms. The most common site of aneurysms was the anterior communicating artery (n=8), followed by middle cerebral artery (n=6). When we found an enlarged thromboembolism during coil embolization, we tried to dissolve it using tirofiban administered via IA and IV loading (5 μg/kg, respectively) for 3-5 minutes followed by IV maintenance (0.08 μg/kg/min) for approximately 4-24 hours. RESULTS In 4 of 5 patients with total vessel occlusion, the vessel was recanalized to Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Scale (TICI) grade 3, and in 1 patient to TICI grade 2a. In 2 patients with partial vessel occlusion and 13 patients with minimal occlusion, the vessel recanalized to TICI grade 3. Irrelevant intracerebral hemorrhage was noted in 1 patient (5%), and thromboemboli-related cerebral infarction developed in 5 patients (25%), of which only 1 (5%) was symptomatic. CONCLUSION IA/IV infusion and IV maintenance with tirofiban appear to be an effective rescue treatment for thromboembolism during endovascular coil embolization in patients with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms.","Kim, Sang Heum; Kim, Tae Gon; Kong, Min Ho",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,481,19

The worldwide pandemic that occurs shortly after the nascent virus becomes established can have a profound impact on morbidity and mortality. Because influenza viruses continually evolve and the illness they engender can vary considerably based on characteristics of the strain, the weather, other circulating or endemic pathogens, as well as the number of susceptible hosts, the impact of each season on human health is unpredictable. Over time, the general pattern is for pandemic strains to adapt and gradually take on characteristics of seasonal strains with lower virulence and a diminished synergism with bacterial pathogens. Study of this punctuated evolution yields a number of insights into the overall pathogenicity of influenza viruses.","McCullers, Jonathan A",Microbiology spectrum,481,16

METHODS AND RESULTS Bacillus subtilis spores were aerosolized and introduced into a filtration system. Both treated and untreated filters exhibited high viable removal efficiency (>99.996%) with negligible variation in pressure drop during the entire experiment. The viability of collected spores on the filter was investigated by enumeration of spores extracted from the filter by vortexing. At room temperature and low relative humidity (RH), the survival fraction of the treated filter was significantly lower than that of the untreated filter (P-value < 0.05). Meanwhile, at room temperature and high RH and at high temperature and high RH, the survival fractions on the treated medium were statistically the same as the untreated control at room temperature and low RH. CONCLUSIONS Both treated and untreated filters achieved excellent viable removal efficiency for spores. The pressure drop of the treated filter was not affected by the iodine treatment. The viability of collected bacterial spores was decreased because of the exertion of iodine disinfectant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The evaluation demonstrates that the iodine-treated filter is a viable medium for respiratory protection against infectious spore aerosols. The results warrant further evaluation of smaller biological agents, which exhibit higher penetration.","Lee, J-H; Wu, C-Y; Wysocki, K M; Farrah, S; Wander, J",Journal of applied microbiology,481,19

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study with historic control. SETTING Single tertiary academic center. POPULATION Women older than 18 with primary cervical cancer staged FIGO IB1 - IIB enrolled in the prospective Leipzig School MMR study who underwent total mesometrial resection (TMMR) without adjuvant radiation. METHOD We retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive TMMR procedures which were performed for cancer of the uterine cervix and in which the mesureter was preserved (intervention group, 01/2014 - 06/2017). We compared this group to the previous 100 consecutive TMMRs which were performed before the introduction of mesureteral preservation (control group, 09/2010-01/2014). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The occurrence of urological and specifically ureteral complications. RESULTS Mesureteral preservation was feasible and was associated with a significant decrease in ureteral complications (11% without mesureteral preservation vs. 3% with mesureteral preservation, p=0.049). Furthermore, we found a significant decrease in the number of postoperative percutaneous nephrostomies and re-operations (7% vs. none, p=0.014). There was also a trend towards a decrease in other urinary complications such as postoperative bladder atony and uretero-vaginal fistulas. CONCLUSION The mesureter constitutes a convenient dissection plane enabling the preservation of lateral ureteral blood supply during TMMR. In our study, maintenance of mesureteral integrity was associated with a significant reduction in ureteral complications. Mesureteral preservation might also be useful in other types of pelvic surgeries with a high risk of ureteral damage.","Wolf, Benjamin; Espig, Oliver; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Horn, Lars-Christian; Aktas, Bahriye; Höckel, Michael",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,481,1

This study aims to examine the relationship between the police traffic stops (PTSs) and motor vehicle crash (MVC) deaths at the state level. We hypothesize that increased PTSs would be associated with reduced MVC deaths. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed PTSs and MVC deaths at the state level from 2004 to 2016. Police traffic stops data were from 33 state patrols from the Stanford Open Policing Project. The MVC deaths data were collected from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The vehicle miles traveled data were from the Federal Highway Administration Office of Highway Policy Information. All data were adjusted per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (100MVMT) and were analyzed as state-level time series cross-sectional data. The dependent variable was MVC deaths per 100MVMT, and the independent variable was number of PTSs per 100MVMT. We performed panel data analysis accounting for random and fixed state effects and changes over time. RESULTS Thirty-three state patrols with 235 combined years were analyzed, with a total of 161,153,248 PTSs. The PTS rate varied by state and year. Nebraska had the highest PTS rate (3,637/100MVMT in 2004), while Arizona had the lowest (0.17/100MVMT in 2009). Motor vehicle crash deaths varied by state and year, with the highest death rate occurring in South Carolina in 2005 (2.2/100MVMT) and the lowest in Rhode Island in 2015 (0.57/100MVMT). After accounting for year and state-level variability, no association was found between PTS and the MVC death rates. CONCLUSION State patrol traffic stops are not associated with reduced MVC deaths. Strategies to reduce death from MVC should consider alternative strategies, such as motor vehicle modifications, community-based safety initiatives, improved access to health care, or prioritizing trauma system.

BrS is characterised by a coved ST-segment elevation in right precordial leads. The prevalence is estimated to range between 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 2,000 in different populations, with the highest being in Southeast Asia and in males. More than 18 genes associated with BrS have been discovered and recent evidence has suggested a complex polygenic mode of inheritance with multiple common and rare genetic variants acting in concert to produce the BrS phenotype. Diagnosis of BrS in patients currently relies on presentation with a type-1 Brugada pattern on ECG either spontaneously or following a drug provocation test using a sodium channel blocker. Risk assessment in patients diagnosed with BrS is controversial, especially with regard to the predictive value of programmed electrical stimulation and novel ECG parameters, such as QRS fragmentation. The first line of BrS therapy remains an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), although radiofrequency catheter ablation has been shown to be an effective option in patients with contraindications for an ICD. True BrS can be unmasked on ECG in susceptible individuals by monitoring factors such as fever, and this has been recently evident in several patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Aggressive antipyretic therapy and regular ECG monitoring until fever resolves are current recommendations to help reduce the arrhythmic risk in these COVID-19 patients. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics, clinical diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment of patients with BrS, with special emphasis on COVID-19 comorbidity.","Korlipara, Haarika; Korlipara, Giridhar; Pentyala, Srinivas",Acta cardiologica,481,1

OBJECTIVES The study aims were to: (a) examine the association between financial stress and the prevalence of common metabolic abnormalities; and (b) test the association for gender differences. METHODS A cross-sectional secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Retirement and Sleep Trajectories (REST) study, an ancillary study of the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) study. Composite indicator structural equation alpha modeling with a stacking approach was applied in the data analysis. RESULTS After controlling for covariates, financial stress was positively associated with the prevalence of abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia, with significant gender differences. Among men, financial stress was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia. Among women, financial stress was positively associated with the prevalence of prediabetes, abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia. CONCLUSION Men living with financial stress are more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia, a specific metabolic abnormality and risk factor for acute cardiovascular events. However, financial stress in women is associated with a broader array of metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, prediabetes, abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome), highlighting a potential risk of multiple chronic conditions later in life.","Kuo, Wan-Chin; Oakley, Linda D; Brown, Roger L; Hagen, Erika W; Barnet, Jodi H; Peppard, Paul E; Bratzke, Lisa C",Nursing research,481,7

METHODS Published articles in PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases from January 2000 to April 2016 were queried. Inclusion criteria were any study that reported the prevalence of urethral strictures following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), or both as a primary treatment for PCa. Forty-six articles met our inclusion criteria. A summary estimate of the proportion of patients who developed a urethral stricture was derived via a random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS In total, 16,129 PCa patients underwent either EBRT (5681, 35.2%), BT (5849, 36.3%), or both (4599, 28.5%). Overall, 630 strictures were diagnosed at follow-up with a pooled estimate period prevalence of 2.2% (95% confidence interval, CI 1.9-2.6%) in a median follow-up time of 4 years (interquartile range, IQR 2.7-5). Of which, the pooled estimate prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI 0.9-2%) post EBRT, 1.9% (95% CI 1.3-2.4%) post BT, and 4.9% (95% CI 3.8-6%) post both EBRT and BT. Of 20 studies reporting a median time to stricture formation, the overall median time was 2.2 years (IQR 1.8-2.5, range 1.4-9). In a meta-regression analysis, receiving both EBRT and BT increased the estimated difference in proportion of stricture diagnoses by 3% (95% CI 1-6%), p = 0.018 compared to EBRT alone. An increase in median follow-up time was found to significantly increase the risk of developing urethral strictures (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS With a short-term follow-up, urethral strictures occur in 2.2% of men with PCa receiving radiotherapy. Receiving both EBRT and BT increased the risk of stricture formation. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the long-term natural history of stricture formation after RT.","Awad, Mohannad A; Gaither, Thomas W; Osterberg, E Charles; Murphy, Gregory P; Baradaran, Nima; Breyer, Benjamin N",Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,481,27

Mammalian epithelial cells grown in vitro can be used to study the different steps of the intracellular life of Listeria. However, rapid multiplication and dissemination of bacteria can induce important cell death and detachment, resulting in the formation of lytic plaques. Thus, in vitro infections with L. monocytogenes are usually restricted to short time courses, from a few minutes to one day.

The genus of Aspergillus consist of various complexes, causing a wide spectrum of diseases from superficial infections in immunocompetent hosts to life-threatening disseminated infections among immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to identify Aspergillus species by phenotypic (total isolates) and molecular tests (35 isolates), obtained from patients in Isfahan (the third-largest city of Iran) between 2010 and 2018, and determine the susceptibility of 35 clinical isolates to itraconazole (ITR), amphotericin-B (AMB), and voriconazole (VOR). Patients and Methods Based on clinical signs, a total of 2385 suspected cases were included in this retrospective study from January 2010 to December 2018. Direct microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide, sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, and czapekdox agar media was applied to identify etiologic agents. Thirty-five Aspergillus species collected from January 2016 to December 2018 were identified by PCR-sequencing of ITS1-5.8SrDNA-ITS2 region, and their susceptibility to ITR, AMB, and VOR was determined using E-test. Results Based on direct microscopy and positive culture, 132 out of 2385 suspected cases had Aspergillus infection (5.5%). Fifty-four patients were male, and 78 patients were female. Patients in the age groups of 41-50 and 21-30 years had the highest and lowest frequencies, respectively. Aspergillus flavus/oryzae (n=54), A. fumigatus (n=24), A. niger (n=15), and A. terreus (n=12) were the most prevalent Aspergillus species, respectively. Among 35 Aspergillus species, the MIC ranges of AMB, ITR, and VOR for A. flavus/oryzae, A. niger, and A. terreus were (0.5-4 μg/mL; 0.5-16 μg/mL; 0.25-8 μg/mL), (1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL), and (4-4 μg/mL, 0.5-1 μg/mL, 0.5-1 μg/mL), respectively. Conclusion Aspergillus infections have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and often occur in immunocompromised patients. Accurate identification at the species level is essential since the emergence of cryptic species is connected to different patterns of AFST that affect patient treatment outcomes. Azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. is a global concern, and the detection of the route of resistance is pivotal to prevent and control infection.","Chadeganipour, Mostafa; Mohammadi, Rasoul",Infection and drug resistance,481,1

METHODS This is a prospective randomized double-blinded clinical trial enrolling 90 patients with severe POP from January 2016 to April 2017. Patients underwent LSH plus a ""two-meshes"" LSC and were randomized, regarding mesh fixation, in Group 1 (extracorporeal interrupted 3-0 delayed absorbable sutures) and Group 2 (running locked 3-0 delayed absorbable suture). Our primary endpoints were the operative times and the secondary endpoints the incidence of intra- or post-operative complications. RESULTS A total of 42 patients for group completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Overall mesh fixation time (24 vs. 39 min; p < 0.01), and operative time (121 vs. 138 min; p < 0.05) resulted significantly lower in Group 2. No differences were found in terms of anatomic failure, vaginal mesh erosion or intra- or post-operative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic continuous locked 3-0 absorbable suture for anterior and posterior mesh fixation during LSC guaranteed a faster and effective alternative to multiple interrupted sutures. The significant operative time reduction linked to this technique should be considered even more helpful when performing a highly complex surgery such as LSC.","Morciano, Andrea; Marzo, Giuseppe; Caliandro, Dario; Campagna, Giuseppe; Panico, Giovanni; Alcaino, Simona; Bisanti, Tatiana; Ercoli, Alfredo; Romualdi, Daniela; Scambia, Giovanni",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,481,17

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, includes both CBS and CGL enzymes.

Herein, we cloned and biochemically characterized cDNA encoding CBS from T. gondii (TgCBS), which represents a first example of protozoan CBS that does not bind heme but possesses two C-terminal CBS domains. We demonstrated that TgCBS can use both serine and O-acetylserine to produce cystathionine, converting these substrates to an aminoacrylate intermediate as part of a PLP-catalyzed β-replacement reaction. Besides a role in cysteine biosynthesis, TgCBS can also efficiently produce hydrogen sulfide, preferentially via condensation of cysteine and homocysteine. Unlike the human counterpart and similar to CBS enzymes from lower organisms, the TgCBS activity is not stimulated by S-adenosylmethionine.

METHODS A total of 63 laboratory confirmed patients treated in our hospital were selected as the COVID-19 group, including 28 severe patients and 35 non-severe patients. Another 50 healthy subjects undergoing physical examination simultaneously were selected as the healthy group. Here we performed a study on the laboratory characteristics and explored their efficacy for diagnosis of the disease. RESULTS Compared with healthy people, the abnormal indicators of patients with COVID-19 are low levels of lymphocytes (LYM), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT), total protein (TP), and albumin (ALB), and high levels of monocytes (MON), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The level of MON and CRP in severe patients were significantly increased compared with non-severe pneumonia patients, and indicators such as LYM and ALB were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of LYM, MON, RBC, HGB, PLT, TP, ALB, AST, GGT, and CRP was 97.7% and 91.7%, which was higher than the single item (p < 0.05).

AIM Considering the fact that the reported data in different articles for the type and prevalence of skin manifestations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are inconsistent, we have described the mechanism and type of skin lesions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In this review article, we have searched the Medline database (PubMed) for the combination of the following key terms ""Dermatological Manifestation"", ""cutaneous Manifestation"", ""Skin Manifestation"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"". RESULTS The prevalence of skin manifestations related to COVID-19 ranged from 0.2% to 20%. The majority of these skin lesions are maculopapular eruptions. The skin presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are described below. Traumatic skin conditions such as dermatitis in individuals, especially those with allergies, might initiate secondary to over-washing or rinsing with inappropriate detergents. Also, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (mask-gloves-shield) can trigger skin lesions on the face and hands or aggravate the lesions of acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, eczema, etc. Furthermore, cutaneous adverse drug reactions may occur during hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients. Also, psychocutaneous disorders due to acute stress can trigger or deteriorate several skin manifestations. Moreover, COVID-19 prevalence and course may be changed in patients with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory underlying skin disorders such as psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, scleroderma who are on immunosuppressive or biological medications to control their disorders.

Rehabilitation is increasingly recognised as contributing to dementia care. Rehabilitation subscribes to person-centredness, and thus, evaluations of person-centredness in rehabilitation for people living with dementia are relevant in order for healthcare professionals to know how best to practice person-centredness. Aim The aim of this study was to identify methods of evaluating person-centeredness in rehabilitation for people living with dementia. Materials and Methods Review of the literature using the search terms dementia, person-centredness, and rehabilitation or occupational therapy. Databases searched included: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, OTseeker, and SveMed+. The study included peer-reviewed articles from year 2000 to 2018 in Danish, English, Norwegian, or Swedish. Results Only one academic article met the inclusion criteria. In that article, person-centred practice was evaluated using observation and interview as well as analytical frameworks from person-centred care and occupational therapy. Conclusion Evaluations of person-centred practice in rehabilitation for people living with dementia in peer-reviewed literature are lacking. Evaluations are needed to identify effective strategies to pursue and uphold person-centred care. Given the dearth of research on evaluations of person-centredness in rehabilitation, this article included research in person-centred dementia care in the discussion, which potentially can inspire practice and research of rehabilitation for people living with dementia. To understand the complex nature of person-centredness, a variety of research methodologies of qualitative and quantitative characters are recommended for evaluations.","Allen Christensen, Kate; Lund, Karen-Margrethe; Thuesen, Jette",Journal of aging research,481,0

They decrease time to hemostasis as well as length of stay. Major complications such as arterial ischemia and occlusion can be encountered in a minority of patients. We are describing a series of 3 patients with access site closure using Angio-Seal after coronary angiography who developed intermittent claudication within 2-3 weeks of follow-up. Access site thrombosis/stenosis in the CFA was found in all the three cases. They were successfully revascularized using Jetstream atherectomy with embolic protection filter followed by balloon angioplasty. This technique can treat extensive thrombus burden as well as extract the collagen and foot plate of Angio-Seal through atherectomy with cutting blades and thrombectomy via rheolytic macerating aspiration port. All cases had excellent angiographic and clinical results.,"Barvalia, Mihir; Thawabi, Mohammad; Nawaz, Yassir; Sethi, Nishant; Shao, John; Amponsah, Michael; Visveswaran, Gautam; Cohen, Marc; Wasty, Najam",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,481,5

An outbreak investigation was conducted to identify the source and risk factors associated with the increase of gastroenteritis. METHODS A case was defined as any person in Kananga who developed acute diarrhoea (≥ 3 times/24 hours) and any of the following symptoms: fever, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain from 11 November 2013 to 10 December 2013. Active case finding was conducted by reviewing medical records, and a case-control study was conducted. Rectal swabs and water samples were tested for bacteriological examination. RESULTS One hundred and five cases were identified. Multivariate analysis revealed that consumption of untreated drinking-water was associated with illness (adjusted odds ratio: 18.2). Both rectal swabs and municipal water samples tested positive for Aeromonas hydrophila. On inspection of the municipal water system, breaks in the distribution pipes were found with some submerged in river water. CONCLUSION This acute gastroenteritis outbreak was most likely caused by Aeromonas hydrophila and transmitted through a contaminated water source. This study highlights that areas less damaged by a disaster that do not require ongoing evacuation centres can still have acute gastroenteritis outbreaks. All affected areas should be monitored during a disaster response, not just those with evacuation centres. Boiling or chlorinating of water should also be recommended for all areas affected by disaster.","Ventura, Ray Justin; Muhi, Edzel; de los Reyes, Vikki Carr; Sucaldito, Ma Nemia; Tayag, Enrique",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,481,4

Galectins can function intracellularly and can also be secreted to bind to cell surface glycoconjugate counterreceptors. Some galectins are made by immune cells, whereas other galectins are secreted by different cell types, such as endothelial or epithelial cells, and bind to immune cells to regulate immune responses. Galectin binding to a single glycan ligand is a low-affinity interaction, but the multivalency of galectins and the glycan ligands presented on cell surface glycoproteins results in high-avidity binding that can reversibly scaffold or cluster these glycoproteins. Galectin binding to a specific glycoprotein counterreceptor is regulated in part by the repertoire of glycosyltransferase enzymes (which make the glycan ligands) expressed by that cell, and the effect of galectin binding results from clustering or retention of specific glycoprotein counterreceptors bearing these specific ligands.","Thiemann, Sandra; Baum, Linda G",Annual review of immunology,481,5

Since December 2019, COVID-19 （corona virus disease 2019） outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 （severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2） has occurred in China and many countries around the world. Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be quickly screened. The antimalarial drug Chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The dosage used according to current clinical recommended dosage and course of treatment are larger than that of previous treatment of malaria. Many provinces have required close clinical monitoring of adverse reactions. This paper reviews the pharmacological effects, poisoning and toxicological mechanisms, in vivo metabolism and distribution, and forensic issues of chloroquine drugs, in order to provide help to forensic practice and clinical work.","Duan, Y J; Liu, Q; Zhao, S Q; Huang, F; Ren, L; Liu, L; Zhou, Y W",Fa yi xue za zhi,481,16

In India, where community-based mental healthcare is led by non-government organizations (NGOs), this is a crucial time to gather evidence on how these organizations adapted to the challenges. METHODS We explored provider perspectives in an NGO providing mental health services to communities using in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion to understand the impact on services and adaptations during the COVID 19 pandemic. RESULTS Three elements of service provision were highlighted: established relationships with communities, responsiveness to the patient needs, and resilience in ensuring continuity. Responding to the end-to-end care needs of the clients and continual adaptations were vital for ensuring continued services. Telemedicine enabled expansion of service and clientele as well as efficiency, but there were issues of casualization of therapy and poor privacy. CONCLUSIONS The study provides an understanding of adaptations to ensure continuity of care to mentally ill during disruptions. Insights from strategies are crucial to help plan for resilient community-based mental health care services.","Nair, Sapna; Kannan, Preethi; Mehta, Kaustav; Raju, Ananya; Mathew, John; Ramachandran, Padmavati",Journal of public health,481,24

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has posed a public health emergency of international concern. Psychological well-being of front-line nurses is a big concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS With a predictive study design, a same survey was sent separately at two time points (i.e. before and after nurses worked at COVID-19 units) between January and March 2020 among 356 front-line nurses in First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui, China. RESULTS Of a total 356 front-line nurses, stress level and the prevalence of PTSD were significantly increased after they worked at COVID-19 units. Nurses who had work experience less than 2 years was significantly associated with a high risk of developing PTSD. Nurses who worked in COVID-19 inpatients wards had significantly higher odds of being PTSD (Odds Ratio [OR]=21.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 5.08; 94.5) than those who worked in other COVID-19 related units. Resilience was negatively associated with PTSD (OR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.93; 0.99). CONCLUSION Nurses had significantly increased risk to develop PTSD during COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS We collected medical reports, lifestyle details, and blood samples of individuals and used the polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction method to genotype the SNPs, and a visit was conducted in August 2016 to obtain the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the 2113 eligible people. To explore which genes and environmental factors are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Chinese Han population, we used elastic net to build a model, which is to explain which variables are strongly associated with T2DM, rather than predict the occurrence of T2DM. RESULT The genotype of the additive of rs964184, together with the history of hypertension, regular intake of meat and waist circumference, increased the risk of T2DM (adjusted OR = 2.38, p = 0.042; adjusted OR = 3.31, p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.05, p < 0.001). The TT genotype of the additive and recessive models of rs12654264, the CC genotype of the additive and dominant models of rs2065412, the TT genotype of the additive and dominant models of rs4149336, together with the degree of education, regular exercise, reduced the risk of T2DM (adjusted OR = 0.46, p = 0.017; adjusted OR = 0.53, p = 0.021; adjusted OR = 0.59, p = 0.021; adjusted OR = 0.57, p = 0.01; adjusted OR = 0.59, p = 0.021; adjusted OR = 0.57, p = 0.01; adjusted OR = 0.50, p = 0.007; adjusted OR = 0.80, p = 0.032) .

As pathogens are transmitted from infected hosts via a number of routes (e.g., aerosolization, sneezing, and coughing), there is a great demand to accurately monitor their presence and behavior. Despite such need, conventional detection methods (e.g., colony counting, immunoassays, and various molecular techniques) generally suffer from a number of demerits (e.g., complex, time-consuming, and labor-intensive nature). To help overcome such limitations, nanomaterial-based biosensors have evolved as alternative candidates to realize portable, rapid, facile, and direct on-site identification of target microbes. In this review, nano-biosensors developed for the detection of airborne pathogens are listed and discussed in reference to conventional options. The prospects for the development of advanced nano-biosensors with enhanced accuracy and portability are also discussed.","Bhardwaj, Sanjeev K; Bhardwaj, Neha; Kumar, Vanish; Bhatt, Deepanshu; Azzouz, Abdelmonaim; Bhaumik, Jayeeta; Kim, Ki-Hyun; Deep, Akash",Environment international,481,24

The pathophysiology of tissue necrosis involves lymphatic congestion, followed by venous congestion and ultimately arterial insufficiency. Topical tacrolimus has been shown to increase growth of lymphatic collateral vessels and decrease lymphedema, potentially obviating one contributor to necrosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vascular and histological differences between these 2 groups to identify the etiology of our research findings. METHODS A 3 × 10-cm cranially based dorsal skin flap was raised and reinset on 22 Sprague Dawley rats. They were randomized to receive 0.2 g of either topical petroleum jelly or topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment daily to the flaps. The rats were killed 7 days postoperatively. Two blinded reviewers marked the total flap area as well as areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrotic tissue. Full-thickness biopsies of each area were taken from 2 randomly chosen animals in each group. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned to generate hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Representative images of each area of the flap were taken less than 40× magnification using light microscopy. Arteries, veins, and lymphatics in the dermal layer were quantified under blinded conditions by a trained pathologist and calculated per cross-sectional area using Fiji software. RESULTS The average area of the dorsal flaps in the control and tacrolimus groups was 22.5 and 23.9 cm2, respectively. Total necrotic area was significantly lower in rats receiving topical tacrolimus as compared with controls (P = 0.015). In the control cohort, average total number of vessels was 12.5, 6, and 0, in the areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrosis, respectively. In the tacrolimus cohort, average total number of vessels increased was 20, 11.5, and 5.4, in the areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrosis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS On a histological level, topical tacrolimus is correlated with increased vascular growth in areas most susceptible for ischemic damage as compared with topical control. Future work is needed to investigate vascular biomarkers and increase the power of our study.","Wald, Gal; Van, Y-Vu; Towne, William; Otterburn, David M",Annals of plastic surgery,481,16

Government officials in the United States subsequently responded by issuing lockdown orders that closed schools, terminated sports, and resulted in many people transitioning to working from home, immediately affecting the ability of athletic trainers (ATs) to practice clinically. OBJECTIVE To describe the job status, job duties, telemedicine use, and resiliency of ATs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Mixed-methods survey. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS A total of 611 ATs (age = 32 ± 13 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The survey consisted of 6 demographic questions, a job status assessment (3 questions, 1 open-ended prompt), a telemedicine use assessment (5 questions, 2 open-ended prompts), and the 6-item Brief Resilience Scale. Qualitative analyses were completed using Text iQ technology and descriptive statistics, and cross-tabulations were conducted using follow-up χ2 comparisons of resiliency with job setting and telemedicine use. RESULTS Most ATs continued to work in some capacity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed optimism about the likelihood that their job status and setting would return. However, participants shared financial and mental health concerns because of reduced pay, stress, and uncertainty about the future. We also identified versatility within the profession, as ATs were serving in new roles related to COVID-19 or adopting telemedicine (n = 251, 41.1%). Athletic trainers were implementing all domains of clinical practice using telemedicine, yet most did not consult legal counsel on or have formal training in the delivery method before implementation. Finally, most ATs exhibited normal resilience that was not affected by job setting (χ2 = 26.901, P = .68) or the use of virtual health care (χ2 = 2.597, P = .27). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has affected ATs' jobs, and in many cases, the ATs have demonstrated adaptability and value in assuming various roles in the larger health care system.","Winkelmann, Zachary K; Games, Kenneth E",Journal of athletic training,481,0

Anecdotal reports suggest as much as 18 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP) being inadvertently applied under these circumstances, accompanied by inaccurate pressure readings by the anesthesia machine. We hypothesized that resistance within closed anesthetic gas scavenging systems(AGSS) disconnected from WAGS may inadvertently increase circuit pressures. METHODS An anesthesia machine was connected to an anesthesia breathing circuit, a reference manometer, and a standard bag reservoir to simulate a lung. Ventilation was initiated as follows: Volume Control, TV 500 mL, respiratory rate 12, I:E 1:1.9, FiO2 1.0, fresh gas flow(FGF) rate 2.0 liters per minute(LPM), and PEEP 0 cmH2O. After engaging the ventilator, PEEP and peak inspiratory pressure(PIP) were measured by the reference manometer and the anesthesia machine display simultaneously. The process was repeated using prescribed PEEP levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O. Measurements were repeated with the WAGS disconnected and then were performed again at FGF of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 LPM. This process was completed on three anesthesia machines: Dräger Perseus A500, Dräger Apollo, and the GE Avance CS2. Simple linear regression was used to assess differences. RESULTS Utilizing non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis, the reference and machine manometer measurements of PIP demonstrated median differences of -0.40 cmH2O (95%LOA: -1.00,0.55) for the Dräger Apollo, -0.40 cmH2O (95%LOA: -1.10, 0.41) for the Dräger Perseus, and 1.70 cmH2O (95%LOA: 0.80,3.00) for the GE Avance CS2. At FGF 2 LPM and PEEP 0 cmH2O with the WAGS disconnected, the Dräger Apollo had a difference in PEEP of 0.02 cmH2O (95%CI: -0.04,0.08; p=0.53); the Dräger Perseus A500, <0.0001 cmH2O (95%CI: -0.11 0.11; p=1.00); and the GE Avance CS2, 8.62 cmH2O (95%CI: 8.55,8.69; p<0.0001). After removing the hose connected to the AGSS and the visual indicator bag on the GE Avance CS2, the PEEP difference was 0.12 cmH2O (95%CI: 0.059,0.181; p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS Displayed airway pressure measurements are clinically accurate in the setting of disconnected WAGS. The Dräger Perseus A500 and Apollo with open scavenging systems do not deliver inadvertent CPAP with WAGS disconnected, but the GE Avance CS2 with a closed AGSS does. This increase in airway pressure can be mitigated by the manufacturer's recommended alterations. Anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential clinically important increases in pressure that may be inadvertently delivered on some anesthesia machines, should the WAGS not be properly connected.","Pham, Vinh; Nguyen, Le; Hedin, Riley J; Shaver, Courtney; Hammonds, Kendall A P; Culp, William C",Anesthesia and analgesia,481,28

The present RCT aims to show that SCS during RPD does not increase the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) when compared with modified Blumgart anastomosis (MBA). PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2019 and September 2019, consecutive patients (ASA score ≤ 2) who underwent RPD were enrolled and randomized to the SCS or the MBA group. The primary endpoint was the rate of CR-POPF. A noninferiority margin of 10% was chosen. RESULTS Of the 186 patients, 4 were excluded because PJ was not performed. The remaining 182 patients were randomized to the SCS group (n = 89) or MBA group (n = 93). CR-POPF rate was not inferior in the SCS group [SCS: 6.7%, MBA: 11.8%; 95% confidence interval (- 0.76, - 0.06), P = 0.0002]. PJ duration was significantly lower in the SCS group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between the two groups in operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, or rates of conversion to laparotomy, morbidity, reoperation, or mortality. On subgroup analysis of patients with a soft pancreas and small main pancreatic duct, SCS significantly reduced the duration of PJ. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that SCS was not inferior to MBA in terms of the CR-POPF rate during RPD.

METHODS We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. RESULTS The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation. CONCLUSIONS These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.","Sheng, Xiaoyan; Liu, Fenyu; Zhou, Jin; Liao, Rongrong",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,481,29

The contribution of this paper is to present new models for detecting COVID-19 and other cases of pneumonia using chest X-ray images and convolutional neural networks, thus providing accurate diagnostics in binary and 4-classes classification scenarios. Classification accuracy was improved, and overfitting was prevented by following 2 actions: (1) increasing the data set size while the classification scenarios were balanced;and (2) adding regularization techniques and performing hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, the network capacity and size in the models were reduced as much as possible, making the final models a perfect option to be deployed locally on devices with limited capacities and without the need for Internet access. The impact of key hyperparameters was tested using modern deep learning packages. The final models obtained a classification accuracy of 99,17 and 94,03% for the binary and categorical scenarios, respectively, achieving superior performance compared to other studies in the literature, and requiring a significantly lower number of parameters.

However, the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing depends crucially on widespread app installation and usage among citizens. Despite the large social benefits, evidence on the effectiveness of incentives to stimulate adoption of contact-tracing apps is scarce. Whereas monetary compensations for app installation or usage provide users with a direct economic benefit, research in related health domains has found that extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivation and pro-social behaviour. Thus, we conduct a randomised controlled online experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of different incentive mechanisms in promoting the installation and usage of the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA). We find that monetary incentives are effective in significantly increasing verified app installations and app usage 14 days after installation, up to three times the usage without compensation. Deferred monetary compensation for verified usage yields lower installation rates than immediate monetary compensation for installation, but sustains the highest retention rate among adopters. Non-monetary compensation in the form of optional charity donations is found to be ineffective in promoting installations or usage beyond outcomes of monetary incentives, suggesting that there is no substantial crowding-out of intrinsic motives. This suggests that monetary incentives can serve as an important policy instrument to encourage the adoption of contact-tracing apps and contain the spread of COVID-19. © 2021 ACM.","Fast, V.; Schnurr, D.","58th Computers and People Research Conference, SIGMIS-CPR 2021",481,1

Beginning with this question, we have designed a new course for second-year engineering students. Drawing on the interdisciplinary backgrounds of our diverse team of engineering instructors, we aimed to provide an introduction to energy for all engineering students that challenged the dominant discourse in engineering by valuing students’ lived experiences and bringing in examples situated in different cultural contexts. An Integrated Approach to Energy was offered for the first time in Spring 2020 for 18 students. In this paper, we describe the design of the course including learning objectives, content, and pedagogical approach. We assessed students’ learning using exams and the impact of the overall course using interviews. Students demonstrated achievement of the learning objectives in technical areas. In addition, interviews revealed that they learned about environmental, economic, and social aspects of engineering practice. We intend for this course to serve as a model of engineering as a sociotechnical endeavor by challenging students with scenarios that are technically demanding and require critical thinking about contextual implications.","Hoople, Gordon D.; Chen, Diana A.; Lord, Susan M.; Gelles, Laura A.; Bilow, Felicity Mejia Joel Alejandro",Sustainability,481,1

The assay has two components: fluorescent polystyrene particles covalently coated with RBD, termed virion-particles (v-particles), and fluorescently-labeled hACE2 (hACE2F) that binds the v-particles. When incubated with an inhibitor, v-particle - hACE2F binding is diminished, resulting in a reduction in the fluorescent signal of bound hACE2F relative to the non-inhibitor control, which can be measured via flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. We determine the amount of RBD needed for v-particle preparation, v-particle incubation time with hACE2F, hACE2F detection limit, and specificity of v-particle binding to hACE2F. We measure the dose response of the v-particles to a known inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that RNA-hACE2F granules trap v-particles effectively, providing a basis for potential RNA-hACE2F therapeutics.","Kikuchi, Nanami; Willinger, Or; Granik, Naor; Navon, Noa; Ackerman, Shanny; Samuel, Ella; Antman, Tomer; Katz, Noa; Goldberg, Sarah; Amit, Roee",bioRxiv,481,1

Leisure and business activities on beaches and in ports have restricted direct and indirect contamination from, for example, plastics, hydrocarbon spillage, microbiological loads, and noise levels. This has led to temporarily improved environmental conditions, and the beaches having conditions closer to Marine Protected Areas. Here we report some impacts that have been studied using local surveys and qualitative observations in Ecuador at the popular beaches and ports of Salinas, Manta, and Galapagos. Satellite data support this information. Online surveys were carried out at critical moments of the pandemic: May (15th) and just after when measures were relaxed a little, but within lockdown in July (21st) 2020. Respondents were asked to compare conditions before and during the pandemic lockdown. Most (97-99 %) suggested that beaches had significantly improved from visual observations during confinement. On a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), the beaches of Salinas and Manta respectively were rated 2.2 and 2.8 (less than acceptable) before quarantine, and 4.5 and 4.3 after;results from the second survey (after 18 weeks of restrictions) were much the same. Replies from Galapagos showed a similar trend but with less marked differences. In addition to the beaches having less plastic and garbage, more fish, and large marine organisms, including humpback whales, bottlenose dolphins, and manta-ray were observed near to shore. At Galapagos beaches, turtles, sea lions, and sharks were observed many more times than pre COVID. Quantitative satellite data on Chlorophyll and attenuation coefficient (Kd, 490 nm) support the qualitative survey data that there is an improvement in coastal environment quality. Here we recommend that this unique opportunity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is used locally, regionally, and globally to construct baseline data sets that include information on physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological factors in coastal zones. These parameters are based on beach and water standards, noise, human dimension cultural heritage, and economic value indices.

As per Attention Restoration Theory (ART), participation in outdoor activities is known to reduce depression and provide restorative benefits. However, many older adults, who suffer from depression, especially those who receive care in organizational settings, have less access to sensory experiences of the outdoor natural environment. This is often due to their physical or cognitive limitations and from lack of organizational resources to support outdoor activities. To address this, we plan to study how technology can bring the restorative benefits of outdoors to the indoor environments through augmented spatial natural soundscapes. Thus, we propose an interview and observation-based study at an assisted living facility to evaluate how augmented soundscapes substitute for outdoor restorative, social, and experiential benefits. We aim to integrate these findings into a minimally intrusive and intuitive design of an interactive augmented soundscape, for indoor organizational care settings.","Joshi, Swapna; Stavrianakis, Kostas; Das, Sanchari",,481,16

Anyhow, only few data is available for German ORLs. Methods The German Society of ORL, Head and Neck Surgery and the German ENT Association addressed German ORLs to participate in a web-based survey about infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data of infections and concomitant parameters in German ORLs were compared to the total number of infections in Germany. An initial survey was launched May 2020 and a monthly follow-up survey was active until January 2021. Results 970 out of 6383 German ORLs (15%) participated in the initial survey and the June follow-up. Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 until June 2020 was reported by 54 ORLs. The relative risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 for ORLs is calculated as an OR of 3.67 (95% CI 2.82;4.79) compared to the total population of Germany. As treatment, 2 individuals were admitted to hospital without intensive care and domestic quarantine was conducted in 96.3% of cases. No casualties were reported. In 31 cases the source of infection was not identifiable whereas 23 had a clear etiology: infected patients: n = 5, 9.26% ;medical staff: n = 13, 24.1% . 9.26% (n = 5) of the identified cases were related to contact to infected family members (n = 3), closer neighborhood (n = 1) or general public (n = 1).

Evidence review We searched the L.OVE platform through July 6, 2021 and included randomized trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard or other active treatments. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analysis, assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach and performed sensitivity analysis excluding trials with risk of bias. Results We included 29 RCTs which enrolled 5592 cases. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low. Compared to standard of care, ivermectin may reduce mortality, may increase symptom resolution or improvement, may increase viral clearance, may reduce infections in exposed individuals and may decrease hospitalizations (Risk difference (RD) 21 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 35 fewer to 4 more). However, after excluding trials classified as ''high risk'' or ''some concerns'' in the risk of bias assessment, most estimates of effect changed substantially: Compared to standard of care, low certainty evidence suggests that ivermectin may not significantly reduce mortality (RD 7 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 77 fewer to 108 more) nor mechanical ventilation (RD 6 more per 1000, 95%CI: 43 fewer to 86 more), and moderate certainty evidence shows that it probably does not significantly increase symptom resolution or improvement (RD 14 more per 1000, 95%CI: 29 fewer to 71 more) nor viral clearance (RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 84 fewer to 76 more). It is uncertain if ivermectin increases or decreases severe adverse events and symptomatic infections in exposed individuals. Conclusions and Relevance Ivermectin may not improve clinically important outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and its effects as a prophylactic intervention in exposed individuals are uncertain. Previous reports concluding significant benefits associated with ivermectin are based on potentially biased results reported by studies with substantial methodological limitations.

An outbreak of diphtheria declared in Yemen in October 2017 is still ongoing. Methods. Probable cases were recorded through an electronic diseases early warning system. Microbiological culture, genomic sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility and toxin production testing were performed. Findings. The Yemen diphtheria outbreak developed in three epidemic waves, which affected nearly all governorates (provinces) of Yemen, with 5701 probable cases and 330 deaths (October 2017 - April 2020). The median age of patients was 12 years (range, 0.17-80). Virtually all outbreak isolates (40 of 43 tested ones) produced the diphtheria toxin. We observed low level of antimicrobial resistance to penicillin. We identified six separate Corynebacterium diphtheriae phylogenetic sublineages, three of which are genetically related to isolates from Saudi Arabia and Somalia. The predominant sublineage was resistant to trimethoprim and was associated with unique genomic features, more frequent neck swelling (p=0.002) and a younger age of patients (p=0.06). Its evolutionary rate was estimated at 1.67 x 10E-6 substitutions per site per year, placing its most recent common ancestor in 2015, and indicating silent circulation of C. diphtheriae in Yemen earlier than outbreak declaration. Interpretation. We disclose clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of one of the largest contemporary diphtheria outbreaks and demonstrate clinically relevant heterogeneity of C. diphtheriae isolates, underlining the need for laboratory capacity and real-time microbiological analyses to inform prevention, treatment and control of diphtheria.

In this case, remote access auxiliary support services may be raised in order to carry out medical care monitoring of patients. Although tele-medicial/tele-health applications are not a substitute for a face-to-face meeting between physician and patient in terms of medical service delivery, interest in these applications is increasing day by day to protect vulnerable patient groups from the risk of transmission and to ensure the continuity of care services. In this review, the discussion of the changing care needs of patients in need of palliative care and home care during the pandemic process and the use of new tools to meet health demands in a way that includes less risk will be reviewed. © 2021 Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University.

It is based on an analysis of the main technological solutions applied in the field of CSCL, distinguishing between the collaborative use of technology and collaborative technology. The research entails an ex post facto non-experimental quantitative study based on the survey method conducted with 1 06 students of five subjects belonging to the degrees of Primary and Infant Education at Campus La Salle Madrid. Students developed project-based learning with a CSCL-based methodology;analysis are presented according to the age of the students and the years of experience working in virtual environments. Students value that the most useful technologies in CSCL are videoconferencing and instant messaging, such as WhatsApp, compared to other tools such as Wikis, Blogs or Social Networks. Aside from the situation derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing and instant messaging systems do not tend to be integrated into virtual platforms or incorporated into CSCL. However, students positively value their usefulness in collaborative processes. In this sense, higher education institutions should promote extensive reflection on the tools that favor interaction processes and collaborative learning, taking advantage of the great effort that has been made during the pandemic situation, which has largely been sustained by digital ecosystems.Alternate abstract:Cette contribution découle d'un projet de recherche dans lequel est analysée une proposition pédagogique et technologique pour la conception de processus d'apprentissage CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning).

However, since individuals with cancer were under-represented during clinical vaccine trials, experience with COVID-19 vaccines among cancer patients is limited. Methods: An internet-based survey was conducted January 15 -February 10, 2021 among members of the Inspire online health community. The 63-item survey was emailed to members of the Inspire community who had opted-in for research. Results: Out of 19,152 respondents, 4895 (25%) self-reported a cancer diagnosis. Of these, 1337 (27%) were receiving active therapy. Cancer respondents were 66% female, 77% white, 44% college educated, with a median age range 55-65 years. 88% had solid tumors and 12% hematologic malignancies. 241 (5%) had prior COVID-19 and 148 (3%) thought they had had it but were not tested. Among cancer patients with COVID-19 approximately 30% reported ongoing late symptoms. At the time of survey, 1335 (27%) cancer patients had received a COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna 51% Pfizer-BioNTech 46%, Astra-Zeneca 3%, Other/unknown &gt;1%). Following the first injection, 63% had local adverse events (AEs): injection site pain (51%), swelling (8%), redness (6%), and itching (4%). 34% reported systemic AEs including myalgia (32%), fatigue (18%), headache (12%), joint pain (5%), and chills (5%). 199 (15%) had received the second (booster) vaccination. 76% reported local AEs including pain (69%), swelling (14%), itching (8%), and redness (7%). 67% reported systemic AEs including fatigue (49%), myalgia (30%), headache (29%), chills (23%), fever (16%), joint pain (15%), and nausea (12%). AEs were comparable to the clinical trial results obtained from the general population (fda.gov/media/144245/download &144434/download). Conclusions: In this internet-based survey drawn from the Inspire online health community 1335 cancer patients reported receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. Byself-report the vaccines were well tolerated with AEs patterns mimicking clinical trial results conducted in the general population. These safety results should be reassuring to cancer patients although attention to COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is required (and will be studied during follow-up surveys).","Loew, B.; Tsai, R.; Hervey, J.; Hoffman, K.

Initial manifestations include fever, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms, which may progress to respiratory disease. There may also be neurological and psychiatric manifestations, involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. Methods We performed a literature search of the databases PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science for observational studies reporting neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19. This was followed by a narrative synthesis to summarise the data and discuss neuropsychiatric associations, symptom severity, management, and recovery. Findings The most frequently reported neurological symptoms were ageusia, hyposmia/anosmia, dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness. Statistically significant relationships were noted between Asian ethnicity and peripheral neuropathy (p=0.0001) and neuro-syndromic symptoms (p=0.001). ITU admission was found to have a statistically significant relationship with male sex (p=0.024). Depression and anxiety were also identified both during and after infection. The most frequent treatments used were intravenous immunoglobulins, followed by antibiotics, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine; with mean treatment duration of 6 days.

Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of 1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, 2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, 3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and 4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.","Stryhn, Anette; Kongsgaard, Michael; Rasmussen, Michael; Harndahl, Mikkel Nors; Østerbye, Thomas; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Thybo, Søren; Gabriel, Mette; Hansen, Morten Bagge; Nielsen, Morten; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Thomsen, Allan Randrup; Buus, Soren",bioRxiv,481,1

It particularly focuses on students’ feedback, detecting advantages, disadvantages, and recommendations when teaching in this manner. The main research objective was to (1) discover how students assess their learning in online distance courses, (2) consider the collected experience and opinions, and (3) reflect them into recommendations for further teacher and learner training in how to exploit online distance instruction efficiently. First, the process of online distance instruction in the Czech Republic was described and requirements were set which should be applied when designing and conducting online distance courses. Then, feedback from 272 respondents, students of upper secondary and higher education institutions, was collected. Students reflected on 64 courses which received positive or negative assessment. Advantages, disadvantages, and recommendations detected in both groups of courses were thought. Respondents’ experience and opinions were monitored via a questionnaire consisting of eight open-answer items. Finally, the process of online distance learning was considered from the view of the collected data. Results proved that, as expected, even deeper teacher training is required. Main problems were detected in (1) the low level of teacher competency in this field in general, (2) time management, and (3) lack of technical support to learners. However, the fact that the necessity of learners’ competency in online distance learning must be also developed was mentioned by a few respondents. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Simonova, I.; Faltynkova, L.; Kostolanyova, K.","14th International Conference on Blended Learning, ICBL 2021",481,20

This metropolitan area is one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world with more than 22 million people. It lies on the Atlantic Rainforest Biome, a tropical moist broadleaf forest regarded as a world hotspot of biodiversity. First, a diagnostic of the current conditions was elaborated using available layers of geospatial data from the MASP. Then the future tree cover was discussed according to three scenarios: i) the non-adopters that represent the business as usual;ii) the late-adopters that develop innovative actions from 2035;and iii) early-adopters that undertake innovative interventions of urban greening from 2020. The vegetation cover was estimated to be reduced by 4% considering the current non-adopter scenario by 2050. On the other hand, vegetation cover has the potential to increase 30% in 2050, once there is an early adoption of innovative interventions, promoting various ecosystem services and co-benefits that support the quality of life and the biodiversity in the MASP, while fostering the carbon credit in the city through vegetation carbon sink.

Increasing infection rates has led authorities in several countries to initiate booster campaigns for vulnerable populations, including the elderly. However, the durability of vaccine-induced immunity in the elderly is currently unknown. Here, we describe interim results of a prospective cohort study comparing immune responses in a cohort of vaccinated elderly persons to those in healthcare workers (HCW), measured six months after first immunisation with BNT162b2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-, full Spike- and RBD -IgG seropositivity rates and IgG levels at six months were significantly lower in the elderly compared to HCW. Serum neutralization of Delta VOC measured by pseudovirus neutralisation test was detectable in 43/71 (60.6%, 95%CI: 48.9-71.1) in the elderly cohort compared to 79/83 in the HCW cohort (95.2%, 95%CI: 88.3-98.1) at six months post vaccination. Consistent with the overall lower antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-S1 T cell reactivity was reduced in the elderly compared to HCW (261.6 mIU/ml, IQR:141.5-828.6 vs 1198.0 mIU/ml, IQR: 593.9-2533.6, p<0.0001). Collectively, these findings suggest that the established two-dose vaccination regimen elicits less durable immune responses in the elderly compared to young adults. Given the recent surge in hospitalisations, even in countries with high vaccination rates such as Israel, the current data may support booster vaccinations of the elderly. Further studies to determine long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in high-risk populations and the safety and effectiveness of additional boosters are needed.","Tober-Lau, P.; Schwarz, T.; Vanshylla, K.; Hillus, D.; Gruell, H.; EICOVCOVIM Study Group,; Suttorp, N.; Landgraf, I.; Kappert, K.; Seybold, J.; Drosten, C.; Klein, F.; Kurth, F.; Corman, V.

Although various annotation volumes (AVs) for the mouse brain have been proposed, it is common in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mouse brain that regions-of-interest (ROIs) for brain structures (nodes) are created arbitrarily according to each researcher’s necessity, leading to inconsistent ROIs among studies. One reason for such a situation is the fact that earlier AVs were fixed, i.e. combination and division of nodes were not implemented. This report presents a pipeline for constructing a flexible annotation atlas (FAA) of the mouse brain by leveraging public resources of the Allen Institute for Brain Science on brain structure, gene expression, and axonal projection. A mere two-step procedure with user-specified, text-based information and Python codes constructs FAA with nodes which can be combined or divided objectively while maintaining anatomical hierarchy of brain structures. Four FAAs with total node count of 4, 101, 866, and 1,381 were demonstrated. Unique characteristics of FAA realized analysis of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) across the anatomical hierarchy and among cortical layers, which were thin but large brain structures. FAA can improve the consistency of whole brain ROI definition among laboratories by fulfilling various requests from researchers with its flexibility and reproducibility.

In light of this situation, the most important advancement since COVID-19′s emergence has been the development of multiple, life-saving, vaccines. Academic research on vaccine has been extensive. It is estimated that in only one year it has been produced more published and indexed papers on this single issue than in the last twenty years on any other single issue, thus, necessitating some organization. This research consists of a systematic literature review of the social science publication on COVID-19 published in the first year of the pandemic (February 2020 to March 2021). This review is important because it occurs at a time when vaccines have begun their global distribution and the best efforts to address the pandemic is through vaccination programs. In this research, 53 papers published in relevant journals are analyzed out of the almost 30,000 articles retrieved from Scopus database. The analysis conducted relies on two different types: descriptive analysis (evolution at the time of citations;evolution over time of keywords;bibliographical mapping of countries, the top 10 most influential papers), and bibliometric analysis for content evaluation. A cluster analysis was performed for the latter. Clustering the research papers, based on the actual content of papers, found there to be five research areas: (1) economic aspects;(2) ethics and legal aspects;(3) health communication;(4) policies and crisis management, and (5) political issues.

The studies aimed at finding predictors of the severe course of this novel coronavirus infection, as well as the factors that determine the efficacy and safety of this disease pharmacotherapy, are acquiring special social significance. The aim of this work is to find and summarize information on genetic predictors of severe COVID-19, as well as pharmacogenetic aspects that determine the variability of the therapeutic response to the drugs recommended for COVID-19 treatment. Materials and methods. The article provides a review of scientific results on the research of gene polymorphism that determine a body's response to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the effects of pharmacotherapy for this disease, obtained from open and available sources within the period of 2019 - March 2021. The search was conducted in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov;Elibrary, Scopus. The main search inquiries were: ""predictors + severe course + COVID-19"", ""genetic variations + COVID-19"", ""pharmacogenetics + COVID-19"", ""gene polymorphism + SARS-CoV-2"", ""pharmacotherapy + gene polymorphism + COVID-19"" in both Russian and English. Results and conclusion. The exploratory research detailing the mechanisms of infecting with SARS-CoV-2, the variability of the disease severity and the individual characteristics of therapeutic responses to the drugs used, are being actively carried out by scientists all over the world. However, most of their scientific projects are diverse, and the possible predictors of a severe course of COVID-19 found in them, have not been confirmed or investigated in subsequent studies. A generalization of the individual studies results of the genetic predictors concerning COVID-19 severity and effectiveness of its pharmacotherapy, can become the basis for further search and increase the reliability of the data obtained in order to develop a strategy for preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection, to identify potential targets of the treatment, and develop the protocols for optimizing this disease pharmacotherapy.","Shishimorov, I.

In this critical scenario, Italy has emerged as a relevant case because of its transformation from a leading pro-integration country to a country where EU integration is an increasingly divisive issue. We explore the relationship between Italian public opinion and the EU, with a specific interest in understanding how the coronavirus crisis may affect such a relationship, supposing that our case study may also be revealing as to how a crisis context can produce effects on the popular legitimacy of the EU. We show that in Italy there is demand from some majoritarian segments of society for stronger cooperation in the EU. To explain the apparent paradox of why Italians decreasingly feel that their country benefits from the EU but still want to increase EU cooperation in certain areas, we turn to the argument of the public's instrumental approach to the principle of burden-sharing: citizens support deeper integration to face the costs of the most pressing crises affecting the country and the EU at large.","Basile, L.; Cilento, M.; Conti, N.",Partecipazione E Conflitto,481,1

Numerous initiatives are striving to create both digital vaccination records and new digital identities for people with little or no official documentation;i.e. 'low doc' persons. Yet there is no globally agreed model for identity, nor any standardized way to establish identity. Nevertheless, field workers today are able by and large to establish the bona fides of Yellow Card holders with adequate certainty for the paper-based system to function most of the time. This paper contends that vaccinations should be digitized without introducing new identity systems, since a lack of formal identification is obviously not preventing Yellow Cards today. This paper describes a new digital Yellow Card, deployable on most regular mobile phones, in which public key certificates represent vaccinations and other credentials, vouched for by officials or field workers. The design has practical benefits for the digital engagement and privacy of low doc persons. It also shows how traditionally hierarchical public key infrastructure can be deployed without dictating identification protocols to communities, thus avoiding some of the controversies that plague this technology. The PKI security function can remain centralized while certificate issuance is decentralized, which leaves community organizations free to carry on their business as usual. © 2020 IEEE.","Wilson, S.","2020 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, ISTAS 2020",481,10

The main objective of this study was to review the aspects of the diagnostic kits approved in Brazil and their application in the different federative units to gather epidemiological information. In order to achieve these objectives, a survey was carried out on the data available at the regulatory agency (ANVISA) and in the literature. The main countries that have registered products in Brazil are China (51.4%), Brazil (16.6%), South Korea (9.2%), USA (8.8%) and Germany (3.6%). The methodologies of these products are based on the detection of nucleic-acid (15.8%), antigen (13%) and antibody (71.2%). In the immunological tests, it was verified that the sensitivity ranged from 55 to 100% and the specificity from 80 to 100%. The percentage of cases in the samples tested in Brazil is elevated in almost all federative units since eight states showed 40% of positive cases in tested samples, while 18 states displayed between 20 and 40%. In conclusion, this review showed that Brazil is dependent on external technology to respond to pandemics, epidemics and endemics disease and needs to improve its biotechnological scheme to solve further diseases outbreaks.","Vedova-Costa, Jean Michel Dela; Ramos, Eliézer Lucas Pires; Boschero, Raphael Aparecido; Ferreira, Gabriela Nascimento; Soccol, Vanete Thomaz; Santiani, Manuel Hospinal; Pacce, Violetta Dias; Lustosa, Bruno Paulo Rodrigues; Vicente, Vânia Aparecida; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo",Braz. arch. biol. technol,481,6

The myths on the COVID-19 vaccine are spreading widely, causing a hindrance to this noble preventive measure. The prevalence of such myths among the healthcare professionals may be toxic and deadly. Aim & Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the healthcare professionals regarding the myths on COVID-19 vaccination and to demystify them. Materials and Methods: An 18-item questionnaire evaluating knowledge, attitude, and practice based on the existing myths on COVID-19 vaccination was circulated through Google Forms among the 412 healthcare professionals of six disciplines belonging to a private University. The responses obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 20 software package. Results: A total of 385 health professionals participated in this study. The majority of them had medium knowledge (165) and positive attitude (273) with the mean knowledge and attitude scores of 3.82 (SD-1.55) out of 6 and 4.3 (SD-1.58) out of 7 respectively. Even though 312 participants got vaccinated, 72 of them failed to receive it. The knowledge scores showed a high statistically significant difference among the participants of different designations (p=0.001), but not with gender, field, and staff with different years of experience (p>0.05). The attitude scores were statistically different among participants of fields and designation (p<0.05) but not among genders (p=0.31) and staff with different years of experience (p=0.87).

Employing, however, survival methodology when its fundamental assumptions are not fulfilled can severely bias the results. Currently, hundreds of clinical studies are using survival methods to investigate factors potentially associated with the prognosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19), and test new preventive and therapeutic strategies. In the pandemic era, it is more critical than ever that decision-making is evidence-based and relies on solid statistical methods. However, this is not always the case. Serious methodologic errors have been identified in recent seminal studies about Covid-19: one reporting outcomes of patients treated with remdesivir, and another one on the epidemiology, clinical course and outcomes of critically-ill patients. High-quality evidence is essential to inform clinicians about optimal Covid-19 therapies, and policymakers about the true effect of preventive measures aiming to tackle the pandemic. Though timely evidence is needed, we should encourage the appropriate application of survival analysis methods and careful peer-review to avoid publishing flawed results, which could affect decision-making. In this paper, we recapitulate the basic assumptions underlying non-parametric survival analysis and frequent errors in its application, and discuss how to handle data of Covid-19.","Piovani, D.; Nikolopoulos, G.

In this study, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of vaccine passports in relaxing public health restrictions. Methods: Through an online survey that includes a conjoint experiment of a demographically representative sample of 5,000 Japanese adults aged 20-74, we assess the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, reasons for hesitation, and effectiveness of hypothetical vaccine passports. Results: We found that about 30% of respondents did not intend to vaccinate or have not yet decided, with major reasons for vaccine hesitancy being related to concerns about the safety and side effects of the vaccine. In line with previous findings, younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and psychological factors such as weaker COVID-19 fear were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The easing of public health restrictions such as travel, wearing face masks, and dining out at night was associated with an increase in vaccine acceptance by 4-10%. Conclusion: Vaccine hesitancy can be reduced by mitigating the concerns about vaccine safety and side effects, as well as by relaxing public health restrictions. However, the feasibility of vaccine passports needs to be sufficiently assessed, taking the ethical issues of passports and the public health impacts of the relaxation of restrictions into careful consideration.","Okamoto, S.; Kamimura, K.; Komamura, K.",,481,20

If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, K-monotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of K-regular and K-weak regular splittings, where K is a proper cone in Rn. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration scheme in a general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature. Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in standard proper cone setting, i.e., K=R+n), is open. To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for K-weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative scheme is a K-regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also study K-monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a K-weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on M-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next generation matrix involved in the pandemic model. The computation of large PageRank matrices shows that the two-stage Gauss-Seidel method performs better than the Gauss-Seidel methods. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Shekhar, V.; Nayak, S.; Mishra, N.; Mishra, D.",Applied Mathematics and Computation,481,20

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a new measure of the investor's sentiment based on Google trend to construct a Chinese investor's sentiment index and a quantile causal approach to examine the causal relationship between googling investor's sentiment and the Chinese stock and bond markets as well as the sector indices. On the other hand, the network connectedness is used to estimate the spillover effect on the investor's sentiment and index returns. To check the robustness of the study results, the authors employed the Chinese VIX, as another measure of the investor's sentiment using daily data from May 2019 to December 2020. Findings In fact, the authors found a dual causality between the investor's sentiment and the financial market indices in optimistic or pessimistic situations, which indicates that positive and negative financial market returns may have an effect on the Chinese investor's sentiment. In addition, the results indicated that a pessimistic investor's sentiment has a negative impact on the banking, healthcare and utility sectors. In fact, the study results provide a significant peak of connectivity between the investor's sentiment, the stock market and the sector indices during the 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 turmoil periods that coincide respectively with the 2015 recession of the Chinese economy and the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value This finding suggests that the Chinese googling investor's sentiment is considered as a prominent channel of shock spillovers during the coronavirus crisis, which confirms the behavioral contagion. This study also identifies the contribution of a particular interest for portfolio managers and investors, which helps them to accordingly design their portfolio strategy.","Mezghani, T.; Boujelbene, M.; Elbayar, M.",China Finance Review International,481,22

We sought to examine oncology provider perspectives on clinical decisions and care delivery during the pandemic and to compare provider views early versus late in the pandemic. Methods: We invited oncology providers, including attendings, trainees and advanced practice providers, to complete a cross-sectional online survey using a variety of outreach methods including social media (Twitter), email contacts, word of mouth and provider list-serves. We surveyed providers at two time points during the pandemic when the number of COVID-19 cases was rising in the United States, early (March 2020) and late (January 2021). The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chisquared tests to evaluate differences in early versus late provider responses. Results: A total of 132 providers completed the survey and most were white (n = 73/132, 55%) and younger than 49 years (n = 88/132, 67%). Respondents were attendings in medical, surgical or radiation oncology (n = 61/132, 46%), advanced practice providers (n = 48/132, 36%) and oncology fellows (n = 16/132, 12%) who predominantly practiced in an academic medical center (n = 120/132, 91%). The majority of providers agreed patients with cancer are at higher risk than other patients to be affected by COVID-19 (n = 121/132, 92%). However, there was a significant difference in the proportion of early versus late providers who thought delays in cancer care were needed. Early in the pandemic, providers were more likely to recommend delays in curative surgery or radiation for early-stage cancer (p < 0.001), delays in adjuvant chemotherapy after curative surgery (p = 0.002), or delays in surveillance imaging for metastatic cancer (p < 0.001). The majority of providers early in the pandemic responded that “reducing risk of a complication from a COVID-19 infection to patients with cancer” was the primary reason for recommending delays in care (n = 52/76, 68%). Late in the pandemic, however, providers were more likely to agree that “any practice change would have a negative impact on patient outcomes” (p = 0.003). At both time points, the majority of providers agreed with the need for other care delivery changes, including screening patients for infectious symptoms (n = 128/132, 98%) and the use of telemedicine (n = 114/132, 86%) during the pandemic. Conclusions: We found significant differences in provider perspectives of delays in cancer care early versus late in the pandemic which reflects the swiftly evolving oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of changes in treatment and care delivery on outcomes for patients with cancer.","Parikh, D. A.; Ragavan, M.

Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1 October 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from the theory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform are consistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts of the signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications to the waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients, improving past constraints by factors of ${\sim}2$; we also find consistency with Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of the spin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, we tighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of ${\sim}2.6$ and bound the mass of the graviton to $m_g \leq 1.76 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$ with 90% credibility. We also analyze the properties of the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times, constraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to $\delta \hat{f}_{220} = 0.03^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and $\delta \hat{f}_{221} = 0.04^{+0.27}_{-0.32}$ for the first overtone; additionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determine that our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through a template-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of general relativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidence for new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for any unaccounted systematics.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott, the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

At the beginning of the outbreak, almost all public spaces were closed to minimize the spread of this virus. Even as public spaces open up, they have several restrictions. Such restrictions include limited occupancy in common rooms to ensure social distancing and this can lead to increased occupancy costs inside buildings. The strategy of “Design as a cure” has been long used by architects and urban planners to minimize the spread of infectious diseases in urban environments. Re-configuring the space layout and optimizing the heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) operations were some immediate solutions proposed by building designers to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection in buildings. This paper explores the use of smart re-configurable spaces (SReS) to improve the efficiency of indoor space utilization while maintaining a safe indoor environment. We used an existing smart building design framework to design SReS for a common area/lounge in one of the cadet resident halls at Virginia Tech. User requirements were measured by conducting an interview with the residential coordinator and focus groups among the cadets. The concept of generative design was used in Revit 2021 to design various layouts of the lounge. Towards the end, we create a layout for maximum occupancy and suggest various re-configuration strategies. Future work includes modeling and evaluating the human-building interaction of SReS in virtual reality (VR). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dongre, P.; Manuel, M.; Gračanin, D.","9th International Conference on Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions, DAPI 2021, held as part of the 23rd International Conference, HCI International 2021",481,1

Material and Methods: Data of patients were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into two-groups as pre-pandemic and pandemic. Age, gender, duration after the onset of complaints until visiting hospital, WBC count, days after presentation to hospital until surgery, surgical method, whether the appendix was complicated, duration of hospitalization, whether any complications developed, and results of PCR tests were evaluated. The data of the groups were compared and it was investigated whether there was any difference between them. Statistical analysis was done with the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 21. P 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Appendectomy was performed in 327 patients during pandemic and in 295 during pre-pandemic period. Although the ratio of complicated appendicitis increased during pandemic compared to pre-pandemic period (47.1% versus 40.7%), there was no difference between groups. However, duration between onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital (p=0.003), time elapsed before surgery (p=0.021), length-of-stay in hospital (p=0.009), and developed complications (p=0.01) were higher in pandemic group. Conclusion: Comparing prepandemic, although there was no statistically significant difference during the pandemic period, there was an increase in complicated appendicitis and related complications. It was attributed to late arrival at hospitals due to curfews, parental fear of disease transmission, and prolonged duration of screening tests in the emergency departments.","Demir, S.; Oztorun, C.

Eighteen school principals from a range of secondary schools were interviewed about their experiences and the findings of this study are discussed in relation to the leadership capability framework (Education Council, 2018). This research reveals that principals acted with empathy in prioritising wellbeing over learning, demonstrated community responsiveness by using multiple ways of communicating, encouraged collective leadership, led with optimism, demonstrated resilience, and took opportunities to shift practice in their schools.","Thornton, Kate",set: Research Information for Teachers,481,10

On the other hand, the potentially harmful consequences of such services' inappropriate usage cannot be neglected. Thus, a suitable methodology for quality assurance and quality control has to be established. A study's purpose was to develop and test an original methodology for a complex evaluation of open-access AI services in teleradiology. The approach included assessing the user experience, accessibility, safety, and diagnostic accuracy on the independent reference dataset. The methodology was applied to assess seven AI services for the detection of COVID-19 on a CT scan. A comparative analysis of this assessment is presented in this work. The analysis allowed us to draw conclusions about AI services' quality and their value for different users - patients, physicians, and healthcare data scientists.

Patients will tend to forget their antibiotics, especially when they feel better. Related to this phenomenon, the development of medication reminder media is essential. AIM: This experimental study was aimed to develop and apply calendarized package as a medication reminder media in patients with short-course antibiotics to improve their compliance. METHODS: Calendarized package was prepared from the labeling of the original package of antibiotics with stickers. Patients above 18 years old who were prescribed short-course oral antibiotics (not more than 7 days) during the study period were asked to participate in this study. Patients were grouped into two groups (control and intervention group). Patients’ demographical data, medications prescribed, and the last antibiotics course day was recorded. Patients were then contacted for compliance evaluation on the latest antibiotics course day. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited in this study. Seventy-six patients were grouped into the intervention group, while the remaining 74 patients were the control group. The results showed that the number of compliant patients in the intervention group was higher (72.37%) than those in the control group (45.95%), respectively (p < 0.000). CONCLUSION: The application of the calendar on the package indicates the positive impact on the patients’ compliance with antibiotics. However, in this study, the compliance measurement was conducted indirectly because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, several limitations should be considered. Future research using a bigger sample size and stricter compliance measurement method is needed to confirm this finding. © 2021 Ilil Maidatuz Zulfa, Widya Handayani.","Zulfa, I.

During these time, the people are afraid to go crowed places such as bus stop. But most people prefer to use public transport instead of driving their vehicles due to diverse benefits. Through their mobile phones, if the people are aware of the timings of their route bus they can come to the bus stop on time in order to avoid the waiting. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the improvement of public transport for making the usage of this type of transport convenient and safe. To achieve the aim of this paper, a GPS (Global Positioning System) and a GSM (Global system for mobile communication) concepts are employed. Moreover, to complete the design successfully, the SIM808 board is used in order to track the location of the vehicle remotely as it contains a GPS module, and for sending short SMS messages including the latitude and longitude GSM modem is attached.

Methods We used comprehensive national English datasets and simulation modelling to determine the total burden (identified and unidentified) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections. Those unidentified would either be 1) discharged before symptom onset (""missed""), or 2) have symptom onset 7 days or fewer from admission (""misclassified""). We estimated the contribution of ""misclassified"" cases and transmission from ""missed"" symptomatic infections to the English epidemic before 31st July 2020. Findings In our dataset of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in acute English Trusts with a recorded symptom onset date (n = 65,028), 7% were classified as hospital-acquired (with symptom onset 8 or more days after admission and before discharge). We estimated that only 30% (range across weeks and 200 simulations: 20-41%) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections would be identified. Misclassified cases and onward transmission from missed infections could account for 15% (mean, 95% range over 200 simulations: 14.1%-15.8%) of cases currently classified as community-acquired COVID-19. From this, we estimated that 26,600 (25,900 to 27,700) individuals acquired a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in an acute Trust in England before 31st July 2020, resulting in 15,900 (15,200-16,400) or 20.1% (19.2%-20.7%) of all identified hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Conclusion Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalised patients likely caused approximately a fifth of identified cases of hospitalised COVID-19 in the ""first wave"", but fewer than 1% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in England. Using symptom onset as a detection method for hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 likely misses a substantial proportion (>60%) of hospital-acquired infections.","Knight, G. M.; Pham, T.

Considered alone short-term visits and noticing were again consistent and significant predictors of three well-being measures, but recent visits to nature were not associated with pro-nature conservation behaviours. A combined regression highlighted the importance of a longer-term relationship with nature in all outcomes apart from loneliness but also revealed that even when considered in concert with longer-term factors, currently noticing nature had a role in feeling one’s life was worthwhile, pro-nature behaviours and loneliness.Originality/valueThe closeness of the human-nature relationship and noticing nature have rarely been examined in concert with nature visits.

The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic re-organization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas Carbon Dioxide (CO2). We confirm that when coupled to odor presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states. Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2 but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.","Lesar, Amanda; Tahir, Javan; Wolk, Jason; Gershow, Marc",bioRxiv,481,22

The under-representation of transmembrane proteins in the Protein Data Bank highlights the need to apply new and advanced bioinformatics methods to shed light on their structure and function. This study focuses on such a family; transmembrane proteins containing the Pfam domain PF09335 (‘SNARE_ASSOC’/‘VTT ‘/‘Tvp38’). One prominent member, Tmem41b, has been shown to be involved in early stages of autophagosome formation and is vital in mouse embryonic development. Here we use evolutionary covariance-derived information not only to construct and validate ab initio models but also to make domain boundary predictions and infer local structural features. The results from the structural bioinformatics analysis of Tmem41b and its homologues show that they contain a tandem repeat that is clearly visible in evolutionary covariance data but much less so by sequence analysis. Furthermore, cross-referencing of other prediction data with the covariance analysis shows that the internal repeat features 2-fold rotational symmetry. Ab initio modelling of Tmem41b reinforces these structural predictions. Local structural features predicted to be present in Tmem41b are also present in Cl−/H+ antiporters. These results together strongly point to Tmem41b and its homologues as being transporters for an as-yet uncharacterised substrate and possibly using H+ antiporter activity as its mechanism for transport.","Mesdaghi, Shahram; Murphy, David L.; Rodríguez, Filomeno Sánchez; Burgos-Mármol, J.

After having completed their 6-month-long projects, the 14-18 year-old school students report having substantially increased in confidence relating to relevant scientific topics and methods as well as having developed numerous skills, outcomes which are corroborated by teachers. There is evidence that the projects helped increase students' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations (generally high to begin with) were typically maintained or confirmed through their involvement. Longitudinal evaluation 3 years later has revealed that these projects have been lasting experiences for students which they have benefited and drawn upon in their subsequent university education. Data on students' destinations suggests that their involvement in research projects has made them more likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be expected. Cases of co-created novel physics research resulting from PRiSE also has seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on the student co-authors but participating students from other schools also. Teachers have also been positively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced their own knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous effects felt across their wider schools.

However, few epidemiologic studies have examined this association. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that adults with diabetes will have a higher risk for infection compared to those without diabetes. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of diabetes and incident hospitalization with infection using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We used Cox regression models with adjustments for demographics, health behaviors, and cardiometabolic and kidney functioning measures. Diabetes status at baseline (1987-1989) was defined as a fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or non-fasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL, or self-report of a diagnosis of diabetes, or current diabetes medication use. First hospitalization with any infection and specific types of infections (respiratory, urinary, foot, sepsis, and postoperative wound) were ascertained from ICD-9 codes in hospital discharge records, with follow-up to September 30, 2015. Results: We included 13,356 participants (mean age, 55;26% black;54% female). During a median follow-up of 18.8 years, there were 7,791 incident hospitalizations with infection.

Participants were randomly exposed to an acute stress or no-stress control condition after which they completed a cost-benefit reinforcement learning task. Acute stress improved learning to maximize benefits (monetary rewards) relative to minimising energy expenditure (grip force). Using computational modelling, we demonstrate that costs and benefits can exert asymmetric effects on decisions when prediction errors that convey information about the reward value and cost of actions receive inappropriate importance; a process associated with distinct alterations in pupil size fluctuations. These results provide new insights into learning strategies under acute stress – which, depending on the context, may be maladaptive or beneficial - and candidate neuromodulatory mechanisms that could underlie such behaviour.","Voulgaropoulou, Stella; Fauzani, Fasya; Pfirrmann, Janine; Vingerhoets, Claudia; van Amelsvoort, Thérèse; Hernaus, Dennis",bioRxiv,481,1

The authors’ research, carried out from June to August 2020, covered 700 people, which accounts for 18.7% of the religious education teachers working in the Śląskie Voivodeship. The results of the authors’ own research allowed formulating a conclusion that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the development of modern information and communication competencies of all participants of religious education. Entities involved in this type of education recognized and used multiple opportunities offered by information and communication technologies, which can be seen in the respondents’ declarations describing various forms of their didactic and educational on-line work. The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated parents to become more involved in the religious education of younger school-age children. The surveyed religion teachers declared that, thanks to the activity and the help of their parents, the children systematically participated in religion lessons and carried out orders and educational tasks without major problems. Thus, indirectly, parents of children of a younger school age were covered by religious education and were subject to pedagogy. Nevertheless, as teachers have pointed out, the virtual world makes it impossible to form authentic interpersonal relationships. The research confirmed the thesis, according to which religious education carried out in distance learning limits the complete implementation of its objectives, since an upbringing in faith calls for community that necessitates direct contact between the pupil and the teacher.","Buchta, Roman Cichosz Wojciech Zellma Anna",Religions,481,15

This interest has grown rapidly during the current COVID-19 pandemic where CRISPR diagnostics have been frontline contenders for rapid testing solutions. This surge in CRISPR diagnostics research prompts the following question: What exactly are the achievable limits of detection and associated assay times enabled by the kinetics of Cas12 and Cas13 enzymes? To address this question, we here present a model based on Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics theory applied to Cas enzymes. We use the model to develop analytical solutions for reaction kinetics and develop back-of-the envelope criteria to validate and check for consistency in reported enzyme kinetics parameters. We applied our analyses to all studies known to us which report Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics data for CRISPR associated enzymes. These studies include all subtypes of Cas12 and Cas13 and orthologs. We found all studies but one clearly violate at least two of our three rules of consistency. We further use our model to explore ranges of reaction time scales and degree of reaction completion for practically relevant target concentrations applicable to CRISPR-diagnostic assays.","Ramachandran, Ashwin; Santiago, Juan G.",bioRxiv,481,1

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that spread to a pandemic in early 2020 provokes enormous setbacks to this expansion. This, however, should provide lessons regarding the importance of resilient and inclusive food systems. Emergency responses to COVID-19 should consider interventions towards that end and leverage the opportunities provided by food markets growth as economies recover from the present economic recession. This paper assesses options of how this could be done by facilitating the better functioning and interconnectedness of the many small and medium-sized enterprises that are proliferating along the ""hidden middle"" of food value chains in storage, logistics, transportation, and wholesale and retail distribution. It also explores how policies can help smallholder farmers connect to this ""hidden middle"" in more gainful ways and help them climb out of poverty as well.","Vos, R.; Cattaneo, A.",Journal of Integrative Agriculture,481,5

The global pandemic of the COVID-19 and the subsequent nationwide lockdown have put the endeavours of both academicians and students to the test. The disruptions are even visible in andragogical approaches across higher education institutions both nationally and internationally. Two government-funded universities in India and Bangladesh have decided to explore avenues to switch to an alternative e-platform overcoming the challenges of traditional classroom teaching. The business management faculties of both universities exercise blended learning modules using a design thinking approach. Methods. This exploratory case study involves university students and teachers reflecting on the knowledge delivery mechanism in a collaborative online workspace called the virtual dassroom. The authors have adopted the case method to identify evidence-based practices improving learning gains. This case is motivated by the profound idea of learning continuity where the agenda of teaching-learning should remain status quo as much as possible, even under the constrained situation. Results and conclusions. This study confirms that the use of curriculum-based blended learning modules applying a design thinking approach is gaining momentum to offer courses in which videoconferencing is a useful tool as an addition to present methods of teaching inside the classroom, to strengthen learning and to inspire students to practice learning. Acceptance of technology has made learning accessible and pervasive, bridging the digital divide. Originality. It is a pioneering effort to measure the effectiveness of the online learning of two public-funded universities across borders with similar demographics and challenges. This case makes an original contribution through its observation that even the traditional and public-funded universities erstwhile functioning through purely offline mode are gradually switching to online mode. This case also highlights the imminent need for policymakers to augment and integrate blended learning tools with design thinking approaches for tertiary education to reduce the intermittent use of technology, thereby assuring higher learning gain for the students.","Hasan, K.

The objectives of this study were to determine what the food industry needs to be able to control COVID-19 impacts in the work environment and what mitigation strategies are being implemented. A web-based needs assessment survey was distributed from January to April 2021, via 13 food professional/trade organizations and 2 social networks, targeting management professionals at food (produce, dairy, poultry, and beef/pork) processing facilities and produce farm operations in the US. Statistical analyses evaluated patterns in self-reported adoption of mitigation strategies against COVID-19 in the participants' facilities/operations and perceived needs of the industry regarding COVID-19. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis. In total 145 responses were received, of which 79 were usable, including 38 (48%) from the dairy, 17 (22%) from the fresh produce, and 24 (30%) from a mixture of other food industry sectors. Only two usable responses were from the beef/pork sector and none from the poultry sector. Findings revealed that several social distancing, biosecurity, and surveillance mitigation strategies against COVID-19 are commonly implemented in the participants' facilities/operations, but their implementation frequency differs by the facility/operation size and industry sector. Also, findings indicated that collaboration between the food industry and government agencies, contingency plans and appropriate training, and new technologies are needed to control COVID-19 in the food industry. Subject to limitations associated with the relatively low response rate (possible selection bias), the findings suggest that the US food industry is prepared to safeguard workers' health and businesses in the event of a new COVID-19 variant or similar future disaster, provided that appropriate structures are put in place to ensure coordination and compliance, both before and during such an outbreak.","Llanos-Soto, S.; Bulut, E.; Murphy, S.

We set out to reconfigure our service to best meet the needs of patients.MethodsPrior to the pandemic, patients with displaced fractures requiring manipulation routinely received treatment in the operating theatre. The pandemic posed several challenges to the continued delivery of this service following a reduction in theatre capacity. After discussion with multidisciplinary team members, it was agreed that where possible manipulations would be performed in fracture clinic at the point of the presentation. To facilitate this, the trust’s mini c-arm (fluoroscopy) was relocated. A standard operating procedure (SOP) was written to guide safe administration of analgesia for adults and children. Essential resuscitation equipment and airway trained doctor support were made available to ensure patient safety. Data was collected prospectively over a 28-day period and compared to the same period in 2019.ResultsThe mini c-arm was used on 34 patients in the fracture clinic setting. 82.4% patients received definitive treatment and 44.1% avoided admission for theatre. There were no adverse events. Compared to 2019, the number of patients undergoing fracture manipulation in theatre decreased by 66.7%. NHS reference costs were used to estimate a £8445 saving over the 28-day period.Leadership LessonsThe nature of the global pandemic required swift action to be taken to adapt our service to meet the needs of patients. We used the PDSA (plan, do, study, act) framework to implement this change. After discussion of the findings at our quality improvement meeting, an SOP has now been written to guide the continued running of the service. We wish to highlight this model of emergency orthopaedic fracture care to other trusts for use in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Cash, Thomas Sargazi Nastaran Barton Cefin Boyce-Cam Nicholas",BMJ Leader,481,16

In animal studies, seasonal and circadian (daily) rhythms in immune function generate periodicity in vulnerability to disease, although it is not known whether the same applies to humans. Making use of extensive data from the UK Biobank cohort, we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters (inflammatory markers, white blood cell counts and antibody titres), and test for associations with a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors. Methods and Findings: Markers of inflammation (CRP), and white blood cell counts were measured between 8am and 7pm over a 4-year time period in 329,261 participants in UK Biobank. Individual-level data were linked to other factors that vary over seasonal and daily cycles, including changes in day length, outdoor temperature and vitamin D at the time the blood sample was collected. Analyses were further adjusted for potentially confounding lifestyle factors. Seasonal patterns were evident in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and CRP, but not monocytes, and these were independent of lifestyle, demographic and environmental factors. All the immune parameters assessed demonstrated significant daytime variation that was independent of confounding factors. Conclusions: At a population level, human immune parameters vary across season and across time of day, independent of multiple confounding factors. Both season and time of day are fundamental dimensions of immune function that should be considered in all studies of immuno-prophylaxis and disease transmission. Strategic alignment of human activities to seasons and times of the day when we are less susceptible to infection could be an important additional tool for limiting population-level impacts of infectious diseases.","Wyse, C.; O'Malley, G.; Coogan, A.; Smith, D.",,481,1

Methods: We included 27,865 cases registered between January 2020 and February 2021 in the COVID-19 Registry of Japan to examine the relationship between the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of COVID-19 patients on the day of admission and the prefecture where the patients live. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to examine the random effect of each prefecture in addition to the patients' backgrounds. In addition, we compared the results of two models; one model included the number of beds secured for COVID-19 patients in each prefecture as one of the fixed effects, and the other model did not. Results: The results indicated that the prefecture had a substantial impact on the severity of COVID-19 on admission. Even when considering the effect of the number of beds separately, the heterogeneity caused by the random effect of each prefecture affected the severity of the case on admission. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed a possible association between regional heterogeneity and increased/decreased risk of severe COVID-19 infection on admission. This heterogeneity was derived not only from the number of beds secured in each prefecture but also from other factors.","Tsuzuki, S.; Asai, Y.; Matsunaga, N.; Ishioka, H.; Akiyama, T.; Ohmagari, N.",,481,1

Therefore, the operators may consider shut in the wells. Current investigation offers an insight into the effect of near-wellbore skin buildup because of such shut-in. A series of simulation studies was performed to quantitatively address the impact of well shut-in on the long-term performance of well, in particular on key performance indicators of the well including cumulative steam to oil ratio and cumulative oil production. The long-term shut-in contributes to three main modes of plugging: (1) near-wellbore pore plugging by clays and fines, (2) scaling, and (3) chemical consolidation induced by corrosion. A series of carefully designed simulations was also utilized to understand the potential of skin buildup in the near-wellbore region and within different sand control devices. The simulation results showed a higher sensitivity of well performance to shut-in for the wells in the ITinitial stage of SAGD production. If the well is shut in during the first years, the total reduction in cumulative oil production is much higher compared to a well which is shut-in during late SAGD production life. As the induced skin due to shut-in increases, the ultimate cumulative oil production drops whose magnitude depends on well completion designs. The highest effect on the cumulative oil production is in the case of completion designs with flow control devices (liner deployed and tubing deployed completions). Therefore, wellbore hydraulics and completion design play key roles in the maintenance of uniform inflow profile, and the skin buildup due to shut-in poses a high risk of inflow problem and increases the risk of hot-spot development and steam breakthrough. This investigation offers a new understanding concerning the effect of shut-in and wellbore skin buildup on SAGD operation. It helps production and completion engineers to better understand and select candidate wells for shut-in and subsequently to minimize the skin buildup in wells.

Although analysts tend to be overly optimistic about dividends paid over short horizons, the authors find analysts possess skill regarding the direction of future dividend growth. The authors provide evidence that prices of dividend futures are driven more by hedging activity than fundamental views or uncertainty around future cash flows, leading prices to drop significantly below analysts’ expectations and subsequent realized payoffs in times of increased equity market volatility.

While communities have invested in sport tourism initiatives, building dedicated sports facilities and competing to host tournaments, little academic attention has been paid to understanding the travel planning and decision-making associated with youth sport families. Utilising an inductive approach, the purpose of this study was to examine the processes and decisions parents make in the context of youth sport tourism to facilitate their children's travel sport participation. In-depth interviews were conducted with youth sport parents from the two US states with significant investments in sport tourism: Indiana and Florida. (n = 15 FL;n = 18 IN). Three themes were identified in the parents' narratives using grounded theory methods, (1) Travel Logistics, (2) Flow-on Tourism, and (3) Tourn-acations. Travel logistics were dominated by decisions over accommodations and transportation with price and team bonding of consideration. A series of barriers and enablers to participation in flow-on tourism were identified including tournament schedules and proximity to tourist attractions. Decisions to create a mini-vacation out of the tournament trip (tourn-acation) were associated with novelty, distance from home, and timing such as tournaments scheduled around national holidays. A model outlining the family travel decision-making process in the context of youth sport tourism is proffered. Recommendations for DMOs leveraging the flow-on tourism associated with youth sport-events are discussed in addition to acknowledging the role of youth sport tourism in post Covid-19 tourism recovery.","Mirehie, Mona Gibson Heather J.; Buning, Richard J.; Coble, Cassandra Flaherty Meredith",Journal of Destination Marketing &amp; Management,481,17

At the core of the study, a mobile application entitled Nutrition Assessment System (NAS) that simplified the data collection was used as toolkit and a technical test was carried out in all Lebanese governorates between November 2020 and March 2021. Findings show that food insecurity is an immediate problem for households in Beirut and in many governorates in Lebanon. Nine in every 16 households ate less than 2 meals per day and more than 70% of them skipped their meals to spare food. Even though half the population studied had a low food consumption score, 82.4% of the people were not relying on livelihood coping strategies. However, more than three out of ten of these households relied on at least three food-based coping strategies. In addition, as for the livelihoods, this assessment found that most Lebanese households reported a drop in income along with an expansion in debt incurrence in the last 24 months to be able to buy food.

This resulted in several challenges for staff and patients, but also in benefits such as convenience or increased access for people with impaired mobility or in rural areas. There is a need to understand the extent and impacts of telemental health implementation, and barriers and facilitators to its effective and acceptable use. This is relevant both to future emergency adoption of telemental health, and to debates on its future use in routine mental health care. Objective: To investigate the adoption and impacts of telemental health approaches during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and facilitators and barriers to optimal implementation. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science) were searched for primary research relating to remote working, mental health care, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprint servers were also searched. Results of studies were synthesised using framework synthesis. Results: A total of 77 papers met our inclusion criteria. In most studies, the majority of contacts could be transferred to a remote form during the pandemic, and good acceptability to service users and clinicians tended to be reported, at least where the alternative to remote contacts was interrupting care. However, a range of impediments to dealing optimal care by this means were also identified. Conclusions: Implementation of telemental health allowed some continuing support to the majority of service users during the COVID-19 pandemic and has value in an emergency situation. However, not all service users can be reached by this means, and better evidence is now needed on long-term impacts on therapeutic relationships and quality of care, and on impacts on groups at risk of digital exclusion and how to mitigate these.","Appleton, R.; Williams, J.; Vera San Juan, N.; Needle, J.; Schlief, M.; Jordan, H.; Sheridan Rains, L.; Goulding, L.; Badhan, M.; Roxburgh, E.; Barnett, P.; Spyridonidis, S.; Tomaskova, M.; Mo, J.; Harju-Seppanen, J.; Haime, Z.; Casetta, C.; Papamichail, A.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Simpson, A.; Sevdalis, N.; Gaughran, F.; Johnson, S.",,481,1

We aim to document the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs in Belgian hospitals, and to study potential risk factors for the infection in order to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare institutions. MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline results (April 22 - April 26) of an ongoing cohort study. All staff who were present in the hospital during the sampling period and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. Fourteen hospitals across Belgium and 50 HCW per hospital were randomly selected. RT-qPCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs, and a semi-quantitative IgG ELISA was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera. Individual characteristics likely to be associated with seropositivity were collected using an online questionnaire. Findings698 participants completed the questionnaire; 80.8% were women, median age was 39.5, and 58.5% were nurses. Samples were collected on all 699 participants. The weighted anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 7.7% (95%CI, 4.7%-12.2%), while 1.1% (95%CI, 0.4%-3.0%) of PCR results were positive. Unprotected contact with a confirmed case was the only factor associated with seropositivity (PR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.4-3.2). InterpretationMost Belgian HCW did not show evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by late April 2020, and unprotected contact was the most important risk factor. This confirms the importance of widespread availability of protective equipment and use of adequate IPC measures in hospital settings.","Mortgat, Laure; Barbezange, Cyril; Fischer, Natalie; Heyndrickx, Leo; Hutse, Veronik; Thomas, Isabelle; Vuylsteke, Bea; Arien, Kevin; Desombere, Isabelle; Duysburgh, Els",,481,19

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.","Pierson, David J",Respiratory care,481,9

It has previously been shown that a particular six-base insertion in loop 1 of the pseudoknot is extremely deleterious to the virus. We have now isolated multiple independent second-site revertants of the loop 1 insertion mutant, and we used reverse-genetics methods to confirm the identities of suppressor mutations that could compensate for the original insertion. The suppressors were localized to two separate regions of the genome. Members of one class of suppressor were mapped to the portions of gene 1 that encode nsp8 and nsp9, thereby providing the first evidence for specific interactions between coronavirus replicase gene products and a cis-acting genomic RNA element. The second class of suppressor was mapped to the extreme 3' end of the genome, a result which pointed to the existence of a direct base-pairing interaction between loop 1 of the pseudoknot and the genomic terminus. The latter finding was strongly supported by phylogenetic evidence and by the construction of a deletion mutant that reduced the 3' UTR to its minimal essential elements. Taken together, the interactions revealed by the two classes of suppressors suggest a model for the initiation of coronavirus negative-strand RNA synthesis.","Züst, Roland; Miller, Timothy B; Goebel, Scott J; Thiel, Volker; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,481,16

At least one virus was detected in 436 (38.3%) specimens by FA and in 608 (53.4%) specimens by PCR (P<0.001). Specimen quality was inadequate for FA in 52 (4.6%) specimens; 13 of these (25%) were positive by PCR. In contrast, 18 (1.6%) specimens could not be analyzed by PCR; 1 of these was positive by FA. The number of specimens positive only by PCR among specimens positive by PCR and/or FA was 18 (7.0%) of 257 for RSV, 18 (13.4%) of 134 for FluA, 25 (64.1%) of 39 for PIV1, 8 (88.9%) of 9 for PIV2, 17 (30.1%) of 55 for PIV3, and 101 (76.5%) of 132 for AdV. MPV was detected in 6.6% of all specimens and in 9.5% of the 702 specimens negative by FA. The mean number of virus copies per milliliter in specimens positive by both PCR and FA was significantly higher, at 6.7x10(7), than that in specimens positive only by PCR, at 4.1x10(4) (P<0.001). The PCR assays were significantly more sensitive than FA assays for detecting respiratory viruses, especially parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. Use of real-time PCR to identify viral respiratory pathogens in children will lead to improved diagnosis of respiratory illness.","Kuypers, Jane; Wright, Nancy; Ferrenberg, James; Huang, Meei-Li; Cent, Anne; Corey, Lawrence; Morrow, Rhoda",Journal of clinical microbiology,481,12

Colonoscopy showed large rectal varices which were the source of her lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). Since endoscopic treatment for LGIB are limited, and because the patient had portal vein thrombosis which contraindicated transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), we performed percutaneous transhepatic embolization of her rectal varices using a new mixture of embolic and sclerotic agents, followed by Amplatzer plug 2 (AVP 2). To our knowledge, the use of this new mixture with the AVP 2 in the rectal varices treatment has not been previously published in literature.

Similar numbers of infectious viral particles were detected in feces of calves inoculated with either virus, but diarrhea, xylose malabsorption, and reduction of villus height occurred only after inoculation with virulent virus. The mean percentage of the area of the villus epithelium per villus immunostained for rotavirus antigen was eight times greater in calves inoculated with virulent virus, and the mean percentage of villi on which immunostained enterocytes were detected was twice as large in calves inoculated with virulent virus than in calves inoculated with the virus of low virulence. Mean crypt death and mean crypt cell production rates were increased after inoculation with either virus. Virulence was associated with extensive spread of infection through the small intestine, preferential colonization of the proximal small intestine, and marked damage to enterocytes and villi. The virus of low virulence infected the proximal small intestine poorly, and although it infected more enterocytes in the mid and distal small intestine and replicated in them, causing cytopathic effects, it did not damage intestinal structure and affect function.","Hall, G A; Bridger, J C; Parsons, K R; Cook, R",Veterinary pathology,481,24

METHODS: A survey was devised and publically published on the REDCap database management system with individual centres responding to a public link. RESULTS: 78 adult and paediatric centres worldwide contributed to the survey, representing at least 3500 patients' experience. Centres (n/78 unless otherwise specified, %) reported infrastructure maintenance for PN bag deliveries to patients (60, 76.92%) or delivery of ancillary items (dressing packs, gloves, bungs) (57, 73.08%) home delivery and HPN administration (65, 83.33%) but homecare nurse shortages (25, 32.05%). Follow up of routine HPN patients changed to either all telemed or mixed with emergency clinic review (70, 89.74%). In 26 centres (33.33%), new discharges on HPN for benign conditions were reduced or stopped. Based on clinical history the centres reported psychological distress for patients (52, 66.67%) with anxiety, worry, concern and apprehension reported most frequently (37/52, 71.15%) but also fear (10/52, 19.23%), depression (5/52, 9.62%) and issues related to isolation/confinement (12/52, 23.08%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was reported by clinicians to have had a far reaching adverse impact on patients on home parenteral nutrition, especially their safety in terms of provision of PPE, PN bags, available nursing staff and psychological well-being.

Here we describe the post-COVID symptoms of 675 patients followed up using a virtual review pathway, stratified by severity of acute COVID infection. METHODS: COVID-19 survivors completed an online/telephone questionnaire of symptoms after 12+ weeks and a chest radiograph. Dependent on findings at virtual review, patients were provided information leaflets, attended for investigations and/or were reviewed face-to-face. Outcomes were compared between patients following high-risk and low-risk admissions for COVID pneumonia, and community referrals. RESULTS: Patients reviewed after hospitalisation for COVID pneumonia had a median of two ongoing physical health symptoms post-COVID. The most common was fatigue (50.3% of high-risk patients). Symptom burden did not vary significantly by severity of hospitalised COVID pneumonia but was highest in community referrals. Symptoms suggestive of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were common (depression occurred in 24.9% of high-risk patients). Asynchronous virtual review facilitated triage of patients at highest need of face-to-face review. CONCLUSION: Many patients continue to have a significant burden of post-COVID symptoms irrespective of severity of initial pneumonia. How best to assess and manage long COVID will be of major importance over the next few years.","Taylor, Rebecca R; Trivedi, Bhavi; Patel, Neena; Singh, Richa; Ricketts, William M; Elliott, Katharine; Yarwood, Marcus; White, Veronica; Hylton, Hannah; Allen, Ruth; Thomas, Gavin; Kapil, Vikas; McGuckin, Rachel; Pfeffer, Paul E",,481,20

Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour. The message is simple: we need to rethink our current relationship with nature and with ourselves, which should lead to a social transformation towards the sustainable use of the available resources.","Lorenz, Camila; de Oliveira Lage, Mariana; Chiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco",Sci Total Environ,481,16

During an outbreak, we suggest tracing close contacts from both PCR-positive individuals and suspected cases, rather than from suspected cases alone Due to the long period of infectivity before turning PCR positive or developing symptoms, close contacts that had contact with a newly PCR positive case within 4 days should be judged as at risk of being infected;close contacts that had contact within 8 days of a newly symptomatic case should be judged as at risk being infected","Weihua, Cheng Bing Zhao Enfu Chen Guoqian Li Jun Ma Yanling Cui Changxi Xu Yong Cui Bo Shen Mingyu Luo Dapeng Yin Laishun Yao",China CDC Weekly,481,1

The first cases of a form of pneumonia of unknown etiology were detected at the beginning of that month in Wuhan. The virus is believed to have emerged at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market, where transmission of a zoonotic pathogen to humans occurred. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Some studies conducted in China during the epidemic report small numbers of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and some pregnancy complications in patients with COVID-19. However, they fail to document the transplacental passage of the virus from mother to fetus. RESULTS: Following the COVID-19 outbreak, guidelines for couples who are undergoing treatments of assisted reproduction have been issued by the International Federation for Fertility Societies (IFFS), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction (REDLARA). They recommend couples to discuss assisted reproduction with their doctors while those at risk or with SARS-CoV-2 should consider freezing oocytes or embryos and retransferring them later. CONCLUSIONS: Other than the US, Italy is the country with the highest number of cases (197675 positives, 26644 deaths) (updated on April 26). The Italian National Transplant Centre and the Higher Institute of Health advised on March 17 to complete the cycles already started and not to start new cycles.

In December 2019, COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan city, China, and now coronavirus has spread across various nations infecting more than 198 countries. As the cities around China started getting contaminated, the number of cases increased exponentially. As of March 18 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide was more than 250,000, and Asia alone had more than 81,000 cases. The proposed model uses time series analysis to forecast the outbreak of COVID-19 around the world in the upcoming days by using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). We analyze data from February 1 2020 to April 1 2020. The result shows that 120,000 confirmed fatal cases are forecasted using ARIMA by April 1 2020. Moreover, we have also evaluated the total confirmed cases, the total fatal cases, autocorrelation function, and white noise time-series for both confirmed cases and fatalities in the COVID-19 outbreak.","Dansana, Debabrata; Kumar, Raghvendra; Das Adhikari, Janmejoy; Mohapatra, Mans; Sharma, Rohit; Priyadarshini, Ishaani; Le, Dac-Nhuong",Front Public Health,481,8

METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiographic data were collected from members in a three-generation family. Whole exomes were amplified and sequenced for proband. The identified variants were verified in the remaining members. The pathogenicity of candidate variants was predicted using multiple software programmes. A 28-year-old non-consanguineous Chinese woman at 23 weeks' gestation presenting with sustained foetal bradycardia of 100 b.p.m. Immunological disorders and infection were excluded. The infant was delivered at 37 weeks' gestation with 2700-g birthweight. QTc was prolonged in both ECG and Holter recording. Hearing tests confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic testing demonstrated that the infant carried a novel frameshift c.431delC (p.I145Sfs*92) and a novel nonsense c.1175G>A (p.W392X) compound variants of KCNQ1 inherited from mother and father, respectively, in autosomal recessive inheritance. Only relative II-5 carrying heterozygous KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 variant had prolonged QTc, while the other carriers did not have prolonged QT, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance of LQT1 phenotype with incomplete penetrance in the family. CONCLUSION: We report the novel frameshift KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 and nonsense KCNQ1-W392X compound variants in autosomal recessive inheritance that caused JLNS presenting as sustained foetal bradycardia for the first time. Meanwhile, KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 heterozygous variant demonstrated LQT1 phenotype in autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.","Zhang, Yanmin; Li, Xiaomin; Yang, Ying; Wang, Jie; Gao, Xinru; Fan, Mengyun",Europace,481,20

Although Japan eliminated measles in 2015, the number of measles patients has gradually increased since then, and reached 744 in 2019. In the 2010s, Japan experienced two large rubella epidemics, and the majority of the patients were reported in Tokyo and other metropolitan areas. While the transmission of measles and rubella seems to be suppressed during the COVID-19 pandemic, closing the gap in routine childhood vaccination will be challenging in any country. Moreover, supplementary immunization campaigns for adults have also been disrupted, and they must be invigorated.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center U.K. ICU. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation that received a transthoracic echocardiogram between March and December 2020. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Right ventricular dilation was defined as right ventricular:left ventricular end-diastolic area greater than 0.6, right ventricular systolic impairment as fractional area change less than 35%, or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion less than 17 mm. One hundred seventy-two patients were included, 59 years old (interquartile range, 49-67), with mostly moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 101; 59%). Ninety-day mortality was 41% (n = 70): 49% in patients with right ventricular dilation, 53% in right ventricular systolic impairment, and 72% in right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment. The right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment phenotype was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.15-7.60]), but either disease state alone was not. Right ventricular fractional area change correlated with PaO2:FIO2 ratio, PaCO2, chest radiograph opacification, and dynamic compliance, whereas right ventricular:left ventricle end-diastolic area correlated negatively with urine output. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular systolic impairment correlated with pulmonary pathophysiology, whereas right ventricular dilation correlated with renal dysfunction. Right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment was the only right ventricular phenotype that was independently associated with mortality.","Chotalia, Minesh; Ali, Muzzammil; Alderman, Joseph E; Kalla, Manish; Parekh, Dhruv; Bangash, Mansoor N; Patel, Jaimin M",Crit. care med,481,1

The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative model to aid decision-making in liver transplantation for T2 HCC. We proposed a novel ethical framework where the individual transplant benefit for a T2 HCC patient should outweigh the harm to others on the waiting list, determining a ""net benefit"", to define appropriate organ allocation. This ethical framework was then translated into a quantitative Markov model including Italian averages for waiting list characteristics, donor resources, mortality, and transplant rates obtained from a national prospective database (n = 8567 patients). The net benefit of transplantation in a T2 HCC patient in a usual situation varied from 0 life months with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15, to 34 life months with a MELD score of 40, while it progressively decreased with acute organ shortage during a pandemic (i.e., with a 50% decrease in organs, the net benefit varied from 0 life months with MELD 30, to 12 life months with MELD 40).

Telemental health providers (N = 177) completed an online survey between March and May 2019. Most providers (75%) spent less than 25% of their work-week using telemedicine, but 70% reported an intention to use telemedicine more in the future. The belief that telemedicine affords greater access to patients, work-life balance, flexibility in providing care, and the opportunity to be at the forefront of innovative care were significant predictors of intentions to use the technology more in the future. Other significant predictors included needing assistance to coordinate insurance reimbursements, manage a successful telemedicine practice, and integrate the telemedicine program with other health IT software. Findings have important implications for increasing the frequency of telemedicine use among telemental health providers.

This included extracorporeal blood purification devices. This narrative review will give a brief overview regarding some of the extracorporeal devices that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients, including the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter, produced by ExThera Medical (Martinez, CA, USA), first licensed in the European Economic Area in 2019. The Seraph® 100 contains ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene beads with end point-attached heparin and is approved for the reduction of pathogens from the bloodstream either as a single agent or as an adjunct to conventional anti-infective agents. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins have been shown to bind to the immobilized heparin in a similar way to the interaction with heparan sulfate on the cell surface. This binding is nonreversible and as such, the pathogens are removed from the bloodstream. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological basis and rationale for using heparin for pathogen removal from the blood as well as exploring the technology behind the adaptation of heparin to deprive it of its systemic anticoagulant activity. In addition, we summarize the in vitro data as well as the available preclinical testing and published clinical reports. Finally, we discuss the enormous potential of this technology in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance and high mortality associated with sepsis and consider the application of this as a possible treatment option for COVID-19.","Seffer, Malin-Theres; Cottam, Daniel; Forni, Lui G; Kielstein, Jan T",Blood Purif,481,1

Failure to consider the appropriateness of the model can lead to making inferences that are not supported by scientific evidence. The main focus of this article is to find the best statistical distribution in fitting PM2.5 concentrations in the periods of February–June 2018 and February–June 2019 (the periods without COVID-19) and in the period of February–June 2020 (the period with COVID-19) in Jakarta, Indonesia. This article considers making an assessment of the performance of both generalized distributions (e.g., generalized gamma, generalized extreme value, and generalized log-logistic [GLL]) and classical distributions (such as lognormal [LN], gamma, Weibull, log-logistic, and Gumbel) in modeling daily concentrations of PM2.5 in the period of February–June 2020, or the period during which the COVID-19 pandemic is present, in Jakarta. For comparison purposes, this study also analyzed PM2.5 concentrations in the periods of February–June 2018 and February–June 2019. The comparative evaluation of the models of each period of data uses graphical analyses and goodness-of-fit statistics. The results of applications indicate that the generalized distributions fit the data better than do the classical distributions. Particularly, compared with the classical distributions, including the LN model, the GLL distribution is the most appropriate model in fitting PM2.5 concentrations in the periods without and during the period with COVID-19 in Jakarta, Indonesia. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Warsono, W.; Antonio, Y.; Yuwono, S.

Sometimes, the lack of suppliers and the global shortage of these reagents, a consequence of the high demand, make it difficult to detect and diagnose patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting the control of virus spread. Many alternatives have enabled the continuous processing of samples and have presented a decrease in time and cost. These measures thus allow broad testing of the population and should be ideal for controlling the disease. In this sense, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection effectiveness by Real time RT-PCR using two different protocols for RNA extraction. The experiments were conducted in the National Institute of Health (INS) from Peru. We compared Ct values average (experimental triplicate) results from two different targets, a viral and internal control. All samples were extracted in parallel using a commercial kit and our alternative protocol-samples submitted to proteinase K treatment (3 µg/µL, 56°C for 10 minutes) followed by thermal shock (98°C for 5 minutes followed by 4°C for 2 minutes); the agreement between results was 100% in the samples tested. In addition, we compared the COVID-19 positivity between six epidemiological weeks: the initial two in that the Real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted using RNA extracted by commercial kit, followed by two other using RNA obtained by our kit-free method, and the last two using kit once again; they did not differ significantly. We concluded that our in-house method is an easy, fast, and cost-effective alternative method for extracting RNA and conducing molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.","Ñique, Adolfo Marcelo; Coronado-Marquina, Fiorella; Mendez Rico, Jairo Andrés; García Mendoza, María Paquita; Rojas-Serrano, Nancy; Simas, Paulo Vitor Marques; Cabezas Sanchez, Cesar; Drexler, Jan Felix",PLoS One,481,29

This may be in part due to an uncontrolled immune-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering a systemic hyperinflammatory response, the so-called ""cytokine storm"". The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2. While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a unique visceral fat, presents with high degree of inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease. Whether and how adipose tissue may respond to the COVID-19 therapies is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the difference in computed tomography (CT) measured EAT and subcutaneous (SAT) attenuation, defined as mean attenuation expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), in 72 patients [mean±SD age was 59.6±12.4 years, 50 (69%) were men] at the hospital admission for COVID-19 and 99 days [IQR (71-129)] after discharge. RESULTS: At the admission, EAT HU was significantly correlated with blood glucose levels, interleukin 6 , troponin T levels and waist circumference. EAT HU decreased from -87.21±16.18 to -100.0±11 (p<0.001) whereas SAT HU did not change (-110.21±12.1 to -111.11±27.82, p=0.78) after therapy.

Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels; T-cell proportion; and related gene expression occurring in patients with COVID-19 on admission and after initial treatment. METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a decreased T-cell proportion with downregulated gene expression related to T-cell activation and differentiation occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Ouyang, Yabo; Yin, Jiming; Wang, Wenjing; Shi, Hongbo; Shi, Ying; Xu, Bin; Qiao, Luxin; Feng, Yingmei; Pang, Lijun; Wei, Feili; Guo, Xianghua; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi",Clin Infect Dis,481,14

Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection.

Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have drawn particular attention due to their (i) high melting points and excellent softening-resistance, which are the two key requirements for high-temperature applications; and (ii) compositional space, which is immense even after considering cost and recyclability restrictions. However, RHEAs also exhibit intrinsic brittleness and oxidation-susceptibility, which remain as significant challenges for their processing and application. Here, utilizing natural-mixing characteristics amongst refractory elements, we designed a Ti38V15Nb23Hf24 RHEA that exhibits>20% tensile ductility already at the as-cast state, and physicochemical stability at high-temperatures. Exploring the underlying deformation mechanisms across multiple length-scales, we observe that a rare beta prime precipitation strengthening mechanism governs its intriguing mechanical response. These results also reveal the effectiveness of natural-mixing tendencies in expediting HEA discovery.","Wei, Shaolou; Kim, Sang Jun; Kang, Ji Yun; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Yongjie; Furuhara, Tadashi; Park, Eun Soo; Tasan, Cemal Cem",,481,16

We report the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term course of OCD. A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n = 240) who were on regular follow-up at a tertiary care specialty OCD clinic in India were assessed telephonically, about 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic (""pandemic"" cohort). Data from the medical records of an independent set of patients with OCD (n = 207) who were followed up during the same period, 1 year prior, was used for comparison (historical controls). The pandemic group and historical controls did not differ in the trajectories of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores (chi-square likelihood ratio test of the group × time interaction = 2.73, p = 0.255) and relapse rate (21% vs. 20%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.59; p = 0.535). Preexisting contamination symptoms and COVID-19-related health anxiety measured by the COVID-Threat Scale did not predict relapse.

To contain the disease, an effective early warning system that predicts the locations of outbreaks is of crucial importance. Studies have shown the effectiveness of using large-scale mobility data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., lockdowns) through population density analysis. However, predicting the locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user identifiers (>450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand. More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in Tokyo, Japan. We show that by integrating COVID-19 related web search query analytics with social contact networks, we are able to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations 1-2 weeks beforehand, compared to just using social contact indexes or web search data analysis. This study proposes a novel method that can be used in early warning systems for disease outbreak hotspots, which can assist government agencies to prepare effective strategies to prevent further disease spread.","Yabe, Takahiro; Tsubouchi, Kota; Ukkusuri, Satish V",,481,32

People have already started to live wearing masks, keeping a safe distance from others and maintaining a high level of hygiene. This paper deals with an in-depth analysis of riskness associated with COVID-19 infections in Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) at the sub-city (ward) level. Attempts have been made to identify the areas with high or low risk of infections using GIS-based geostatistical approach. Cosine Similarity Index has been used to rank different wards of KMC according to the degree of riskness. Four indices were computed to address intervention objectives and to determine 'Optimized Prevention Rank' of wards for future policy decisions. The highest risk areas were located in the eastern and western part of the city, to a great extent overlapped with wards containing larger share of population living in slums and/or below poverty level. While, highly infected areas lie in central Kolkata and in several wards at the eastern and northeastern periphery of the KMC. The 'Optimized Prevention Rank' have indicated that the lack of social awareness along with lack of social distancing and high susceptibility have contributed to the increasing number of containments of COVID-19 cases. The rankings of the wards would no doubt provide the policy makers a basis to control further spread of the disease or delay a second wave.

(Special Issue: COVID-19 data.)",15.661747,3.4024253,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, reductions of hospital admissions with a focus on emergencies have been observed for several medical and surgical conditions, while trend data during later stages of the pandemic are scarce. Consequently, this study aims to provide up-to-date hospitalization trends for several conditions including cardiovascular, psychiatry, oncology and surgery cases in both the in- and outpatient setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using claims data of 86 Helios hospitals in Germany, consecutive cases with an in- or outpatient hospital admission between March 13, 2020 (the begin of the ""protection"" stage of the German pandemic plan) and December 10, 2020 (end of study period) were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2019. Cause-specific hospitalizations were defined based on the primary discharge diagnosis according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) or German procedure classification codes for cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatry and surgery cases. Cumulative hospitalization deficit was computed as the difference between the expected and observed cumulative admission number for every week in the study period, expressed as a percentage of the cumulative expected number. The expected admission number was defined as the weekly average during the control period. A total of 1,493,915 hospital admissions (723,364 during the study and 770,551 during the control period) were included. At the end of the study period, total cumulative hospitalization deficit was -10% [95% confidence interval -10; -10] for cardiovascular and -9% [-10; -9] for surgical cases, higher than -4% [-4; -3] in psychiatry and 4% [4; 4] in oncology cases. The utilization of inpatient care and subsequent hospitalization deficit was similar in trend with some variation in magnitude between cardiovascular (-12% [-13; -12]), psychiatry (-18% [-19; -17]), oncology (-7% [-8; -7]) and surgery cases (-11% [-11; -11]). Similarly, cardiovascular and surgical outpatient cases had a deficit of -5% [-6; -5] and -3% [-4; -3], respectively. This was in contrast to psychiatry (2% [1; 2]) and oncology cases (21% [20; 21]) that had a surplus in the outpatient sector. While in-hospital mortality, was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular (3.9 vs. 3.5%, OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06-1.15], P<0.01) and in oncology cases (4.5 vs. 4.3%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11], P<0.01), it was similar in surgical (0.9 vs. 0.8%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.13], P = 0.07) and in psychiatry cases (0.4 vs. 0.5%, OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.78-1.31], P<0.95). CONCLUSIONS: There have been varying changes in care pathways and in-hospital mortality in different disciplines during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. Despite all the inherent and well-known limitations of claims data use, this data may be used for health care surveillance as the pandemic continues worldwide. While this study provides an up-to-date analysis of utilization of hospital care in the largest German hospital network, short- and long-term consequences are unknown and deserve further studies.","Bollmann, Andreas; Hohenstein, Sven; Pellissier, Vincent; Stengler, Katharina; Reichardt, Peter; Ritz, Jörg-Peter; Thiele, Holger; Borger, Michael A; Hindricks, Gerhard; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf",PLoS One,481,16

AIM: To explore the views and experiences of Twitter social media users who reported that a relative, friend or acquaintance died of COVID-19 without a family member/friend present. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis of English-language tweets. DATA SOURCES: Twitter data collected 7-20th April 2020. A bespoke software system harvested selected publicly-available tweets from the Twitter application programming interface. After filtering we hand-screened tweets to include only those referring to a relative, friend or acquaintance who died alone of COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: 9328 tweets were hand-screened; 196 were included. Twitter users expressed sadness, despair, hopelessness and anger about their experience and loss. Saying goodbye via video-conferencing technology was viewed ambivalently. Clinicians' presence during a death was little consolation. Anger, frustration and blame were directed at governments' inaction/policies or the public. The sadness of not being able to say goodbye as wished was compounded by lack of social support and disrupted after-death rituals. Users expressed a sense of political neglect/mistreatment alongside calls for action. They also used the platform to reinforce public health messages, express condolences and pay tribute. CONCLUSION: Twitter was used for collective mourning and support and to promote public health messaging. End-of-life care providers should facilitate and optimise contact with loved ones, even when strict visitation policies are necessary, and provide proactive bereavement support.","Selman, Lucy E; Chamberlain, Charlotte; Sowden, Ryann; Chao, Davina; Selman, Daniel; Taubert, Mark; Braude, Philip",Palliat Med,481,20

Here, using Sentinel-2A data, we quantified impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality parameters in one of the largest perennial creeks i.e., the Buddha Nala located in District Ludhiana in India. This creek has long been considered as a dumping ground for industrial wastes and has resulted in surface and ground water pollution in the entire lower Indus Basin. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), Nitrogen Content Index (NI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) were compared prior (2019) and during (2020) lockdown in the creek. There was a significant enhancement in NDVI, NDWI, NDCI, and NI values, and reduction in NDTI and TSM values during the lockdown period. When compared with prior year (2019), the values of indices suggested an improvement in water quality and an indicative change in aquatic ecology in the creek. The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the improvement in water quality of Buddha Nala was more evident in the upstream and downstream sections than the middle section. This is intriguing since the middle section of the creek was continually impacted by domestic household effluents. The earth observation inspired methodology employed and findings are testament to the discriminatory power to employ remote sensing data and to develop protocols to monitor water quality in regions where routine surveillance of water remains cost prohibitive.","Das, Susanta Kaur Samanpreet Jutla Antarpreet",Water,481,21

In this study we sought to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of HCWs in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted this observational cohort study from April 14-May 13, 2020 in a pediatric ED in Orange County, CA. Asymptomatic HCW &#8805;18 years of age were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained by fingerstick at the start of each shift. The inter-sampling interval was &#8804;96 hours. The primary outcome was positive seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 as determined with an antibody fast detection kit (Colloidal Gold, Superbio, Timisoara, Romania) for the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) antibody. RESULTS: A total of 143 HCWs participated in the study. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 10.5% (n = 15). Positive seroprevalence was classified as IgG only (4.9%), IgM+IgG (3.5%), or IgM only (2.1%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in 0.7% of the overall study population (n = 1). Samples obtained on Day 1 indicated seropositivity in 4.2% of the study population (n = 6). Subsequent seroconversion occurred in 6.3% of participants (n = 9). The rate of seroconversion was linear with a rate of approximately one new case every two days, starting at Day 9 of the study. CONCLUSION: We observed a linear rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2-positive status among asymptomatic HCWs who underwent daily symptom surveys and temperature screens in an environment with universal source control. Rapid antibody testing may be useful for screening for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in high-risk populations, such as HCWs in the ED.","Heyming, Theodore W; Sanger, Terence; Tongol, Aprille; Schomberg, John; Bacon, Kellie; Lara, Bryan",West J Emerg Med,481,16

It was developed in response to requests by epidemiologists for portable real time assessment of the effect of COVID-19 on other causes of death and all-cause mortality. This is performed by comparing 2020 real time values with observations from the same week in the previous 5 years, and by enabling the extraction of temporal snapshots of mortality series that facilitate modeling the interdependence between its causes. RESULTS: Our solution employs a scalable ""Data Commons at Web Scale"" approach that abstracts all stages of the data cycle as in-browser components. Specifically, the data wrangling computation, not just the orchestration of data retrieval, takes place in the browser, without any requirement to download or install software. This approach, where operations that would normally be computed server-side are maped to in-browser SDKs, is sometimes loosely described as Web APIs, a designation adopted here.

Mouthwash fluid has been reported as an alternative to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We compared mouthwash fluid with a combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab regarding test performance. METHODS: In a large refugee facility, we retested individuals with a previous positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and their quarantined close contacts. All individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 s) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800® system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Of 76 individuals, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 of 76 (17%) infections, but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

We investigated the costs and efficiency of HIV services in relation to HIV testing yield in rural Karonga District, Malawi. METHODS: Costs of HIV services were measured over 12 months to September 2017 in five health facilities, drawing on recognised health costing principles. Financial and economic costs were collected in Malawi Kwacha and United States Dollars (US$). Costs were calculated using a provider perspective to estimate average annual costs (2017 US$) per HIV testing episode, per HIV-positive case diagnosed, and per patient-year on antiretroviral therapy (ART), by facility. Costs were assessed in relation to scale of operation and facility-level annual HIV positivity rate. A one-way sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand how staffing levels and the HIV positivity rate affected HIV testing costs. RESULTS: HIV testing episodes per day and per full-time equivalent HIV health worker averaged 3.3 (range 2.0 to 5.7). The HIV positivity rate averaged 2.4% (range 1.9 to 3.7%). The average cost per testing episode was US$2.85 (range US$1.95 to US$8.55), and the average cost per HIV diagnosis was US$116.35 (range US$77.42 to US$234.11), with the highest costs found in facilities with the lowest daily number of tests and lowest HIV yield respectively. The mean facility-level cost per patient-year on ART was approximately US$100 (range US$90.67 to US$115.42). ART drugs were the largest cost component averaging 71% (range 55 to 76%). The cost per patient-year of viral load tests averaged US$4.50 (range US$0.52 to US$7.00) with cost variation reflecting differences in the tests to ART patient ratio across facilities. CONCLUSION: Greater efficiencies in HIV service delivery are possible in Karonga through increasing daily testing episodes among existing health workers or allocating health workers to tasks in addition to testing. Costs per diagnosis will increase as yields decline, and therefore, encouraging targeted testing strategies that increase yield will be more efficient. Given the contribution of drug costs to per patient-year treatment costs, it is critical to preserve the life-span of first-line ART regimens, underlining the need for continuing adherence support and regular viral load monitoring.","Vyas, Seema; Songo, John; Guinness, Lorna; Dube, Albert; Geis, Steffen; Kalua, Thokozani; Todd, Jim; Renju, Jenny; Crampin, Amelia; Wringe, Alison",BMC Health Serv Res,481,25

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective, multicentre cohort study performed at 24 hospitals in Jiangsu, China. PARTICIPANTS: 625 patients with COVID-19 enrolled between 10 January and 15 March 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 (52.6%) men), 37 (5.9%) were children (18 years or younger), 261 (41.8%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years) and 79 (12.6%) elderly adults (65 years or older). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, p<0.0001, p=0.0003, p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Fever, cough and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared with children (&#967;2 test, p=0.0008, 0.0146 and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both p<0.0001). Older patients had many significantly different laboratory parameters from younger patients. Elderly patients had the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0%, &#967;2 test p<0.0001), intensive care unit use (35.4%, &#967;2 test p<0.0001), respiratory failure (31.6%, &#967;2 test p<0.0001) and the longest hospital stay (median 21 days, Kruskal-Wallis test p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly (&#8805;65 years) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to their having a higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.","Luo, Huanyuan; Liu, Songqiao; Wang, Yuancheng; Phillips-Howard, Penelope A; Ju, Shenghong; Yang, Yi; Wang, Duolao",BMJ Open,481,6

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. It was conducted using an electronic format survey through Qualtrics Survey Software in English. The target participants were HCPs working in any healthcare setting across Iraq. The survey was distributed via two professional Facebook groups between 7 April and 7 May 2020. The survey items were adopted with modifications from three previous studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza Outbreak. Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine the difference in the pandemic impact according to the dealing with COVID-19 cases. KEY FINDINGS: The authors received 430 surveys from HCPs representing 14 provinces. Approximately 60% of the participants were dealing with diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 cases. More than 80% perceived high risk of infection and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 85.9% of the HCPs had concerns of putting family and close friends at risk due to their job during the COVID-19 crisis. HCPs working in a setting dealing with diagnosis/treatment of COVID-19 cases experienced significantly higher concerns about personal and family safety compared with other HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: Working during COVID-19 pandemic has several negative impacts on HCPs including mental and physical health and an overwhelming work environment. Thus, social and emotional support is needed to help HCPs to cope with such stressful conditions. Finally, providing adequate PPE can help to minimise concerns of getting infected in the workplace.","Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Fatlawi, Bashar G; Al-Jalehawi, Ahmad K; Al-Hamadani, Fadya Yaqoob; Alsawad, Oday Sajjad",International journal of pharmacy practice (Online),481,1

The purpose of this study was to assess persistence with osteoporosis treatment in patients from the FLS over a period of 1 year, and to determine predictors of discontinuation. METHODS: The study population comprised adults of both genders, aged 50 or over, admitted to Lille University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 for a low-trauma fracture and managed in our FLS. Outcomes included (1) persistence rate at 1 year after treatment initiation, (2) persistence rate at 2 years after treatment initiation, (3) persistence rate at 1 and 2 years after treatment initiation according to type of treatment, (4) predictors of non-persistence, and (5) reasons for discontinuing treatment over 1 year after initiation. Persistence was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In all, 1,224 patients (&#8805; 50 years old) with a recent history of low-trauma fracture (&#8804; 12 months) were identified. Of these, 380 patients - 79.2% female; mean (SD) age 76 (11) years - were seen at the FLS. In those 380 patients, 410 fractures were found and 360 of them (87.8%) were major fractures, breaking down as follows: vertebra (44%), hip (19%), proximal humerus (10%), and pelvis (8%). Osteoporosis treatment was prescribed for 367 (96.6%) patients and 275 of them began the prescribed treatment. The following anti-osteoporosis drugs were prescribed: zoledronic acid (n=150, 54.5%), teriparatide (n=63, 22.9%), and denosumab (n=39, 14.2%). Oral bisphosphonates were prescribed for a few patients (n=23, 8.4%). Persistence with osteoporosis medication (any class) was estimated at 84.1% (95% CI: 79.1% to 88.1%) at 12-month follow-up, and dropped to 70.3% (95% CI: 63.7% to 75.9%) at 24 months. When drug-specific analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, persistence rates at 12 and 24 months were found to be higher with denosumab than with any other treatment. Independent predictors of non-persistence at 12 months were 'follow-up performed by a general practitioner (GP)' - Odds Ratio (OR) for GP vs. FLS = 3.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 8.90, p=0.004 - and 'treatment with zoledronic acid' - OR for zoledronic acid vs. denosumab = 3.39; 95% CI, 1.21 to 9.50, p=0.019; OR for zoledronic acid vs. teriparatide = 8.86; 95% CI, 1.15 to 68.10, p=0.035. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the success of our FLS in terms of long-term persistence with osteoporosis treatments. However, osteoporosis treatment initiation still needs to be improved.","Anthony, Delbar; Arnaud, Pflimlin; Isabelle, Delabrière; Camille, Ternynck; Christophe, Chantelot; François, Puisieux; Bernard, Cortet; Julien, Paccou",Bone,481,1

This paper evaluates the design and progress of the report to mid 2020, but with some reflection on the new COVID 19 era, particularly as it relates to the expansion of entitlements to achieve UHC. The authors explore how close Sláintecare is to the UHC ideal. They also review the phased strategy of implementation in Sláintecare that utilises a systems-thinking approach with interlinkages between entitlements, funding, capacity and implementation. Finally the authors review the Sláintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Sláintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.","Thomas, Steve; Johnston, Bridget; Barry, Sarah; Siersbaek, Rikke; Burke, Sara",Health Policy,481,16

Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.","Sankaranarayanan, Sreecharan; Kandimalla, Siddharth Reddy; Cao, Mengxin; Maronna, Ignacio; An, Haokang; Bogart, Chris; Murray, R.

The study clarifies and systematizes the views of a wide range of researchers who have developed their own approaches to studying the topical problems of implementing the stakeholder model of corporate governance under crisis. The theory of corporate governance and its stakeholder model constitute the methodological basis of the study. The methods of generalization, grouping, systematization and content analysis are used. The information base includes 85 studies published from 1980 to 2021 and indexed in the international and local databases, as well as fundamental scientific works reflecting the basic provisions of the scientific review article. The current research presents the evolution of views on the development of the stakeholder model, while focusing on the practical aspects of its application. The concept of shared value creation and its progress in numerous studies is seen as an extension of stakeholder theory and an attempt to transform capitalism according to the principles of ""stakeholder capitalism"". The findings of the given scientific review can serve as a theoretical platform for further examination of the stakeholder model of corporate governance in the context of new paradigm declaration concentrated on creating value for stakeholders and the real implementation of responsible business behavior in the context of a pandemic and post-pandemic economy.","Tkachenko, I.

Due to the very low ion currents, and thus, limited by the instrumentation of the 1960s, it took some time for the, by then, new technique to become adopted for analytical applications. In FI-MS, volatile or at least vaporizable samples mainly deliver molecular ions, and consequently, mass spectra showing no or at least minor numbers of fragment ion signals. The next major breakthrough was achieved by overcoming the need to evaporate the analyte prior to ionization. This was accomplished in the early 1970s by simply depositing the samples onto the field emitter and led to field desorption-mass spectrometry (FD-MS). With FD-MS, a desorption ionization method had become available that paved the road to the mass spectral analysis of larger molecules of low to high polarity and even of organic salts. In FD-MS, all of these analytes deliver spectra with no or at least few fragment ion peaks. The last milestone was the development of liquid injection field desorption/ionization (LIFDI) in the early 2000s that allows for sample deposition under the exclusion of atmospheric oxygen and water. In addition to sampling under inert conditions, LIFDI also enables more robust and quicker operation than classical FI-MS and FD-MS procedures. The development and applications of FI, FD, and LIFDI had mutual interference with the mass analyzers that were used in combination with these methods. Vice versa, the demand for using these techniques on other than magnetic sector instruments has effectuated their adaptation to different types of modern mass analyzers. The journey started with magnetic sector instruments, almost skipped quadrupole analyzers, encompassed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oaTOF) analyzers, and finally arrived at Orbitraps. Even interfaces for continuous-flow LIFDI have been realized. Even though being niche techniques to some degree, one may be confident that FI, FD, and LIFDI have a promising future ahead of them. This Account takes you on the journey from principles and applications of the title methods to a glimpse into the future.","Gross, Jürgen H",Eur J Mass Spectrom (Chichester),481,1

For planets with primordial hydrogen and helium-rich envelopes, this can lead to substantial mass loss. Direct observations of atmospheric escape in young planetary systems can help elucidate this critical stage of planetary evolution. In this work, we search for metastable helium absorption---a tracer of tenuous gas in escaping atmospheres---during transits of three planets orbiting the young solar analogue V1298 Tau. We characterize the stellar helium line using HET/HPF, and find that it evolves substantially on timescales of days to months. The line is stable on hour-long timescales except for one set of spectra taken during the decay phase of a stellar flare, where absoprtion increased with time. Utilizing a beam-shaping diffuser and a narrowband filter centered on the helium feature, we observe four transits with Palomar/WIRC: two partial transits of planet d ($P = 12.4$ days), one partial transit of planet b ($P = 24.1$ days), and one full transit of planet c ($P = 8.2$ days). We do not detect the transit of planet c, and we find no evidence of excess absorption for planet b, with $\Delta R_\mathrm{b}/R_\star<0.019$ in our bandpass. We find a tentative absorption signal for planet d with $\Delta R_\mathrm{d}/R_\star = 0.0205\pm0.054$, but the best-fit model requires a substantial (-100$\pm$14 min) transit-timing offset on a two-month timescale. Nevertheless, our data suggest that V1298 Tau d may have a high present-day mass-loss rate, making it a priority target for follow-up observations.","Vissapragada, Shreyas; Stef'ansson, Gudhmundur; Greklek-McKeon, Michael; Oklopcic, Antonija; Knutson, Heather A.; Ninan, Joe P.; Mahadevan, Suvrath; Canas, Caleb I.; Chachan, Yayaati; Cochran, William D.; Collins, Karen A.; Dai, Fei; David, Trevor J.; Halverson, Samuel; Hawley, Suzanne L.; Hebb, Leslie; Kanodia, Shubham; Kowalski, Adam F.; Livingston, John H.; Maney, Marissa; Metcalf, Andrew J.; Morley, Caroline; Ramsey, Lawrence W.; Robertson, Paul; Roy, Arpita; Spake, Jessica; Schwab, Christian; Terrien, Ryan C.; Tinyanont, Samaporn; Vasisht, Gautam; Wisniewski, John",,481,19

This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. METHODS: We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. RESULTS: Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Basu, Arindam; Kuziemsky, Craig; de Araújo Novaes, Magdala; Kleber, Araujo; Sales, Fernando; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb; Flórez-Arango, José F; Gogia, Shashi B; Ho, Kendall; Hunter, Inga; Iyengar, Sriram; John, Oommen; John, Sheila; Kulatunga, Gumindu; Rajput, Vije Kumar; Ranatunga, Prasad; Udayasankaran, Jai Ganesh",Yearb. med. inform.

This article aims to present a proposal, based on the principles of clinical governance, health management and information technology (IT), and to respond to the need for a structured organization model for post-acute COVID-19 rehabilitation. The authors present a regional-based model of a network of clinicians and healthcare managers using a dedicated IT platform to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency objectives, to ensure coordination of the available resources and the most appropriate rehabilitative treatment for patients. The proposed post-acute COVID-19 rehabilitation network has been designed according to the model of a clinical management project within the Italian national healthcare system, and its context is an easily adjustable model for the European healthcare systems. The authors base the project on current laws and scientific guidelines in rehabilitation in Italy and in Europe and use the SWOT analysis technique to assess the proposal feasibility. The primary aims of the project are: (1) standardizing the minimum assessment tools of post-COVID-19 patients with disabilities; (2) ensuring an individual rehabilitation project for each patient with international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) coding and (3) reporting the activity performance with appropriate indicators. The secondary aims are: (1) developing educational programs for patients and care givers also aimed at acquiring better empowerment and positive behavior; (2) creating a regional database for data collection and (3) improving IT, and specifically tele-rehabilitation, as a suitable approach during the COVID-19 emergency and also in the future. Expected results are: continuum of care; effectiveness, efficacy and appropriateness in the delivery of rehabilitation treatments through a standardized minimum assessment and the wording of the individual rehabilitation project and a precise reporting of performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of clinical activities and the satisfaction of patients and caregivers. The assessment of results will be analyzed at three and six months to implement corrective actions according to the concept of continuous improvement of the Deming cycle. The IT remote approach allows the patient to meet the needs of proximity of care and empowerment, and, at the same time, to contain the spread of infection. This project could have a significant healthcare impact ensuring a more efficient and effective management of the demand of rehabilitation post-acute COVID-19, expanding the professional skills of the rehabilitation team members, improving both clinical and process data, in addition to optimal allocation of available economic resources.","Pinto, Monica; Gimigliano, Francesca; De Simone, Stefania; Costa, Massimo; Bianchi, Attilio A M; Iolascon, Giovanni",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),481,17

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on French undergraduate students and teachers, to identify practice changes, and to evaluate successes and areas for improvement of this remote learning experience. Data from 2 online questionnaires were analyzed with 509 participants among students and 189 among teachers from Sorbonne University. Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning. Nevertheless, both students and teachers agreed to replace classical lectures by digital media and to promote in-person teaching in small interactive groups. This paper shares tips for faculty rapidly establishing remote learning. This comparative study of the students' and teachers' points of view underlines that new medical curricula should include more digital contents. We make recommendations regarding general university organization, equipment, and curricular development for long-term implementation of digital resources with reinforced relationships between faculty and students.","Vatier, Camille; Carrié, Alain; Renaud, Marie-Christine; Simon-Tillaux, Noémie; Hertig, Alexandre; Jéru, Isabelle",Adv Physiol Educ,481,16

The aim of this report is to compare orthopaedic fracture frequencies in this period, when the walk was limited at the home mostly, with those during the same part in the previous year with regular state, thus to examine staying at home as a factor influencing the frequency of different fracture types. METHODS: There were 86 patients during the state of emergency in year 2020 and 106 patients during the same part of year 2019 with a regular state, having orthopaedic trauma surgery. Number of fractures, gender distribution, and age of patients have been compared between these periods. RESULTS: Total number of fractures decreased for about 19% during the state of emergency. There was nonsignificant difference in fracture frequency for all skeletal areas (p > 0.05), except for distal femoral fractures which occurred more often during the state of emergency (p < 0.05). Female ratio was higher during state of emergency than in regular state for femoral neck fractures. CONCLUSION: Restricted going outside the home for 54 days has the influence in total number of fractures and gender distribution in femoral neck fractures. The method of external fixation used could be assumed as a reducing factor of intraoperative virus pandemic propagation among medical staff.","Mitkovic, Milan M; Bumbasirevic, Marko; Milenkovic, Sasa; Gajdobranski, Djordje; Bumbasirevic, Vojislav; Mitkovic, Milorad B",Int. orthop,481,16

The goal of this study was to develop models that predict outcome using parameters collected at admission to the hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of COVID-19 patients at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China. Forty-three demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters collected at admission plus discharge/death status, days from COVID-19 symptoms onset and days of hospitalization were analyzed. From 157 patients, 120 were discharged and 37 died. Pearson correlations showed that hypertension and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with death and respiratory distress parameters. A penalized logistic regression model efficiently predicts the probability of death with 13 of 43 variables. A regularized Cox regression model predicts the probability of survival with 7 of above 13 variables. SBP but not hypertension was a covariate in both mortality and survival prediction models. SBP was elevated in deceased compared to discharged COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using an unbiased approach, we developed models predicting outcome of COVID-19 patients based on data available at hospital admission. This can contribute to evidence-based risk prediction and appropriate decision-making at hospital triage to provide the most appropriate care and ensure the best patient outcome. High SBP, a cause of end-organ damage and an important comorbid factor, was identified as a covariate in both mortality and survival prediction models.","Caillon, Antoine; Zhao, Kaiqiong; Klein, Kathleen Oros; Greenwood, Celia; Lu, Zhibing; Paradis, Pierre; Schiffrin, Ernesto L",Am. j. hypertens,481,26

To identify those who develop pulmonary embolism with D-dimer levels by evaluating pulmonary CT angiographies of patients who are followed up with suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. Patients who were followed up in a community hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 and underwent Pulmonary CT angiography examination were evaluated. Clinical and demographic parameters and D-Dimer values for patients with and without pulmonary embolism were evaluated in the pulmonary CT angiogram. Results. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Thorax CT examination was performed in our center for suspicion or follow-up of COVID-19 infection in 3396 patients. Pulmonary CT angiography was applied to 312 (9.2%) of these cases. Of these 312 patients, 141 were identified as COVID-19 patients. Acute pulmonary embolism was detected in 33 (23.4%) of 141 patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary CT angiogram. D-dimer levels (5964.97 +/- 4036.8 mu g/L) of patients with COVID-19 infection and pulmonary embolism were significantly higher than D-dimer levels (972.4 +/- 1766.8 mu g/L) of patients without pulmonary embolism. In patients with COVID-19 infection, a D-dimer value higher than 1013 mu g/L was determined as a cut-off value with 100% sensitivity for the presence of pulmonary embolism. Conclusions. For those struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, pulmonary embolism should be kept in mind if D-dimer values increase more than expected in the presence of respiratory distress that Thorax CT findings cannot explain.","Ahmet, V.; Nedim, K.

CHRFAM7A, a uniquely human fusion gene, is a negative regulator of &#945;7 nAChR and was unaccounted for in preclinical models. METHODS: Molecular methods: Function of CHRFAM7A alleles was studied in vitro in two disease relevant phenotypic readouts: electrophysiology and Aß uptake. Genome edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were used as a model system with the human context. Double blind pharmacogenetic study: We performed double-blind pharmacogenetic analysis on the effect of AChEI therapy based on CHRFAM7A carrier status in two paradigms: response to drug initiation and DMT effect. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used as outcome measure. Change in MMSE score from baseline was compared by 2-tailed T-test. Longitudinal analysis of clinical outcome (MMSE) was performed using a fitted general linear model, based on an assumed autoregressive covariance structure. Model independent variables included age, sex, and medication regimen at the time of the first utilized outcome measure (AChEI alone or AChEI plus memantine), APOE4 carrier status (0, 1 or 2 alleles as categorical variables) and CHRFAM7A genotype. FINDINGS: The direct and inverted alleles have distinct phenotypes. Functional CHRFAM7A allele classifies the population as 25% non-carriers and 75% carriers. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models &#945;7 nAChR mediated Aß neurotoxicity. Pharmacological readout translates into both first exposure (pâ¯=â¯0.037) and disease modifying effect (pâ¯=â¯0.0048) in two double blind pharmacogenetic studies. INTERPRETATION: CHRFAM7A accounts for the translational gap in cholinergic strategies in AD. Clinical trials not accounting for this uniquely human genetic factor may have rejected drug candidates that would benefit 25% of AD. Reanalyses of the completed trials using this pharmacogenetic paradigm may identify effective therapy.","Szigeti, Kinga; Ihnatovych, Ivanna; Birkaya, Barbara; Chen, Ziqiang; Ouf, Aya; Indurthi, Dinesh C; Bard, Jonathan E; Kann, Julien; Adams, Alexandrea; Chaves, Lee; Sule, Norbert; Reisch, Joan S; Pavlik, Valory; Benedict, Ralph H B; Auerbach, Anthony; Wilding, Gregory",EBioMedicine,481,10

Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group). Main Outcomes and Measures: Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization. Cellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses. Results: Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point. Binding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively. By day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization. On day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups. A variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced. Conclusion and Relevance: In this phase 1 study, a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced rapid binding and neutralization antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses.

In these markets, bats and wild animals are frequently sold and stored in close contact. During several of the world's past pandemics, bats were essential to the spread of zoonotic diseases from bat to another animal or to humans directly. Live animal markets create the perfect conditions for novel viruses such as COVID-19 to emerge. This paper suggests that to prevent future pandemics, the sale of exotic animals be banned at wet markets. It also advocates for the integration of the analysis of illicit trade with the study of zoonotic disease transmission and pandemics.","Aguirre, A Alonso; Catherina, Richard; Frye, Hailey; Shelley, Louise",,481,21

Disease transmission may be modeled as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments and has assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment to another. Usually, they are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in time. A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model. However, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. In this work, we extend the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of partial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who return from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. We implement the whole model in \texttt{libMesh}, an open finite element library that provides a framework for multiphysics, considering adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We verify our model with standard SEIRD models and show several examples highlighting the present model's new capabilities.","Grave, Mal'u; Coutinho, Alvaro L. G. A.",,481,17

The impact on their participation in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep) is unknown. This international longitudinal study compared young children's movement behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Parents of children aged 3-5 years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in movement behaviours and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12 months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). Physical activity (PA), sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent survey. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Compliance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Global guidelines for PA (180 min/day [&#8805;60 min moderate- vigorous PA]), SST (&#8804;1 h/day) and sleep (10-13 h/day) for children under 5 years of age, was determined. RESULTS: Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] = 2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjOR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjOR = 3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not. Children of parents with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (AdjOR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.3,0.9). CONCLUSION: PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs. Ensuring children can access an outdoor space, and supporting parents' mental health are important prerequisites for enabling pre-schoolers to practice healthy movement behaviours and meet the Global guidelines.","Okely, Anthony D; Kariippanon, Katharina E; Guan, Hongyan; Taylor, Ellie K; Suesse, Thomas; Cross, Penny L; Chong, Kar Hau; Suherman, Adang; Turab, Ali; Staiano, Amanda E; Ha, Amy S; El Hamdouchi, Asmaa; Baig, Aqsa; Poh, Bee Koon; Del Pozo-Cruz, Borja; Chan, Cecilia H S; Nyström, Christine Delisle; Koh, Denise; Webster, E Kipling; Lubree, Himangi; Tang, Hong Kim; Baddou, Issad; Del Pozo-Cruz, Jesus; Wong, Jyh Eiin; Sultoni, Kuston; Nacher, Maria; Löf, Marie; Cui, Mingming; Hossain, Mohammad Sorowar; Chathurangana, P W Prasad; Kand, Uddhavi; Wickramasinghe, V P Pujitha; Calleia, Rebecca; Ferdous, Shameema; Van Kim, Thanh; Wang, Xiaojuan; Draper, Catherine E",BMC Public Health,481,17

The near total shutdown of rail, road, and air traffic as well as total closure of most of the business establishments and IT industry, especially during the first phase of the LD, is found to dramatically reduce black carbon (BC) abundance. Within one week of the first week of the LD phase 1 (LD1), the ambient BC concentration at the urban centre came down to levels comparable to those reported for remote rural locations, primarily due to &gt;60% reduction in BC from fossil fuel (BCff) emissions. On the other hand, BC from biomass burning (BCwb) did not show any conspicuous impact. Consequently, the fraction of BCwb to BC more than doubled and the spectral absorption coefficient increased from ~1.15 to ~1.4. The single scattering albedo increased from its prevailing mean value 0.66 before LD to 0.74 during LD1 and then gradually decreased to 0.68 with increasing relaxations on vehicular traffic. The results reveal the unequivocal role of vehicular emissions in impacting the aerosol loading and their optical properties over Bengaluru. The study also shows how the environment responded to the gradual relaxations in the subsequent phases of LD. It is interesting to note that a few spells of strong rainfall towards the fourth phase of the LD impacted the aerosols non-selectively leading to sharp decrease in all the quantities. However, owing to the non-selective nature of the washout this large reduction in loading did not impact the single scattering albedo, unlike the case with the LD.","Ajay, A.; Moorthy, K.

In case of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many governments recommended or even obligated their citizens to wear masks as an effective countermeasure. In order to continuously monitor the compliance of this policy measure in public spaces like restaurants or tram stations by public authorities, one scalable and automatable option depicts the application of surveillance systems, i.e., CCTV. However, large-scale monitoring of mask recognition does not only require a well-performing Artificial Intelligence, but also ensure that no privacy issues are introduced, as surveillance is a deterrent for citizens and regulations like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demand strict regulations of such personal data.

Examples of well-known surrogate losses for binary classification include the logistic loss, hinge loss, and sigmoid loss. It is known that the choice of a surrogate loss can highly influence the performance of the trained classifier and therefore it should be carefully chosen. Recently, surrogate losses that satisfy a certain symmetric condition (aka., symmetric losses) have demonstrated their usefulness in learning from corrupted labels. In this article, we provide an overview of symmetric losses and their applications. First, we review how a symmetric loss can yield robust classification from corrupted labels in balanced error rate (BER) minimization and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) maximization. Then, we demonstrate how the robust AUC maximization method can benefit natural language processing in the problem where we want to learn only from relevant keywords and unlabeled documents. Finally, we conclude this article by discussing future directions, including potential applications of symmetric losses for reliable machine learning and the design of non-symmetric losses that can benefit from the symmetric condition.","Charoenphakdee, Nontawat; Lee, Jongyeong; Sugiyama, Masashi",,481,12

Type I interferons (IFNs) especially IFN-ß are best known for their antiviral activities. IFNs accompanied by the standard care protocols have opened up unique opportunities for treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The databases including PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched up to October 30, 2020. The primary and secondary outcomes were considered discharge and mortality, respectively. The abovementioned outcomes of standard care protocol were compared with the standard care plus IFN-ß in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. Out of 356 records identified, 12 randomized clinical trial studies were selected for full-text screening. Finally, 5 papers were included in the systematic review and 3 papers in the meta-analysis. The average mortality rate was reported as 6.195% and 18.02% in intervention and control groups, respectively. Likewise, the median days of hospitalization were lower in the intervention group (9 days) than the control group (12.25 days). According to meta-analysis, IFN-ß was found to increase the overall discharge rate (RR = 3.05; 95% CI: 1.09-5.01).

Aim: To investigate whether there have been variations in the presentations of male patients with sexual and reproductive health problems to the outpatient urology clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand the underlying factors for these variations, if any. Methods: Male patients aged &#8805;18 years who presented to the outpatient urology clinics in 12 centers across Turkey from February 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups: those who presented to the outpatient clinic from February 1, 2020 to March 11, 2020 comprised the ""pre-COVID-19 pandemic period"" group, whereas those who presented to the outpatient clinic from March 12, 2020 to June 1, 2020 comprised the ""COVID-19 pandemic period"" group and compared with each other. Main Outcome Measures: Number and diagnose of patients presented to urology outpatient clinics. Results: Andrological problems were detected in 721 of 4,955 male patients included in the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, there was a significant increase in andrological diagnosis in these patients compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period [n=293 (17%) vs. n=428 (13.2%), p<0.001, respectively]. Similarly, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of patients diagnosed with male reproductive or sexual health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic period [n=107 (6.2%) vs. n=149 (4.6%), p=0.016 and n=186 (10.8%) vs. n=279 (8.6%), p=0.013, respectively]. The number of patients diagnosed with erectile dysfunction during the pandemic was also significantly higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period [n=150 (8.7%) vs. n=214 (6.6%), p=0.008]. Conclusion: Presentations to the outpatient urology clinics due to andrological problems markedly increased during the pandemic period. Although these problems are of multifactorial origin, psychogenic factors are also considered to significantly trigger these problems.","Duran, Mesut Berkan; Yildirim, Omer; Kizilkan, Yalcin; Tosun, Cagatay; Cirakoglu, Abdullah; Gultekin, Mehmet Hamza; Gul, Umit; Altan, Mesut; Sah, Cem; Hasirci, Eray; Ceyhan, Erman; Ongun, Sakir; Turunc, Tahsin",Sex Med,481,1

One thousand samples from the staff of a general hospital providing treatment to patients with severe COVID-19 were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) IgG using RLA. Nine patients with COVID-19 who had been treated in inpatient settings and had already recovered were used as control subjects, and 186 blood donor samples obtained more than 10 years ago were used as negative controls. Four of the 1000 samples showed apparently positive results, and approximately 10 or more samples showed slightly high counts. Interestingly, a few among the blood donor samples also showed slightly high values. To validate the results, antibody examinations using ELISA and neutralizing antibody tests were performed on 21 samples, and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) was performed on 201 samples, both resulting in a very high correlation. One blood donor sample showed slightly positive results in both RLA and CLIA, suggesting a cross-reaction. This study showed that five months after the pandemic began in Japan, the staff of a general hospital with a tertiary emergency medical facility had an extremely low seroprevalence of the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether the slightly high results were due to cross-reactions or a low titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The quantitative RLA was considered sensitive enough to detect low titers of antibodies.","Matsunaga, Hidenori; Makino, Akiko; Kato, Yasuhiro; Murakami, Teruaki; Yamaguchi, Yuta; Kumanogoh, Atsushi; Oba, Yuichiro; Fujimi, Satoshi; Honda, Tomoyuki; Tomonaga, Keizo",Viruses,481,22

To solve this problem, we proposed a method that uses LSTM to obtain query/key/value and verified its effectiveness. (ii) We pointed out 'inter-container' leakage problem, which happens in datasets where questions are sometimes served together. To solve this problem, we showed special indexing/masking techniques that are useful when using RNN-variants and Transformer.

It remains uncertain as to how long this should be implemented, what variables to follow and who would be the ideal candidates for this adjunctive therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients admitted from April to August 2020 within our institution with multifocal pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 who underwent awake-proning for at least 3 hours was conducted. RESULTS: Improvement in respiratory parameters including ROX (SpO2/Fio2/ Respiratory Rate) indices and inflammatory markers within 4 days of institution of awake proning predicted a higher chance for success of this strategy in preventing need for mechanical ventilation. Moreover, benefits of awake proning were limited to patients with mild to moderate ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning can be safely performed with improvement in oxygenation. However, its institution may be beneficial only in patients with mild to moderate ARDS and requires careful evaluation of respiratory parameters and serum inflammatory markers to avoid a delay in endotracheal intubation and consequent increase in mortality rates.","Cherian, Sujith V; Li, Chang; Roche, Brad; Reyes, Stephan A; Karanth, Siddharth; Lal, Aditya P; Aisenberg, Gabriel M; Estrada-Y-Martin, Rosa M",Respir Med,481,33

The mechanisms that lead to this prothrombotic state are not well established. The main aim was to evaluate the von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and plasma ADAMTS13 activity as endothelial injury markers in COVID-19. We present a prospective study in COVID-19 patients recruited in our institution. VWF antigen, ADAMTS13 activity, D-dimer, and fibrinogen were measured during the first week once COVID-19 was diagnosed. Fifty COVID-19 inpatients [44% in the intensive care unit (ICU)] and 102 COVID-19 outpatients were enrolled. Thirty age and gender matched non-COVID-19 ward inpatients and 30 non-COVID-19 healthy individuals were recruited. The COVID-19 inpatients had higher D-dimer, fibrinogen, and VWF antigen levels and a lower ADAMTS13 activity compared with the COVID-19 outpatients (p < 0.05). ICU patients had higher D-dimer and VWF antigen levels compared with the ward patients and the lowest ADAMTS13 activity (p < 0.05). An imbalance in VWF antigen/ADAMTS13 ratio was observed in COVID-19, reaching the highest in ICU patients. In contrast to other ward non-COVID-19 inpatients, a significative reduction in ADAMTS13 activity was observed in all COVID-19 patients. There is an increase in VWF antigen and an ADAMTS13 activity reduction in COVID-19 related to disease severity and could predict poor clinical outcomes. The ADAMTS13 activity reduction could be a marker associated with COVID-19 compared to other non-critical medical conditions.","Marco, A; Marco, P",J. thromb. thrombolysis,481,23

Methods: This retrospective study included 254 confirmed patients from 10 January to 11 March, 2020, at Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China. Laboratory and immunologic features were collected and analyzed, and the main outcomes focused on inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte subsets. Results: A trend of markedly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as lower lymphocyte subset levels in deceased patients was observed compared with survivors. ROC curve analyses indicated that inflammatory cytokines and the decrease levels of T cell, Th (helper T cells) cell, Ts (suppressor T cells) cell, B cell, and NK cell along with Th/Ts ratio increase could be used to predict the death of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses showed that higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 remained significantly correlated with shorter survival time and that the amount of Ts cells was negatively associated with the possibility of death in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 would cause lymphopenia and result in decreased lymphocyte subset cells, particularly in Ts cell counts, which further induces hyperinflammatory response and cytokine storm. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Ts cell might be independent predictors for the poor outcome of COVID-19.","Jiang, Nan; Li, Zhijun; Yang, Bo; Jin, Mengdi; Sun, Yaoyao; He, Yang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Yueying; Si, Daoyuan; Ma, Piyong; Zhang, Jinnan; Liu, Tianji; Yu, Qiong",Biomed Res Int,481,1

The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Materials and Methods: Between May 7th and 23rd, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Results: Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Conclusions: Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Tejas; Goyal, Nishant; Dash, Chinmaya; Chandra, Prarthana P; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Raheja, Amol; Singla, Raghav; Sardhara, Jayesh; Singh, Bhoopendra; Gupta, Ravi",Neurol India,481,10

We sought to know whether the timing of prophylactic doses of LMWH during the course of COVID-19 may affect the time to SARS-CoV-2 nasal-oropharyngeal swab negativization. METHODS: Retrospective monocentric cross-sectional study on patients requiring sub-intensive ward admission due to first SARS-CoV-2 infection and undergoing early (EH; within 7 days from COVID-19 signs and symptoms onset) versus delayed prophylactic LMWH (DH; after 7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR according to scheduled time points: first swab after 2 weeks from COVID-19 onset, then at 1-week intervals until negativity. RESULTS: Time to SARS-CoV-2 swab negativity was shorter in EH (38 patients) compared with DH (55 patients): 22 versus 37 days (P=0.004). The number of confirmative negative swabs in EH was significantly higher compared with DH at week 2 (21.1% versus 3.6%; P=0.017) and 4 (60.0% versus 19.6%; P<0.001). At univariate, EH differed from DH for several disease severity and clinical management parameters. Nevertheless, after accounting for the differences, Cox regression showed early LMWH administration (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91 [1.51, 5.63]; P=0.002) and higher lymphocytes nadir (HR 1.04 [1.01, 1.08]; P=0.020) as predictors of shorter time to swab negativity. CONCLUSIONS: This potential antiviral and/or immune-modulating activity of LMWH needs further in vivo confirmations by randomized controlled trials.","Trunfio, Mattia; Salvador, Elena; Gaviraghi, Alberto; Audagnotto, Sabrina; Marinaro, Letizia; Motta, Ilaria; Casciaro, Riccardo; Ghisetti, Valeria; Fava, Carmen; Bonora, Stefano; Di Perri, Giovanni; Calcagno, Andrea",Antivir Ther,481,7

METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional comparative pilot study, we recruited patients with resolved endophthalmitis in one eye (study eye) and a normal fellow eye (control eye). Collected data included measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and AO-SLO imaging and cone counting at the fovea in both eyes. RESULTS: The study included 12 eyes of 6 patients. The mean age was 51.66±11.97 years (median 56 years). BCVA in all control eyes was 20/20 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) 0), and in the study, eyes was 0.21±0.13 (median 0.19, Snellen 20/30; p=0.001; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.09). The follow-up was 18.66±12.32 (median 20 months). The cone count at the fovea in the control eye was 4356.33±1993.93 (median 4498), and in the study eye, it was 2357.16±1541.17 (median 2187.5; p=0.03; 95% CI -3556 to -1082). CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with resolved endophthalmitis with near-normal vision have reduced number of foveal cones even in absence of OCT-detected gross structural changes. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The current work describes the application of cellular-level imaging technique called adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) to the clinical condition of resolved endophthalmitis. The study of retinal cell biology at the cellular level is possible using the emerging technology of AO-SLO. This new investigative modality that has the potential to image the retina at the cellular level until the photoreceptors is more likely to unravel the pathophysiology of a variety of retinal diseases.","Dave, Vivek Pravin; Kumar, Sanjay; Mulani, Yasmeen; Richhariya, Ashutosh; Pappuru, Rajeev Reddy; Das, Taraprasad",Br. j. ophthalmol,481,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study of patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultation was carried out in the ENT department of a university hospital center where telemedicine consultations were set up to replace scheduled out-patient consultations. Patients were divided into two groups according to overall satisfaction, in order to identify predictive factors. The significance threshold was set at P<0.005. The main endpoint was patient satisfaction after an ENT telemedicine consultation during global lockdown. The secondary endpoint comprised predictive factors for overall satisfaction. RESULTS: One hundred of the 125 patients with telemedicine consultation over a 7-day inclusion period completed the questionnaire. Overall satisfaction was 87%. There were no clinically relevant predictive factors significantly associated with satisfaction. Sound and video quality was satisfactory for 76% and 61% of patients respectively, without significant impact on overall satisfaction (respectively: OR=3.40, P-value=0.049; and OR=3.79, P-value=0.049). Lack of physical examination did not significantly correlate with reduced overall satisfaction (OR=0.30, P-value=0.027). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine consultation did not allow complete medical care but, in a difficult time like the global pandemic, was well accepted by patients. It is a simple way to maintain continuity of care while reducing contamination risk by avoiding direct contact between patients and healthcare professionals.","Fieux, M; Duret, S; Bawazeer, N; Denoix, L; Zaouche, S; Tringali, S",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,481,16

OBJECTIVES: To describe the wide-scale implementation of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) multiple variants assay with melting curve analysis as a routine procedure. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively performed multiple variants RT-PCR on consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples from patients, healthcare workers and nursing home residents from our hospital catchment area. This technique was implemented in our automated Roche FLOW system with a turn-around time of 6 h. RESULTS: Between February 1 and May 2, 2021, 989 samples were tested by the variant RT-PCR. Our method was validated by comparison of variant RT-PCR to whole genome sequencing testing. We observed an increase over time in the proportion of UK variant that became the dominant variant, and the concurrent emergence of the South-African and Brazilian variants. Prompt public health responses for infection control were possible because of this rapid screening method, resulting in early detection and reduction of unnoticed spread of VOC as early as possible. CONCLUSION: A variant RT-PCR with additional melting curve analyses is a feasible, rapid and efficient screening strategy that can be implemented in routine microbiological laboratories.","Ong, David S Y; Koeleman, Johannes G M; Vaessen, Norbert; Breijer, Simone; Paltansing, Sunita; de Man, Peter",J Clin Virol,481,1

Our secondary objective was to estimate the psychometric properties of a brief Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ). Methods: We conducted patient-finding exercise in our study areas through various means to obtain subjects with idiopathic epilepsy. We carefully examined each patient through a detailed case-history examination. Following that, we evaluated fear related to epilepsy by using Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in Epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ) across two broad domains: epilepsy and pharmacotherapy. Results: The study obtained 52 subjects (39.0 years; 45.0% males, 70.0% married, 35.0% unqualified, 85.0% active epilepsy, 80.0% generalized seizures) with idiopathic epilepsy. The alpha coefficient was 92.8, with no item-specific coefficient of &#8804;0.91. The alpha coefficient was 0.90 and 0.93 for reporting a ""yes"" and ""no"" to the items, respectively. We obtained a two-factor structure of BG-FEQ that provided a cumulative variance of 83.6%. The majority (65.0%) reported at least one fear. The per-patient mean number of the fear element was 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.3), which differed significantly for males and females (1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.6 and 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, respectively, p=0.03). The most frequent fear was that of addiction and the bad effects of anti-seizure medications (both 45.0%). Upon bootstrap regression after constraining gender, the fear elements were associated with illiteracy, difficulty in understanding epilepsy and sleeping in a prone position. The sample power was 99.0%. Conclusion: There was a significant representation of fear among those with idiopathic epilepsy, especially among the females, particularly the fear of brain tumour, premature death and more frequent/severe seizures over time. At least 65.0% of idiopathic subjects are likely to be affected by at least one fear. The essential mitigating approach should be the education of practitioners towards better identification and therapeutic handling of comorbid constructs, and also for the education of patients and their caregivers towards better awareness and prevention. There is also a need for formal Epilepsy Educators towards better awareness, therapeutic support and prevention of epilepsy.","Gharagozli, Kurosh; Lotfalinezhad, Elham; Amini, Fatemeh; Saii, Vida; Bhalla, Devender",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,481,29

One important line of research is the use of machine learning (ML) to understand and fight COVID-19. This is currently an active research field. Although there are already many surveys in the literature, there is a need to keep up with the rapidly growing number of publications on COVID-19-related applications of ML. This paper presents a review of recent reports on ML algorithms used in relation to COVID-19. We focus on the potential of ML for two main applications: diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of mortality risk and severity, using readily available clinical and laboratory data. Aspects related to algorithm types, training data sets, and feature selection are discussed. As we cover work published between January 2020 and January 2021, a few key points have come to light. The bulk of the machine learning algorithms used in these two applications are supervised learning algorithms. The established models are yet to be used in real-world implementations, and much of the associated research is experimental. The diagnostic and prognostic features discovered by ML models are consistent with results presented in the medical literature. A limitation of the existing applications is the use of imbalanced data sets that are prone to selection bias.","Alballa, Norah; Al-Turaiki, Isra",Inform Med Unlocked,481,1

This has led to increased stress and anxiety among employees, which explicably affects their satisfaction with life. Thus, the present study analyses the effect of COVID-19 induced stressors (role overload, lifestyle choices, family distraction, and occupational discomfort) on employees' distress levels and job performance. Subsequently, the impact of such distress and job performance on the employees' life satisfaction is analyzed during the lockdown period. Methodology: Data was collected from 433 working professionals of private and public organizations in the Delhi and NCR region of India during India's third and fourth phase of lockdown via a survey, which was distributed online. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was applied first to establish the validity of this study's model (measurement model validity) and subsequently test the hypothesized relationships in the model (structural model). Results: The COVID-19 induced stressors, i.e., role overload, lifestyle choices, and occupational discomfort, were significant predictors of distress during the lockdown. It has been found that role overload and change in lifestyle choice did not significantly affect job performance. Family distraction, occupational discomfort, and distress were significant in impacting job performance, with distress being the most significant one. During the COVID-19 pandemic, life satisfaction has reduced due to a significant increase in distress levels and lowered job performances.

DESIGN: Multivariable prognostic prediction model. SETTING: 127 Spanish hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Derivation (DC) and external validation (VC) cohorts were obtained from multicentre and single-centre databases, including 4035 and 2126 patients with confirmed COVID-19, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Prognostic variables were identified using multivariable logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients' characteristics in the DC and VC were median age 70 and 61 years, male sex 61.0% and 47.9%, median time from onset of symptoms to admission 5 and 8 days, and 30-day mortality 26.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Age, low age-adjusted saturation of oxygen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, dyspnoea and sex were the strongest predictors of mortality. Calibration and discrimination were satisfactory with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a 95% CI for prediction of 30-day mortality of 0.822 (0.806-0.837) in the DC and 0.845 (0.819-0.870) in the VC. A simplified score system ranging from 0 to 30 to predict 30-day mortality was also developed. The risk was considered to be low with 0-2 points (0%-2.1%), moderate with 3-5 (4.7%-6.3%), high with 6-8 (10.6%-19.5%) and very high with 9-30 (27.7%-100%).

The epidemiological relationship between carceral facilities and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, remains largely unexamined. Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities. Given disproportionate policing and incarceration of racialized residents nationally, the criminal punishment system may explain a large proportion of racial COVID-19 disparities noted across the United States.","Reinhart, Eric; Chen, Daniel L",Proc.

Specifically, we show that the order parameter quantifying the limit cycle amplitude can be reconstructed from the mode intensity statistics. We observe a maximum of the averaged amplitude at the mode switching, accounting for limit cycle oscillations. We finally relate this maximum to a dip of mode cross-correlations, reaching a minimum of g_{ij}^{(2)}=2/3, which we show to be a mesoscopic limit.

DESIGN: population-based observational study based on a record linkage procedure of databases included in the electronic health information system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers. Thirty seven percent of positive cases had hypertension, 15% cardiologic diseases, while diabetes and cancer characterized 11.7% and 10% of the infected population, respectively. The geographic distribution of positive cases showed a faster spread of the infection in the city of Trieste, an urban area with the highest regional population density. CONCLUSIONS: the COVID-19 pandemic did not hit the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region as hard as other Northern Italian Regions. In the early phase, as documented in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic particularly affected women and elderly people, especially those living in retirement homes in Trieste.","Calagnan, Elena; Gobbato, Michele; Burba, Ivana; Del Zotto, Stefania; Toffolutti, Federica; Serraino, Diego; Tonutti, Giuseppe",Epidemiol Prev,481,1

This has necessitated thoughtful considerations in making adjustments to the assessment system, with most institutions transitioning to online assessments that so far have remained underutilized. Programmatic assessment encourages the deliberate and longitudinal use of diverse assessment methods to maximize learning and assessment and at present can be utilized optimally as it ensures the collection of multiple low-stake assessment data which can be aggregated for high-stake pass/fail decisions by making use of every opportunity for formative feedback to improve performance. Though efforts have been made to introduce programmatic assessment in the competency-based undergraduate curriculum, transitioning to online assessment can be a potential opportunity if the basic tenets of programmatic assessment, choice of online assessment tools, strategies, good practices of online assessments and challenges are understood and explored explicitly for designing and implementing online assessments.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the ""Wuhan pneumonia""-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized. Understanding the nomenclature and biased terms employed in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak is paramount. We propose solidarity with communication professionals in combating the COVID-19 outbreak and the infodemic. Finding solutions to curb the spread of virus bias, stigma, and discrimination is imperative.","Chang, Angela; Schulz, Peter Johannes; Tu, ShengTsung; Liu, Matthew Tingchi",J Med Internet Res,481,24

In the 1950s, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a global influenza surveillance network that is now composed of institutions in 122 member states. This and other surveillance networks monitor circulating influenza strains in humans and animal reservoirs and are primed to detect influenza strains with pandemic potential. Both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO have also developed pandemic risk assessment tools that evaluate specific aspects of emerging influenza strains to develop a systematic process of determining research and funding priorities according to the risk of emergence and potential impact. Here, we review the history of influenza pandemic preparedness and the current state of preparedness, and we propose additional measures for improvement.

Although emerging studies have identified lymphopenia as a driver of cytokine storm, disease progression, and poor outcomes in infected patients, its immunopathogenesis, as well as environmental and genetic determinants, remain unclear. Understanding the interplay of these determinants in the context of lymphopenia and COVID-19 complications in patients in Africa may help with risk stratification and appropriate deployment of targeted treatment regimens with repurposed drugs to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D status, vasculopathy, apoptotic pathways, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the immunopathogenesis of lymphopenia among African people infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will enroll 230 participants, categorized as ""SARS-CoV-2 negative"" (n=69), ""COVID-19 mild"" (n=32), ""hospitalized"" (n=92), and ""recovered"" (n=37), from two health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Sociodemographic data, travel history, and information on comorbidities will be obtained from case files and through a pretested, interview-based structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples (5 mL) collected between 8 AM and 10 AM and aliquoted into EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and plain tubes will be used for complete blood count and CD4 T cell assays to determine lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1000 cells/µL) and CD4 T lymphocyte levels, as well as to measure the concentrations of vitamin D, caspase 3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) using an autoanalyzer, flow cytometry, and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) techniques. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat and used as a template for the amplification of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, BCL2L12) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping of VDR (Apa1, Fok1, and Bsm1) gene polymorphisms by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method and capillary sequencing. Total RNA will also be extracted, reverse transcribed, and subsequently quantitated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to monitor the expression of apoptosis genes in the four participant categories. Data analyses, which include a test of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and study outcomes (lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D prevalence, mild/moderate and severe infections) will be performed using the R statistical software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium analyses for the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the genotyped VDR gene will also be carried out. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants comprising 37 SARS-CoV-2-negative and 8 COVID-19-recovered individuals have been enrolled so far. Their complete blood counts and CD4 T lymphocyte counts have been determined, and their serum samples and genomic DNA and RNA samples have been extracted and stored at -20 °C until further analyses. Other expected outcomes include the prevalence and distribution of lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D in the control (SARS-CoV-2 negative), confirmed, hospitalized, and recovered SARS-CoV-2-positive participants; association of lymphopenia with CD4 T lymphocyte level, serum vitamin D, sVCAM-1, sFasL, and caspase 3 levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; expression levels of apoptosis-related genes among hospitalized participants with COVID-19, and those with lymphopenia compared to those without lymphopenia; and frequency distribution of the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of VDR gene polymorphisms in COVID-19-infected participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study will aid in the genotypic and phenotypic stratification of COVID-19-infected patients in Nigeria with and without lymphopenia to enable biomarker discovery and pave the way for the appropriate and timely deployment of patient-centered treatments to improve prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare note quality between two different templates using a novel randomized clinical simulation process. DESIGN: A randomized non-blinded controlled trial of a standard note template versus redesigned template. PARTICIPANTS: PGY 1-3 IM residents. INTERVENTIONS: Residents documented the simulated patient encounter using one of two templates. The standard template was modeled after the usual outpatient progress note. The new template placed the assessment and plan section in the beginning, grouped subjective data into the assessment, and deemphasized less useful elements. MAIN MEASURES: Note length; time to note completion; note template evaluation by resident authors; note evaluation by faculty reviewers. KEY RESULTS: 36 residents participated, 19 randomized to standard template, 17 to new. New template generated shorter notes (103 vs 285 lines, p < 0.001) that took the same time to complete (19.8 vs 21.6 min, p = 0.654). Using a 5-point Likert scale, residents considered new notes to have increased visual appeal (4 vs 3, p = 0.05) and less redundancy and clutter (4 vs 3, p = 0.006). Overall template satisfaction was not statistically different. Faculty reviewers rated the standard note more up-to-date (4.3 vs 2.7, p = 0.001), accurate (3.9 vs 2.6, p = 0.003), and useful (4 vs 2.8, p = 0.002), but less organized (3.3 vs 4.5, p < 0.001). Total quality was not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Residents rated the new note template more visually appealing, shorter, and less cluttered. Faculty reviewers rated both note types equivalent in the overall quality but rated new notes inferior in terms of accuracy and usefulness though better organized. This study demonstrates a novel method of a simulated clinical encounter to evaluate note templates before the introduction into practice.

We conducted preliminary analyses to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on outcomes in KTR compared to nontransplant patients. METHODS: We evaluated published information in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, with available data on acute kidney injury (AKI), renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and death and compared clinical outcomes in KTR vs nontransplant recipients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 19 published articles were identified, including a total of 88 KTR and 5342 nontransplant patients. The sample size varied between 2 and 2634. Mean age was 58.6 years vs 58.9 years in KTR vs nontransplant patients. Patient-level incidence of AKI (27.5% vs 13.3%, P < .001), RRT (15.4% vs 3.3%, P < .001), ICU stay (34.1% vs 15.1%, P < .001), and death (22.7% vs 16.2%, P = .10) was higher in KTR, representing relative risks of 2.06 (1.44, 2.96), 4.72 (2.62, 8.51), 2.25 (1.67, 3.03), and 1.41 (0.95, 2.08), respectively. CONCLUSION: Early results suggest that the KTR are at significantly higher risk of AKI, RRT, and ICU stay from SARS-CoV-19 infection compared to the general population. The risk of death may not be significantly different.","Aziz, Fahad; Mandelbrot, Didier; Singh, Tripti; Parajuli, Sandesh; Garg, Neetika; Mohamed, Maha; Astor, Brad C; Djamali, Arjang",Transplant Proc,481,1

Methods: The current study adopted the repeated cross-sectional research and was participated by a cohort of Chinese HCWs who were assigned to work at the current disease resistance line. The between-group information about gender, profession, and location was collected in the demographic questionnaire. Risk perception questionnaire was adapted for COVID-19 to assess risk perception and the Chinese version of emotional self-rating scale (PANAS) was used to evaluate HCWs' negative emotions. Results: Findings revealed the risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs varied in different gender, profession, location, as well as different periods of COVID-19. Over the different periods, the predominated negative emotion expressed by HCWs varied, but negative emotion was consistently associated with risk perception and could be a significant indicator of risk perception. Conclusion: The significance of this research lies in its examination of risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs confronting the COVID-19 during two periods of the pandemic, which underscored the importance of monitoring the risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs to ensure safety and prevent the return of the pandemics.","Yin, Q.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay targeting two regions of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) to a high complexity molecular-based, laboratory-developed EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples on the two assays. Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 184 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays, of which 180 showed valid results and were included for the comparative analysis. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 98.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 95.2-99.7) and kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93-1.0). One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9. Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6. CONCLUSION: The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Other considerations, including reagent availability, turnaround time, labor requirements, cost and instrument throughput should guide the decision of which assay to perform.","Hogan, Catherine A; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Garamani, Natasha; Stevens, Bryan; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A",J Clin Virol,481,1

But neurological symptoms including confusion, stroke, and encephalopathy are reported, and anosmia and hypogeusia are also common indicating that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be neurotropic. Observations: The SARS-Co-1 and 2 viruses bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is present on human brain endothelium and non-neuronal cells in the nasopharynx and lingual epithelium. However, SARS-CoV-1 and 2 do not bind rodent ACE2 avidly, which has required the generation of humanized ACE2 transgenic animal models of disease. Transgenic mouse models suggest that the SARS- CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV are neurotropic and infect and damage the brain, including the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. The symptoms of anosmia and hypogeusia indicate a portal to the brain. The relationship between encephalitis lethargica and post encephalitis parkinsonism to the Spanish Flu (H1N1 influenza virus) is unclear but raises the question of long term neurological complications of pandemics. Conclusions and Relevance: There is a concern that there may be long term neurological sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Companies have started to enhance their sustainability level through the application of innovative practices. The importance of employing innovative social sustainability practices within the supply chain seems to have escalated with the advent of COVID-19. However, studies focusing on the social aspect of sustainability innovation when selecting suppliers during the COVID-19 disaster are non-existent. Selecting these types of suppliers can significantly help companies to be more socially innovative and obtain sustainable development targets. This work introduces a social sustainability innovation framework for assessing suppliers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A group grey-best worst method (Group GBWM) is utilized to identify the criteria weights and improved grey relational analysis (IGRA) is utilized for ranking the suppliers. Findings show that “safety and health practices”, “remote working conditions”, and “localization” are the most important social sustainability innovation criteria, respectively, in choosing suppliers during COVID-19. A manufacturing firm is utilized as an example for verifying the efficiency of the proposed model and framework.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of ""Socio-demographics"", ""Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)"", ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)"", ""Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)"" and ""Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)"" are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 44.2±13.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.09±4.17 vs 6.49±4.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.24±5.16 vs 6.37±3.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others. The high PSS were positively correlated with PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Regression analyses revealed that high-perceived stress is an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. There was not significant difference between kidney function with PSS, PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. CONCLUSIONS: High PSS is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and insomnia and also an independent predictor of anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during the outbreak of Covid-19. As the pandemic is still spreading worldwide quickly early identification and intervention of sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders are essential to protect graft function with high compliance to treatment in transplantation patients.","Barutcu Atas, Dilek; Aydin Sunbul, Esra; Velioglu, Arzu; Tuglular, Serhan",PLoS One,481,20

Sports can act as triggers of fatal arrhythmias and therefore it is essential to promptly frame the athlete at risk and to carefully evaluate the suitability for both competitive and recreational sports activity. A history of syncope or palpitations, the presence of premature ventricular complexes or more complex arrhythmias, a reduced left ventricular systolic function, or the presence of known or familiar heart disease should prompt a thorough evaluation with second level examinations. In this regard, cardiac magnetic resonance and electrophysiological study play important roles in the diagnostic work-up. The role of genetics is increasing both in cardiomyopathies and in channelopathies, and a careful evaluation must be focused on genotype positive/phenotype negative subjects. In addition to being a trigger for fatal arrhythmias in certain cardiomyopathies, sports also play a role in the progression of the disease itself, especially in the case arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

The intended benefits to the older adult and service were for: 1. Daily rehabilitation input for older adults. 2. Older adults to spend less time immobile. 3. Ongoing rehabilitation intervention while awaiting medical clearance for discharge. 4. Increased staff satisfaction 5. Better outcomes on discharge. 6. Rehabilitation ethos on the Health and Ageing wards. Methods The quality improvement project was carried out using the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle. Three iterative PDSA cycles were carried out over the course of the project to deliver proactive interventions as a result of analysis of baseline data and stakeholder involvement. These interventions were aimed at developing communication around the rehabilitation list within the team and sustainability of this list. Results The project resulted in better functional outcomes for older adults and increased staff morale. Between May 2020–June 2020, a total of 56 patients were seen on the rehabilitation list, with 84% of these patients seeing improvements in their Elderly Mobility Scores (EMS). 27% of patients on the rehabilitation list saw a change to their initial discharge plan, either needing reduced packages of care or reduced need for ongoing rehabilitation in an external setting. Conclusions The quality improvement project found that with focussed rehabilitation older adult inpatients with or without COVID-19 can make significant functional gains. These gains have wider effects on their outcomes on discharge and also for the service through increased morale and job satisfaction. Due to demand and capacity issues in the acute setting, older adults who would often benefit from ongoing input are not always reviewed regularly. This project demonstrates that with focussed rehabilitation older adults can improve and achieve better functional outcomes.","Roberts, F.; Birmingham, K.; Darlison, L.; Hertzberg, K.; Chapman, K.; Krampikowski, J.; Bunden, D.; King, L.; Tebbutt, E.; Potter, E.",Age and Ageing,481,12

SARS-CoV-2 transmits from person to person through several routes, mainly via respiratory droplets, which makes it difficult to contain its spread into the community. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: Direct person-to-person respiratory transmission has rapidly amplified the spread of coronavirus. In the absence of any clinically proven treatment options, the current clinical management of COVID-19 includes symptom management, infection prevention and control measures, optimized supportive care, and intensive care support in severe or critical illness. Developing an effective vaccine is now a leading research priority. Some vaccines have already been approved by the regulatory authorities for the prevention of COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: General prevention and protection measures regarding the containment and management of the second or third waves are necessary to minimize the risk of infection. Until now, four vaccines reported variable efficacies of between 62-95%, and two of them (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) received FDA emergency use authorization. Equitable access and effective distribution of these vaccines in all countries will save millions of lives.","Rahman, Sayeeda; Montero, Maria Teresa Villagomez; Rowe, Kherie; Kirton, Rita; Kunik, Frank",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,481,6

Besides recruiting retired healthcare workers, medical students were considered to support this task. Commitment of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using an online survey, with particular focus on their burdens and anxieties. This survey was distributed to students within a 2-week period in April and May 2020. Ultimately, 1241 participants were included in the analysis. During the pandemic, 67.9% (65.3% to 70.5%) of the participants reported that they had volunteered. Furthermore, 88.9% (86.9% to 90.5%) stated that they were against compulsory recruitment in this context. Students who volunteered (committed students) had a significantly lower anxiety index than non-committed students. Additionally, students were more concerned about infecting other patients and relatives than themselves. Higher levels of anxiety were related to lower levels of commitment. A mandatory assignment during the pandemic was rejected by the students and does not seem to be necessary due to the large number of volunteers.","Mihatsch, Lorenz; von der Linde, Mira; Knolle, Franziska; Luchting, Benjamin; Dimitriadis, Konstantinos; Heyn, Jens",J. med. ethics,481,1

However, to capture the full picture and be able to compare situations and consequences for different countries, multivariate analytical models are suggested in order to visualize and compare the situation of different countries more accurately and precisely. Aims: We aimed to utilize data analysis tools that display the relative positions of data points in fewer dimensions while keeping the variation of the original data set as much as possible, and cluster countries according to their scores on the formed dimensions. Methods: Principal component analysis (PCA) and Partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithms were used to analyze data of 56 countries, 82 countries and 91 countries with COVID-19 at three time points, eligible countries included in the analysis are those with total cases of 500 or more with no missing data. Results: After performing PCA, we generated two scores: Disease Magnitude score that represents total cases, total deaths, total actives cases, and critically ill cases, and Mortality Recovery Ratio score that represents the ratio between total deaths to total recoveries in any given country. Conclusion: Accurate multivariate analyses can be of great value as they can simplify difficult concepts, explore and communicate findings from health datasets, and support the decision-making process.","Ramadan, Ahmed; Kamel, Ahmed; Taha, Alaa; El-Shabrawy, Abdelhamid; Abdel-Fatah, Noura Anwar",Heliyon,481,16

OBJECTIVE: To find the clinical and hormonal effects of virtual reality training (VRT) and isokinetic training (IKT) in chronic LBP patients. METHODS: Through the simple random sampling method, 60 university football players with chronic LBP were allocated into three groups: NVRT= 20, NIKT= 20 and NCONTROL= 20. The three groups underwent different exercises for 4 weeks. Clinical (pain intensity and kinesiophobia) and hormonal (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, growth hormone, prolactin, ACTH and cortisol) values were measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS: Four weeks following training, the VRT and IKT groups showed significant changes in pain intensity and kinesiophobia in comparison to the control group (p< 0.05). Hormonal measures also showed significant improvement in the VRT group in comparison to the other two groups (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Training through virtual reality and isokinetic exercise is an effective approach in terms of pain and kinesiophobia. In terms of hormonal analysis, virtual reality shows slightly more improvements than isokinetic training in subjects with chronic LBP.","Nambi, Gopal; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Alrawaili, Saud M; Abodonya, Ahmed M; Saleh, Ayman K",Technol. health care,481,1

First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuals susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE2 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID-19. We studied 204 COVID-19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 insertion/deletion and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Severe COVID-19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p = 0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p = 0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p = 0.02, OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.12-4.63) and male gender (p = 0.002; OR = 3.15, 95%CI = 1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID-19. In conclusion, an adverse outcome of COVID-19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. Our work suggested that the ACE1-I/D might influence COVID-19 severity, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status. This result requires further validation in other large cohorts.","Gómez, Juan; Albaiceta, Guillermo M; García-Clemente, Marta; López-Larrea, Carlos; Amado-Rodríguez, Laura; Lopez-Alonso, Inés; Hermida, Tamara; Enriquez, Ana I; Herrero, Pablo; Melón, Santiago; Alvarez-Argüelles, Marta E; Boga, José A; Rojo-Alba, Susana; Cuesta-Llavona, Elías; Alvarez, Victoria; Lorca, Rebeca; Coto, Eliecer",Gene,481,24

We apply the Asymmetric Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach to 15-min interval intraday data. The results show strong evidence of asymmetric multifractality that increases as the fractality scale increases. Moreover, multifractality is especially higher in the downside (upside) trend for Brent oil (gold), and this excess asymmetry has been more accentuated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Before the outbreak, the gold (oil) market was more inefficient during downward (upward) trends. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, we see that the results have changed. More precisely, we find that gold (oil) is more inefficient during upward (downward) trends. Gold and oil markets have been inefficient, particularly during the outbreak. The efficiency of gold and oil markets is sensitive to scales, market trends, and to the pandemic outbreak, highlighting the investor sentiment effect.","Mensi, Walid; Sensoy, Ahmet; Vo, Xuan Vinh; Kang, Sang Hoon",Resour.

A cross-sectional online survey of 10,933 students was conducted among 10 schools in Guangzhou, China, between 8th and 15th March, 2020. After getting the informed consent from student's caregivers, an online questionnaire was designed and used to obtain time spending on health-related behaviours during the pandemic of COVID-19, as well as the changes compared with 3 months before the pandemic, which was completed by students themselves or their caregivers. Students were stratified by regions (urban, suburban, exurban), gender (boys and girls), and grades (lower grades of primary school, higher grades of primary schools, secondary schools and high schools). Data were expressed as number and percentages and Chi-square test was used to analyse difference between groups. Overall, the response rate of questionnaire was 95.3% (10,416/10,933). The median age of included students was 13.0 (10.0, 16.0) years and 50.1% (n = 5,219) were boys. 41.4%, 53.6% and 53.7% of total students reported less than 15 min per day in light, moderate and vigorous activities and 58.7% (n = 6,113) reported decreased participation in physical activity compared with the time before pandemic. Over 5 h of screen time spending on online study was reported by 44.6% (n = 4,649) of respondents, particular among high school students (81.0%). 76.9% of students reported increased screen time compared with the time before pandemic. Inadequate sleep was identified among 38.5% of students and the proportion was highest in high school students (56.9%).

We aimed at evaluating the association of daily new COVID-19 cases with socio-economic and demographic factors, health vulnerability, resources, and policy response in BRICS countries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data on the COVID-19 pandemic and other indicators of BRICS countries from February 26, 2020 to April 30, 2021. We compared COVID-19 epidemic in BRICS countries and analyzed related factors by log-linear Generalized Additive Model (GAM) models. RESULTS: In BRICS countries, India had the highest totally of confirmed cases with 18.76 million, followed by Brazil (14.45 million), Russia (4.81 million), and South Africa (1.58 million), while China (0.10 million) had the lowest figure. South Africa had the lowest rate of administered vaccine doses (0.18 million) among BRICS countries as of April 30, 2021. In the GAM model, a 1 unit increase in population density and policy stringency index was associated with a 5.17% and 1.95% growth in daily new COVID-19 cases (P < 0.001), respectively. Exposure-response curves for the effects of policy stringency index on daily new cases showed that there was a rapid surge in number of daily new COVID-19 cases when the index ranged from 0 to 45. The number of infections climbed slowly when the index ranged from 46 to 80, and decreased when the index was above 80 (P < 0.001). In addition, daily new COVID-19 cases (all P < 0.001) were also correlated with life expectancy at birth (-1.61%), extreme poverty (8.95%), human development index (-0.05%), GDP per capita (-0.18%), diabetes prevalence (0.66%), proportion of population aged 60 and above (2.23%), hospital beds per thousand people (-0.08%), proportion of people with access to improved drinking water (-7.40%), prevalence of open defecation (0.69%), and annual tourist/visitor arrivals (0.003%), after controlling other confounders. Different lag structures showed similar results in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Strong policy response is crucial to control the pandemic, such as effective containment and case management.

Most published studies have been focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients are limited. In this study, we aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome, and follow-up results. RESULTS: A total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 case patients whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65 of 68; 95.59%) were household contacts of adults. Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness. Abnormalities in leukocyte count were found in 23 (31.08%) children, and 10 (13.51%) children presented with abnormal lymphocyte count. Of the 34 (45.95%) patients who had nucleic acid testing results for common respiratory pathogens, 19 (51.35%) showed coinfection with other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Ten (13.51%) children had real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for fecal specimens, and 8 of them showed prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 presented with distinct epidemiological, clinical, and radiologic characteristics from adult patients. Nearly one-half of the infected children had coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens. It is not uncommon for pediatric patients to have prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the convalescent phase.","Wu, Qin; Xing, Yuhan; Shi, Lei; Li, Wenjie; Gao, Yang; Pan, Silin; Wang, Ying; Wang, Wendi; Xing, Quansheng",Pediatrics,481,16

Medical data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in two university-based hospitals during an outbreak in Daegu, South Korea, were retrospectively analyzed. AKI and its severity were defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network. Of the 164 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 30 patients (18.3%) had AKI; 14, 4, and 12 patients had stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The model consists of a lattice of cells that can be in four different states: susceptible, infected, recovered or death. An infected cell can transmit the disease to any other susceptible cell within some random range $R$. The transmission mechanism follows the physics laws for the interaction between a particle and a target. Each infected particle affects the interaction region a number $n$ of times, according to its energy. The number of interactions is proportional to the interaction cross section $\sigma$ and to the target surface density $\rho$. The discrete energy follows a Planck distribution law, which depends on the temperature $T$ of the system. For any interaction, infection, recovery and death probabilities are applied. We investigate the results of viral transmission for different sets of parameters and compare them with available COVID-19 data. The parameters of the model can be made time dependent in order to consider, for instance, the effects of lockdown in the middle of the pandemic.","Amaro, Jos'e Enrique; Orce, Jos'e Nicol'as",,481,24

We demonstrate that materials often used in home-made face masks block most of the droplets. We also show quantitatively that less liquid carried by ballistic droplets reaches a receptor when a blocking material is deployed near the source than when located near the receptor, which supports the paradigm that your face mask does protect you, but protects others even better than you.","M'arquez-Alvarez, V.; Amig'o-Vera, J.; Rivera, A.; Batista-Leyva, A.

Charting a safer course in health policy,15.820613,3.2531645,2021,"The quarantine and disruption of non-essential activities as measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected all economies around the World. This has had a deeper impact on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging economies because they have very limited resources and vulnerable supply chain and business-to-business / business-to-clients relationships. In this context, it is expected that after the pandemic many of these enterprises will disappear as the ""new normality"" will require changes in business and infrastructure management. To reduce this risk, innovation is identified as a key aspect of business recovery in the ongoing and post-COVID-19 pandemic period. This work presents a multidisciplinary methodological approach to guide these enterprises to innovate their products for new markets and making a better use of their limited available resources. As an example of this approach, the research-supported development of a new product for a family-owned SME was performed in a zone with high COVID-19 risk. The results provide insight regarding innovation as a survival tool for SMEs during and after the COVID-19 contingency, and the use of digital resources is identified as the main facilitator for networking and research-based design of innovative products within the ""social distance"" context.","Caballero-Morales, Santiago-Omar",Res Int Bus Finance,481,16

As the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic is now going to settle down, many medical organizations are in the process of reopening surgical services. This paper describes a few key factors that spine surgeons should consider prior to resuming elective spine services namely, local outbreak situations, availability of hospital resources, manpower and personal protective equipment (PPE). Spine surgeons should prioritize their operating list based on clinical indications and likely benefits from surgical intervention so as to make optimum use of hospital resources and operating room listings. International organizations have published on general principles and recommendations on how to restart elective surgery. However, with different regions at varying phases of the outbreak and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a general set of practice guidelines may not be applicable. This paper also proposes, on top of perioperative precautionary measures already in place, clearly-defined risk stratification algorithms for hospital visitors, as well as a disease-testing protocol for patients planned for elective surgery. It is of critical importance for surgeons to define key areas of concern and assimilate these principles into clearly-defined algorithms which can be applied to the field of spine surgery so as to help re-establish continuity of care for patients.","Wang, V.

The role of anticoagulation (AC) prior to hospital admission and how different types of oral AC influences the outcome of COVID-19 is currently unknown. This observational study compares the outcome in COVID-19 patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and without prior use of AC. We collected the baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presented to the emergency department of Bernhoven Hospital, the Netherlands. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days and analyzed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, symptom duration, home medication, and comorbidities. We included 497 patients, including 57 patients with DOAC (11%) and 53 patients with VKA (11%). Patients with AC had a lower body temperature and lower C-reactive protein levels. Comparing the primary outcome in patients with AC (DOAC or VKA) and no AC, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.64 (95% CI 0.42-0.96, P = 0.03). Comparing DOAC and no AC, the aHR was 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.89, P = 0.02) and comparing VKA and no AC, the aHR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.47-1.27, P = 0.30). In a subgroup analysis of DOAC, all nine patients with prior use of dabigatran survived within 30 days. In this observational study, the prior use of AC is associated with a better survival of COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Detailed information on compounds in the HQ-BS herb pair was obtained from the Traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) and screened by the criteria of OB &#8805;30% and DL &#8805;0.18. A systematic drug targeting model (SysDT) was used for compound targets prediction, and then the targets were analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HQ-BS targets was constructed, after identifying core networks through Cytoscape plugins. RESULTS We found 47 bioactive compounds of HQ-BS and 107 human-derived targets. A compound target network and a target signal pathway network were constructed and used for topological analysis. Kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, wogonin, and oroxylin-a were identified as core compounds and pathways in cancer. The calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, chemical carcinogenesis, estrogen signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, HIF-1 signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway were found to be potential signals of HQ-BS in treating cancer. Through PPI network analysis, TNF signaling pathway, tryptophan metabolism, proteoglycans in cancer, cell cycle, and chemical carcinogenesis sub-networks were obtained. CONCLUSIONS HQ-BS contains various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phytosterols, and other compounds, and these compounds can inhibit or activate multiple targets and pathways against cancer.","Xu, Tian; Wang, Qingguo; Liu, Min",Med Sci Monit,481,20

Social isolation is known to have a significant psychological impact, potentially triggering alcohol misuse in adults. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on alcohol consumption in adults in Bavaria. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 2067 participants, with 1961 young adults (mean age 23.3 ± 4.1) and 106 mature adults (mean age 66.7 ± 9.7). Participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the alcohol drinking behaviour before and during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: After implementation of lockdown, the alteration of alcohol consumption was significantly different between young and mature adults (p < 0.001). Among young adults, 42% reported unchanged drinking behaviour compared to 76% in the mature adult group; 44% of young adults reported to drink less compared to only 7% of mature adults. An increase in alcohol consumption was only reported by 14% of young adults and 17% of mature adults. Interestingly, in the entire cohort, the change of alcohol intake was most pronounced among moderate drinkers (> 0 to < 5 drinks/week) in both age groups (p < 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression revealed female sex, low BMI and younger age to be associated with a decrease in number of self-reported drinks/week. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown significantly affected alcohol drinking behaviour.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand precisely the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this multifaceted disease. There is increasing evidence that the immune system reacts insufficiently to SARS-CoV-2 and thus contributes to organ damage and to lethality. In this review, we suggest that the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in oxidative stress is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage that leads to severe COVID-19. It increases the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppresses the adaptive arm of the immune system, i.e. T cells that are necessary to kill virus-infected cells. This creates a vicious cycle that prevents a specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The key role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 implies that therapeutic counterbalancing of ROS by antioxidants such as vitamin C or NAC and/or by antagonizing ROS production by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and neutrophil granulocytes and/or by blocking of TNF-&#945; can prevent COVID-19 from becoming severe.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all children from 0 to 18 years of age presenting with an injury at the level 1 trauma centre of the University Clinic of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery in Vienna during the lockdown from 16 March to 29 May 2020 compared to records over the same timeframe from 2015 to 2019. RESULTS: In total, 14,707 patients with injuries were included. The lockdown did not lead to a significant decrease in fractures but, instead, yielded a highly significant increase in mild traumatic brain injuries when compared to all injuries that occurred (p = 0.082 and p = 0.0001) as well as acute injuries (excluding contusions, distortions and miscellaneous non-acute injuries) (p = 0.309 and p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of paediatric fractures did not decrease at the level 1 trauma centre, and a highly significant proportional increase in paediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injuries was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. Therefore, medical resources should be maintained to treat paediatric trauma patients and provide neurological monitoring during pandemic lockdowns.","Payr, Stephan; Schuller, Andrea; Dangl, Theresia; Scheider, Philipp; Sator, Thomas; Chocholka, Britta; Jaindl, Manuela; Schwendenwein, Elisabeth; Tiefenboeck, Thomas M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),481,24

However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common comorbidity that has rarely been investigated in detail. This study aims to describe clinical characteristics and determine risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of COVID-19 patients with CVD. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 288 adult patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic characteristics, laboratory results, radiographic findings, complications, and treatments were recorded and compared between CVD and non-CVD groups. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with ICU admission for infected patients with underlying CVD. COVID-19 patients in the CVD group were older and had higher levels of troponin I (TnI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine. They were also more prone to develop into severe or critically severe cases, receive ICU admission, and require respiratory support treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the following were risk factors for ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD: each 1-year increase in age (odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.17; p = 0.018); respiratory rate over 24 times per min (OR, 25.52; 95% CI, 5.48-118.87; p < 0.0001); CRP higher than 10 mg/L (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.63-40.49; p = 0.011); and TnI higher than 0.03 µg/L (OR, 9.14; 95% CI, 2.66-31.43; p < 0.0001). Older age, CRP greater than 10 mg/L, TnI higher than 0.03 µg/L, and respiratory rate over 24 times per minute were associated with increasing odds of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Investigating and monitoring these factors could assist in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients with CVD at an early stage.","He, Feng; Quan, Yibo; Lei, Ming; Liu, Riguang; Qin, Shuguang; Zeng, Jun; Zhao, Ziwen; Yu, Na; Yang, Liuping; Cao, Jie",Aging Dis,481,1

This in part reflects the viral ability to influence the cytokine secretion and thereby the innate immune system. Especially the viral interference of IFN-I signaling and the subsequent deficiency of innate immune response in the early phase have been associated with rapid virus replication and later excessive immune responses. We propose a mathematical framework to analyze IFN-I signaling and its impact on the interaction motif between virus, NK cells and macrophages. The model recapture divergent dynamics of coronavirus infections including the possibility for elevated secretion of IL-6 and IFN-{gamma} as a consequence of exacerbated macrophage activation. Dysfunction of NK cells recruitment increase disease severity by leading to a higher viral load peak, the possibility for excessive macrophage activation, and an elevated risk of the cytokine storm. Thus the model predicts that delayed IFN-I signaling could lead to pathogenicity in the latter stage of an infection. Reversely, in case of strong NK recruitment from infected cells we predict a possible chronic disease state with moderate and potentially oscillating virus/cytokine levels.","Xu, Xiaochan; Sneppen, Kim",,481,24

The objective was to report the postoperative mortality after elective digestive resections in a nationwide cohort during the lockdown period. METHODS: This analytic study was performed using a national billing database (the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Informations). Patients who underwent elective digestive resections were divided in 2 groups: the lockdown group defined by hospital admissions between March 17 and May 11, 2020; and the control group, defined by hospital admissions during the corresponding period in 2019. Groups were matched on propensity score, geographical region, and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The overall population included 15,217 patients: 9,325 patients in the control group and 5,892 in the lockdown group. The overall surgical activity was decreased by 37% during the lockdown period. The overall in-hospital mortality during the hospital stay was 2.7%. After matching and adjustment, no difference in mortality between groups was reported (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.83-1.34; P = .669). An asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for a 2-fold increased mortality, whereas a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was associated with a 10-fold increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable reduction in the surgical activity for elective digestive resections during the lockdown period, mortality remained stable on a nationwide scale in COVID-free patients. These findings support that systematic COVID-19 screening should be advocated before elective gastrointestinal surgery and that all efforts should be made to maintain elective surgical resection for cancer during the second wave in COVID-free patients.","Challine, Alexandre; Dousset, Bertrand; de039,; Angelis, Nicola; Lefèvre, Jérémie H; Parc, Yann; Katsahian, Sandrine; Lazzati, Andrea",Surgery (St. Louis),481,1

There is no precise vaccine/therapeutic agents available to combat the COVID-19 disease. Some repurposed drugs are saving the life of diseased, but the complete cure is relatively less. Several drug targets have been reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in that TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is one of the potential targets; inhibiting this protease stops the virus entry into the host human cell. Camostat mesylate, nafamostat, and leupeptin are the drugs, in which the first two drugs are being used for COVID-19 and leupeptin also tested. To consider these drugs as the repurposed drug for COVID-19, it is essential to understand their binding affinity and stability with TMPRSS2. In the present study, we performed the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of these molecules with the TMPRSS2. The docking study reveals that leupeptin molecule strongly binds with TMPRSS2 protein than the other two drug molecules. The RMSD and RMSF values of MD simulation confirm that leupeptin and the amino acids of TMPRSS2 are very stable than the other two molecules. Furthermore, leupeptin forms interactions with the key amino acids of TMPRSS2 and the same have been maintained during the MD simulations. This structural and dynamical information is useful to evaluate these drugs to be used as repurposed drugs, however, the strong binding profile of leupeptin with TMPRSS2, suggests, it may be considered as a repurposed drug for COVID-19 disease after clinical trial.","Ramakrishnan, Jaganathan; Kandasamy, Saravanan; Iruthayaraj, Ancy; Magudeeswaran, Sivanandam; Chinnasamy, Kalaiarasi; Poomani, Kumaradhas",Appl. biochem. biotechnol,481,12

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of most stable docked complexes (Mpro-22 and Mpro-26) helped to confirm the notable conformational stability of these docked complexes under dynamic state. Furthermore, Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations revealed energetic contributions of key residues of Mpro in binding with potent furoxan derivatives 22, 26. In the present study to validate the molecular docking, MD simulation and MM-PBSA results, crystal structure of Mpro bound to experimentally known inhibitor X77 was used as control and the obtained results are presented herein. We envisaged that spiro-isoquinolino-piperidine-furoxan moieties can be used as effective ligand for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition due to the presence of key isoquinolino-piperidine skeleton with additional NO effect.

Numerous types of models have been employed with various levels of success. This leads to the question of what kind of a mathematical model is most appropriate for a given situation. We consider two widely used types of models: equation-based models (such as standard compartmental epidemiological models) and agent-based models. We assess their performance by modeling the spread of COVID-19 on the Hawaiian island of Oahu under different scenarios. We show that when it comes to information crucial to decision making, both models produce very similar results. At the same time, the two types of models exhibit very different characteristics when considering their computational and conceptual complexity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate respiratory virus surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses. METHOD: We retrospectively analysed data from the Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System in Canada, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, by interrupted time series regression. RESULTS: The national level of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses, which generally does not necessitate quarantine or contact screening, was greatly reduced after Canada imposed physical distancing and other quarantine measures. The 2019-2020 influenza season ended earlier than it did in the previous year. The influenza virus was replaced by rhinovirus/enterovirus or parainfluenza virus in the previous year, with the overall test positivity remaining at approximately 35%. However, during the 2019-2020 post-influenza period, the overall test positivity of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 was still low (7.2%). Moreover, the 2020-2021 influenza season had not occurred by the end of February 2021.

The aim of this study was to investigate the concordance between RAT and RT-qPCR results, and their prediction of disease transmission. METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study of inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 6 to June 14, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were used to perform RAT and RT-qPCR. The primary endpoint was concordance between RAT and RT-qPCR results. The secondary endpoints were the factors causing disagreement in the results and the estimated transmissibility in RT-qPCR-positive patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 229 samples in viral transport medium (VTM) were obtained from 105 patients. The positive and negative concordance rates for VTM were 41% vs 99% (&#954; = 0.37) and 72% vs 100% (&#954; = 0.50) for samples collected on disease days 2-9. An increased body temperature (odds ratio 0.54) and absence of drugs with potential antiviral effect (odds ratio 0.48) yielded conflicting results. RAT was associated with the ability to end isolation (OR 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.61).

These molecules function as both gastrointestinal toxins and superantigens (SAgs) which can simultaneously bind MHC-II and T cell receptor leading to a non-specific polyclonal T cell activation and massive proinflammatory cytokine release. Common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea; however, in more severe cases, systemic dissemination may result in toxic shock syndrome and can be lethal in a few hours. Only small amounts of these heat-stable toxins are needed to cause the disease. Therefore, it is highly important to detect quickly low concentrations of SAgs in biological samples. In this work, we report a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based capture immunoassay for the detection of the SAg SEG. We analyzed the use of different amplification strategies. The SPR-based double-antibody sandwich approach could detect picomolar levels of SEG. The use of antibody-coated silica nanoparticles (AbSiNPs) as an alternative enhancing reagent also detected SEG in the picomolar range. Although AbSiNPs did not improve the limit of detection, for the same amount of SAg tested, AbSiNPs gave a higher response level than free antibodies. This work highlights the suitability of silica nanoparticles for signal amplification in SPR-based biosensors. Overall, SPR biosensors offer the capability for continuous real-time monitoring and high sensitivity that can be befitting for the detection of enterotoxins in food industries, laboratories and regulatory agencies.","Belen, Sarratea Maria; Sofía, Noli Truant; Romina, Mitarotonda; Belén, Antonoglou María; Santiago, Chiappini; María Julieta, Fernández Lynch; Pablo, Romasanta; Cristina, Vescina; Martín, Desimone; Mauricio, De Marzi; Emilio, Malchiodi; Marisa, Fernández",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,481,6

A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival. Our results suggest that Morrbid contributes to JMML pathogenesis.","Cai, Zhigang; Zhang, Chi; Kotzin, Jonathan J; Williams, Adam; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Kapur, Reuben",Blood Adv,481,9

Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested. The predicted CTL epitopes were then tested to eliminate those with MHC class II binding potential, a property that could induce hyperinflammatory responses mediated by TH2 cells in immunized hosts. Eighteen of the 50 epitopes did not show class II binding potential. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis on the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 for prediction of CTL epitopes lacking binding properties that could stimulate unwanted TH2 responses.

Lack of diversity is detrimental to patient care, physician well-being, and the relevance of cardiothoracic surgery on our nation's health. Recent events, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, have further accentuated the gross inequities that underrepresented minorities face in our country and have reignited conversations on how to address bias and systemic racism within our institutions. The field of cardiothoracic surgery has a responsibility to adopt a culture of diversity and inclusion. This kind of systemic change is daunting and overwhelming. With bias ubiquitously entangled with everyday experiences, it can be difficult to know where to start. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Diversity and Inclusion presents this approach for addressing diversity and inclusion in cardiothoracic surgery. This framework was adapted from a model developed by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and includes information and recommendations generated from our literature review on diversity and inclusion. A MEDLINE search was conducted using keywords ""diversity,"" ""inclusion,"" and ""surgery,"" and approaches to diversity and inclusion were drawn from publications in medicine as well as non-healthcare fields. Recommendations were generated and approved by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Executive Committee. We present an overarching framework that conceptualizes diversity and inclusion efforts in a series of concentric spheres of influence, from the global environment to the cardiothoracic community, institution, and the individual surgeon. This framework organizes the approach to diversity and inclusion, grouping interventions by level while maintaining a broader perspective of how each sphere is interconnected. We include the following key recommendations within the spheres of influence: It is important to note that each of the spheres of influence is interconnected. Interventions to improve diversity must be coordinated across spheres for concerted change. Altogether, this multilevel framework (global environment, cardiothoracic community, institution, and individual) offers an organized approach for cardiothoracic surgery to assess, improve, and sustain progress in diversity and inclusion.","Erkmen, Cherie P; Ortmeyer, Katherine A; Pelletier, Glenn J; Preventza, Ourania; Cooke, David T",Ann Thorac Surg,481,16

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","Cheng, Zenghui; Lu, Yong; Cao, Qiqi; Qin, Le; Pan, Zilai; Yan, Fuhua; Yang, Wenjie",AJR Am J Roentgenol,481,33

Extensions or duplicates of rural social assistance programmes do not reflect the distinct vulnerabilities of the urban poor, who face higher living costs and more precarious employment, and are not reached by social insurance schemes that are designed for formally employed workers. Neither the Sustainable Development Goals nor the New Urban Agenda reflect a specific focus on urban social protection. COVID-19 has exposed this major gap in coverage, given the disproportionate impact of lockdowns on the livelihoods of the urban poor. To ‘build back better’ post COVID-19, we propose rights-based national social protection systems with two components: categorical social assistance for non-working vulnerable groups (children, older persons, persons with disability) and universal social insurance for all working adults (formal, informal or self-employed), financed out of general revenues rather than mandatory contributions by employees and employers. These ideas are explored in the case of South Africa, which has comprehensive social assistance but inadequate social insurance for urban informal workers.

In this research we investigate how meteorological conditions and air pollution, as concurring factors, impact COVID-19 transmission, using data on new confirmed cases from 219 prefecture cities from January 24 to February 29, 2020. Results revealed a kind of nonlinear dose-response relationship between temperature and coronavirus transmission. We also found that air pollution indicators are positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the coronavirus further spreads by 5-7% as the AQI increases by 10 units. Further analysis based on regional divisions revealed that in northern China the negative effects of rising temperature on COVID-19 is counteracted by aggravated air pollution. In the southern cities, the ambient temperature and air pollution have a negative interactive effect on COVID-19 transmission, implying that rising temperature restrains the facilitating effects of air pollution and that they jointly lead to a decrease in new confirmed cases. These results provide implications for the control and prevention of this disease and for the anticipation of another possible pandemic.","Zhang, Zhenbo; Xue, Ting; Jin, Xiaoyu",Sci Total Environ,481,1

Analysis of urban characteristics in the face of the challenge of the post-COVID 19 city: The case of Madrid,16.08683,3.4250343,2020,"Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i) the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality that were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii) the potential role of the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection.","Miotto, Mattia; Di Rienzo, Lorenzo; Gosti, Giorgio; Milanetti, Edoardo; Ruocco, Giancarlo",PLoS One,481,1

Here different symptoms of neurological and/or cardiological origin have been reported. With symptoms, which are very similar to the ones reported but are not caused by SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of functionally active autoantibodies (fAABs) targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAABs) has been discussed to be involved. We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-fAABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-fAABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-fAAB detection). Other GPCR-fAABs, in opposite, cause a negative chronotropic effect on those cells. The positive chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified in the blood of Long-COVID patients targeted the ß2-adrenoceptor (ß2-fAAB), the &#945;1-adrenoceptor (&#945;1-fAAB), the angiotensin II AT1-receptor (AT1-fAAB), and the nociceptin-like opioid receptor (NOC-fAAB). The negative chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified targeted the muscarinic M2-receptor (M2-fAAB), the MAS-receptor (MAS-fAAB), and the ETA-receptor (ETA-fAAB). It was analysed which of the extracellular receptor loops was targeted by the autoantibodies.","Wallukat, Gerd; Hohberger, Bettina; Wenzel, Katrin; Fürst, Julia; Schulze-Rothe, Sara; Wallukat, Anne; Hönicke, Anne-Sophie; Müller, Johannes",J Transl Autoimmun,481,16

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine which virtual communication method (ie, telephone call or video call) was preferred by confined older hospital patients and nursing home residents and the variables influencing this preference. METHODS: The TOVID (Telephony Or Videophony for Isolated elDerly) study was a cross-sectional study that was designed to examine the preference between telephone calls and video calls among frail older adults who were either hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit or institutionalized in a long-term care and nursing home during the COVID-19 confinement period. RESULTS: A total of 132 older people were surveyed between March 25 and May 11, 2020 (mean age 88.2 years, SD 6.2); 79 (59.8%) were women. Patients hospitalized in the geriatric acute care unit were more able to establish communication independently than residents institutionalized in the long-term care and nursing home (P=.03) and were more satisfied with their communication experiences (P=.02). Overall, older people tended to favor telephone calls (73/132, 55.3%) over video calls (59/132, 44.7%); however, their satisfaction degree was similar regardless of the chosen method (P=.1), with no effect of age (P=.97) or gender (P=.2). In the geriatric acute care unit, the satisfaction degrees were similar for telephone calls (40/41, 98%) and video calls (33/38, 87%) in older patients (P=.10). Conversely, in the long-term care and nursing home, residents were more satisfied with the use of video calls to communicate with their relatives (14/15, 93%) versus the use of telephone calls (6/12, 50%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Older people confined to health care settings were able to complete telephone calls more independently than video calls, and they tended to use telephone calls more often than video calls. The satisfaction degrees were similar with both modalities and even greater with video calls among long-term care and nursing home residents when they were given assistance to establish communication.

METHODS: A total of 45 patients with CF and their mothers were enrolled in the study together with 90 age-matched healthy children and their mothers as a control group. The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered by teleconference with children aged 13 to 18 years old and their mothers. The STAI for children was administered with children aged 9 to 12 years. Results were compared with age-matched healthy children and their mothers. The relationship between anxiety scores of children with CF and their mothers was evaluated by comparing with clinical data of children with CF. At the conclusion of the teleconference, mothers were asked whether their anxiety had changed as a result of the interview. RESULTS: It was found that healthy children aged 13 to 18 years had higher state anxiety scores than age-matched children with CF. Mothers of children with CF had higher trait anxiety scores, especially those of children aged 0 to 12 years, than mothers of healthy children (P < .05). For mothers of children with CF, state anxiety scores were higher among those whose children had chronic Pseudomonas infection (P < .05). Most mothers of children with CF stated that their anxiety decreased following the interview. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety among mothers of children with CF as well those with healthy children. However, COVID-19 had no effect on the anxiety of children with CF. Informing parents of children with CF about COVID-19 by teleconference may decrease anxiety.","Pinar Senkalfa, Burcu; Sismanlar Eyuboglu, Tugba; Aslan, Ayse T; Ramasli Gursoy, Tugba; Soysal, Azime S; Yapar, Dilek; Ilhan, Mustafa N",Pediatr Pulmonol,481,24

METHODS: A survey was distributed to 14 different hospitals of the Milan area to analyze the variation of EGS procedures. Each hospital reported the number of EGS procedures in the same time frame comparing 2019 and 2020. The survey revealed that the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 was reduced by 19% when compared with 2019. The decrease was statistically significant only for abdominal wall surgery. Interestingly, in 2020, there was an increase of three procedures: surgical intervention for acute mesenteric ischemia (p = 0.002), drainage of perianal abscesses (p = 0.000285), and cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons 'decision making' process. The increase of acute mesenteric ischaemia and perianal abscess might be related to the modification of dietary habits and reduction of physical activity related to the lockdown.","Kurihara, Hayato; Marrano, Enrico; Ceolin, Martina; Chiara, Osvaldo; Faccincani, Roberto; Bisagni, Pietro; Fattori, Luca; Zago, Mauro",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,481,1

Since the very beginning, the spread of the virus has been tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing efforts. As of March 2021, more than 830,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this first pandemic year. In parallel, nomenclatures systems, often with poor consistency among each other, have been developed to designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible, SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during the first ~ 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission. At the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, though, some alarming events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically, three new viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been described as variants of concern (VOC). These variants were first reported in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). Their designation as VOCs was determined by an increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from immunocompromised patients with long-term infection, suggesting a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to the identification of these lineages, as well as emerging data concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes, reinfection risk, vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential. Most of the available evidence is, to date, provisional, but still represents a starting point to uncover the potential threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic surveillance must be strengthened, especially in the wake of the vaccination campaigns.","González-Candelas, Fernando; Shaw, Marie-Anne; Phan, Tung; Kulkarni-Kale, Urmila; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Luciani, Fabio; Kimura, Hirokazu; Sironi, Manuela",Infect Genet Evol,481,16

RDV is a relatively new chemical entity, 'ester prodrug', with no reported stability profile. Due to the urgency of its use and thus fast production, it is important to develop a stability-indicating method for its assay. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) with dual detection: diode array at 240 nm and fluorescence at &#955;ex/em 245/390 nm. Isocratic elution of acetonitrile and distilled water (acidified with phosphoric acid, pH 4) in the ratio of 55:45 (v/v), respectively, was used. The linearity range using HPLC-diode array detection was 0.1-15 µg/mL, whereas that using fluorimetric detection was 0.05-15 µg/mL. As per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, RDV has been degraded by accelerated alkaline, acidic, neutral hydrolysis, oxidative, heat, and photolytic stress conditions. Possible degradation hypothesis of the parent molecule has been suggested and illustrated. The proposed methods have achieved selective determination of the intact drug with no peaks overlapping in all assumptions. Extensive degradation confirms threatened drug stability at thermal and basic hydrolytic stressing.

We used an automated machine learning approach where 1594 viral genomes with available clinical follow-up data were used as the training set (797 'severe' and 797 'mild'). The best algorithm, based on random forest classification combined with the LASSO feature selection algorithm, was employed to the training set to link mutation signatures and outcome. The performance of the final model was estimated by repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross validation (CV) and then adjusted for multiple testing with Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV. We identified 26 protein and Untranslated Region (UTR) mutations significantly linked to severe outcome.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the wider factors influencing and impacting upon hospital doctors' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and mixed quantitative-qualitative analysis. SETTING: Acute National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England. PARTICIPANTS: An online survey was circulated in early June 2020 to all 449 doctors employed by the Trust. 242 doctors completed the survey (54% response rate). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Questions assessed occupational details, self-reported changes in physical and mental health, satisfaction with working hours and patterns, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), medication and facilities, communication and sought to identify areas seen as having a significant effect on doctors' well-being. RESULTS: 96% of respondents requiring PPE were able to access it. Nearly half of the respondents felt that their mental health had deteriorated since the start of the pandemic. Over a third stated that their physical health had also declined. Issues identified as having a negative impact on doctors included increased workload, redeployment, loss of autonomy, personal issues affecting family members, anxiety around recovery plans, inadequate access to changing and storage facilities and to rest areas that allow for social distancing. Doctors appreciated access to 'calm rooms' that were made available for staff, access to clinical psychology support, free drinks and free car parking on site. CONCLUSION: The emerging themes are suggestive of increased burnout risk among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and encompass factors well beyond shortage of PPE. Small organisational initiatives and the implementation of changes suggested by survey respondents can have a positive impact on doctors' well-being.","Cubitt, Lyndsey Jayne; Im, Yu Ri; Scott, Ciaran James; Jeynes, Louise Claire; Molyneux, Paul David",BMJ Open,481,23

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious multisystem disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), man-ifested by acute respiratory symptoms. The novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is the most common serious clinical mani-festation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the severe NCP, the sys-temic manifestations of the disease were also demonstrated, and one of the rare complications, first described in Wuhan (China), is pneumothorax. Case report. A 65-year-old female was admitted to the Clinic for Pulmonology with a high fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and general weakness that started five days before. Laboratory findings revealed lympho-penia, elevated values of inflammatory markers, and liver le-sion. A chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated diffusely accentuated interstitial pattern and reduced parenchymal transparency, left perihilar. Positive SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab sam-ple was detected in the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), confirming the diagnosis of NCP. Immediately, nasal oxygen therapy with a flow rate of 8 L/min, with chloroquine phosphate, antibiotics, and symp-tomatic treatment, was initiated. On the 8th day, her condition suddenly deteriorated, and she developed severe hypoxemia. A repeated CXR showed complete left-sided pneumotho-rax. Thoracic drainage was successfully performed with com-plete reexpansion of the lungs the very next day. The patient was released from the hospital in good general condition with normal arterial blood gases. Conclusion. Pneumothorax may develop as a complication in patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, without previous pulmonary comorbidities, due to alveolar damage. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation in these patients should raise the suspicion of pneumothorax. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are nec-essary to reduce mortality.","Novkovic, L.; Cekerevac, I.",Vojnosanitetski Pregled,481,20

We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms. MATERIALS & METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2 ± 19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR = 7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR = 3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR = 3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR = 3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR = 3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has effects in epilepsy patients. Patients with tumor-related, drug-resistant epilepsy, insomnia, and economic difficulties are at a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine represents a suitable tool in this setting.","Fonseca, Elena; Quintana, Manuel; Lallana, Sofía; Luis Restrepo, Juan; Abraira, Laura; Santamarina, Estevo; Seijo-Raposo, Iván; Toledo, Manuel",Acta neurol. scand,481,30

Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escapes LY-CoV016). In addition, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail.

Healthcare professionals deserve some level of basic psychological need satisfaction in the area of job autonomy. Reasons that lead to employees achieving job autonomy and job satisfaction have been researched by industrial and organizational psychologists but very few of such studies have directed their attention towards the role psychological capital can play. Therefore, this study sought to find out how much of an impact positive psychology can make on the job autonomy of healthcare employees leading to the fulfillment of job satisfaction. Methods: Data were collected from 385 healthcare professionals from the public sector. A structural equation model was performed to analyze the relationship that exists between the constructs of psychological capital and job autonomy leading to job satisfaction on the part of the employees. Results: Results showed both a direct and indirect positive relationship between hope and job satisfaction and indirect through job autonomy. Apart from self-efficacy, that had a very low positive relationship, optimism largely influenced job autonomy of healthcare professionals. Results also showed that psychological capital positively related to job autonomy while job autonomy minimally influenced job satisfaction. Conclusions: It is concluded from this study that healthcare professionals deserve some level of basic psychological need satisfaction in the area of job autonomy and that can stimulate positive work ethic.","Dai, Baozhen; Akey-Torku, Benedicta",,481,20

To date, several studies have investigated why certain people experience discomfort when looking at clustered patterns. Recently, ""involuntary protection against dermatosis"" (IPAD) hypothesis was proposed to explain the causes of trypophobia. The IPAD hypothesis suggests that involuntary aversive responses to skin diseases cause discomfort in response to image clusters. However, this idea has not been fully investigated empirically. Therefore, the present study used a modified version of the priming procedure and tested whether the activation of the concept of skin-related diseases affected the evaluation of trypophobic images. In Experiment 1, participants engaged in a lexical decision task in which words related to skin problems, negative events, or neutral events were presented. Then, they evaluated the discomfort of trypophobic, negative, and neutral images. The results indicated that participants evaluated trypophobic images as more discomforting after they were exposed to skin-problem-related words, whereas the exposure to words related to skin-problems did not enhance the discomfort of negative images. These findings demonstrate that the association with skin-related problems increases the discomfort of trypophobic images. In Experiment 2, we further tested the reproducibility of the priming effect observed in Experiment 1 and investigated the effect of priming with words related to COVID-19 in the context of a spreading infection. Contrary to predictions, no priming effect was produced by either skin-related words or COVID-19-related words. Future studies should further explore the causal relationship of the association between skin disease and trypophobia.","Shirai, Risako; Ogawa, Hirokazu",Sci Rep,481,24

Recently, early clinical data reported the feasibility of low doses of radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of ARDS in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the involved mechanisms remained unknown. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Here, we used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. RESULTS: Low doses of RT (0.5-1 Gray) decreased LPS-induced pneumonia, and increased the percentage of nerve- and airway-associated macrophages producing interleukin (IL) 10. During H1N1 viral infection, we observed decreased lung tissue damage and immune cell infiltration in irradiated animals. Low doses of RT increased IL-10 production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Irradiation of TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo increased IL-10 secretion and decreased interferon Î³ production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight a mechanism by which low doses of RT regulate lung inflammation and skew lung macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory profile. These data provide a preclinical mechanistic support to clinical trials evaluating low doses of RT, such as COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Meziani, Lydia; Robert, Charlotte; Classe, Marion; Da Costa, Bruno; Mondini, Michele; Clémenson, Céline; Alfaro, Alexia; Mordant, Pierre; Ammari, Samy; Le Goffic, Ronan; Deutsch, Eric",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,481,24

The process of securitization is a financial innovation, which some financial analysts consider one of the causes of the Great Financial Crisis. Although it is often linked to the emergence of the Great Financial Crisis, the advantages of the securitization model, together with a level of adaptability and enhanced process control throughout all procedural levels, significantly outweigh its perceived shortcomings. The financial system of the Republic of Srpska continues to be characterized by the growth of nonperforming loans in bank assets, mainly caused by increased systemic risk due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and declining economic activity in the country, but also by a well-developed financial system infrastructure, which is necessary in order to allow the application of the securitization model to significantly contribute to increasing financial stability in the conditions of volatile financial structure. The model of securitization of nonperforming loans and its application in the process of bank restructuring can be the mainstay of the stabilization of the financial system. The aim of the research is to demonstrate that the application of the adapted securitization model of nonperforming assets of banks and its application in the process of bank restructuring in the conditions of unstable financial structure may contribute to financial stability and control of increase of a systemic risk. Securitization increases the supply of quality financial instruments, the number of participants in the process of transformation of financial assets and develops a more resilient financial market. The results include emergence of additional funding sources for financial institutions, generation of nonperforming assets' problems, with additional liquidity and diversification for many of their clients. © 2021 Dragana Bašić et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Bašić, D.; Ćurić, P.",Economics,481,24

We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases. RESULTS: One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% v. 72%, p = 0.03) or to have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% v. 18%, p < 0.01). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and medical history or symptoms.

This study compared COVID-19-related outcomes in pregnant women versus non-pregnant women after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 y) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and age. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The initial sample comprised of 5183 pregnant and 175,908 non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation, and ICU admission in pregnant and non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs. 1.5%, 9.9% vs. 6.5%, 8.1% vs. 9.9%, 13.0% vs. 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant- and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 1·65, 95% CI 1·30-2.09), pneumonia (OR 1·99, 95% CI 1·81-2·19) and ICU admission (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1·86-2·71) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR 0·93, 95% CI 0·70-1·25). CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for background demographic and medical factors, pregnancy is a risk factor for death, intubation and ICU admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected women of reproductive age.

The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic causing potentially large swings, thus presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human-natural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may influence electric power grid risks, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domains interconnections. Our study provides an important first step towards data-driven analysis and predictive modeling of risks in the coupled interconnected systems. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators.","Che-Castaldo, Judy P.; Cousin, R'emi; Daryanto, Stefani; Deng, Grace; Feng, Mei-Ling E.; Gupta, Rajesh K.; Hong, Dezhi; McGranaghan, Ryan M.; Owolabi, Olukunle O.; Qu, Tianyi; Ren, Wei; Schafer, Toryn L.

Methods: We gathered data from all 18 staff members with COVID-19 in ALDs in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, China. The baseline, job before diagnosis, presumed infection environment, use of protective equipment, and psychological status before and after diagnosis were collected and analyzed. A total of 18 uninfected staff members working alongside them in the same environment and 18 random matched infected doctors and nurses formed two control groups; the psychological impact of these three groups was then compared. Results: Of the 18 members of staff, 88.89% were infected due to the working environment (hospital), and nine had face-to-face conversations with doctors and nurses in their daily work. Many staff members did not take any protective measures in their routine work. Before they were diagnosed, 12 staff members were aware of the seriousness of the epidemic, and most of the staff maintained a neutral attitude to the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 77.78% of the staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes after diagnosis, which were mainly caused by family health and disease related issues. Most of them managed their emotions by self-control and video calls with their families. There was no significant difference in psychological impact among the three groups, but uninfected staff members were fully aware of the seriousness of the epidemic. Conclusions: Effective protective measures should be taken for staff members in ALDs. Psychological interventions are very important to help infected staff members in ALDs cope with psychological distress.","Luo, Li-Sha; Jin, Ying-Hui; Cai, Lin; Pan, Zhen-Yu; Zeng, Xian-Tao; Wang, Xing-Huan",Front.

A methodology is proposed for the determination of maximum pool size and adjustments of cut-off values of cycle threshold (Ct in RT-qPCR pool testing, to compensate for the dilution caused by pooling. The trade-off between pool size and test sensitivity is stated explicitly. The procedure was designed to ensure that samples that would be detectable in individual testing remain detectable in pool testing. The proposed relaxation in cut-off is dependent on the pool size, allowing a relatively tight correction to avoid loss of detection of positive samples. The methodology was evaluated in a study of pool testing of adults attending a public emergency care unit, reference for COVID-19 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and presenting flu-like symptoms. Even samples on the edge of detectability in individual testing were detected correctly. The proposed procedure enhances the consistency of RT-qPCR pool testing by enforcing that the scales of detectability in pool processing and in individual sample processing are compatible.

Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days. The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days. Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, and troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP, and D-dimer levels.

The trustworthiness of guidelines can vary depending on the methods used to assemble and evaluate the evidence, the completeness and transparency of reporting on the process undertaken and how conflicts of interest are addressed. With a global consortium of partners and collaborators, we have created a catalogue of COVID-19 recommendations as our direct response to the increased need for structured access to high quality guidance in the field. The COVID19 map of recommendations and gateway to contextualization (https://covid19.recmap.org) is a living project: emerging guideline literature is added on an ongoing basis, allowing granular access to individual recommendations. Building on prior work on mapping recommendations for the World Health Organization tuberculosis guidelines, a novel feature of this map is the self-directed contextualization of the recommendations using the GRADE-Adolopment approach to adopt, adapt or synthesize de novo recommendations for context specific questions. Through our map, stakeholders access the evidence underpinning a recommendation, select what needs to be contextualized and go through the steps of development of adapted recommendations. This one-stop shop portal of evidence-informed recommendations, built with intuitive functionalities, easy to navigate and with a support team ready to guide users across the maps, represents a long-needed tool for decision-makers, guideline developers and the public at large.","Lotfi, Tamara; Stevens, Adrienne; Akl, Elie A; Falavigna, Maicon; Kredo, Tamara; Mathew, Joseph L; Schünemann, Holger J",J. clin. epidemiol,481,6

Understanding patients' perceptions of the disruptions in care and their willingness to reengage the healthcare system are crucial to planning the resumption of elective care. Questions/Purposes: The purpose of this study was to elicit patient perceptions about delays in total joint arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We identified a consecutive series of patients who experienced COVID-19-driven delays to scheduled total hip or knee arthroplasty at an urban, academic medical center in the Southeastern United States. A 20-item survey was administered via telephone. Answers were recorded and descriptive statistics were performed. A post hoc &#967;-square analysis compared characteristics and outlooks of patients who did and did not immediately desire surgery. Results: Of 111 patients (64% of those identified) who met inclusion criteria and completed the survey, 96% said they felt that they were treated fairly and 90% said that the surgical delay was in their best interest; 68% reported emotional distress from the delay, but 45% reported a desire to wait longer for the pandemic to subside. Lower joint-function scores, higher pain levels, higher pain catastrophizing scores, and longer latency from personally deciding to pursue surgery were associated with the reported need for immediate surgery. Conclusion: Overall, patients reported that they understood the need for elective surgical delays during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the psychological implications they reported were not negligible. Patient preference for immediate reengagement with the healthcare system was dichotomous, with many patients favoring precautionarily furthering the delay. Understanding these preferences will help optimize elective orthopedic care during unprecedented times.","Wilson, Jacob M; Schwartz, Andrew M; Grissom, Helyn E; Holmes, Jeffrey S; Farley, Kevin X; Bradbury, Thomas L; Guild, George N",HSS J,481,24

High sensitivity, incredible miniaturization capability, promising extremely low minimum limit of detection (LoD) at the molecular level, integration with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and last but not least label-free operation were amongst the predominant motives for highlighting these sensors in the biosensor community. Although there are various diseases targeted by FET sensors for detection, infectious diseases are still the most demanding sector that needs higher precision in detection and integration for the realization of the diagnosis at the point of care (PoC). The COVID-19 pandemic, nevertheless, was an example of the escalated situation in terms of worldwide desperate need for fast, specific and reliable home test PoC devices for the timely screening of huge numbers of people to restrict the disease from further spread. This need spawned a wave of innovative approaches for early detection of COVID-19 antibodies in human swab or blood amongst which the FET biosensing gained much more attention due to their extraordinary LoD down to femtomolar (fM) with the comparatively faster response time. As the FET sensors are promising novel PoC devices with application in early diagnosis of various diseases and especially infectious diseases, in this research, we have reviewed the recent progress on developing FET sensors for infectious diseases diagnosis accompanied with a thorough discussion on the structure of Chem/BioFET sensors and the readout circuitry for output signal processing. This approach would help engineers and biologists to gain enough knowledge to initiate their design for accelerated innovations in response to the need for more efficient management of infectious diseases like COVID-19.","Panahi, A.; Sadighbayan, D.; Forouhi, S.; Ghafar-Zadeh, E.",Biosensors,481,24

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused more than two million deaths worldwide and affected people's physical and mental health. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are generally required to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms at least for 14 days in the case the disease turns towards severe complications. Here, we overviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the patients' general health with a focus on their cardiovascular, respiratory and mental health, and investigated several existing patient monitoring systems. We addressed the limitations of these systems and proposed a wearable telehealth solution for monitoring a set of physiological parameters that are critical for COVID-19 patients such as body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and cough. This physiological information can be further combined to potentially estimate the lung function using artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor fusion techniques. The prototype, which includes the hardware and a smartphone app, showed promising results with performance comparable to or better than similar commercial devices, thus potentially making the proposed system an ideal wearable solution for long-term monitoring of COVID-19 patients and other chronic diseases.","Jiang, Wei; Majumder, Sumit; Subramaniam, Sophini; Li, Xiaohe; Khedri, Ridha; Monday, Tapas; Abolghasemian, Mansour; Satia, Imran; Deen, M Jamal",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering (Online),481,20

While less pathogenic than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV, this novel betacoronavirus presents a global threat due to its high transmission rate, ability to invade multiple tissues, and ability to trigger immunological hyperactivation. The identification of the animal reservoir and intermediate host were important steps toward slowing the spread of disease, and its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV has helped to determine pathogenesis and direct treatment strategies. The exponential increase in cases has necessitated fast and reliable testing procedures. Although RT-PCR remains the gold standard, it is a time-consuming procedure, paving the way for newer techniques such as serologic tests and enzyme immunoassays. Various clinical trials using broad antiviral agents in addition to novel medications have produced controversial results; however, the advancement of immunotherapy, particularly monoclonal antibodies and immune modulators is showing great promise in clinical trials. Non-orthodox medications such as anti-malarials have been tested in multiple institutions but definitive conclusions are yet to be made. Adjuvant therapies have also proven to be effective in decreasing mortality in the disease course.

DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24·6 (sd 2·0) years, 70·2 % female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULTS: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28·4 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 41·0 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19. Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for more food assistance and relief funds.

Self-injectors in Malawi and Uganda are currently instructed to store used units in containers and return them to health workers for disposal. However, this may not be feasible in low-resource settings, especially for younger or covert self-injectors. We describe adolescent (15-19 years) and adult (20-49 years) self-injectors' disposal experiences in Uganda and Malawi. When possible, we compare covert and overt users' experiences. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional qualitative studies in 2019 with 50 self-injectors in Uganda and 60 in Malawi. We purposively selected approximately half adolescents and included those trained by clinic-based providers and community health workers. We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic data analysis and compared the findings across settings. RESULTS: Just under half of both samples were adolescents, substantially more of whom were covert users in Uganda (68%) than Malawi (~ 10%). Most participants reported being told to store used units in a container and return them to health workers. About two-thirds of Uganda participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, most commonly returning them to health workers. Over one-third of Malawi participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, slightly more disposed into latrines compared to returning to health workers. Participants in both settings reported compliance with health workers' disposal instructions as a primary reason for their disposal method. One-fifth of Uganda participants, mostly adolescent covert users, and one-quarter in Malawi said they were told they could dispose into latrines, and often did so. The majority in both settings said they would prefer to dispose units in latrines because they worried about needlestick injuries to others and because it was convenient. Some Uganda adolescent covert users felt returning units to health workers was challenging due to privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: While most self-injectors disposed of used units as instructed, findings from both studies suggest that returning units to health workers is not preferred and may not be feasible for some adolescent covert users. More convenient disposal solutions should be identified.","Burke, Holly M; Packer, Catherine; Wando, Laura; Wandiembe, Symon Peter; Muwereza, Nelson; Pradhan, Subarna; Zingani, Akuzike; Ngwira, Bagrey",Reprod Health,481,16

Each experience included the collective review of a case study and student-developed care plans before viewing and debriefing a series of videos. Students summarized their experience in a weekly written reflection. RESULTS: Student feedback was examined through their reflections and verbal responses. The videos served as catalysts for robust discussion. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive related to an interactive experience, a heightened sense of teamwork, and enhanced comprehension by sharing differing perspectives of common experiences.

In this paper, we introduce RelicVR, a virtual reality (VR) game that encourages players to discover artifacts through physical interaction in a game-based approach. Players need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure by using available tools and physical movements. The game relies on the dynamic voxel deformation technique to allow players to chip away earth covering the artifacts. We added uncertainty in the exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological discovery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features of the hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually but strategically without hitting the artifact itself. From playtesting sessions with eight participants, we found that the uncertainty elements are conducive to their engagement and exploration experience. Overall, RelicVR is an innovative game that can improve players' learning motivation and outcomes of ancient artifacts.","Liu, Yilin; Lin, Yiming; Shi, Rongkai; Luo, Yiming; Liang, Hai-Ning",,481,12

In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic.

The primary outcome was the measurement of antibody antiHBs before the first Fendrix® dose and a month after the administration of each dose. Other outcome was collection of adverse effects during administration and all those that could be related to the vaccine and that occur within 30 days after each dose. In this study, only one group was assigned. There was no randomization or masking. RESULTS: The participants were recruited between April 13, 2018 and October 31, 2019. 67 participants were enrolled in the Clinical Trial and included the analyses. The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix®, administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose. Once the positivity was reached in any of the doses, the participant finished the study and was not given the following doses. 68.66% (46 out 67) had a positive response to first dose of Fendrix®. 57.14% (12 out 21) had a positive response to second dose of Fendrix®. 22.22% (2 out 9) had a positive response to third dose of Fendrix and 42.96% (3 out 7) had a positive response to last dose of Fendrix®. Overall, 94.02% (64 out 67) of participants had a positive response to Fendrix®. No serious adverse event occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Fendrix®, is a viable vaccine alternative for NHS workers classified as ""non-responders"". Revaccination of healthy non-responders with Fendrix®, resulted in very high proportions of responders without adverse events.

To support clinical development of BMS-986178 (an OX40 agonist antibody), two repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. In the first study, BMS-986178 was administered intravenously (IV) once weekly for one month at doses from 30 to 120â¯mg/kg. BMS-986178 was well tolerated; surprisingly, immune function was suppressed rather than increased based on pharmacodynamic (PD) and flow cytometry readouts (e.g. T-cell dependent antibody response [TDAR]). To determine whether immune suppression was due to a bi-phasic response, a follow-up study was conducted at lower doses (1 and 10â¯mg/kg). Although receptor engagement was confirmed, immune function was still suppressed at both doses. In addition, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 1â¯mg/kg resulted in hypersensitivity reactions and reduced BMS-986178 exposure after repeated dosing, which precluded a full PD assessment at this dose. In conclusion, BMS-986178 was clinically well-tolerated by monkeys at weekly IV doses from 10 to 120â¯mg/kg (AUC[0-168]â¯&#8804;â¯712,000â¯µgâh/mL). However, despite target engagement, PD assays and other immune endpoints demonstrated immune suppression, not stimulation. Due to the inverted immune response at higher doses and the onset of ADAs, additional repeat-dose toxicity studies of BMS-986178 in monkeys (that would typically be required to support Phase 3 clinical trials and registration) would not add value for human safety assessment.","Gamse, Joshua T; Freebern, Wendy; Haynes Ii, Rashade; Simutis, Frank; Pazian, Mary; Crona, James; Haggerty, Helen G; Graziano, Michael; Bunch, Roderick Todd",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,481,1

We utilize the published data on the single stranded RNAs of 11,132 SARS-CoV-2 patients in the GISAID database, which contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Among many important research questions which are currently being investigated, one aspect pertains to the genetic characterization/classification of the virus. We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modeling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, and so forth, we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index. Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. This is in line with a phylogenetic analysis which we use to contrast our results. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups. It is the subject of ongoing research to examine whether the genetic subgroup could be related to diseases outcome and its potential implications for vaccine development.","Hahn, Georg; Lee, Sanghun; Weiss, Scott T; Lange, Christoph",Genet Epidemiol,481,1

The majority of people who contract COVID-19 experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without special treatment. However, for many COVID-19 has proved to be fatal. Despite the global challenge, policy responses across different countries have varied considerably. This study explored the impact of policy decisions by comparing the transmission rates and COVID-19 related fatalities between 1st and 30th April 2020 within different countries, based on the government policies implemented. Methods: A predictive analytics algorithm was developed to identify factors impacting on the transmission and fatalities of COVID-19. This utilized data related to the disease spread and policy responses in 185 countries around the world from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Bespoke algorithms were used for pre-processing the data for extracting relevant government policies, imputing missing values, eliminating less contributory factors, and selecting the most informative variables. Results: Stay at home policies, restriction on gathering and international travel controls were associated with a reduced number of confirmed cases and resulting fatalities. However, factors including the number of daily tests performed and contact tracing appeared to be less contributory compared against alternative measures implemented to contain the pandemic. Conclusions: Experimental results suggested that proactive approaches to implementing all policy decisions result in a greater impact on the outcomes achieved. This is particularly true for policies such as test and trace, which is more effective at the beginning of an outbreak when there are fewer chains of transmission. Once the COVID-19 cases rise significantly, the testing process becomes ineffective and has a minimal impact on the disease spread and therefore lockdown implementation becomes a more efficient way of controlling the pandemic.","Kamgar, F.; Hughes, R.; Lucherini, S.",Value in Health,481,10

Once we return to the normalization of the lifestyle, there will be a backlog of unoperated pending cases along with the possibility of further spread of the coronavirus. Methods: We reviewed the available literature and protocols for neurosurgical practice in different geographic locations. We drafted a consensus statement based on the literature and protocols suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and various professional societies to prevent the spread of SARS-COV2 while streamlining the neurosurgical practice. Results: The consensus statement suggests the patient triage, workflow, resource distribution, and operational efficacy for care providers at different stages of management.

Transfusion of allogeneic blood, while necessary, is not benign, and has been associated with increased rates of wound complication, venous thromboembolism, delirium, and death. PURPOSE: To develop a prediction tool capable of predicting IOBL and risk of requiring allogeneic transfusion in patients undergoing surgery for vertebral column tumors. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective, single-center study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive series of 274 patients undergoing 350 unique operations for primary or metastatic spinal column tumors over a 46-month period at a comprehensive cancer center OUTCOME MEASURES: IOBL (in mL), use of intraoperative blood products, and intraoperative blood products transfused. METHODS: We identified IOBL and transfusions, along with demographic data, preoperative laboratory data, and surgical procedures performed. Independent predictors of IOBL and transfusion risk were identified using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 57.0±13.6 years, 53.1% were male, and 67.1% were treated for metastatic lesions. Independent predictors of IOBL included en bloc resection (p<.001), surgical invasiveness (ß=25.43 per point; p<0.001), and preoperative albumin (ß=-244.86 per g/dL; p=0.011). Predictors of transfusion risk included preoperative hematocrit (odds ratio [OR]=0.88 per %; 95% confidence interval [CI, 0.84, 0.93]; p<0.001), preoperative MCHgb (OR=0.88 per pg; 95% CI [0.78, 1.00]; p=0.048), preoperative red cell distribution width (OR=1.32 per %; 95% CI [1.13, 1.55]; p<0.001), en bloc resection (OR=3.17; 95%CI [1.33, 7.54]; p=0.009), and surgical invasiveness (OR=1.08 per point; [1.06; 1.11]; p<0.001). The transfusion model showed a good fit of the data with an optimism-corrected area under the curve of 0.819. A freely available, web-based calculator was developed for the transfusion risk model (https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/TRUST/). CONCLUSIONS: Here we present the first clinical calculator for intraoperative blood loss and transfusion risk in patients being treated for primary or metastatic vertebral column tumors. Surgical invasiveness and preoperative microcytic anemia most strongly predict transfusion risk. The resultant calculators may prove clinically useful for surgeons counseling patients about their individual risk of requiring allogeneic transfusion.","Pennington, Zach; Ehresman, Jeff; Feghali, James; Schilling, Andrew; Hersh, Andrew; Hung, Bethany; Lubelski, Daniel; Sciubba, Daniel M",Spine j,481,24

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through 4 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: We considered cohort and case-control studies that evaluated differences in age and sex on the risk of COVID-19 infection, disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We screened and included studies using standardised electronic data extraction forms and we pooled data from published studies and data acquired by contacting authors using random effects meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We screened 11.550 titles and included 59 studies comprising 36.470 patients in the analyses. The methodological quality of the included papers was high (8.2 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (relative risk (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12). When infected, they also had a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27), a higher need for intensive care (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74) and a higher risk of death (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.91). The analyses also showed that patients aged 70 years and above have a higher infection risk (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.81), a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.32), a higher need for intensive care (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.60) and a higher risk of death once infected (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.84) compared with patients younger than 70 years.

This often creates local disconnectedness that energizes the current populist backlash against MNE activities. We develop approaches to new IB theory, addressing the interdependencies of MNEs and city-regions that we propose as a crucial avenue for future research. We contrast two generic MNE strategies. The first is the traditional one: the 'global orchestration' of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call 'local spawning,' involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events. Addressing disconnections requires MNEs to re-orient their strategies while dealing with disruptions requires undertaking risk mitigation.

The likelihood that fear, which when intense approaches fright, will produce trauma depends on how the individual's inner world is structured. That's why, in order to continue to give importance to psychic reality, the question the author tries to answer is: when the noise of concrete reality is deafening, who is the author of the dream and what is the dream about? The idea that is proposed is that despite the weight of a traumatic reality the analyst should never stop using the concept of the unconscious as a compass.

In addition, it also affected the medical education of many residents and learners throughout the country. Historically, physicians undergoing their residency training were not involved in telemedicine. However, in response to the challenges faced due to COVID-19, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) released a provision in May 2020 to allow residents to participate in telemedicine. Method: Lincoln Medical Center, located in the South Bronx of New York City, currently has 115 Internal Medicine residents, and telemedicine clinic visits have been conducted by residents since June 2020. An anonymous 25-question survey was sent to all Internal Medicine residents between August 8, 2020 to August 14, 2020. Result: Of 115 residents, 95 (82.6% of the residents) replied to this questionnaire. Residents revealed feeling less confident in managing chronic diseases through telemedicine visits. The survey also shows that 83.1% of respondents prefer in-person visits during their training, 65.3% feel that the telemedicine experience will affect their future career choice, and 67.4% would prefer less than 50% of visits to be telemedicine in their future careers. Outcome: The purpose of the new ACGME rules allowing telemedicine was to prevent the undertraining of residents and maintain health care for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affects residency training and the experiences of residents, which in turn can influence their future career plans.","Chiuid, ChiaYu Sarwal A.; Jawed, M.; Chemarthi, V.

By using the modularity optimization algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID-19.","Tsiotas, Dimitrios; Magafas, Lykourgos",,481,26

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID-19 infections, is limited. METHODS: Patients from 6 NYC-area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. RESULTS: Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID-19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0-73.0 years). Sixty-six of the 121 patients (54.5%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0%) died of COVID-19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age &#8805;64 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.51), African American race (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13-2.15), and 3 or more comorbidities (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03-1.98). Only recent immunotherapy use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.08-11.27) was associated with death due to COVID-19 on multivariable analysis; chemotherapy treatment and recent major surgery were not predictive of COVID-19 severity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a COVID-19 infection is 14.0%. Recent immunotherapy use is associated with an increased risk of mortality related to COVID-19 infection. LAY SUMMARY: The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is 14.0%; there is no association between cytotoxic chemotherapy and cancer-directed surgery and COVID-19 severity or death. As such, patients can be counseled regarding the safety of continued anticancer treatments during the pandemic. This is important because the ability to continue cancer therapies for cancer control and cure is critical.","Lara, Olivia D; O039,; Cearbhaill, Roisin E; Smith, Maria J; Sutter, Megan E; Knisely, Anne; McEachron, Jennifer; Gabor, Lisa R; Jee, Justin; Fehniger, Julia E; Lee, Yi-Chun; Isani, Sara S; Wright, Jason D; Pothuri, Bhavana",Cancer,481,16

This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of acute pulmonary hypertension (aPH) as per established trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) criteria in Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care and to explore whether short-term outcomes are affected by the presence of aPH. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patients treated in the intensive care units at a tertiary university hospital over a month. The presence of aPH on the TTE was noted, and plasma NTproBNP and troponin were measured as markers of cardiac failure and myocardial injury, respectively. Follow-up data were collected 21 d after the performance of TTE. RESULTS: In total, 26 of 67 patients (39%) had an assessed systolic pulmonary artery pressure of > 35 mmHg (group aPH), meeting the TTE definition of aPH. NTproBNP levels (median [range]: 1430 [102-30 300] vs. 470 [45-29 600] ng L-1 ; P = .0007), troponin T levels (63 [22-352] vs. 15 [5-407] ng L-1 ; P = .0002), and the 21-d mortality rate (46% vs. 7%; P < .001) were substantially higher in patients with aPH compared to patients not meeting aPH criteria. CONCLUSION: TTE-defined acute pulmonary hypertension was frequently observed in severely ill Covid-19 patients. Furthermore, aPH was linked to biomarker-defined myocardial injury and cardiac failure, as well as an almost sevenfold increase in 21-d mortality.","Norderfeldt, Joakim; Liliequist, Andreas; Frostell, Claes; Adding, Christofer; Agvald, Per; Eriksson, Maria; Lönnqvist, Per-Arne",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,481,15

Exploiting the ability of the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional data, we propose an online anomaly detection method to identify anomalies in a collection of multivariate time series. We demonstrate the applicability of the online algorithm in identifying counties in the United States with anomalous trends in terms of COVID-19 related cases and deaths.

In the present study, 11 Brazilian office workers (five women, six men; mean [SD] age 39.3 [9.6] years) wore two triaxial accelerometers fixed on the upper back and right thigh continuously for five days, including a weekend, before COVID-19 (September 2019), and again while working at home during COVID-19 (July 2020). We determined time used in five behaviours: sedentary, standing, light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA), and time-in-bed. Data on these behaviours were processed using Compositional Data Analysis, and behaviours observed pre-COVID19 and during-COVID19 were compared using repeated-measures MANOVA.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program on anxiety symptoms and other mental health outcomes among people vulnerable during COVID-19 owing to a pre-existing medical condition. Methods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or waitlist). Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6-10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete. Findings: Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86). Mean age was 55·0 years (SD 11·4 years), 162 (94%) were women, and 136 (79%) identified as White. In intention-to-treat analyses, the intervention did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms post-intervention (-1·57 points, 95% CI -3·59 to 0·45; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0·22 points) but reduced symptoms 6 weeks later (-2·36 points, 95% CI -4·56 to -0·16; SMD -0·31). Depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks post-intervention (-1·64 points, 95% CI -2·91 to -0·37; SMD -0·31); no other secondary outcomes were significant. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation: The intervention did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms or other mental health outcomes post-intervention. However, anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks later, potentially capturing the time it took for new skills and social support between intervention participants to affect mental health. Multi-faceted interventions such as SPIN-CHAT have potential to address mental health needs in vulnerable groups during COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains about effectiveness.

Private maternity hospitals have a unique challenge of reassuring unaffected patients of uneventful delivery with the lowest possible rate of coronavirus infection while consequently offering compassionate and state of art services to women who turn out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. This has led to a routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of all patients before admission in many of the private hospitals in India. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-COV-2 among asymptomatic pregnant women and to ascertain the utility of universal screening in these women. Methodology: A retrospective observational multi-center study was conducted over a period of approximately 5 months (1-May-2020 to 10-September-2020) in a chain of privately run maternity hospitals with presence in multiple cities across India. All asymptomatic pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to elective/emergency hospital admission. Results: Among 4158 women tested, 54 (1.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and intra partum and postnatal period was uneventful for all of them. Conclusion: Universal screening should be continued as preferred approach to ensure low anxiety levels of delivering women and safety of frontline workers. Further, universal screening helps avoid emergence of maternity centers as virus clusters by effective isolation of identified positive cases and minimizing points of contact.","Sharma, Shreyasi; Wazir, Sanjay; Kumar, Rajagopal Kishore",J Obstet Gynaecol India,481,30

METHODS: At our Emergency Department of the Crema Hospital, from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of June 2020, 54 consecutive patients admitted to ICU suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) attributable to viral SARS - CoV - 2 infection were recruited. The recruitment criterion was based on refractory hypoxia, general condition and clinical impairment, comorbidities and CT images. The incoming parameters of the blood chemistry and radiology investigations and the timing of the gold - tracheal intubation were compared. Medical therapy was based on the application of shared protocols. RESULTS: The onset of symptoms was varyng, i.e. within the range of 1-14 days. The average time from the admission to the emergency room to the admission to intensive care was approximately 120 h. The average number of days of hospitalization in the ICU was 28 days. With a majority of male patients, the most significant age group was between 60 and 69 years. There were 21 deaths and, compared to the survivors, the deceased ones were older at an average age of about 67 years (vs an average age of the survivors of about 59 years). From the available data entering the ICU, the surviving patients presented average better values of oximetry and blood gas analysis, with a lower average dosage of D-Dimer than the deceased. Ones with a presence of bilateral pneumonia in all patients, the worsening of the ARDS occurred in 31 patients. 9 out of 25 patients early intubated died, while 12 out of 23 patients died when intubation was performed after 24 h of non-invasive ventilation. The presence of multiple comorbidities was shown in 17 of 28 patients and revealed an additional adverse prognostic factor. Also, more than one complication in the same patient were detected; after respiratory worsening, renal failure was more frequently found in 16 patients. Some particular complications such as lesions induced by ventilation with barotrauma mechanism (VILI), ischemic heart disease and the appearance of central and peripheral neurological events were detected too. CONSIDERATIONS: SARS - CoV - 2 disease is caused by a new coronavirus that has its main route of transmission through respiratory droplets and close contact, resulting in a sudden onset of the clinical syndrome with acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS). But it can also appear with other symptoms such as gastrointestinal or neurological events, as to be considered as a disease with multisystem phenotype. This pathology evolves towards a serious form of systemic disease from an acute lung damage to venous and arterial thromboembolic complications and multi-organ failure, mostly associated with high mortality. All patients received empirical or targeted antibiotic therapy for prevention and control of infections of potential pathogens, together with low molecular weight heparin therapy. The majority of patients was subjected to the off - label protocol with antivirals and hydroxychloroquine therapy, we used cortisone support therapy under surveillance and in 3 cases the protocol with anti - IL6 monoclonal antibody (Tolicizumab). In a simplified classification of the tomographic examination of the chest, mostly 3D and 2C lesions were found in the deceased patients with a prevalence of severe and moderate forms, whilst in the survivors the distribution appears with a prevalence of medium and moderate forms. Among the intubated patients, 21 patients, all suffering from worsening ARDS, died whilst there was no mortality in patients subjected to non-invasive ventilation it so. The heterogeneity of the respiratory syndromes and the presence of multiple comorbidities represent an unfortunate prognostic factor. Among the complications, besides the respiratory worsening, renal failure, liver failure and the state of sepsis were most frequently found; less frequent complications were lesions induced by ventilation with a barotrauma mechanism, ischemic heart disease, the appearance of central neurological events of sensory alterations, meningo - encephalitis and cerebral hemorrhage, and peripheral neurological events with polyneuro - myopathies. Mechanical ventilation can adversely affect the prognosis due to lung damage induced, protective ventilation remains the necessary treatment during severe hypoxia in patients with SARS - CoV - 2. The essential prerequisite remains the search for optimal 'customized' values since conditions can vary from patient to patient and, in the same patient, during different times of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In these extraordinary circumstances, our reality was among the most affected and was able to hold the impact thanks to the immediate great response set in place by the operators, although it costed us an effort especially the one to try to guarantee a high quality level of assistance and care compared to the huge wave of patients in seriously bad conditions. Further research on this heterogeneous pathology and data sharing could help identify a more dedicated clinical decision-making and treatment pathway that, together with a resource planning, would allow us to better face any new disease outbreak.","Zuccon, William; Comassi, Paolo; Adriani, Luca; Bergamaschini, Giulio; Bertin, Elena; Borromeo, Raffaella; Corti, Serena; De Petri, Federica; Dolci, Francesco; Galmozzi, Attilio; Gigliotti, Alberto; Gualdoni, Livio; Guerra, Claudia; Khosthiova, Anna; Leati, Giovanni; Lupi, Giuseppe; Moscato, Paolo; Perotti, Vittorio; Piantelli, Miriam; Ruini, Alain; Sportelli, Silvia; Susca, Micaela; Troiano, Carmine; Benelli, Giampaolo; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Canetta, Ciro; Merli, Guido; Scartabellati, Alessandro; Melilli B S C, Giovanni; Sfogliarini, Roberto; Pellegatta, Germano; Viganò, Giovanni",Am. j. emerg. med,481,16

However, the drivers of poorer outcomes are not fully elucidated. We performed detailed characterization of patients with COVID-19 to determine the clinical and biochemical factors that may be drivers of poorer outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 889 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 9 and April 22, 2020 in a large London National Health Service Trust. Unbiased multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of death and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 62% of patients in our cohort were of non-white ethnic background and the prevalence of diabetes was 38%. 323 (36%) patients met the primary outcome of death/admission to the ICU within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, lower platelet count, advancing age and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (but not diabetes) independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission. Factors that were significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were coexisting ischemic heart disease, increasing age and lower platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of a diverse patient population, comorbidity (ie, diabetes with ischemic heart disease; increasing CFS score in older patients) was a major determinant of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Antiplatelet medication should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials among high-risk patient groups.","Izzi-Engbeaya, Chioma; Distaso, Walter; Amin, Anjali; Yang, Wei; Idowu, Oluwagbemiga; Kenkre, Julia S; Shah, Ronak J; Woin, Evelina; Shi, Christine; Alavi, Nael; Bedri, Hala; Brady, Niamh; Blackburn, Sophie; Leczycka, Martina; Patel, Sanya; Sokol, Elizaveta; Toke-Bjolgerud, Edward; Qayum, Ambreen; Abdel-Malek, Mariana; Hope, David C D; Oliver, Nick S; Bravis, Vasiliki; Misra, Shivani; Tan, Tricia M; Hill, Neil E; Salem, Victoria",,481,1

Since late November 2019, COVID-19 has become a global health pandemic and threat. Although most people have no or mild symptoms, COVID-19 spreads aggressively and can lead to ARDS rapidly in a proportion of individuals. The evidence supports that gas exchange and countering the negative effects of bed rest and immobility are priorities in severely affected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, in recent years, research has focused on poor long-term functional outcomes in patients with ARDS, often associated with ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies. In addition to physical therapists providing respiratory support in the ICU, the literature unequivocally supports the view that early intervention for ICU management of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 needs to focus on reducing contributors to impaired long-term function, with direct attention paid to preventing or managing ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies, in conjunction with respiratory care.","Candan, Sevim Acaroz; Elibol, Nuray; Abdullahi, Auwal",Physiother Theory Pract,481,16

While safe and effective vaccines have been developed, research is expected to continue for many years regarding the optimal implementation of existing vaccines in specific settings, and the development of second-generation vaccines that may offer advantages in terms of either efficacy or ease of implementation. Given this context, some commentators have argued that new Covid vaccine trials should be able to use placebo controls, and that existing studies should be able to continue with blinded participants in order to collect high quality, unbiased data. Using international ethics guidance documents, this paper argues against placebo controls, given the existence of proven effective interventions, and against protracted blinding once safety and efficacy milestones have been met. Instead, it advocates for study designs that allow for direct comparison between approved and experimental vaccines, which facilitates both data collection and greater access to vaccines.","Haire, Bridget",Indian J Med Ethics,481,26

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed by a review of relevant literature and sports-related questionnaires, and input from five experienced sports dietitians. Item construct and format was adapted and modified from a previous questionnaire. The modified questionnaire sought information on demographics, nutrition knowledge, beliefs, intended practices, information sources and exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. A five-phase validity process was conducted to determine content, face and construct validity, item difficulty and internal reliability of the questionnaire. The Delphi technique was applied with experts over three anonymous rounds. Items were reviewed to determine whether to keep, modify, or delete, rate the relevance of each item using a content validity index (CVI), and provide comments. A content analysis was conducted on all comments after each round. Online interviews were conducted with a pilot group of endurance athletes (n = 15) to assess item difficulty and feasibility. Nutrition knowledge was compared between pilot group of athletes and experts to determine construct validity and internal consistency. A test-retest process was applied to a second pilot group (n = 8) to verify questionnaire reliability. RESULTS: High CVI (&#8805;.83) and agreement scores were obtained through the Delphi technique. High reliability (r = .942) and acceptable internal consistency (&#945; = .53-.78) of the questionnaire were obtained.

METHODS: A search of a national insurance claims database was performed to identify all patients who underwent ACLR from 2007 to 2017, who were active within the database at a minimum of 6 months prior to and 18 months after their surgery. The primary outcome studied was a subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis, manipulation under anesthesia and arthrolysis (MUA/LOA). Patients who filled a prescription for aspirin, low-molecular weight heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, fondaparinux, and warfarin within 2 days after their surgery were included and those who filled a prescription within 3 months prior to surgery were excluded. Thromboprophylaxis status was defined as no thromboprophylaxis, aspirin, and any agent other than aspirin. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between prophylaxis status and MUA/LOA RESULTS: Of the 14,081 patients in our final surgical population, 191 patients had MUA /LOA and 13890 patients did not. 499 patients were prescribed pharmacologic prophylaxis. Rates of MUA/LOA across groups were 1.3% in the group with no thromboprophylaxis, 1.9% in the group prescribed aspirin, and 4.3% in the group prescribed any agent other than aspirin. Only the group prescribed an agent other than aspirin was significantly associated with subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-4.8, p=.004). CONCLUSION: Patients who were prescribed a pharmacologic agent other than aspirin had a 2.6 times higher likelihood of requiring a procedural intervention for arthrofibrosis following ACLR compared to patients who were not prescribed a thromboprophylaxis agent.","Qin, Charles; Qin, Mia; Baker, Hayden; Shi, Lewis L; Strelzow, Jason; Athiviraham, Aravind",Arthroscopy,481,24

Using a constructive example, we demonstrate how social-psychological unhappiness can be the basis for an incentive structure that optimally nudges students to improve their performance The example is based on evidence that students aspire to improve their performance when it lags behind that of other students with whom they naturally compare themselves For a given set of m students, we quantify unhappiness by the index of relative deprivation, which measures the extent to which a student lags behind other students in the set who are doing better than him We examine how to divide the set into an exogenously predetermined number of subsets in order to maximize aggregate relative deprivation, so that the incentive for the students to study harder because of unfavorable comparison with other students is at its strongest We show that the solution to this problem depends only on the students’ ordinally-measured levels of performance, independent of the performance of comparators In addition, we find that when m is an even number, there are multiple optimal divisions, whereas when m is an odd number, there is only one optimal division","Stark, Oded",Economic Analysis and Policy,481,30

In this study, we investigated ampicillin's ability, which is commonly used in dairy cattle disease treatment, to induce Cronobacter sakazakii into the VBNC state. After treatment with ampicillin, the counts of culturable cells decreased from 108 CFU/mL to an undetected level 7-30 days post-treatment. Meanwhile, viable cells were still approximately 104-105 cells/mL, and could be resuscitated under appropriate conditions. Fluorescence microscopy showed that VBNC cell maintained apparent cellular integrity, but that the morphology of VBNC cells differed visibly from that of normal cells. Moreover, the respiratory chain activity of VBNC cells were confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, suggesting that cells in a VBNC state were physiologically active. Finally, transcriptomics analysis and real-time PCR (qPCR) validation were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of VBNC cell formation. Over-expression of relA, lon, ppx, and ppk in the toxin-antitoxin (TA) trigger system contributed to VBNC cell formation. In the TA trigger system, RelA and exopolyphosphatases/guanosine pentaphosphate phosphohydrolases (PPX/GPPA) synthesize ppGpp, which activates polyphosphate kinase (PPK), the cellular enzyme that accumulates plyphosphate (PolyP). PolyP combines with and stimulates Lon to degrade the antitoxins, thereby activating the toxins that induce a VBNC state. The results of our research will facilitate a better understanding of the survival strategies that bacteria develop to deal with ampicillin pressure and the health risks associated with VBNC Cronobacter sakazakii induced by antibiotics.","Zhang, Jingfeng; Wang, Li; Shi, Lei; Chen, Xun; Chen, Chuxin; Hong, Zicheng; Cao, Yong; Zhao, L",Int J Food Microbiol,481,24

A surge in the case fatality ratio as compared with the infection ratio has been observed in most of the countries. The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 shares the most common sequence with SARS-CoV, but it has a higher rate of transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is initiated by the binding of viral spike protein with the target receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitating virus internalization within host cells. SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes alveolar damage ranging from mild to severe clinical respiratory manifestations. Most of the cases have revealed the association of Coronavirus disease with patients having earlier comorbidities like Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, and Cerebrovascular diseases. Pharmacological investigation of the SARS-Cov-2 patients has revealed the frequent use of drugs belongs to Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs). Interestingly, a significant increase in ACE2 expression was noticed in patients routinely treated with the above group of drugs were also reported. To date, the association of ACEi and/or ARBs with the up-regulation of ACE2 expression has not been defined distinctively.

Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can withstand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is a dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organising a scoping review aiming to explore the application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and O'Malley. Peer-reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled using a standardised and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the WHO's Global Research Database on COVID-19 and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full-text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrix. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June 2020 to May 2021. Results from this scoping review will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed article and will assist policy-makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic responses.","Neill, Rachel; Hasan, Md Zabir; Das, Priyanka; Venugopal, Vasuki; Jain, Nishant; Arora, Dinesh; Gupta, Shivam",BMJ Open,481,25

We show that individual transporters can function at rates varying by at least two orders of magnitude that persist for multiple turnovers. A gain-of-function mutant shows increased population of the fast-acting transporters, leading to a 10-fold increase in the mean transport rate.

The current situation has led many countries to implement drastic rules to stop the spread of the virus. According to the Spanish health authority decisions need to be made in the context of uncertainty and lack of knowledgeable experiences through a gradual and asymmetric de-escalation process planned in four phases. Although the vast majority of studies refer to economic risks and impacts on tourist flows and economic income, few of them explicitly investigates safety and health measures that hotel managers should implement to their customers. Over a population of 12,740 hotels, 823 Spanish hotel managers have been involved in a participatory study. With the aim of assessing the actions taken to stop the spread of the virus, empirical research was implemented. A model presented four variables and 13 indicators which have been previously tested among hotel managers in the tourism sector. Five conclusions are drawn from the hypotheses: (1) Mass testing surveillance in customers and employees should be quick, affordable, and homogeneous throughout the European Union. (2) Training measures need to be taken by both public authorities and the private sector to reach a knowledgeable crisis management team with high commitment to the customer's health and safety. (3) Protocols established by public authorities should be observed and adjusted gradually not only in hotels but also in tourist arrivals. (4) Healthy measures need to be periodically updated.

Patients with a history of chronic conditions, obesity, and cancer are at greater risk from COVID-19; moreover, concerns surrounding the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs) and its relationship to COVID-19 susceptibility have increased since the beginning of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to compare the characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those of patients without COVID-19 in primary care; to determine the risk factors associated with the outcome of mortality; and to determine the potential influence of certain medications, such as ACEIs and ARBs, on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: An observational retrospective study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Catalan Central Region of Spain between March 1 and August 17, 2020, was conducted. The data were obtained from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies System of the Catalan Institute of Health in Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS: The study population included 348,596 patients (aged >15 years) registered in the Primary Care Services Information Technologies System of the Catalan Central Region. The mean age of the patients was 49.53 years (SD 19.42), and 31.17% of the patients were aged &#8805;60 years. 175,484/348,596 patients (50.34%) were women. A total of 23,844/348,596 patients (6.84%) in the population studied were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, and the most common clinical conditions of these patients were hypertension (5267 patients, 22.1%) and obesity (5181 patients, 21.7%). Overall, 2680/348,596 patients in the study population (0.77%) died during the study period. The number of deaths among patients without COVID-19 was 1825/324,752 (0.56%; mean age 80.6 years, SD 13.3), while among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the number of deaths was 855/23,844 (3.58%; mean age 83.0 years, SD 10.80) with an OR of 6.58 (95% CI 6.06-7.15). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that women were more likely to contract COVID-19 than men. In addition, our study did not show that hypertension, obesity, or being treated with ACEIs or ARBs was linked to an increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19. Age is the main factor associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Mayer, Miguel Angel; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Puigdellívol-Sánchez, Anna; Marín Gomez, Francesc X; Leis, Angela; Mendioroz Peña, Jacobo",JMIR Public Health Surveill,481,16

Yet, opportunities to perform both functions concurrently for the same population are scarce. Residents must also master the art of preventive medicine, but they often lack an established community of practice that provides a continuous forum to do so. This project explored Population Health Rounds as a novel vehicle to optimize preventive medicine residency training. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Modeled after traditional medical rounds, Population Health Rounds consist of a 1-hour weekly meeting engaging preventive medicine residents and supervising attendings at Stony Brook Medicine in both population medicine and clinical preventive medicine concurrently, including patient case discussions and targeted population health analytics. EVALUATION AND RESULTS: Because of the pandemic, the rounds have predominantly focused on COVID-19 and its effects on the hospital employee population. In addition to providing direct patient care to COVID-19-positive and exposed employees, residents have analyzed data on this population and made recommendations to hospital leadership based on COVID-19's institutional epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors. A formative qualitative survey of resident perceptions offers insights on the value and learning outcomes of this new model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Factors that may impact the implementation, sustainability, and feasibility of this model are discussed. The preventive medicine residency program is commissioned to address gaps in clinical preventive services for the patient-centered medical home tied to the sponsoring institution's family medicine practice. Additional plans are underway to expand the rounds to other clinical contexts, such as lifestyle medicine in the occupational setting, and for targeted populations, such as the underserved. Replication of the Population Health Rounds model is recommended to determine its effectiveness.","Jadotte, Yuri T; Lane, Dorothy S",J Public Health Manag Pract,481,5

METHODS: A total of 21 different coloured samples made of pink gingiva Heraceram porcelain were used. Dentists (n = 54), dental assistants (n = 56), dental students (n = 126) and participants unrelated to dentistry (n = 116) were asked to identify pairs of samples that appeared identical. In addition, they were asked to indicate the pairs of samples whose colour they considered to be acceptable for use in a dental rehabilitation. A least squares regression was adjusted using an S-shaped curve of the equation y = exp (B0 + B1/x). The adjusted model was used to predict a colour difference value for an acceptability percentage of 50%. RESULTS: The threshold value for the perception of colour changes in human gingiva varies from &#916;Eab* 2.3 ± 0.38 units and CIEDE2000 (&#916;E00) 1.5 ± 0.28units (dental students) to &#916;Eab* 2.7 ± 0.43 units and &#916;E00 1.8 ± 0.30 units (participants unrelated to dentistry). The threshold of gingival acceptability varies from &#916;Eab* 2.9 ± 0.43 units and &#916;E00 2.0 ± 0.31 units (dental assistants) to &#916;Eab* 3.6 ± 0.54 units and &#916;E00 2.5 ± 0.41 units (dental students). CONCLUSION: From the total number of samples, the average threshold of perception for the gingival chromatic space is 3.1 units for &#916;Eab* and 2.1 units for &#916;E00. Moreover, the mean gingival acceptance threshold is 4.1 units for &#916;Eab* and 2.9 units for &#916;E00. These thresholds are similar for all professional categories studied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The determination of the perception and acceptability thresholds in the gingival chromatic space are of special relevance for designing the physical shade tabs used in gingival colour guides. The results from this work will aid in selecting optimal gingival colour for patients.","Gómez-Polo, Cristina; Martín Casado, Ana María; Gómez-Polo, Miguel; Montero, Javier",J Dent,481,13

These recessions are unique, caused initially by supply disruptions, largely due to government-imposed 'stay-in-shelter lockdowns'. These have interacted with falling incomes and demand, declining exports (and imports), collapsing commodity prices, shrinking travel and tourism, decreasing remittances and foreign exchange shortages. Highlighting implications for employment, wellbeing and development, it argues that governments need to design comprehensive relief measures and recovery policies to address short-term problems. These should prevent cash-flow predicaments from becoming full-blown solvency crises. Instead of returning to the status quo ante, developing countries' capacities and capabilities need to be enhanced to address long-term sustainable development challenges.

Patients with long COVID asked for rehabilitation. Many of them, including previously healthy and fit clinicians, tried to fight postviral fatigue with exercise-based rehabilitation. We observed a growing number of patients with long COVID who experienced adverse effects from exercise therapy and symptoms strikingly similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Community-based physical therapists, including those in private practice, unaware of safety issues, are preparing to help an influx of patients with long COVID. In this editorial, we expose growing concerns about long COVID and ME. We issue safety recommendations for rehabilitation and share resources to improve care for those with postviral illnesses.

These include dengue, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever and influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus and coronaviruses. There are currently seven human endemic coronaviruses, all of which cause respiratory diseases and bind to receptors found within the endothelium. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in many cell types, particularly in the lung, including endothelial cells. The initiation of a cytokine storm by the virus along with infection of endothelial cells leads to apoptosis and structural and functional changes that attenuate vascular integrity in many organs including the lungs, heart, liver and kidney. Endothelial damage also enhances the coagulation pathway leading to thrombus formation in major vessels and capillaries. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has an adverse outcome for individuals with particular comorbid diseases, e.g. hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this is due to the presence of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation in subjects with these diseases.

Pocos días después se estaba identificando al agente etiológico como un nuevo virus de la familia de los coronavirus, denomi-nado SARS-CoV-2. El virus causante de COVID-19 es un virus ""nuevo"" para la humanidad, y por lo tanto, no hay inmunidad hacia el mismo. Mientras se dispone de una vacuna efec-tiva y segura contra el SARS-CoV-2, solo se vislumbra en el futuro inmediato que la población vaya siendo inmunizada de forma natural, idealmente de manera re-gulada. Los aislamientos, las cuarentenas y el cierre de fronteras han sido y siguen siendo utilizadas como primera línea de defensa ante enfermedades infecciosas nuevas. Sin embargo, estas medidas tienen un rol principalmente en la etapa de contención y luego en la fase de mitigación, como estrategia para ralentizar la dispersión del virus en la comunidad. Una vez se alcanza la fase de mitigación, como ocurre actualmente en Colombia, se deben balancear estas soluciones de aislamiento, con estrategias de distanciamiento más regulado que permitan la reactivación de las actividades sociales y comerciales, y así minimizar los efectos contraproducentes por las implicaciones sociales y económicas [3]. La alta transmisibilidad del virus solo podrá combatirse cuando un porcentaje sig-nificativo de la población esté inmune. Lo que se conoce como inmunidad colecti-va o de rebaño se puede lograr de dos formas; la primera con vacunación masiva, y la segunda con la exposición natural al agente infeccioso, en miras a que el sistema inmune desarrolle una respuesta que proteja al individuo, y evite además que sea una fuente de infección para otros. Para que se logre un nivel adecuado de inmunidad colectiva, se requiere que alrededor del 70% de la población sea inmune, dependiendo del agente infeccioso. Algunos ejemplos de inmunidad co-lectiva conseguida a través de la vacunación, son las obtenidas con las campañas contra sarampión, varicela, paperas y polio, las cuales son enfermedades poco frecuentes en la actualidad en los países con esquemas de vacunación masivos.","Toro-Montoya, Ana isabel",Med. lab,481,16

We aim to identify the risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 using data on mainland China. We estimated attack rate (AR) at county level. Logistic regression was used to explore the role of transportation in the nationwide spread. Generalized additive model and stratified linear mixed-effects model were developed to identify the effects of multiple meteorological factors on local transmission. The ARs in affected counties ranged from 0.6 to 9750.4 per million persons, with a median of 8.8. The counties being intersected by railways, freeways, national highways or having airports had significantly higher risk for COVID-19 with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.40 (p = 0.001), 2.07 (p < 0.001), 1.31 (p = 0.04), and 1.70 (p < 0.001), respectively. The higher AR of COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower average temperature, moderate cumulative precipitation and higher wind speed. Significant pairwise interactions were found among above three meteorological factors with higher risk of COVID-19 under low temperature and moderate precipitation. Warm areas can also be in higher risk of the disease with the increasing wind speed. In conclusion, transportation and meteorological factors may play important roles in the transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China, and could be integrated in consideration by public health alarm systems to better prevent the disease.","Wei, Jia-Te; Liu, Yun-Xia; Zhu, Yu-Chen; Qian, Jie; Ye, Run-Ze; Li, Chun-Yu; Ji, Xiao-Kang; Li, Hong-Kai; Qi, Chang; Wang, Ying; Yang, Fan; Zhou, Yu-Hao; Yan, Ran; Cui, Xiao-Ming; Liu, Yuan-Li; Jia, Na; Li, Shi-Xue; Li, Xiu-Jun; Xue, Fu-Zhong; Zhao, Lin; Cao, Wu-Chun",Int J Hyg Environ Health,481,20

Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to a worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to a surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders.","Seifert, J; Heck, J; Eckermann, G; Singer, M; Bleich, S; Grohmann, R; Toto, S",Nervenarzt,481,9

METHODS: B. pertussis infection was studied by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) in 49 infants < 12 months of age, who were admitted for lower respiratory tract infections during the winter season. Seven other possible viral pathogens were documented by antigen detection or PCR in NPSs. The clinical feature of infants with mixed infection of B. pertussis and respiratory viruses were examined. RESULTS: Overall, B. pertussis infection was found in 10 (20.4%) cases, nine were less than 6 months of age and seven were unvaccinated. Viral etiology was found in 41 (84%) cases and pertussis-viral co-infection was present in eight patients, five of whom had mixed infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Only the presence of staccato coughing, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis were significantly different in B. pertussis-positive cases compared with B. pertussis-negative cases. Of the 10 pertussis cases, only the culture-positive cases showed the typical symptoms and laboratory findings of pertussis in addition to virus-associated respiratory symptoms with severe hospital course, whereas cases identified as DNA-positive lacked the characteristics of pertussis and their clinical severities were the same as B. pertussis-negative cases. CONCLUSION: In the absence of typical paroxysmal cough and lymphocytosis, we should carefully consider diagnosis of pertussis in young children hospitalized for presumed viral respiratory illness according to local epidemiological surveillance.","Mihara, Yuka; Yoshino, Shuji; Nakatani, Keigo; Nishimura, Toyoki; Kan, Hiromi; Yamamura, Yoshiko; Tanaka, Etsuko; Ishii, Shigeki; Shimonodan, Hidemi; Okada, Kenji; Nishiguchi, Toshihiro",J. infect. chemother,481,13

Firstly, a self-developed olfactory visualization sensor was used to capture the odor information of rice samples at different storage periods and a portable spectroscopy system was employed to collect the near-infrared (NIR) spectra during rice storage. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the pre-processed olfactory visualization sensor data and the NIR spectra, and the number of the best principal components (PCs) based on the single technique model was optimized during the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) modeling. Finally, the optimal PCs were fused at the feature level, and a BPNN detection model based on the fusion feature was established to achieve rapid measurement of fatty acid content during rice storage. The experimental results showed that the best BPNN model based on the fusion feature had a good predictive performance where the correlation coefficient (RP) was 0.9265, and the root mean square error (RMSEP) was 1.1005 mg/100 g.

The goal of this study was to predict the potential of 25 small molecule drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which could lead to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with the use of concomitant medications. We focused on 11 transporters, which are targets for DDIs. In vitro potency studies in membrane vesicles or HEK293 cells expressing the transporters coupled with DDI risk assessment methods revealed that 20 of the 25 drugs met the criteria from regulatory authorities to trigger consideration of a DDI clinical trial. Analyses of real-world data from electronic health records, including a database representing nearly 120,000 patients with COVID-19, were consistent with several of the drugs causing transporter-mediated DDIs (e.g., sildenafil, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine). This study suggests that patients with COVID-19, who are often older and on various concomitant medications, should be carefully monitored for ADRs. Future clinical studies are needed to determine whether the drugs that are predicted to inhibit transporters at clinically relevant concentrations, actually result in DDIs.","Yee, Sook Wah; Vora, Bianca; Oskotsky, Tomiko; Zou, Ling; Jakobsen, Sebastian; Enogieru, Osatohanmwen J; Koleske, Megan L; Kosti, Idit; Rödin, Mattias; Sirota, Marina; Giacomini, Kathleen M",Clin. pharmacol. ther,481,5

Case study research involves a detailed empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context. The main purpose of a case study is to provide a contextual analysis of the conditions and processes involved in the phenomenon under study. A comparative case study is an appropriate research methodology to explore new multi-faceted concepts with limited empirical evidence.FindingsThe results confirm previous studies that nonsovereign SITEs have a distinctive overdrive toward tourism specialization.

In this study, we evaluate the potential role of myoglobin in predicting poor outcome in patients with Sars-Cov2 pneumonia. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one Sars-Cov 2 patients with an average age of 69.9 ± 13.2 years, and symptoms duration of 8.8 ± 7.9 days were enrolled in the study. At the admission, the serum levels of myoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, fibrinogen, d-dimers, lactic dehydrogenase, troponin (Tn-I), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), complement fractions C3 and C4, immunoglobulins, interleukin 6 were evaluated. We also assessed the patients' complete clinical history and performed a thorough physical examination including age, disease history, and medications. RESULTS: Twenty-four (20%) patients died, and 18 (15%) patients required intensive care. The mean time between symptoms onset and death was 12.4 days ± 9.1. Univariate analysis of the patients' data highlighted some independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19, including higher neutrophils rate (HR: 1.171), lower lymphocyte rate (HR: 0.798), high CK-MB serum levels (HR: 1.6), high Tn-I serum levels (HR: 1.03), high myoglobin serum levels (HR: 1.014), Alzheimer (HR 5.8), and higher CRP values (HR: 1.011). Cox regression analysis model revealed that higher serum values of myoglobin (HR 1.003; 95%CI: 1.001-1.006; p = 0.01), and CRP (HR 1.012; 95% CI: 1.001-1.023; p = 0.035) could be predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The value of the myoglobin level for predicting 28 days-mortality using ROC curve was 121.8 ng/dL. Lower survival rate was observed in patients with serum levels of myoglobin>121.8 ng/dL (84% vs 20% respectively, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that higher serum levels of myoglobin could be a considerable and effective predictor of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients; a careful follow-up in these patients is strongly suggested. The possibility of enhancing these findings in other cohorts of COVID-19 patients could validate the clinical value of myoglobin as a biomarker for worse prognosis in COVID-19.","Rotondo, Cinzia; Corrado, Addolorata; Colia, Ripalta; Maruotti, Nicola; Sciacca, Stefania; Lops, Lucia; Cici, Daniela; Mele, Angiola; Trotta, Antonello; Lacedonia, Donato; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; Cantatore, Francesco Paolo",Postgrad Med,481,12

This paper discusses the interplay between ABHS input (formulation) factors and output (product performance) factors in the context of a multidimensional perspective using a novel representative paradigm. In the model, represented in the form of a three-dimensional tetrahedron, each of the faces represents inputs in the manufacturing of the ABHS product, which are the type and amount of alcohol, the inactive ingredients, the formulation and the manufacturing practices. The four corners of the tetrahedron represent the product performance factors which include product efficacy, sensory characteristics, usage and compliance and product safety. The multidimensional approach to the formulation and evaluation of ABHS shows that several factors contribute to the effectiveness and utility of these products.

DesignA cross sectional study. SettingData from 20 member nations of the WHO African region until September 1, 2020. Participants69,580 cases of COVID-19, stratified by sex (men, n=43071; women, n=26509) and age (0-39 years, n=41682; 40-59 years, n=20757; 60+ years, n=7141). Main outcome measuresWe computed the SSA- and country-specific case fatality rates (CFRs) and sex-specific CFR differences across various age groups, using a Bayesian approach. ResultsA total of 1,656 (2.4% of total cases reported; 1656/69580) deaths were reported, with men accounting for 1168/1656 (70.5%) of total deaths. In SSA, women had a lower CFR than men (mean CFRdiff = -0.9%; 95% credible intervals -1.1% to -0.6%). The mean CFR estimates increased with age, with the sex-specific CFR differences being significant among those aged 40 or more (40-59 age-group: mean CFRdiff = -0.7%; 95% credible intervals -1.1% to -0.2%; 60+ age-group: mean CFRdiff = -3.9%; 95% credible intervals -5.3% to -2.4%). At the country level, seven of the twenty SSA countries reported significantly lower CFRs among women than men overall. Moreover, corresponding to the age-specific datasets, significantly lower CFRs in women than men were observed in the 60+ age-group in seven countries and 40-59 age-group in one country. Conclusions>Sex and age are important predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Countries should prioritize the collection and use of sex-disaggregated data to understand the evolution of the pandemic.

The fluid dynamics of this process is difficult to predict because the rupture involved complex liquid-gas transition. Equation of state (EOS) plays a key role in the thermodynamic process of liquid-gas transition. Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by EOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size and the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the mechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of liquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses decrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken. The present multiphase model can be extended to study the generation and transmission of bioaerosols which can carry the bioparticles of influenza or coronavirus.","He, Bing; Qin, Chunyan; Chen, Wenbo; Wen, Binghai",,481,24

Telehealth has been used relatively well in patients from remote regions with limited access to subspecialty healthcare providers. This article discusses novel ways of using telehealth during the current pandemic and measures that would need to be taken to sustain telehealth and teleconsultations. RECENT FINDINGS: Telehealth has expanded to outpatient pediatric cardiology clinics across the globe during the pandemic. Technological advancements in video conferencing and the abundance of readily available wearable devices have allowed cardiologists to establish a preliminary diagnosis and set forth a treatment plan. Additional support by insurance providers and relaxation of mandatory regulations by the government have allowed telehealth to succeed during the pandemic. Although many subdisciplines within pediatric cardiology can be easily adapted into a sustainable telehealth model, some unique patient interactions, such as fetal cardiology, exercise physiology, and echocardiograms cannot be done remotely. The field of telehealth medicine with HIPAA-compliant programs and both insurance and government support should remain in our armamentarium of available resources for all patients and families. SUMMARY: Although not unique to pediatric cardiology, telehealth has emerged as an avenue to perform an initial evaluation and even establish a care pathway for patients. It is well recognized that telehealth visits will not supplant all patient--physician interactions but is a very acceptable first step in the majority of cases and can often steer the patient to subsequently undergo more selective and streamlined care.","Cohen, Emmie; Cohen, Mitchell I",Curr Opin Cardiol,481,16

The traditional test-trace-isolate-support paradigm focuses on identifying people after they have been exposed to positive individuals, and isolating them to protect others. This article introduces an alternative and complementary approach, which appears to be the first to notify people before exposure happens, in the context of their interaction network, so that they can directly take actions to avoid exposure themselves, without using personally identifiable information. Our system has just become achievable with present technology: for each positive case, do not only notify their direct contacts, but inform thousands of people of how far away they are from the positive case, as measured in network-theoretic distance in their physical relationship network. This fundamentally different approach has already been deployed in a publicly downloadable app. It brings a new tool to bear on the pandemic, powered by network theory. Like a weather satellite providing early warning of incoming hurricanes, it empowers individuals to see transmission approaching from far away, and to directly avoid exposure in the first place. This flipped perspective engages natural self-interested instincts of self-preservation, reducing reliance on altruism. Consequently, our new system could solve the behavior coordination problem which has hampered many other app-based interventions to date. We also provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that shows how our system already achieves critical mass from the user perspective at very low adoption thresholds (likely below 10% in some common types of communities as indicated empirically in the first practical deployment); after that point, the design of our system naturally accelerates further adoption, while also alerting even non-users of the app.","Loh, Po-Shen",,481,1

We aim to investigate global hospital bed (HB), acute care bed (ACB), and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity and determine any correlation between these hospital resources and COVID-19 mortality. METHOD: Cross-sectional study utilizing data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other official organizations regarding global HB, ACB, ICU bed capacity, and confirmed COVID-19 cases/mortality. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were performed. RESULTS: A total of 183 countries were included with a mean of 307.1 HBs, 413.9 ACBs, and 8.73 ICU beds/100,000 population. High-income regions had the highest mean number of ICU beds (12.79) and HBs (402.32) per 100,000 population whereas upper middle-income regions had the highest mean number of ACBs (424.75) per 100,000. A weakly positive significant association was discovered between the number of ICU beds/100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality. No significant associations exist between the number of HBs or ACBs per 100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Global COVID-19 mortality rates are likely affected by multiple factors, including hospital resources, personnel, and bed capacity. Higher income regions of the world have greater ICU, acute care, and hospital bed capacities. Mandatory reporting of ICU, acute care, and hospital bed capacity/occupancy and information relating to coronavirus should be implemented. Adopting a tiered critical care approach and targeting the expansion of space, staff, and supplies may serve to maximize the quality of care during resurgences and future disasters.","Sen-Crowe, Brendon; Sutherland, Mason; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",J Surg Res,481,10

Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored &#8805;7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

Early detection of infected HCWs can prevent spreading of the virus in hospitals among HCWs and patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the asymptomatic infection of HCWs in a private clinic in the city of Santiago, Chile. Our study was conducted during a period of 5 weeks at the peak of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 413 HCWs and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. We found that a 3.14% of HCWs were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (14/413). Out of these, 7/14 were completely asymptomatic and did not develop symptoms within 3 weeks of testing. Sequencing of viral genomes showed the predominance of the GR clade; however, sequence comparison demonstrated numerous genetic differences among them suggesting community infection as the main focus of transmission among HCWs. Our study demonstrates that the protocols applied to protect HCWs and patients have been effective as no infection clusters due to asymptomatic carriers were found in the clinic. Together, these data suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs of this health center is not nosocomial.","Olmos, Claudio; Campaña, Gonzalo; Monreal, Victor; Pidal, Paola; Sanchez, Nannet; Airola, Constanza; Sanhueza, Dayan; Tapia, Patricio; Muñoz, Ana María; Corvalan, Felipe; Hurtado, Sebastian; Meneses, Claudio; Orellana, Ariel; Montecino, Martin; Arriagada, Gloria; Bustos, Fernando Jose",PLoS One,481,1

The purpose of this work was to identify risk factors associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), to analyse viral kinetics in patients with and without IMV and to provide a comprehensive description of clinical course. METHODS: A cohort of 168 hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective observational study at a large European tertiary care centre was analysed. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95% CI 1.10-1.37, p < 0.01) and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95% CI 2.00-16.82, p < 0.01) were associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations, slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33 days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p < 0.01). Median duration of hospitalisation was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a short duration of symptoms before admission as a risk factor for severe disease that merits further investigation and different viral load kinetics in severely affected patients. Median duration of hospitalisation of IMV patients was longer than described for acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19.","Thibeault, Charlotte; Mühlemann, Barbara; Helbig, Elisa T; Mittermaier, Mirja; Lingscheid, Tilman; Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Meyer-Arndt, Lil A; Meiners, Leonie; Stubbemann, Paula; Haenel, Sascha S; Bosquillon de Jarcy, Laure; Lippert, Lena; Pfeiffer, Moritz; Stegemann, Miriam S; Roehle, Robert; Wiebach, Janine; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Zoller, Thomas; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Uhrig, Alexander; Balzer, Felix; von Kalle, Christof; Suttorp, Norbert; Jones, Terry C; Drosten, Christian; Witzenrath, Martin; Sander, Leif E; Corman, Victor M; Kurth, Florian",Infection,481,20

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms ""telemedicine"" and ""COVID-19."" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.","Hagge, Daniel; Knopf, Andreas; Hofauer, Benedikt",HNO,481,29

To make estimation more robust, this study aims to (1) propose an improved indicator of greenery visibility for analytical use (standardized GVI; sGVI), and (2) quantify the relation between sGVI and other greenery metrics. Analyzing a data set for Yokohama city, Japan, it is shown that the sGVI, a weighted form of GVI aggregated to an area, mitigates the bias of densely located measurement sites. Also, by comparing sGVI and NDVI at city block level, we found that sGVI captures the presence of vegetation better in the city center, whereas NDVI is better in capturing vegetation in parks and forests. These tools provide a foundation for accessing the effect of vegetation in urban landscapes in a more robust matter, enabling comparison on any arbitrary geographical scale.","Kumakoshi, Yusuke; Chan, Sau Yee; Koizumi, Hideki; Li, Xiaojiang; Yoshimura, Yuji",,481,23

factores determinantes para la adopción de las herramientas de Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicación con objetivos comerciales en las cooperativas oleícolas de segundo grado en España El sector oleícola español lidera la producción mundial de aceite de oliva, sin embargo, cuenta con importantes problemas comerciales que ponen en riesgo la rentabilidad de los productores Éste es un problema históricamente ligado a este sector En este sentido el cooperativismo de segundo grado salva una de las trabas para su avance comercial frecuentemente señalada por la literatura sobre el sector

creation in a given country or region (Feldman, 1993 and Mendez 1998) Schumpeter (1934) already predicted that technological change would be decisive, assuming that companies that were not capable of adapting to innovations would not survive in the market In this sense, Porter (1985 and 1990) indicated what competitiveness was: ""competitive advantage derives from the way in which companies organize and carry out discrete activities To gain competitive advantage over its rivals, a company must offer a service at a value comparable to that of the competitor, but carry out the activities more efficiently than its competitors (lower cost) or carry out the activities in a peculiar way that creates greater value for the buyer and allows for an overpricing (differentiation)"" Undoubtedly, the correct use and management of ICTs constitutes a differentiation (Fernández, Bernal, Mozas and Medina, 2019;Moreno and Sempere, 2019) ICTs, therefore, have emerged as necessary elements for achieving economic development This is such an accepted fact that the European Union indicates that the development of ICTs is vital for Europe's competitiveness in today's increasingly digitalized world economy During the 2014-2020 funding period, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) set aside more than 20,000 million euros for investment in ICTs and the European Commission established the Digital Europe 2021-2027 program, which aims to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and, in this way, transfer its benefits to European citizens and companies (Regulation of the European Parliament and Council establishing the Digital Europe program for the period 2021-2027) Within this digitalization process, made more urgent by Covid-19, cooperatives seem the best way to channel the collaborative economy, under the modality of working on a digital platform (Arrieta, 2019) In this paper we focus our analysis on one family of the Social Economy: agricultural cooperatives Specifically, we will go into the analysis of the Spanish olive cooperative movement for several reasons: a) Spain is the world's leading producer of olive oil and more than 70% of it is produced by cooperatives (Cooperativas Agroalimentarias de España, 2017) and the Consejo Económico y Social de la Provincia de Jaén, 2019) According to the data provided by the International Olive Oil Council (2019 a and b) for the 2018-19 campaign, Spain has produced more than 51% of the world's olive oils and the new plantations predict a constant increase;b) there are 11,316,0 0 hectares in the world that are exclusively dedicated to the cultivation of 1 500 million olive trees (72% are mountain and hill), located mainly in the Mediterranean basin (79%), which gives them an enormous environmental value (at the same time that they serve to reduce erosion and constitute a CO2 sink) which leads them to be considered by many researchers as public goods (Mozas, 2019b);c) annually, an increase in the world's olive grove surface area is observed, which represents 1% per year (between 34 and 45 million seedlings, which means 154,000 new hectares) The importance of the olive grove is spreading worldwide, since there are already 56 countries in which the olive grove is cultivated and 169 in which its products are consumed (Vilar and Cárdenas, 2016) and these figures are increasing year after year (Mozas, 2019b);d) on the other hand, the production of olive oil with respect to the total of oils and fats produced in the world represents barely 2% However, consumption has been growing at between 2 and 4% annually, which is why companies are interested in this product In fact, the turnover of the sector has experienced a growing increase in recent years, ranging from 9,000 to 13,600 million euros per year and employing more than 30 million people (Vilar and Cárdenas, 2016) All these reasons make it a strategic sector worldwide and for Spain in particular The main objective we have set ourselves is to verify which are the structural, organizational and commercial factors that favor technological innovation in the second degree olive oil cooperatives in Spain From the theoretical framework that has been analyzed, the following work proposals have been derived: Proposition 1 Training employees in ICTs favors innovation in the organization Proposition 2 The application of measures aimed at commitment to CSR favors innovation in the organization Proposition 3 The degree of internationalization, measured by the percentage of exports, favors innovation in the organization Proposition 4 The commitment to organic production favors innovation in the organization Proposition 5 The degree of business integration, measured through the number of member cooperatives, favors innovation in the organization Population and method The organizations analyzed in this study have a total of 449 companies (444 cooperatives: 1 SAT;3 SA;1 cooperative group), most of them first degree cooperatives, integrating more than 165,000 individual members with a turnover of more than 2 billion euros and employing more than 2,500 people These organizations are integrated around 35 second degree cooperative societies dedicated to the marketing of olive oil in Spain and constitute our population under study In order to collect part of the data of this study a survey has been carried out on the population under study, but others were requested from Agro-Food Cooperatives in Spain within the framework of the work of the Socioeconomic Observatory of Spanish Agro-Food Cooperativism (OSCAE) The methodological technique used in this study was Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), using the fuzzy set approach (fsQCA) in order to establish technological and organizational variables that together are associated with a higher level of efficiency The QCA technique, based on Boolean algebra, uses a verbal, conceptual and mathematical language that configures it as a qualitative and quantitative approach, combining the main advantages of both (Ragin, 1987) Thus, applying QCA it is possible to systematically analyze a set of cases in order to determine causal patterns in the form of need and sufficiency relationships between a set of conditions and an outcome (Scheider & Wagemann, 2010) This method has the advantage over a regression technique of establishing relationships between subsets of variables to explain relationships In addition, this technique allows working with medium-size samples not large enough to apply traditional quantitative methods (Ragin et al , 2003;Ragin and Rihoux, 2009) Specifically, in this study the fu zy set variant (fsQCA) has been used, since it resolves one of the main drawbacks and criticisms of the initial method, called csQCA, which is its strictly dichotomous approach (Sehring et al , 2013) The dependent variable is the degree of technological innovation This variable has been created by considering the different ICTs used by the company in its business performance Thus, a count has been made of the number of technologies used by the company, considering the following: intranet, website, presence in social networks, e-shop, presence in electronic markets and apps For their part, the causal variables used have been: training in ICT of human resources (staff and top management), the degree of commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility, the export nature, the sale of ecological supply, and business integration The results obtained in this study allow us to verify, by means of the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) technique, that the immersion of the companies in ICTs is favored by the following factors: the intensity of cooperative integration, measured by the number of first degree cooperatives or other entities that make up the second degree cooperative;the ICT training of the employees;the export character of the cooperative, the offer of ecological products and the degree of commitment of the cooperatives to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions The original value of this study is the direct link between economic development and innovation and investment in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Furthermore, the conclusion we draw is that far from considering Corporate Social Responsibility as a burden for companies and institutions, it should be analyzed and integrated into organizations asan opportunity The relationship between these variables will improve not only the competitive position of the company, but also the situation of its environment","Moral, Adoración Mozas Jurado Enrique Bernal Uclés Domingo Fernández Viruel Miguel Jesús Medina Poyatos Raquel

The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization. TRIAL DESIGN: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority. PARTICIPANTS: Included participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Umeå University Hospital, Region Västerbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi®) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion). RANDOMISATION: Randomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + ""standard of care"": ""standard of care""). The randomisation list, with consecutive subject numbers, was generated by an independent statistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed to have three phases. The first, an exploration phase of 45 participants (30 treatment and 15 control) will focus on safety and includes a more extensive laboratory assessment as well as more frequent safety evaluation. The second prolongation phase, includes the first 100 participants followed by an interim analysis to define the power of the study. The third phase is the continuation of the study up to maximum 600 participants included in total. TRIAL STATUS: The current protocol version is COVIDENZA v2.0 as of September 10, 2020. Recruitment started July 29, 2020 and is presently in safety pause after the first exploration phase. Recruitment is anticipated to be complete by 31 December 2021.

We sought to identify the effects of border shutdowns on the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used the synthetic control method to measure the effects of entry bans against Chinese visitors on the cumulative number of confirmed cases using World Health Organization situation reports as the data source. The synthetic control method constructs a synthetic country that did not shut down its borders, but is similar in all other aspects. RESULTS: Six countries that shut down their borders were evaluated. For Australia, the effects of the policy began to appear 4 days after implementation, and the number of COVID-19 cases dropped by 94.4%. The border shutdown policy took around 13.2 days to show positive effects and lowered COVID-19 cases by 91.7% on average by the end of February. CONCLUSIONS: The border shutdowns in early February significantly reduced the spread of the virus.

The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the effect of both pure BG and BG doped with 5-wt% of Li (BGLi) on both the remineralization of in vitro demineralized human-teeth and the antimicrobial behavior against strains from caries and periodontitis. METHODS: Bioglass® 45S5 (BG) and BGLi were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The remineralization tests were carried out using in vitro demineralized enamel teeth and evaluated by Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Vickers micro-hardness (HV). The antimicrobial behavior of the particles was evaluated against S. mutans, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. gingivalis, representing pathogens from caries and periodontitis. RESULTS: Enamel lesion was partially remineralized when both bioglasses (BG and BGLi) were applied on its surface with micro-hardness recoveries around 45%. They further inhibited the growth of S. mutans and P. gingivalis, at 50 and 200 mg/mL, respectively. BGLi presented a higher toxicity against A. actinomycetemcomitans than BG, with inhibition concentrations of 20 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bioglasses could be used in the treatment of two of the most prevalent oral diseases: caries and periodontitis, promoting the remineralization of the teeth and killing the main pathogens. The presence of Li did not affect the bioactivity of the bioglass and improved the antibacterial effect over A. actinomycetemcomitans strain.","Palza Cordero, Humberto; Castro Cid, René; Diaz Dosque, Mario; Cabello Ibacache, Rodrigo; Palma Fluxá, Patricia",J Dent,481,26

This work aims at evaluating the impact of a reduction in chronic use of benzodiazepine on the future burden of dementia in France. Using estimations of dementia incidence and of benzodiazepine use and nation-wide projections of mortality and population sizes, a Monte Carlo approach based on an illness-death model provided projections of several indicators of dementia burden. With no change in benzodiazepine consumption, the prevalence of dementia between age 65 and 99 in France in 2040 was estimated at 2.16 millions (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.38), with a life expectancy without dementia at 65 years equal to 25.0 years (24.7-25.3) for women and 23.8 years (23.5-24.2) for men. Assuming a disappearance of chronic use of benzodiazepine in 2020, the prevalence would be reduced by about 6.6% in 2040 and the life expectancy without dementia would increase by 0.99 (0.93-1.06) year among women and 0.56 (0.50-0.62) among men. To conclude, a modest but significant reduction in future dementia burden could be obtained by applying current recommendation for duration of benzodiazepine use.","Jacqmin-Gadda, Hélène; Guillet, Florian; Mathieu, Clément; Helmer, Catherine; Pariente, Antoine; Joly, Pierre",Sci Rep,481,16

We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, to conduct rapid evidence synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control in 3 days. METHODS: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries (n=3), public agencies (n=6), multilateral institutions (n=3), COVID-19 resource aggregators (n=5) and preprints (n=1) (without language restrictions) for articles on CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles. Most of the evidence was from low-and middle-income countries with well-established CHW programmes. Evidence from CHW programmes initiated during pandemics and for CHW involvement in pandemic response in high-income countries was scant. CHW roles and tasks change substantially during pandemics. Clear guidance, training for changed roles and definition of what constitutes essential activities (ie, those that must to be sustained) is required. Most common additional activities during pandemics were community awareness, engagement and sensitisation (including for countering stigma) and contact tracing. CHWs were reported to be involved in all aspects of contact tracing - this was reported to affect routine service delivery. CHWs have often been stigmatised or been socially ostracised during pandemics. Providing PPE, housing allowance, equal training opportunities, transportation allowance, improving salaries (paid on time and for a broad range of services) and awards in high-profile public events contributed to better recruitment and retention. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). CONCLUSIONS: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. More implementation research on CHWs in pandemics is required.","Bhaumik, Soumyadeep; Moola, Sandeep; Tyagi, Jyoti; Nambiar, Devaki; Kakoti, Misimi",,481,1

Where the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping country after country. The Italian and Moroccan authorities have declared a state of emergency in response to the growing threat of this novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak by March 09 and 20, respectively. In-state of emergency, citizens cannot go out to public spaces without special authorization from local authorities. But after all these efforts exerted by these authorities, the number of new cases of the COVID-19 continues to rise significantly, which confirms the lack of commitment of some citizens. First, we aim to investigate the cause of new infections despite all strategies of control followed in these countries including media reports, awareness, and treatment, self-distancing and quarantine, by estimating the number of these people who underestimate the lives and safety of citizens and put them at risk. To do this, we use real data of the COVID-19 in Italy and Morocco to estimate the parameters of the model, and then we predict the number of these populations. Second, we propose an optimal control strategy that could be the optimal and the efficient way for the Moroccan and Italian authorities and other countries to make the state of emergency more efficient and to control the spread of the COVID-19. The model is analyzed for both countries and then to compare the implications of the obtained results. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the strategy of control that we propose and to show what would have been happened in Morocco and Italy if this strategy of control was applied early.","Omar, Zakary; Sara, Bidah; Mostafa, Rachik",Rev. mex. ing. bioméd,481,26

Unfortunately, people commonly use these platforms to share misinformation which can influence other people adversely. The spread of misinformation is unavoidable in an extraordinary situation like Covid-19, and the consequences can be dreadful. This paper proposes a two-step ranking-based misinformation detection (RMiD) technique. Firstly, a novel ranking-based approach leveraging the scalable information retrieval infrastructure is applied to detect misinformation from a huge collection of unlabelled tweets based on a related but very small labelled misinformation data set. Secondly, the identified misinformation tweets are represented as a coupled matrix tensor model and Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization is applied to learn their spatio-temporal topic dynamics. The experimental analysis shows that RMiD is capable of detecting misinformation with better coverage and less noise in comparison with existing techniques. Moreover, the coupled matrix tensor representation has improved the quality of topics discovered from unlabelled data up to 4% by leveraging the semantic similarity of terms in labelled data.","Balasubramaniam, Thirunavukarasu Nayak Richi Luong Khanh Bashar Md Abul",Social Network Analysis and Mining,481,21

Herein, we discuss about concerns associated with virus occurrence in human feces and sewage, with attention to the possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, based on the review of recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 as well as the previous pandemic events. Given the reported environmental stability of coronavirus, the feces- and sewage-derived transmission routes may be of importance to prevent unprecedented spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) particularly in developing countries. However, so far, limited number of studies detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 even in human feces, whereas a number of virus RNA copies were identified in both feces and sewage specimens. Therefore, uncertainty remains in the possibility of this transmission pathway, and further investigation is warranted in future studies, for example, by increasing the number of specimens, examining the effectiveness of methods for viral viability test, considering the patient medical history, and so forth.","Elsamadony, Mohamed; Fujii, Manabu; Miura, Takayuki; Watanabe, Toru",Sci Total Environ,481,16

The rapid viral spread has made the disease a public health emergency of worldwide concern. The gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is reverse transcription followed by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); however, the role of viral load quantification has not been thoroughly investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a high-precision quantitative one-step RT-qPCR reaction using the association of the viral target and the human target in the same reaction. METHODS: The assay standardization involved the absolute quantification method, with serial dilutions of a plasmid with the N gene in a biological matrix to build a standard curve. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the possibility of quantifying as few as 2.5 copies/reaction and an analysis of 244 patients with known results selected by cross-section that revealed 100% agreement with a qualitative RT-qPCR assay registered by Anvisa. In this population, it was possible to quantify patients with between 2.59 and 3.5 × 107 copies per reaction and negative patients continued to indicate the same result. CONCLUSION: This assay can be a useful tool for a proper patient management, because the level and duration of viral replication are important factors to assess the risk of transmission and to guide decisions regarding the isolation and release of patients; an accurate diagnosis is critical information, whereas the current COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest current global health problem.","Queiroz, Jackson Alves da Silva; Rampazzo, Rita de Cássia Pontello; Filho, Edivá Basílio da Silva; Oliveira, Gabriella Sgorlon; Oliveira, Suyane da Costa; Souza, Luan Felipo Botelho; Pereira, Soraya Dos Santos; Rodrigues, Moreno Magalhães de Souza; Maia, Adriana Cristina Salvador; da Silva, Cicileia Correia; Mendonça, Aline Linhares Ferreira de Melo; Lugtenburg, Celina Aparecida Bertoni; Aguiar, Francisco de Assis Araújo; Rodrigues, Rosiane de Souza Soares; Santos, Caio Henrique Nemeth; Guimarães, Alice Paula Di Sabatino; Máximo, Fernando Rodrigues; Santos, Alcione de Oliveira Dos; Krieger, Marco Aurélio; Salcedo, Juan Miguel Villalobos; Dall039,; Acqua, Deusilene Souza Vieira",Int J Infect Dis,481,16

The role of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in its smooth viral infectivity of the host cannot be ignored, especially the spike proteins that mediate spike attachment and host membrane fusion. Worth mentioning the nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins make the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 much simpler than expected in spreading infection.

Experiments were conducted with variable kaolin minerals mass contents (mixing ratios) in the soil columns. Measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) diminished with increased clay contents, i.e., Ks=0.00771, 0.00560, 0.00536, 0.00519, and 0.00314 cm s-1, for clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. Experimental NaCl concentrations in the effluent from the bottom of the soil columns were about constant for times t &#8776; 800, 1200, 1300, 1400, and 3400 s from the beginning of a rinsing experiment for the clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. These NaCl concentrations then decreased with time quickly, and finally, approached zero. The presented model can reproduce experimental time variations of NaCl concentration in the effluent from the soil column reliably. Simulated salt mass left in the soil column with time also matches the experimental results for the clay contents = 0.2 and 0.5%. An inconsistency between simulated and experimental salt mass left in the soil columns becomes more significant as the clay content increases. These results suggest that the soil-water retention curve for the pure Toyoura sand can be applied to the soil column composed of kaolin minerals/Toyoura sand mixture when the clay content is small, i.e., less than 1%. Prediction of rinsing process becomes more difficult with increased clay content. However, the time required to remove saline water from the soil column to less than 1% of its initial value simulated by the model agrees closely with experimental results of 1000, 1500, 1700, 2100, and 5400 s, respectively.","Higashino, Makoto; Aso, Daiki; Stefan, Heinz G",,481,24

However, it is not known whether patients with COVID-19 have a uniquely higher incidence of these events compared to historical ARDS (non-COVID-19 ARDS) patients. METHODS We compared barotrauma rates in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation between March-July 2020 to patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS who received mechanical ventilation in 2016-2018. We defined barotrauma as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum during mechanical ventilation. RESULTS We analyzed 222 patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation and 421 patients with ARDS. Barotrauma events occurred in 13.1% of patients with COVID-19 and 9.3% of historical ARDS patients (p = 0.136). Mean tidal volumes were 5.7 and 6.4 mL/kg of predicted body weight, plateau pressures were 25.6 and 23.6, PEEP was 11.2 and 8.8, and driving pressures were 14.4 and 14.8 cmH2O, respectively, in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. There were 42 pneumothoraces among COVID-19 patients and 50 among historical ARDS patients (p = 0.144). Incidence rates were 1.7 and 2.7 per 100 ventilator days in COVID-19 and historical ARDS respectively (p=0.808). There were 14 cases of pneumomediastinum among patients with COVID-19 compared to 16 among patients with ARDS (p = 0.152). Overall, pneumothoraces were identified within 24 hours of ipsilateral internal jugular or subclavian line placement in 5.4% (5/92) of events. In both groups, barotrauma was associated with fewer vent-free days at 28 days (3.0 vs 9.2 in COVID-19, p &lt; 0.001 and 7.6 vs 11.5 in historical ARDS, p = 0.0214). Barotrauma was not associated with an increased mortality at discharge for either cohort. For COVID-19 patients only, mean plateau pressure and driving pressure were associated with barotrauma events (28 vs 25 cmH2O, p = 0.0015;16.7 vs 14.0 cmH2O, p ≤ 0.01). Administered tidal volume, PEEP, age, sex, tobacco use, obesity, number of comorbidities, and the presence of lung comorbidities were not associated with barotrauma in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients who are mechanically ventilated are at high risk of barotrauma;this was not unique to patients with COVID-19. Barotrauma is associated with prolonged ventilation and fewer ventilator-free days. Despite advances in lung-protective ventilation, barotrauma continues to be a significant source of morbidity in patients mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure.","Christoph, E.; Kay, S.; Sjoding, M.

Even though numerous researches have discussed the travel restriction between cities and provinces, few studies focus on the effect of transportation control inside the city due to the lack of the measurement and available data in Wuhan. Since the public transports have been shut down in the beginning of city lockdown, the change of traffic density is a good indicator to reflect the intracity population flow. Therefore, in this paper, we collected time-series high-resolution remote sensing images with the resolution of 1m acquired before, during and after Wuhan lockdown by GF-2 satellite. Vehicles on the road were extracted and counted for the statistics of traffic density to reflect the changes of human transmissions in the whole period of Wuhan lockdown. Open Street Map was used to obtain observation road surfaces, and a vehicle detection method combing morphology filter and deep learning was utilized to extract vehicles with the accuracy of 62.56%. According to the experimental results, the traffic density of Wuhan dropped with the percentage higher than 80%, and even higher than 90% on main roads during city lockdown; after lockdown lift, the traffic density recovered to the normal rate. Traffic density distributions also show the obvious reduction and increase throughout the whole study area. The significant reduction and recovery of traffic density indicates that the lockdown policy in Wuhan show effectiveness in controlling human transmission inside the city, and the city returned to normal after lockdown lift.","Wu, Chen; Guo, Yinong; Guo, Haonan; Yuan, Jingwen; Ru, Lixiang; Chen, Hongruixuan; Du, Bo; Zhang, Liangpei",,481,2

As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic-on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively. (2) Mechanism analysis illustrated that the lockdowns of 44 cities reduced human movements by 69.85%, and a reduction in the AQI, PM2.5, and CO was partially mediated by human mobility, and SO2, PM10, and NO2 were completely mediated.

Reaching them with effective prevention is a programmatic priority. The HIV prevention cascade can be used to track intervention coverage, and identify gaps and opportunities for programme strengthening. The aim of this study was to characterise gaps in condom use and identify reasons underlying these gaps among young women who sell sex (YWSS) in Zimbabwe using data from enrolment into an impact evaluation of the DREAMS programme. DREAMS provided a package of biomedical, social and economic interventions to AGYW aged 10 to 24 with the aim of reducing HIV incidence. METHODS: In 2017, we recruited YWSS aged 18 to 24 using respondent-driven sampling in six sites across Zimbabwe. We measured knowledge about efficacy of, access to, and effective (consistent) use of condoms with the most recent three sexual partners, separately by whether YWSS self-identified as female sex workers (FSW) or not. Among YWSS without knowledge about efficacy of, not having access to, and not effectively using condoms, we described the potential reasons underlying the gaps in the condom cascade. To identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with effective condom use, we used logistic regression modelling. All analyses were RDS-II weighted and restricted to YWSS testing HIV-negative at enrolment. RESULTS: We enrolled 2431 YWSS. Among 1842 (76%) YWSS testing HIV-negative, 66% (n = 1221) self-identified as FSW. 89% of HIV-negative YWSS demonstrated knowledge about efficacy of condoms, 80% reported access to condoms and 58% reported using condoms consistently with the three most recent sexual partners. Knowledge about efficacy of and effective use of condoms was similar regardless of whether or not YWSS self-identified as FSW, but YWSS self-identifying as FSW reported better access to condoms compared to those who did not (87% vs 68%; age- and site-adjusted (adjOR) = 2.69; 95% CI: 2.01 to 3.60; p < 0.001). Women who reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and common mental disorder in the past week were less likely to use condoms consistently (43% vs. 60%; adjOR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.68; p < 0.001) and (51% vs. 61%; adjOR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97; p = 0.029), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high knowledge about efficacy of and access to condoms, there remain large gaps in self-reported consistent condom use among YWSS. Addressing the structural determinants of YWSS' inconsistent condom use, including violence, could reduce this gap. YWSS who do not self-identify as FSW have less access to condoms and may require additional programmatic intervention.","Chabata, Sungai T; Hensen, Bernadette; Chiyaka, Tarisai; Mushati, Phillis; Busza, Joanna; Floyd, Sian; Birdthistle, Isolde; Hargreaves, James R; Cowan, Frances M",J Int AIDS Soc,481,13

Internationally, cases in newborns are few and the outcomes, in general, are good. There is no certainty of possible vertical transmission, and the presence of the virus in human milk is improbable. The gold standard for diagnosis is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We performed a literature review and presented a case of perinatal COVID-19. Clinical case: We describe the case of a full-term male infant with a birth weight of 3450 g and history of rooming-in with another mother-baby pair, both positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the second day of life, the neonate developed pneumonia, with clinical, X-ray and ultrasound diagnostic confirmation. On the third day of life, RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; the mother was also positive but remained asymptomatic. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to a tertiary level neonatal unit on day 5 of life, where congenital heart disease was ruled out. He evolved satisfactorily with a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8 and was extubated and discharged on day 21 of life. Telephone follow-up was performed without complications. Conclusions: The present case was classified as horizontal transmission with a short incubation period of COVID-19.","Lima-Rogel, Victoria; Villegas-Silva, Raúl; Coronado-Zarco, Alejandra; Estrada-Ruelas, Isaac; Vega, Alma R Sánchez-De la; Muro-Flores, Raúl H; Villa-Guillén, Mónica",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,481,1

We aimed at investigating whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak limited access to ED and affected urgent surgical activities during and immediately after the 2-month pandemic-related national lockdown. METHODS: Data regarding patients who accessed to the surgical ED were retrospectively collected. Analysed time-periods included: 'Pre-COVID-19 Era', 'COVID-19 Era' considered as the period of full national lockdown and 'Post-COVID-19 Era' after easing of lockdown measures. Consecutive emergency surgical procedures and ED admissions before, during and after COVID-19-lockdown were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in overall ED admissions and in all-specialty surgical consultations (P<0.01) throughout the outbreak. Once national lockdown was eased, we recorded a subsequent rebound 5-fold rise of emergency surgical procedures compared to COVID-19 group (P=0.011). Time-to-surgery was significantly greater in 'COVID-19 era' and 'post-COVID-19 era' compared to 'pre-COVID-19' group (22.56±4.78, 75.99±15.89 and 16.73 ±1.76 hours, respectively) (P<0.01). A raised incidence of postoperative complications emerged in the 'COVID-19 era' group (37.5%) compared to pre and post-COVID groups (9.1% and 12.5%, respectively; P<0.001). Mortality rate in the 'COVID-19 era' was 31.3% and 7.5% in 'post-COVID-19' group (<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the major reduction of emergency surgical procedures and overall ED admissions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The raised rate of postoperative complications and mortality might be likely due to the superior severity of surgical conditions observed in the 'COVID-19 era' subjects together with a probable deferred pursuit of medical attention.","Casella, Giovanni; Castagneto-Gissey, Lidia; Lattina, Ilario; Ferrari, Paolo; Iodice, Alessandra; Tesori, Chiara; Catani, Marco; Assenza, Marco; Mingoli, Andrea; LA Torre, Filippo",,481,29

To date, therapeutic vaccines have not been successful in eliciting HIV-specific CD8 T cell or bNAb responses that are capable of preventing long-term viral rebound upon ART cessation. These challenges suggest that a combinatorial approach that harnesses both bNAbs and CD8 T cell responses may be necessary for long term control of viral replication. In this study we demonstrate a synergistic interaction between CD8 T cells and bNAbs using an in vitro model.

Anticipating the future widespread use of COVID-19 testing in dental offices, the authors wrote this article as a proactive effort to provide dental health care providers with current and necessary information surrounding the topic. METHODS: The authors consulted all relevant and current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as online resources and review articles. RESULTS: Routine COVID-19 screening and triage protocols are unable to detect all infected people. With the advancements in diagnostic tools and techniques, COVID-19 testing at home or in the dental office may provide dentists with the ability to evaluate the disease status of their patients. At-home or point-of-care (POC) tests, providing results within minutes of being administered, would allow for appropriate measures and rapid decisions about dental patients' care process. In this review, the authors provide information about available laboratory and POC COVID-19 screening methods and identify and elaborate on the options available for use by dentists as well as the regulatory requirements of test administration. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists need to be familiar with COVID-19 POC testing options. In addition to contributing to public health, such tests may deliver rapid, accurate, and actionable results to clinical and infection control teams to enhance the safe patient flow in dental practices. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Oral health care must continue to offer safety in this or any future pandemics. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the POC offers a control mechanism contributing to and enhancing the real and perceived safety of care in the dental office setting.","Shirazi, Sajjad; Stanford, Clark M; Cooper, Lyndon F",J Am Dent Assoc,481,26

The purpose of this study was to determine changes in flight operations during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: A survey of the American College of Emergency Physicians Air Medical Section was conducted between May 13, 2020, and August 1, 2020. COVID-19 prevalence was defined as high versus low based on cases > 2,500 or &#8804; 2,500. RESULTS: Of the 48 respondents, the majority (89.6%) reported that their patient guidelines had changed because of COVID-19; 89.6% of programs reported transporting COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 91.5% reported transporting persons under investigation. The majority of respondents reported additional training in COVID-19 airway management (79.2%) and personal protective equipment use (93.6%). Permitted aerosol-generating procedures included bilevel positive airway pressure (40.4%) and high-flow nasal oxygen (66.0%). No difference in guideline changes, positive COVID-19/persons under investigation transport restrictions, or permitted aerosol-generating procedures were noted between high- and low-prevalence settings. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in changes to HEMS guidelines regardless of local disease prevalence.

It can, however, take days to provide the diagnosis, and false negative rate is relatively high. Imaging, in particular chest computed tomography (CT), can assist with diagnosis and assessment of this disease. Nevertheless, it is shown that standard dose CT scan gives significant radiation burden to patients, especially those in need of multiple scans. In this study, we consider low-dose and ultra-low-dose (LDCT and ULDCT) scan protocols that reduce the radiation exposure close to that of a single X-Ray, while maintaining an acceptable resolution for diagnosis purposes. Since thoracic radiology expertise may not be widely available during the pandemic, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based framework using a collected dataset of LDCT/ULDCT scans, to study the hypothesis that the AI model can provide human-level performance. The AI model uses a two stage capsule network architecture and can rapidly classify COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and normal cases, using LDCT/ULDCT scans.

Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess health system preparedness in tandem with need projections for comprehensive outlook. Objective: We attempted this study to forecast the need for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in need due to COVID-19. Methods: We employed age-structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the need under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of containment and mitigation strategies. Correspondingly, data on health resources was collated from various government records. Further, we computed daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. Findings: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in need during peak of epidemic. Also, model suggests that continuing strict lockdown measures in India after mid May 2020 would have been ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly. Augmenting testing of 1,500,000 tests per day during projected peak (mid-Sept) under social-distancing measures and current test to positive rate of 9.7% would lead to more documented cases (60, 000, 000 to 90, 000, 000) leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 13x, 70x and 37x times more acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively would be required to commensurate with need under that scenario. However, if testing capacity is limited to 9,000,000 tests per day (current situation as of 19th August 2020) under continued social-distancing measures, documented cases would plummet significantly, still requiring 5x, 31x and 16x times the current allocated resources (acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively) to meet unmet need for COVID-19 treatment in India.","Verma, Veenapani Rajeev; Saini, Anuraag; Gandhi, Sumirtha; Dash, Umakant; Koya, Shaffi Fazaludeen",,481,26

Jordanian universities and schools have also fully utilized long-distance education during this hard time. Furthermore, educational experts have emphasized that it will be used even when this pandemic is over, at least by integrating it into a traditional classroom method. In Jordan, tools such as E-learning platform namely Moodle, and meeting tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams have been widely used. It is a great necessity to evaluate the usability of these tools. This study aims to evaluate and compare the usability of the mentioned tools. We conducted this study using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, which mainly focuses on ease of use, efficiency, and easy to learn.

Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of CRS. We describe the efficacy and safety of TCZ in SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 20 2020 to May 21 2020. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of a composite of either need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Safety outcomes included an increase in liver transaminases and/or evidence of infection. Results: A total of 20 patients received TCZ during the study period. The median age was 54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47-63). About 85% of the patients were male. Nearly 70% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. About 55% required ICU admission. The median duration of ICU stay was 11 days (95% CI: 3-13 days). The cumulative incidence of the requirement for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvement and mortality was 11% (95% CI: 0.03%-1%), 74% (95% CI 37%-89%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%-63%), respectively. There was no difference in outcomes according to age, gender or computed tomography severity score. Asymptomatic transaminitis was the most common drug reaction (55%), and one patient developed bacteraemia. Conclusions: TCZ is likely a safe and effective modality of treatment for improving clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS CoV-2 patients with a reduction in ICU stay and ventilatory care need.","Patel, Atul; Shah, Kinjal; Dharsandiya, Mitkumar; Patel, Ketan; Patel, Tushar; Patel, Mukesh; Reljic, Tea; Kumar, Ambuj",Indian J Med Microbiol,481,20

This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution and population mobility on COVID-19 across China. METHODS: We obtained daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, air particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), weather parameters such as ambient temperature (AT) and absolute humidity (AH), and population mobility scale index (MSI) in 63 cities of China on a daily basis (excluding Wuhan) from January 01 to March 02, 2020. Then, the Generalized additive models (GAM) with a quasi-Poisson distribution were fitted to estimate the effects of PM10, PM2.5 and MSI on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: We found each 1 unit increase in daily MSI was significantly positively associated with daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all lag days and the strongest estimated RR (1.21, 95% CIs:1.14 ~ 1.28) was observed at lag 014. In PM analysis, we found each 10 µg/m3 increase in the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 was positively associated with the confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the estimated strongest RRs (both at lag 7) were 1.05 (95% CIs: 1.04, 1.07) and 1.06 (95% CIs: 1.04, 1.07), respectively. A similar trend was also found in all cumulative lag periods (from lag 01 to lag 014). The strongest effects for both PM10 and PM2.5 were at lag 014, and the RRs of each 10 µg/m3 increase were 1.18 (95% CIs:1.14, 1.22) and 1.23 (95% CIs:1.18, 1.29), respectively.

Additionally, racial and ethnic variation in incidence is typically presented in broad categories rather than by narrow age ranges. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data (2000-2017) were examined to calculate frequencies and age-adjusted incidence rates among individuals aged birth to 39 years. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated as the measure of association for rate comparisons by race and Hispanic origin overall and by single year of age. RESULTS: Several histologic types showed substantial variation in race/ethnicity-specific and overall rates by single year of age. Overall, Black children and young adults experienced substantially decreased incidence of acute lymphoid leukemia (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.49-0.55) compared to Whites, and this decreased incidence was strongest at ages 1 through 7 years and 16 through 20 years. Hispanic individuals experienced decreased overall incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (IRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.48-0.52) and astrocytoma (IRR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.52-0.56) and increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.42-1.51) compared to non-Hispanic Whites, and the increased risk was strongest at ages 10 through 23 years. Substantial decreased risk across many tumor types was also observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of incidence rates for pediatric cancers by narrow age groups may provide insights regarding etiological differences in subgroups. Additionally, variation in age-specific incidence rates by race and ethnicity may enable hypothesis generation on drivers of disparities observed.","Marcotte, Erin L; Domingues, Allison M; Sample, Jeannette M; Richardson, Michaela R; Spector, Logan G",Cancer,481,24

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique is the standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which, however, requires complicated sample manipulation (e.g., RNA extraction) and is time-consuming. We previously demonstrated that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could precisely detect Human papillomavirus and somatic mutations of Epidermal growth factor receptor gene and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene in plasma. The objective of this study was to develop CRISPR as a rapid test for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. We first combined reverse transcription-isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification and CRSIPR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in genomic RNA of cells infected with the virus. The CRISPR assay with guide RNA against the M gene of SARS-CoV-2 had a sensitivity of 0.1 copies per µL for detection of the virus. We then used the CRSIPR assay to directly analyze raw SARS-CoV-2 samples. The CRISPR assay could sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 in one hour without RNA extraction. This assay can be performed at a single temperature and with minimal equipment. The results were immediately visualized either by a UV light illuminator or paper strips. The diagnostic value of the test was confirmed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 min gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.5% sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique.

Here, we show that TET2 deficiency leads to DNA hypermethylation of regulatory elements in GC B cells, associated with silencing of the respective genes. This hypermethylation affects the binding of transcription factors including those involved in exit from the GC reaction and involves pathways such as B cell receptor, antigen presentation, CD40, and others. Normal GC B cells manifest a typical hypomethylation signature, which is caused by AID, the enzyme that mediates somatic hypermutation. However, AID-induced demethylation is markedly impaired in TET2-deficient GC B cells, suggesting that AID epigenetic effects are partially dependent on TET2. Last, we find that TET2 mutant DLBCLs also manifest the aberrant TET2-deficient GC DNA methylation signature, suggesting that this epigenetic pattern is maintained during and contributes to lymphomagenesis.","Rosikiewicz, Wojciech; Chen, Xiaowen; Dominguez, Pilar M; Ghamlouch, Hussein; Aoufouchi, Said; Bernard, Olivier A; Melnick, Ari; Li, Sheng",Sci.

A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drug's properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug's P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","Arutyunova, Elena; Khan, Muhammad Bashir; Fischer, Conrad; Lu, Jimmy; Lamer, Tess; Vuong, Wayne; van Belkum, Marco J; McKay, Ryan T; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Vederas, John C; Young, Howard S; Lemieux, M Joanne",J Mol Biol,481,15

Both, substitution of interferon and blocking interferon signaling through JAK STAT inhibition to limit cytokine storms have been proposed. However, little is known so far about possible abnormalities in STAT signaling in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the current study, we investigated downstream targets of interferon signaling, including STAT1, pSTAT1 and 2 and IRF1, 7 and 9 by flow cytometry in 30 patients with COVID-19, 17 with mild and 13 with severe infection. We report an upregulation of STAT1 and IRF9 in mild and severe COVID-19 cases, which correlated with the IFN-signature assessed by Siglec-1 (CD169) expression on peripheral monocytes. Most interestingly, Siglec-1 and STAT1 in CD14+ monocytes and plasmablasts showed lower expression among severe COVID-19 cases compared to mild cases. Contrary to the baseline whole protein STAT1 expression, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was enhanced in severe COVID-19 cases, indicating a dysbalanced JAK STAT signaling that fails to induce transcription of interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE). This abnormality persisted after IFN- and IFN-{gamma} stimulation of PBMCs from patients with severe COVID-19. The data suggest impaired STAT1 transcriptional upregulation among severely infected patients which may represent a potential predictive biomarker and may allow stratification of patients for certain interferon-pathway targeted treatments.","Rincon-Arevalo, Hectot; Aue, Arman; Ritter, Jacob; Szelinski, Franziska; Khadzhynov, Dmytro; Zickler, Daniel; Stefanski, Ana-Luisa; Lino, Andreia C; Koerper, Sixten; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Doerner, Thomas; Schrezenmeier, Eva",,481,6

METHODS: We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP < 0.15). RESULTS: Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.","Morra, Anna; Escala-Garcia, Maria; Beesley, Jonathan; Keeman, Renske; Canisius, Sander; Ahearn, Thomas U; Andrulis, Irene L; Anton-Culver, Hoda; Arndt, Volker; Auer, Paul L; Augustinsson, Annelie; Beane Freeman, Laura E; Becher, Heiko; Beckmann, Matthias W; Behrens, Sabine; Bojesen, Stig E; Bolla, Manjeet K; Brenner, Hermann; Brüning, Thomas; Buys, Saundra S; Caan, Bette; Campa, Daniele; Canzian, Federico; Castelao, Jose E; Chang-Claude, Jenny; Chanock, Stephen J; Cheng, Ting-Yuan David; Clarke, Christine L; Colonna, Sarah V; Couch, Fergus J; Cox, Angela; Cross, Simon S; Czene, Kamila; Daly, Mary B; Dennis, Joe; Dörk, Thilo; Dossus, Laure; Dunning, Alison M; Dwek, Miriam; Eccles, Diana M; Ekici, Arif B; Eliassen, A Heather; Eriksson, Mikael; Evans, D Gareth; Fasching, Peter A; Flyger, Henrik; Fritschi, Lin; Gago-Dominguez, Manuela; García-Sáenz, José A; Giles, Graham G",Breast Cancer Res,481,20

METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 2791 UK adults recruited 30/04/2020-14/06/2020. Participants self-reported data on sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosed/suspected Covid-19, vaping status, changes in vaping and motivation to quit vaping since Covid-19. RESULTS: There were no differences in diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 between never, current and ex-vapers. Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out small negative (protective) associations between vaping status and diagnosed/suspected Covid-19. Among current vapers (n = 397), 9.7 % (95 % CI 6.8-12.6 %) self-reported vaping less than usual since Covid-19, 42.0 % (37.2-46.9 %) self-reported vaping more, and 48.3 % (43.4-53.2 %) self-reported no change. In adjusted analyses, vaping less was associated with being female (aOR = 3.40, 95 % CI 1.73-6.71), not living with children (aOR = 4.93, 1.15-21.08) and concurrent smoking (aOR = 8.77, 3.04-25.64), while vaping more was associated with being younger (aOR = 5.26, 1.37-20.0), living alone (aOR = 2.08, 1.14-3.85), and diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 (aOR = 4.72, 2.60-8.62). Of current vapers, 32.2 % (95 % CI 27.5-36.8 %) were motivated to quit vaping since Covid-19, partly motivated by Covid-19, and 21.0 %, (10.5-31.4 %) of recent ex-vapers quit vaping due to Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Among UK adults, self-reported diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 was not associated with vaping status. Half of current vapers changed their vaping consumption since Covid-19, with the majority reporting an increase, and a minority was motivated to quit due to Covid-19.

We assessed individual characteristics related to changes in emotional exhaustion and psychological distress over time. METHODS: A survey of diverse hospital staff measured emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout Inventory) and psychological distress (K6) in Fall 2020 (T1) and Winter 2021 (T2). Relationships between occupational, personal, and psychological variables were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Of 539 T1 participants, 484 (89.9%) completed T2. Emotional exhaustion differed by occupational role (F = 7.3, p < .001; greatest in nurses), with increases over time in those with children (F = 8.5, p = .004) or elders (F = 4.0, p = .047). Psychological distress was inversely related to pandemic self-efficacy (F = 110.0, p < .001), with increases over time in those with children (F = 7.0, p = .008). Severe emotional exhaustion occurred in 41.1% (95%CI 36.6-45.4) at T1 and 49.8% (95%CI 45.4-54.2) at T2 (McNemar test p < .001). Psychological distress occurred in 9.7% (95%CI 7.1-12.2) at T1 and 11.6% (95%CI 8.8-14.4) at T2 (McNemar test p = .33). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers' psychological burden is high and rising as the pandemic persists. Ongoing support is warranted, especially for nurses and those with children and elders at home. Modifiable protective factors, restorative sleep and self-efficacy, merit special attention.","Maunder, Robert G; Heeney, Natalie D; Kiss, Alex; Hunter, Jonathan J; Jeffs, Lianne P; Ginty, Leanne; Johnstone, Jennie; Loftus, Carla A; Wiesenfeld, Lesley A",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,481,24

The current study assessed the associations of age, gender and their interaction with loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. A pooled sample of 3,012 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey in one of three waves between May 8 and June 23, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations of loneliness with age and gender controlling for marital status, household income, education, living alone, employment situation, and survey wave. A likelihood ratio test assessed the model with interaction between age and gender included. Approximately 8.4% of the sample reported feeling lonely 5+ days in the past week. The regression model with main effects found greater odds of loneliness among women than men (AOR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.32, 2.34) and among all age groups younger than 60 years compared to those aged 60+ years (p = 0.002). In the final regression model, a significant interaction effect between age and gender on loneliness was found. The interaction showed that women had greater odds of loneliness than men among those aged 18-29 years (AOR = 3.53, 95%CI = 1.69, 7.37) and 60+ years (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.33, 5.17). Special consideration of loneliness among younger and older adult women is needed in service planning. Given inconsistencies with pre-pandemic studies, detailed data collected during the current crisis is essential to inform proactive resource allocation to prevent and treat mental health consequences of the pandemic.","Wickens, Christine M; McDonald, André J; Elton-Marshall, Tara; Wells, Samantha; Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Jankowicz, Damian; Hamilton, Hayley A",J Psychiatr Res,481,29

Methods: We tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data. Results: CCP usage per admission peaked in Fall 2020, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, after randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in mortality, CCP usage per admission declined steadily to a nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.52, p=0.002) between CCP usage per hospital admission and deaths occurring 2 weeks after admission, and this finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place 1, 2, or 3 weeks after admission. Changes in the number of hospital admissions, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and age of patients could not explain these findings. The retreat from CCP usage might have resulted in as many as 29,000 excess deaths from mid-November 2020 to February 2021. Conclusions: A strong inverse correlation between CCP use and mortality per admission in the USA provides population-level evidence consistent with the notion that CCP reduces mortality in COVID-19 and suggests that the recent decline in usage could have resulted in excess deaths.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a novels shock to livestock systems and may result in indirect effects on livestock emissions and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the pandemic in 2020, extensive pastoralist livestock systems in Northern Kenya were subjected to restrictions on movement, increased costs of transportation, and closure of livestock markets. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya using proxy data and a three-part framework based on changes in 1) herd size, 2) feed availability, and 3) livestock movement. METHODS We evaluated changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on proxy data from crowd-sourced market data, household panel surveys, and remote sensing data on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Proxy data were obtained before the pandemic in 2019 and after the pandemic in 2020 to compare between years and evaluate the indirect effects of the pandemic and associated restrictions on livestock GHG emissions using the three-part framework. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Overall GHG emissions from livestock in Northern Kenya have decreased due to the pandemic and this was largely driven by reductions in herd size. This reduction in GHG emissions occurred despite an increase in GHG emissions from livestock associated with higher feed availability. Decreased livestock movement due to the pandemic contributed to reductions in GHG emissions from livestock, but such reductions were likely to be small due to limited need for livestock to travel longer distances under the prevailing conditions of high feed availability. SIGNIFICANCE This research shows that assessments of changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems due to shock events can be conducted successfully based on proxy data and the three-part framework developed here. We found that shock events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to unexpected results with respect to the direction and magnitude of changes in livestock emissions depending on contextual factors and environmental conditions. Thus, we call for more spatially explicit and continued data collection to assess and monitor the consequences of shock events on GHG emissions from livestock and related SDGs in Africa.","Graham, Michael W.; Chelanga, Philemon Jensen Nathaniel D.; Leitner, Sonja M.; Fava, Francesco Merbold Lutz",Agricultural Systems,481,16

415383,415383,415383,Covid-19 and the mundane practices of privilege,15.72669,3.2337382,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the newly emerged Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disaster, little is known about the nutritional risks for critically ill patients. It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of ï¼18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of ï¼24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of &#8805;5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients' outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. RESULTS: A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (&#8805;5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P ï¼0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Ping; He, Zhigang; Yu, Gang; Peng, Dan; Feng, Yikuan; Ling, Jianmin; Wang, Ye; Li, Shusheng; Bian, Yi",Clin. nutr.

It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual's eating behaviors. The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. METHOD: Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, health-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. RESULTS: Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR = 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR = 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR = 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were more commonly categorised into the group consistently eating more, whereas participants with underweigh persistently ate less. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics. This is particularly important as part of on-going preventive efforts to prevent nutrition-related chronic diseases.","Herle, Moritz; Smith, Andrea D; Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Clin Nutr ESPEN,481,16

Presentations range from asymptomatic to overwhelming symptoms that result in hospitalization, intubation, or death. The number of COVID-19 related deaths among older adults in the outpatient practice during the peak of the pandemic is unclear. METHODS: The objective is to describe the COVID-19 status and clinical characteristics of patients in a Geriatrics Ambulatory Practice who died during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Retrospective chart review Participants: 54 adults age 65 years and older. Methods: COVID-19 status defined by positive test result and presumed COVID-19 status based upon clinical presentation. RESULTS: Out of 1200 active patients in the Geriatrics Ambulatory Practice, 54 (4.5%) died between January 1st, 2020 and June 30th, 2020. The study sample was 63% female, 33% Hispanic/Latino, 27% Black/African American, and 22% white. The mean (SD) age was 86(8.6) years, range (72-107 years). The most prevalent medical comorbidities in decreasing order of frequency were hypertension (88.9%), diabetes (51.9%), and cognitive impairment (51.9%). Nineteen (35%) were COVID-19 positive and 8 had presumed COVID-19. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities between the COVID-19 or presumed COVID-19 group compared to those with No COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Approximately 35% of Geriatric patients who died during the first 6 months of 2020 had confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 15% had presumed COVID-19. The actual number of COVID-19 related deaths among older adults in the ambulatory practice during the peak of the pandemic is difficult to estimate and likely underestimated.","George, Claudene J; Guo, Alice",J Prim Care Community Health,481,29

It has a fast-spreading potential worldwide, which leads to high mortality regardless of lows death rates. Now some vaccines or a specific drug are approved but not available for every country for disease prevention and/or treatment. Therefore, it is a high demand to identify the known drugs and test them as a possible therapeutic approach. In this critical situation, one or more of these drugs may represent the only option to treat or reduce the severity of the disease, until some specific drugs or vaccines will be developed and/or approved for everyone in this pandemic. In this updated review, the available repurpose immunotherapeutic treatment strategies are highlighted, elucidating the crosstalk between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2.

Patients with COVID-19 often exhibit cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury, but imaging evidence is lacking. In the study we detected and evaluated the severity of myocardial dysfunction in COVID-19 patient population using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2-D STE). A total of 218 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had no underlying cardiovascular diseases were enrolled and underwent transthoracic echocardiography. This study cohort included 52 (23.8%) critically ill and 166 noncritically ill patients. Global longitudinal strains (GLSs) and layer-specific longitudinal strains (LSLSs) were obtained using 2-D STE. Changes in GLS were correlated with the clinical parameters. We showed that GLS was reduced (<-21.0%) in about 83% of the patients. GLS reduction was more common in critically sick patients (98% vs. 78.3%, P < 0.001), and the mean GLS was significantly lower in the critically sick patients than those noncritical (-13.7% ± 3.4% vs. -17.4% ± 3.2%, P < 0.001). The alteration of GLS was more prominent in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium (P < 0.001). GLS was correlated to mean serum pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2, RR = 0.42, P < 0.0001), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, R = -0.20, P = 0.006) and inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 (R = -0.21, P = 0.003). In conclusions, our results demonstrate that myocardial dysfunction is common in COVID-19 patients, particularly those who are critically sick. Changes in indices of myocardial strain were associated with indices of inflammatory markers and hypoxia, suggesting partly secondary nature of myocardial dysfunction.","Li, Rui; Wang, Hong; Ma, Fei; Cui, Guang-Lin; Peng, Li-Yuan; Li, Chen-Ze; Zeng, He-Song; Marian, Ali J; Wang, Dao-Wen",Acta pharmacol.

The objective of this paper is to document findings from interviews conducted with family members on three categories: (1) feelings experienced during the visit, (2) barriers, challenges or concerns faced using this service, and (3) opportunities for improvements. METHODS: Family members were interviewed postvisit via phone. For category 1 (feelings), automated analysis in Python using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner package produced weighted valence (extent of positive, negative or neutral emotive connotations) of the interviewees' word choices. Outputs were compared with a manual coder's valence ratings to assess reliability. Two raters conducted inductive thematic analysis on the notes from these interviews to analyse categories 2 (barriers) and 3 (opportunities). RESULTS: Valence-based and manual sentiment analysis of 230 comments received on feelings showed over 86% positive sentiments (88.2% and 86.8%, respectively) with some neutral (7.3% and 6.8%) and negative (4.5% and 6.4%) sentiments. The qualitative analysis of data from 57 participants who commented on barriers showed four primary concerns: inability to communicate due to patient status (44% of respondents); technical difficulties (35%); lack of touch and physical presence (11%); and frequency and clarity of communications with the care team (11%). Suggested improvements from 59 participants included: on demand access (51%); improved communication with the care team (17%); improved scheduling processes (10%); and improved system feedback and technical capabilities (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of vICU for remote family visitations evoked happiness, joy, gratitude and relief and a sense of closure for those who lost loved ones. Identified areas for concern and improvement should be addressed in future implementations of telecritical care for this purpose.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Dhala, Atiya; Zheng, Feibi; Ahmadi, Nima; Kash, Bita; Masud, Faisal",BMJ qual. saf.

We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS: In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION: There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.","Bjørnsen, Lars Petter; Næss-Pleym, Lars Eide; Dale, Jostein; Laugsand, Lars Erik",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,481,1

We investigated the incidence of COVID-19 and the impact of immunosuppression and containment measures on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large IBD cohort, from a multicenter cohort from 21st of February to 30th of June, 2020. Ninety-seven patients with IBD (43 UC, 53 CD, one unclassified IBD) and concomitant COVID-19 over a total of 23,879 patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD vs. the general population was 0.406% and 0.402% cases, respectively. Twenty-three patients (24%) were hospitalized, 21 (22%) had pneumonia, four (4%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and one patient died. Lethality in our cohort was 1% compared to 9% in the general population.

This tool development was a part of research conducted to examine the preparedness of Indian higher education teachers during the period of lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic. After reviewing related literature, initially 37 items related with the attitude of teachers towards online education were framed. Later on, 11 items were modified and four were deleted as per the opinions of the experts. The draft scale consisting of 33 items was administered on teachers and data was collected with the help of Google forms. Item analysis was carried out using t-value and r-value. Reliability of scale was determined by using Cronbach Alpha value (0.88) and split-halt correlation (0.82). After item analysis, the scale items were reduced to 30 and four factors were established as a result of factor analysis (Principal Component Analysis). Psychometric scale analyses have shown that this scale is valid, reliable and thus can be used in the evaluation of teachers 'attitudes towards online teaching and learning.","Sangwan, Anupma; Sangwan, Anurag; Punia, Poonam",TechTrends,481,16

Among actions against the further outbreak of COVID-19, vaccination has been considered as a chief candidate. However, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has led to concern about their safety and thus to public vaccine hesitancy. Strategic heath communication channels, which are widely used and highly trusted, can contribute to more effective promotions of vaccination intention and to the reduction of misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between the exposure to and credibility of different health information sources and the COVID-19 vaccination intention among 629 German adults. Descriptive statistical analysis and multiple linear regressions are employed to examine the research questions. Results reveal that, aside from reliable information from experts and health authorities, local newspapers also have a positive impact on COVID-19 vaccination intention. However, this effect diminishes to some extent when age is considered. In addition, alternative information sources pose a noticeable threat to COVID-19 vaccination intention. Therefore, a close cooperation between healthcare experts, health authorities, and mass media with regard to information dissemination is conducive for vaccination campaigns and for the fight against misleading claims about COVID-19 vaccines.","Gehrau, V.; Fujarski, S.; Lorenz, H.; Schieb, C.; Blobaum, B.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],481,24

Since its early use for scoliosis surgery, the growth and utilization of IOM techniques expanded dramatically over the past 50 years to include spinal tumor resection and evaluation of cerebral ischemia. The importance of IOM has been broadly acknowledged, and in 1989, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) released a statement that the use of SSEPs should be standard-of-care during spine surgery. In 2012, both the AAN and the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) recommended that: ""Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) using SSEPs and transcranial MEPs be established as an effective means of predicting an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as paraparesis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, in spinal surgery."" With a multimodal approach that combines SSEPs, MEPs, and sEMG with tEMG and D waves, as appropriate, sensitivity and specificity can be maximized for the diagnosis of reversible insults to the spinal cord, nerve roots, and peripheral nerves. As with most patient safety efforts in the operating room, IOM requires contributions from and communication between a number of different teams. This comprehensive review of neuromonitoring techniques for surgery on the central and peripheral nervous system will highlight the technical, surgical and anesthesia factors required to optimize outcomes. In addition, this review will discuss important trouble shooting measures to be considered when managing ION changes concerning for potential injury.","Buhl, Lauren K; Bastos, Andres Brenes; Pollard, Richard J; Arle, Jeffrey E; Thomas, George P; Song, Yinchen; Boone, M Dustin",J Intensive Care Med,481,6

However, such user participation is infeasible for long-term continuous cardiac monitoring in order to capture the intermittent and asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart that short-term ECG tests often miss. In this paper, we present a computational solution for automated and continuous cardiac monitoring. A neural network is designed to jointly infer ECG and diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) from photoplethysmogram (PPG). PPG measures the variations of blood volume driven by heartbeats, and the signal can be sensed at the wrist or finger via an optical sensor. To minimize the memory consumption on mobile devices, we devise a model compression scheme for the proposed architecture. For higher trustworthiness and transparency, this study also addresses the problem of model interpretation. We analyze the latent connection between PPG and ECG as well as the CVDs-related features of PPG learned by the neural network, aiming at obtaining clinical insights from data. The quantitative comparison with prior methods on a benchmark dataset shows that our algorithm can make more accurate ECG inference.

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population. As the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, quantifying the impact of interventions will be a vital consideration for the appropriate use of mitigation strategies.","Imai, Natsuko; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Abbott, Sam; Bhatia, Sangeeta; van Elsland, Sabine; Prem, Kiesha; Liu, Yang; Ferguson, Neil M",Wellcome Open Res,481,16

This paper reports the strain-induced shrinkage in the Si bandgap, providing photosensing well beyond its fundamental absorption limit in Si nanomembrane (NM) photodetectors (PDs). The Si-NM PD pixels were mechanically stretched (biaxially) by a maximum strain of ~3.5% through pneumatic pressure-induced bulging, enhancing photoresponsivity and extending the Si absorption limit up to 1550 nm, which is the essential wavelength range of the lidar sensors for obstacle detection in self-driving vehicles. The development of deformable three-dimensional optoelectronics via gas pressure-induced bulging also facilitated the realization of unique device designs with concave and convex hemispherical architectures, which mimics the electronic prototypes of biological eyes.","Katiyar, Ajit K; Thai, Kean You; Yun, Won Seok; Lee, JaeDong; Ahn, Jong-Hyun",Sci Adv,481,29

In order to explore the mechanisms of how the evolution works, we associate the nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and its related families with the degrees of randomness. Since the distances between randomly generated nucleotide sequences are very concentrated around a mean with low variance, they are qualified as good candidates for the fundamental reference. Such reference could then be applied to measure the randomness of other Coronaviridae sequences. Our findings show that the relative randomness ratios are very consistent and concentrated. This result indicates their randomness is very stable and predictable.

Empirical models were developed using the relations of nutrients (total phosphorus, TP, and total nitrogen, TN) with chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) for efficient lake managements. The empirical models indicated that TP was the key regulating factor for algal growth in agricultural (R2 = 0.69) and power generation (R2 = 0.50) reservoirs. The CHL-a:TP and TN:TP ratios, indicators of phosphorus limitation, were used to validate the phosphorus reduction approach. The mean CHL-a:TP ratio of agricultural reservoirs was 0.60, indicating that algal chlorophyll is potentially limited by TP than any other factors. Agricultural, multipurpose, and power generation reservoirs, based on the N:P ratios, were more P- limited systems than natural lakes and estuarine reservoirs. The trophic state index (TSI) of Korean reservoirs varied between mesotrophy to hypereutrophy based on values of TSI (TP), TSI (CHL-a), and TSI (SD). Agricultural reservoirs were hypereutrophic using the criteria of TSI (CHL-a) and blue-green algae dominated the algal community. Analysis of trophic state index deviation (TSID) indicated that agricultural reservoirs were primarily P limited and other factors had minor effect. In contrast, the trophic status of estuarine and power generation reservoirs and natural lakes was largely modified by non-algal turbidity. Our outcomes may be effectively used for Korean lakes and reservoirs management.","Mamun, Md; Kwon, Seokcheol; Kim, Jeong-Eun; An, Kwang-Guk",Sci Total Environ,481,26

However, dilute ferrofluids pose an additional challenge compared to concentrated ones. Migration of the magnetic nanoparticles toward a magnet is not well counteracted by a buildup of an osmotic pressure gradient, and consequently, homogeneity of the fluid is gradually lost. Here, we investigate this phenomenon by measuring and numerically modeling time-dependent concentration profiles in aqueous ferrofluids in the field of a neodymium magnet and at 10 T in a Bitter magnet. The numerical model incorporates magnetic, frictional, and osmotic forces on the particles and takes into account the polydispersity of the particles and the spatial dependence of the magnetic field. The magnetic sedimentation rate in our most stable ferrofluids can be understood in terms of the magnetophoresis of separate nanoparticles, a best-case scenario when it comes to applications.","van Silfhout, Alex M; Engelkamp, Hans; Erné, Ben H",J. phys. chem.

Randomised controlled trials have recently shown that there are no meaningful benefits of these two therapies in hospitalised patients. Uncertainty remains regarding the potential harmful impact of these therapies as very early treatments and their burden to the health care system. The present study investigated the length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality, and costs of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or their combination in comparison with standard of care among patients hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study took place in the Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland (n = 840) between 26 February and 31 May 2020. Demographics, treatment regimens, comorbidities, the modified National Early Warning Score (mNEWS) on admission, and contraindications to COVID-19 treatment options were assessed. Outcomes included LOS, in-hospital mortality, and drug and LOS costs. RESULTS: After successful propensity score matching, patients treated with (1) hydroxychloroquine, (2) lopinavir/ritonavir or (3) their combination had on average 3.75 additional hospitalisation days (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37&ndash;6.12, p = 0.002), 1.23 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI &minus;1.24 &ndash; 3.51, p = 0.319), and 4.19 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI 1.52&ndash;5.31, p &lt;0.001), respectively, compared with patients treated with the standard of care. Neither experimental therapy was significantly associated with mortality. These additional hospital days amounted to 1010.77 additional days for hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine combined with lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in an additional cost of US$ 2,492,214 (95%CI US$ 916,839&ndash;3,450,619).

The COVID-19 pandemic acutely stressed our established system and required us to enhance our utilization of telemedicine. We hypothesized that expansion of telemedicine to new and follow up patient visits for pediatric urology could be done effectively in a way that satisfied patient and parental expectations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a pre-COVID-19 established telemedicine program based in our electronic medical record (EMR), patients and providers transitioned to primarily virtual visits when clinically appropriate. Guidelines were formulated to direct patient scheduling, provider and staff education was provided, including a process map designed for multiple providers to complete video visits (VV), and the EMR was redesigned to incorporate telehealth terminology. The number of VV per provider was recorded using the electronic medical record, and patient reported outcomes (PRO) were measured using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 631 VV met inclusion criteria during the period of May 2018-April 2020. This included 334 follow up, 172 new, and 125 postoperative visits. The median age of patients at time of visit was 7 years (IQR 2-12 years), median visit time was 20 min (IQR 15-30 min), and the median travel distance saved by performing a VV was 12.2 miles (IQR 6.3-26.8 miles). Diagnoses were varied and included the entire breadth of a standard pediatric urology practice. The PRO questionnaire was completed for 325 of those patient visits. Families reported a high overall satisfaction with the video visits (median score of 10 out of 10) and felt that the visit met their child's medical needs. 90% stated that they would strongly recommend a telehealth visit to other families. Patients and parents reported benefits of VV including decreased travel costs and less time taken off from work and school. CONCLUSION: The EMR enabled nimble redirection of clinical care in the setting of a global pandemic. The enhanced use of telemedicine has proved to be an alternative method to provide care for pediatric urology patients. Families indicate a high degree of satisfaction with this technology in addition to significant time and cost savings. Telemedicine should remain a key aspect of medical care and expanded from post-operative visits to new patient and follow up visits, even as we return to our normal practices as the pandemic restrictions soften.","Gan, Zoe; Lee, Seo Young; Weiss, Dana A; Van Batavia, Jason; Siu, Sharmayne; Frazier, Jennifer; Zderic, Stephen A; Shukla, Aseem R; Srinivasan, Arun K; Kolon, Thomas F; Zaontz, Mark R; Canning, Douglas A; Long, Christopher J",J. pediatr. urol,481,16

The search for the understanding of the disease spreading made scientists around the world turn their attention to epidemiological studies. An interesting approach in epidemiological modeling nowadays is to use agent-based models, which allow to consider a heterogeneous population and to evaluate the role of superspreaders in this population. In this work, we implemented an agent-based model using probabilistic cellular automata to simulate SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics using COVID-19 infection parameters. Differently to the usual studies, we did not define the superspreaders individuals a priori, we only left the agents to execute a random walk along the sites. When two or more agents share the same site, there is a probability to spread the infection if one of them is infected. To evaluate the spreading, we built the transmission network and measured the degree distribution, betweenness, and closeness centrality. The results displayed for different levels of mobility restriction show that the degree reduces as the mobility reduces, but there is an increase of betweenness and closeness for some network nodes. We identified the superspreaders at the end of the simulation, showing the emerging behavior of the model since these individuals were not initially defined. Simulations also showed that the superspreaders are responsible for most of the infection propagation and the impact of personal protective equipment in the spreading of the infection. We believe that this study can bring important insights for the analysis of the disease dynamics and the role of superspreaders, contributing to the understanding of how to manage mobility during a highly infectious pandemic as COVID-19.","Lima, L L; Atman, A P F",PLoS One,481,24

The purpose of this review is to elucidate the pathophysiology of this unique coagulopathy. METHODS: The authors performed online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) term ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""coagulopathy,"" and ""thrombus."" Then, selected 51 articles that closely relevant to coagulopathy in COVID-19. RESULTS: The primary targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the pneumocytes, immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. The alveolar damage and the pulmonary microvascular thrombosis are the major causes of acute lung injury in COVID-19. The endotheliopathy that occurs is due to direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of other pathways that include the immune system and thromboinflammatory responses leading to what is termed CAC. As a result, both microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic events occur in arterial, capillary, venule, and large vein vascular beds to produce multiorgan dysfunction and thrombotic complications. In addition to the endothelial damage, SARS-CoV-2 also can cause vasculitis and presents as a systemic inflammatory vascular disease. Clinical management of COVID-19 includes anticoagulation but novel therapies for endotheliopathy, hypercoagulability, and vasculitis are needed. CONCLUSION: The endotheliopathy due to direct endothelial infection with SARS-COV-2 and the indirect damage caused by inflammation play the predominant role in the development of CAC. The intensive control of thromboinflammation is necessary to improve the outcome of this highly detrimental contagious disease.","Iba, Toshiaki; Connors, Jean Marie; Levy, Jerrold H",Inflamm Res,481,24

Routine clinical diagnosis, however, is mostly performed by PCR - based assays that do not discriminate between infectious and non-virus. Herein, we aimed to determine the correlation between positive viral cultures and either PCR positivity, the Cycle Threshold (Ct) or the number of viral copies. MethodsA systematic electronic literature search was performed and studies that reported both viral SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR-based assays were included. A separate search for samples from blood, urine, stool, breast milk and tears were performed. To convert Ct values reported in the reviewed studies were to viral genomic copies, calibration experiments with four different reaction performed, using quantified RNA molecules. ResultsA total 540 articles were reviewed, and 38 studies were included in this review. Out of 276 positive-culture of non-severe patients, 272 (98.55%) were negative ten days after symptoms onset, while PCR assays remained positive for up to 67 days. In severely ill or immunocompromised patients positive-culture was obtained up to 32 days and out of 168 cultures, 31 (18.45%) stayed positive after day 10. In non-severe patients, in Ct value greater than 30 only 10.8% were still culture-positive while in Ct >35 it was nearly universally negative. The minimal calculated number of viral genome copies in culture-positive sample was 2.5 x 103 copies / mL. These findings were similar in immunocompromised patients. Recovering positive culture from non-respiratory samples was sporadically obtained in stool or urine samples. Conversion of Ct values to viral genome copies showed variability between different PCR assays and highlighted the need to standardize reports to correctly compare results obtained in different laboratories. ConclusionDuring the pandemic phase, non-severe COVID-19 patients who are recovering and are not immuno-suppressed, can be regarded as non-infectious, within 10 days from symptom onset, or with Ct value greater than 35 (or a calculated viral load lower than 1.2x103 copies / mL). These findings have important implications for recovering patients and asymptomatic patients, with respect to isolation criteria. The conversion of Cq values to viral genome copies described herein may be useful in future work, enabling a more standardized comparison between results reported in different studies from different laboratories.","rozenberg, gilad; Erster, Oran; Ghersin, Itai; Mandelboim, Michal; neuberger, Ami; Schwartz, Eli",,481,16

But its role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, frequencies of total and multiple subsets of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals were analyzed using a multicolor flow cytometry assay. Plasma concentration of IL-10 was measured using a microsphere-based immunoassay kit. Comparing to healthy controls, the frequencies of total lymphocytes and T cells decreased significantly in both acutely infected COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals. The frequencies of total lymphocytes correlated negatively with the frequencies of CD3- CD56+ NK cells. The frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells correlated with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios positively, while the frequencies of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ CD127- T cells correlated negatively with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios. Ratios of CD4+ /CD8+ T cells increased significantly in patients beyond age of 45 years. And accordingly, the frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells were also found significantly increased in these patients. Collectively, the results suggest that regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, the data indicate that NK cells might contribute to the COVID-19 associated lymphopenia.","Gao, Menglu; Liu, Yili; Guo, Mingquan; Wang, Qianying; Wang, Yan; Fan, Jian; Shen, Yinzhong; Hou, Junjie; Wan, Yanmin; Zhu, Zhaoqin",J. leukoc. biol,481,21

Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, nonhospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China. METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on 22 January 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (&#8805; 10 minutes within 2 m). Medium-risk contacts wore all US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), &#8805; 1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.","Scott, Sarah E; Zabel, Karen; Collins, Jennifer; Hobbs, Katherine C; Kretschmer, Melissa J; Lach, Mitchell; Turnbow, Katie; Speck, Lindsay; White, Jessica R; Maldonado, Keila; Howard, Brandon; Fowler, Jeanene; Singh, Sonia; Robinson, Susan; Pompa, Alexandra Peterson; Chatham-Stephens, Kevin; Xie, Amy; Cates, Jordan; Lindstrom, Stephen; Lu, Xiaoyan; Rolfes, Melissa A; Flanagan, Marcy; Sunenshine, Rebecca",Clin Infect Dis,481,16

The Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR) program is an action-oriented, evidence-based behavioral treatment for opioid and methamphetamine disorders in parents involved in the child welfare (CW) system. A seven-clinician team operates out of a Medicaid-funded clinic, primarily delivering services in the community. Attending to underlying mechanisms of FAIR's intervention strategies that promote client engagement and clinical outcomes, FAIR rapidly adapted procedures in response to COVID-19-onset disruptions. This study analyzed administrative records and Medicaid claims data from January 2019 to July 2020, including 157 clients and 17,449 claims. Analyses considered COVID-19 presence as March-July 2020. The study examined changes in the frequency and reimbursement volume of FAIR service delivery pre- and postonset of COVID-19. Although average monthly reimbursement per clinician did not significantly decline, reimbursement per client significantly declined by 31% (pre: $1005 [$732]; post: $698 [$546], p < .001). Clinicians delivered services on significantly more days per month during COVID-19 (mean (sd) = 16.73 (6.33); 20.26 (7.24), t(127) = -2.70, p < .01).

METHODS: A validated electronic survey was administered May-June, 2020 to US medical oncologists (MO), radiation oncologists (RO), and surgeons (SO) involved in clinical trials organizations. Questions on NET use included practice patterns for locoregional management following NET. RESULTS: 114 Physicians from 29 states completed the survey-42 (37%) MO, 14 (12%) RO, and 58 (51%) SO. Before COVID-19, most used NET 'rarely' (49/107, 46%) or 'sometimes' (36, 33%) for ER + BC. 46% would delay surgery 2 months without NET. The preferred NET regimen was tamoxifen for premenopausal and aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. 53% planned short term NET until surgery could proceed. Most recommended omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for one micrometastatic node after 1, 2, or 3 months of NET (1 month, N = 56/93, 60%; 2 months, N = 54/92, 59%; 3 months, N = 48/90, 53%). With longer duration of NET, omission of ALND decreased, regardless of years in practice, percent of practice in BC, practice type, participation in multidisciplinary tumor board, or number of regional COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: More physicians preferred NET for ER + BC during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic times. As the duration of NET extended, more providers favored ALND in low volume metastatic axillary disease. The Covid-19 pandemic affected practice of ER + BC; it remains to be seen how this may impact outcomes.","Park, Ko Un; Gregory, Megan; Bazan, Joey; Lustberg, Maryam; Rosenberg, Shoshana; Blinder, Victoria; Sharma, Priyanka; Pusztai, Lajos; Shen, Chengli; Partridge, Ann; Thompson, Alastair",Breast Cancer Res Treat,481,16

However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. METHODS: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. RESULTS: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals' infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. CONCLUSIONS: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume. Thus, it is highly recommended that testing be adopted in combination with measures such as wearing masks and social distancing to better manage infectious diseases. Our research contributes to understanding the role of testing in epidemic control and provides useful suggestions for the government and individuals in responding to epidemics.","Cui, Yapeng; Ni, Shunjiang; Shen, Shifei",BMC Infect Dis,481,29

A retrospective mixed methods evaluation of the COVID-19 community monitoring service using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework.

Among the 850 patients, 305 (36%) were classified as having a high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. The most prevalent risk factors were cardiovascular disease (37%), lung disease (30%) and age over 60 years (26%). The most common reported ongoing symptoms were fatigue (55%), breathing issues (26%) and mental health issues such as low mood (19%). There were no deaths in patients that participated in the service. The process of risk stratification undertaken with telephone triage was effective in determining risk of prolonged illness from COVID-19. Telephone monitoring by trained health professionals has a strong potential in the effective management of patients with a mild COVID-19 illness.","Clarke, A C; Hull, S; Semciw, A I; Jessup, R L; Campbell, D; Fabri, A M; Tully, N; Bramston, C; Hayes, J",J. community health,481,15

Local water droplet motion has attracted considerable interest and has expanded into various application areas because of its close relationship with processes associated with life. However, few approaches have been capable of independently manipulating local droplet motion without loss on a substrate due to the difficulty in shaping and focusing the motion route. Here, we demonstrate a non-contact electrostatic-powered local water motion strategy. The gradient of electrostatic charges in space guides the local drop motion without liquid loss in a controlled motion path. The local droplet motion on surfaces with varied wettabilities is discussed and compared. A unipolar electrostatic field is theoretically simulated.

We modeled competing hypotheses regarding the underlying testing mechanisms, thereby providing different prevalence estimates based on case numbers, and used them to predict SARS-CoV-2-attributed death rate trajectories. Assuming that individuals were tested based solely on a predefined risk of being infectious implied the absolute case numbers reflected prevalence, but turned out to be a poor predictor. In contrast, models accounting for testing capacity, limiting the pool of tested individuals, performed better. This puts forward the percentage of positive tests as a robust indicator of epidemic dynamics in absence of country-specific information. We next demonstrated this strongly affects data interpretation. Notably absolute case numbers trajectories consistently overestimated growth rates at the beginning of two COVID-19 epidemic waves. Overall, this supports non-trivial testing mechanisms can be inferred from data and should be scrutinized.","Besserve, Michel; Buchholz, Simon; Scholkopf, Bernhard",,481,15

We report the physical activities and surgical outcomes in elderly patients who underwent ATAAD. METHODS: From 2009 to 2019, 103 consecutive patients underwent surgery for ATAAD at our institution. Surgical outcomes along with pre- and postoperative physical activities in 52 elderly patients (&#8805;70 years old) were compared with those in 51 younger patients (<70 years old). Postoperative walking difficulty was defined as taking &#8805;30 days to regain the ability to walk 200 m postoperatively or as the inability to walk at discharge. RESULTS: It took longer for elderly patients to regain the ability to walk 100 or 200 m postoperatively. ROC analysis revealed the AUC of the duration for walking 200 m postoperatively as a prognostic indicator for late deaths was 0.878, with the highest accuracy at 30 days (sensitivity = 83.3%, specificity = 91.8%). Hospital mortality within 30 days was 3.8%, and 1-, 3-, and 5-years survival rates were 92%, 84.7%, 84.7%, respectively, for elderly patients, with no significant differences between groups. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed postoperative walking difficulty was an independent risk factor for late mortality in all cohorts (p = .017).

Effective treatments are urgently needed. The enzymatic activity of the HECT-E3 ligase family members has been implicated in the cell egression phase of deadly RNA viruses such as Ebola through direct interaction of its VP40 Protein. Here we report that HECT-E3 ligase family members such as NEDD4 and WWP1 interact with and ubiquitylate the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Furthermore, we find that HECT family members are overexpressed in primary samples derived from COVID-19 infected patients and COVID-19 mouse models. Importantly, rare germline activating variants in the NEDD4 and WWP1 genes are associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Critically, I3C, a natural NEDD4 and WWP1 inhibitor from Brassicaceae, displays potent antiviral effects and inhibits viral egression. In conclusion, we identify the HECT family members of E3 ligases as likely novel biomarkers for COVID-19, as well as new potential targets of therapeutic strategy easily testable in clinical trials in view of the established well-tolerated nature of the Brassicaceae natural compounds.","Novelli, Giuseppe; Liu, Jing; Biancolella, Michela; Alonzi, Tonino; Novelli, Antonio; Patten, J J; Cocciadiferro, Dario; Agolini, Emanuele; Colona, Vito Luigi; Rizzacasa, Barbara; Giannini, Rosalinda; Bigio, Benedetta; Goletti, Delia; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Grelli, Sandro; Mann, Justin; McKee, Trevor D; Cheng, Ke; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Guarracino, Andrea; Pepe, Gerardo; Tomino, Carlo; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Uzunhan, Yurdagul; Tubiana, Sarah; Ghosn, Jade; Notarangelo, Luigi D; Su, Helen C; Abel, Laurent; Cobat, Aurélie; Elhanan, Gai; Grzymski, Joseph J; Latini, Andrea; Sidhu, Sachdev S; Jain, Suresh; Davey, Robert A; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Wei, Wenyi; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo",Cell Death Dis,481,24

DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Laboratory analyses were performed in the United Kingdom at Imperial College, London and university facilities in London. Research clinics for finger prick sampling were run in two affiliated NHS trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Sensitivity analyses were performed on sera stored from 320 previous participants in the React 2 programme with confirmed previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Specificity analyses were performed on 1000 prepandemic serum samples. 100 new participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attended study clinics for finger prick testing. INTERVENTIONS: Laboratory sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for seven LFIAs on a minimum of 200 serum samples from participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 500 prepandemic serum samples, respectively. Three LFIAs were found to have a laboratory sensitivity superior to the finger prick sensitivity of the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence studies (84%). These LFIAs were then further evaluated through finger prick testing on participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection: two LFIAs (Surescreen, Panbio) were evaluated in clinics in June-July 2020 and the third LFIA (AbC-19) in September 2020. A spike protein enzyme linked immunoassay and hybrid double antigen binding assay were used as laboratory reference standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of LFIAs in detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared with two reference standards. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of seven new LFIAs that were analysed using sera varied from 69% to 100%, and from 98.6% to 100%, respectively (compared with the two reference standards). Sensitivity on finger prick testing was 77% (95% confidence interval 61.4% to 88.2%) for Panbio, 86% (72.7% to 94.8%) for Surescreen, and 69% (53.8% to 81.3%) for AbC-19 compared with the reference standards. Sensitivity for sera from matched clinical samples performed on AbC-19 was significantly higher with serum than finger prick at 92% (80.0% to 97.7%, P=0.01). Antibody titres varied considerably among cohorts. The numbers of positive samples identified by finger prick in the lowest antibody titre quarter varied among LFIAs. CONCLUSIONS: One new LFIA was identified with clinical performance suitable for potential inclusion in seroprevalence studies. However, none of the LFIAs tested had clearly superior performance to the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence surveys, and none showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered for routine clinical use.","Moshe, Maya; Daunt, Anna; Flower, Barnaby; Simmons, Bryony; Brown, Jonathan C; Frise, Rebecca; Penn, Rebecca; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Petersen, Claire; Stockmann, Helen; Ashby, Deborah; Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina; Taylor, Graham P; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Naar, Lenny; Klaber, Robert; Badhan, Anjna; Rosadas, Carolina; Marchesin, Federica; Fernandez, Natalia; Sureda-Vives, Macià; Cheeseman, Hannah; O039,; Hara, Jessica; Shattock, Robin; Fontana, Gianluca; Pallett, Scott J C; Rayment, Michael; Jones, Rachael; Moore, Luke S P; Ashrafian, Hutan; Cherapanov, Peter; Tedder, Richard; McClure, Myra; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul; Cooke, Graham S; Barclay, Wendy S",BMJ,481,16

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of COVID-19-related critical illness, including trends in outcomes and care delivery. DESIGN: Single-health system, multihospital retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 5 hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. PATIENTS: Adults with COVID-19-related critical illness who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure or shock during the initial surge of the pandemic. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure for outcomes and care delivery trend analyses was longitudinal time during the pandemic. The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death at any time, receipt of mechanical ventilation (MV), and readmissions. RESULTS: Among 468 patients with COVID-19-related critical illness, 319 (68.2%) were treated with MV and 121 (25.9%) with vasopressors. Outcomes were notable for an all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality rate of 29.9%, a median ICU stay of 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 17 days), a median hospital stay of 13 days (IQR, 7 to 25 days), and an all-cause 30-day readmission rate (among nonhospice survivors) of 10.8%. Mortality decreased over time, from 43.5% (95% CI, 31.3% to 53.8%) to 19.2% (CI, 11.6% to 26.7%) between the first and last 15-day periods in the core adjusted model, whereas patient acuity and other factors did not change. LIMITATIONS: Single-health system study; use of, or highly dynamic trends in, other clinical interventions were not evaluated, nor were complications. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19-related critical illness admitted to ICUs of a learning health system in the United States, mortality seemed to decrease over time despite stable patient characteristics. Further studies are necessary to confirm this result and to investigate causal mechanisms.

By integrating the stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence of a new long timescale governing the epidemic in broad agreement with empirical data. Our model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The existence of the long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to the endemic state.","Tkachenko, Alexei V.; Maslov, Sergei; Wang, Tong; Elbanna, Ahmed; Wong, George N.; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,481,16

Social distancing and stay-at-home orders leave businesses and cities wondering how future economic activity moves forward. The reduction in face-to-face interactions creates an impetus to understand how social interactivity influences economic efficiency and rates of innovation. Here, we create a measure of the degree to which a workforce engages in social interactions, analyzing its relationships to economic innovation and efficiency. We do this by decomposing U.S. occupations into individual work activities, determining which of those activities are associated with face-to-face interactions. We then re-aggregate the labor forces of U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) into a metric of urban social interactiveness. Using a novel measure of urbanized area, we then calculate each MSA’s density of social work activities. We find that our metric of urban socialness is positively correlated with a city’s per worker patent production. Furthermore, we use our set of social work activities to reaggregate the workforces of U.S. industries into a metric of industry social interactivness, finding that this measure scales superlinearly with an industry’s per worker GDP. Together, the results suggest that social interaction among workers is an important driver of both a city’s rate of invention and an industry’s economic efficiency. Finally, we briefly highlight analogies between cities and stars and discuss their potential to guide further research, vis-à-vis the density of social interactions “igniting” a city or industry.","Painter, Deryc T.; Shutters, Shade T.; Wentz, Elizabeth",Urban Science,481,22

We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England. National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models. FINDINGS: Weekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017-19 by 672 (50·9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16â071 (64·3%) in people with type 2 diabetes. Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264â390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2â874â020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36â291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes. Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10â525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3%) and 5833 (55·4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min per 1·73 m2). Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (6·5-7·0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10·0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95% CI 1·50-3·30, p<0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47-1·77, p<0·0001] in type 2 diabetes). In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7·6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95% CI 1·15-1·30, p<0·0001] for 59-74 mmol/mol [7·6-8·9%] and 1·36 [1·24-1·50, p<0·0001] for 75-85 mmol/mol [9·0-9·9%]). The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25·0-29·9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20·0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2·45 (95% CI 1·60-3·75, p<0·0001) and a BMI of 40·0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2·33 (1·53-3·56, p<0·0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2·33 (2·11-2·56, p<0·0001) and 1·60 (1·47-1·75, p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England. Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.

This systematic review aimed to assess the extent of adoption, efficacy, and safety of NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the literature. Electronic databases and Google Scholar were queried for studies that applied NOM of acute appendicitis during COVID-19. The main outcome measures were the rates of NOM application during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, failure and complication rates of NOM. Failure was defined as the need for appendectomy during NOM and complications included development of appendicular mass or abscess. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (2140 patients) were included. The male to female ratio was 1.44:1 and median age was 34. Nine hundred fifty-nine (44.8%) patients had a trial of NOM. The weighted mean rate of NOM application was 50.1% (95%CI: 29.8-70.5%). The application of NOM during the pandemic was significantly more likely than its application before COVID-19 (OR = 6.7, p < 0.001). The weight mean failure rate of NOM was 16.4% (95%CI: 9.4-23.4). NOM failure was more likely in children and patients with complicated appendicitis. The weighted mean complication rate after NOM was 4.5% (95%CI: 1.4-7.7). NOM had significantly lower odds for complications than appendectomy (OR = 0.36, p = 0.03). There was no mortality after application of NOM. CONCLUSION: NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19 may be a safe, short-term alternative to surgery with acceptably low failure and complication rates.","Emile, Sameh Hany; Hamid, Hytham K S; Khan, Sualeh Muslim; Davis, George N",J Gastrointest Surg,481,20

Besides that, we demonstrate the relative simplicity of the task by attaining surprisingly strong results with training sets of size 10 and 20: in terms of Dice score, $97.0\pm 0.8\%$ and $97.3\pm 0.5$, respectively, while in terms of IoU score, $92.2\pm 1.2\%$ and $93.3\pm 0.4\%$, respectively. To achieve these scores, we capitalize on the mixup augmentation technique, which yields a remarkable gain above $4\%$ IoU score in the size 10 setup.","Maga, Bal'azs",,481,16

In the absence of an available licensed vaccine and antiviral agent, therapeutic human antibodies have been suggested as candidates for treatment. In this study, human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by sorting B cells from patient's PBMC cells with prefusion stabilized spike (S) probes and a direct immunoglobulin cloning strategy. We identified six receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific and five S1 (non-RBD)-specific antibodies, among which, only the RBD-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing potency (IC50 0.006-1.787 µg/ml) as well as high affinity to RBD. Notably, passive immunization using a highly potent antibody (KNIH90-F1) at a relatively low dose (2 mg/kg) completely protected transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 against MERS-CoV lethal challenge. These results suggested that human monoclonal antibodies isolated by using the rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV S probe could be considered potential candidates for the development of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antiviral agents for MERS-CoV human infection.","Choi, Jang-Hoon; Woo, Hye-Min; Lee, Tae-Young; Lee, So-Young; Shim, Sang-Mu; Park, Woo-Jung; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Kim, Joo Ae; Yun, Mi-Ran; Kim, Dae-Won; Kim, Sung Soon; Zhang, Yi; Shi, Wei; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney S; Mascola, John R; Wang, Nanshuang; McLellan, Jason S; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Lee, Hansaem",PLoS One,481,1

Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","Li, Junjiang; Giabbanelli, Philippe",JMIR Med Inform,481,16

This study conducts a multi-scale (national-regional-city), multi-species, and multi-platform analysis of air pollutants and meteorological data by synergizing surface and satellite observations. Our analysis suggests a significant reduction in surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (46-61%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (42-60%) during the lockdown period that are also corroborated by the reduction in satellite observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) (3-56%) and tropospheric NO2 column density (25-50%) data over multiple cities. Other species, namely coarse particulate matter (PM10) (24-62%), ozone (22-56%) also showed a substantial reduction whereas carbon monoxide (16-46%), exhibited a moderate decline. In contrast, sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels did not show any defined reduction trend but rather increased in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata. The temporary air quality improvement achieved by the painful natural experiment of this pandemic has helped demonstrate the importance of reducing emissions from other sectors along with transportation and industry to achieve the national air quality targets in the future.","Sathe, Yogesh; Gupta, Pawan; Bawase, Moqtik; Lamsal, Lok; Patadia, Falguni; Thipse, Sukrut",Sustain Cities Soc,481,1

Visual examination of the world map shows a wide variation of death tolls between countries. The main goal of our series is to determine the best predictors of such discrepancy. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic. Results: BMI per country proved to be the second best predictor of death rate with an R value of 0.43, and GDP being the best predictor with R = 0.65. Conclusion: This article shows a tight correlation between average BMI, food supply per country, and COVID-19-related deaths. Such predisposing factors might operate by upregulating the inflammation pathway in heavily struck countries, leading to easier triggering of the infamous cytokine storm syndrome.

This global pandemic has mandated dramatic changes in healthcare delivery with a particular focus on social distancing in order to reduce viral transmission. Heart failure patients are among the highest utilizers of health care and are at increased risk for COVID-related vulnerabilities. Effectively managing this complex and resource-intensive patient population from a distance presents new and unique challenges. Here, we review relevant data on telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies for heart failure patients and provide a framework to help providers treat this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes (i) dedicated pre-visit contact and planning (i.e. confirm clinical appropriateness, presence of compatible technology, and patient comfort); (ii) utilization of virtual clinic visits (use of telehealth platforms, a video-assisted exam, self-reported vital signs, and weights); and (iii) use of existing remote heart failure monitoring sensors when applicable (CardioMEMS, Optivol, and HeartLogic). While telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies are not new, these technologies are emerging as an important tool for the effective management of heart failure patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, these strategies appear to be safe; however, additional data will be needed to determine their effectiveness with respect to both process and outcomes measures.","Oseran, Andrew S; Afari, Maxwell E; Barrett, Conor D; Lewis, Gregory D; Thomas, Sunu S",ESC Heart Fail,481,16

We evaluate convalescent immune responses in four infants under 3 months old with confirmed COVID-19 who presented with mild febrile illness, alongside their parents, and adult controls recovered from confirmed COVID-19. Although not statistically significant, compared to seropositive adults, infants have high serum levels of IgG and IgA to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with corresponding functional ability to block SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Infants also exhibit robust saliva anti-spike IgG and IgA responses. Spike-specific IFN-Î³ production by infant peripheral blood mononuclear cells appears restrained, but the frequency of spike-specific IFN-Î³ and/or TNF-É producing T cells is comparable between infants and adults. On principal component analysis, infant immune responses appear distinct from their parents. Robust functional antibody responses alongside restrained IFN-Î³ production may help protect infants from severe COVID-19.","Goenka, Anu; Halliday, Alice; Gregorova, Michaela; Milodowski, Emily; Thomas, Amy; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Baum, Holly; Oliver, Elizabeth; Long, Anna E; Knezevic, Lea; Williams, Alistair Jk; Lampasona, Vito; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Gupta, Kapil; Di Bartolo, Natalie; Berger, Imre; Toye, Ashley M; Vipond, Barry; Muir, Peter; Bernatoniene, Jolanta; Bailey, Mick; Gillespie, Kathleen M; Davidson, Andrew D; Wooldridge, Linda; Rivino, Laura; Finn, Adam",Cell Rep Med,481,20

This is frequently difficult to realize due to restricted spatial capacities. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possibility of enabling patients to spend the waiting period outside of the waiting room of the ENT outpatient department, in order to reduce the number of patients in the waiting rooms and therefore observe distancing rules. This was realized by the use of a pager system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the timeframe of 12.5 weeks (04.06.2020-31.08.2020), ENT outpatients were issued with pagers. The patients could thus move freely within the hospital and grounds. The pager system was activated 10-15â¯min before the appointment, to call patients back to the outpatient ENT clinic. questionnaires were used to evaluate the system and examine patients' acceptance and satisfaction. RESULTS: The 137 questionnaires analyzed showed satisfaction with the system, not only regarding distancing rules but also with the more comfortable waiting time. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a pager system for patients could help to meet hygiene and distance rules, and also increase comfort during (often unavoidable) waiting times for patients in the university hospital ENT outpatient department. The long-term use of such a system seems promising.","Vielsmeier, V; Brosig, A; Hauser, A; Bohr, C",HNO,481,21

Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic risk factors may also vary by age. This study aimed to determine the association between common patient characteristics and mortality across age-groups among COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database between April - June 2020. Inpatients were identified using COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. A priori-defined exposures were sex and present-on-admission hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and interactions between age and these comorbidities. Controlling for additional confounders, we evaluated relationships between these variables and in-hospital mortality in a log-binomial model. RESULTS: Among 66,646 (6.5%) admissions with a COVID-19 diagnosis, across 613 U.S. hospitals, 12,388 (18.6%) died in-hospital. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with 30% higher mortality risk (aRR, 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26 - 1.34). Diabetes without chronic complications was not a risk factor at any age (aRR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.06), and hypertension without chronic complications was only a risk factor in 20-39 year-olds (aRR, 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17 - 2.40). Diabetes with chronic complications, hypertension with chronic complications, and obesity were risk factors in most age-groups, with highest relative risks among 20-39 year-olds (respective aRRs 1.79, 2.33, 1.92; p-values &#8804; 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized men with COVID-19 are at increased risk of death across all ages. Hypertension, diabetes with chronic complications, and obesity demonstrated age-dependent effects, with the highest relative risks among adults aged 20-39.","Goodman, Katherine E; Magder, Laurence S; Baghdadi, Jonathan D; Pineles, Lisa; Levine, Andrea R; Perencevich, Eli N; Harris, Anthony D",Clin. infect. dis,481,1

People with intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown and increased the use of psychotropic medication. People with ID are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 have on people with ID.

This potentially isolates / quarantines many staff without SARS-CoV-2, whilst not preventing transmission from staff with asymptomatic infection. We explored the impact of testing staff on absence durations from work and transmission risks to others. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic model for 1,000 key workers to compare the baseline strategy of (S0) no RT-PCR testing of workers to testing workers (S1) with COVID-19-like symptoms in isolation, (S2) without COVID-19-like symptoms but in household-quarantine, and (S3) all staff. We explored confirmatory re-testing scenarios of repeating all initial tests, initially-positive tests, initially-negative tests; or no re-testing. We varied all parameters, including the infection rate (0.1%-20%), proportion asymptomatic (10%-80%), sensitivity (60%-95%), and specificity (90%-100%). RESULTS: Testing all staff (S3) changes the risk of workplace transmission by -56.9 to +1.0 workers per 1,000 tests (with reductions throughout at RT-PCR sensitivity of &#8805;65%), and absences by 0.5 to +3.6 days per test but at heightened testing needs of 989.6-1995.9 tests per 1,000 workers. Testing workers in household-quarantine (S2) reduces absences the most by 3.0-6.9 days per test (at 47.0-210.4 tests per 1,000 workers), while increasing risk of workplace transmission by 0.02-49.5 infected workers per 1,000 tests (which can be minimised when re-testing initially-negative tests). DISCUSSION: Based on optimising absence durations or transmission risk our modelling suggests testing staff in household-quarantine or all staff, depending on infection levels and testing capacities.","Sandmann, Frank G; White, Peter J; Ramsay, Mary; Jit, Mark",Clin. infect. dis,481,10

This article examines the coping mechanisms adopted by fertility patients during this time, focussing on the emotional support received from online fertility forums and fertility clinics during the indeterminate wait for treatment to resume. The study draws upon an online survey which assessed the mental health and wellbeing of 124 female fertility patients whose ART treatment was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The findings indicate a potential for improved communication between fertility clinics and patients in order to reduce psychological stress and isolation during the postponement of ART treatment, alongside better utilisation of online platforms as mechanisms for support. This article adds to the growing body of knowledge concerned with the implications of denying reproductive rights to the infertility community during a global pandemic.

Chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been investigated mostly in China, and there is very little information available on the radiological findings occurring in other populations. In this study, we aimed to describe the characteristics of chest CT findings in confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Iranian population, based on a time classification. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%), and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multifocal GGO, and mixed GGO with consolidation were the most common patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in our study. However, these patterns might change according to the time interval from symptoms.","Jafari, Sirous; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Eshraghi, Sahereh; Araghi, Farnaz; Aryannejad, Armin; Mohammadnejad, Esmaeil; Rasoolinejad, Mehrnaz; Hajiabdolbaghi, Mahboubeh; Koochak, Hamid Emadi; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Abbasian, Ladan; Manshadi, Seyed Ali Dehghan; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Khalili, Hossein; Yazdi, Niloofar Ayoobi; Seifi, Arash",Rom. j. intern. med,481,15

Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.","Castanon, Alejandra; Rebolj, Matejka; Burger, Emily Annika; de Kok, Inge M C M; Smith, Megan A; Hanley, Sharon J B; Carozzi, Francesca Maria; Peacock, Stuart; O039,; Mahony, James F",Lancet Public Health,481,24

Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L). The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.","Saba, Luca; Sverzellati, Nicola",J Thorac Imaging,481,24

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is critical to combat COVID-19, especially at the early stage of pandemic outbreak. This study aimed to measure level of healthcare workers' (HCW') self-reported IPC behaviors with the risk of COVID-19 emerges and increases. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals. A structured self-administered questionnaire was delivered to HCWs in selected hospitals. The dependent variables were self-reported IPC behavior compliance; and independent variables were outbreak risk and three intent of infection risk (risk of contact with suspected patients, high-risk department, risk of affected area). Chi-square tests and multivariable negative binomial regression models were employed. RESULTS: A total of 1386 participants were surveyed. The risk of outbreak increased self-reported IPC behavior on each item (coefficient varied from 0.029 to 0.151). Considering different extent of risk, HCWs from high-risk department had better self-reported practice in most IPC behavior (coefficient ranged from 0.027 to 0.149). HCWs in risk-affected area had higher self-reported compliance in several IPC behavior (coefficient ranged from 0.028 to 0.113). However, HCWs contacting with suspected patients had lower self-reported compliance in several IPC behavior (coefficient varied from - 0.159 to - 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: With the risk of COVID-19 emerges, HCWs improve IPC behaviors comprehensively, which benefits for better combat COVID-19. With the risk (high-risk department and affected area) further increases, majority of IPC behaviors achieved improvement. Nevertheless, under the risk of contact with suspected patients, HCWs show worse IPC behaviors. Which may result from higher work load and insufficient supplies and resources among these HCWs.

In patients with ischaemic heart disease and heart failure, thrombi of the left ventricle can increase patient mortality, mainly due to the risk of systemic embolization. Given the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19, such events may be more likely. We describe a patient hospitalized for congestive heart failure and SARS-CoV-2 infection who was diagnosed with a thrombus in the left ventricle. After the thrombus was identified on echocardiography and treated with anticoagulation, it completely resolved and cardiac function improved. LEARNING POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been frequently associated with thromboembolic phenomena and intracardiac thrombi.Echocardiographic evaluation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is important, especially in cases with known or new-onset cardiac pathology which predisposes to thromboembolic phenomena. The timely diagnosis and treatment of intracardiac thrombi can prevent complications and improve patient prognosis.","Ramalho, C.; Almeida, M.; Gomes, F.; Silva, M.; Rodrigues, S.",European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine,481,16

Correctional and detention facilities are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks. We aimed to evaluate cohort-based testing among detained persons exposed to laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in order to identify presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. METHODS: During May 1-19, 2020, two testing strategies were implemented in 12 tiers or housing units of the Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois. Detained persons were approached to participate in serial testing (n=137) tests at 3 time points over 14 days (day 1, day 3-5, and day 13-14). The second group was offered a single test and interview at the end of a 14-day quarantine period (day 14 group) (n=87). RESULTS: A total of 224 detained persons were approached for participation and of these 194 (87%) participated in at least one interview, and 172 (77%) had at least one test. Of the 172 tested, 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the serial testing group, 17 (89%) new cases were detected, sixteen (84%) on day 1, one (5%) on days 3-5, and none on days 13-14; and, in day 14 group, two (11%) cases were identified. More than half (12/19; 63%) of the newly identified cases were pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the utility of cohort-based testing promptly after initiating quarantine within a housing tier. Cohort-based testing efforts identified new SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections that may have been missed by symptom screening alone.","Wadhwa, Ashutosh; Fisher, Kiva A; Silver, Rachel; Koh, Mitsuki; Arons, Melissa M; Miller, David A; McIntyre, Anne F; Vuong, Jeni T; Kim, Kaylee; Takamiya, Mayuko; Binder, Alison M; Tate, Jacqueline E; Armstrong, Paige A; Black, Stephanie R; Mennella, Connie C; Levin, Rebecca; Gubser, Jane; Jones, Bridgette; Welbel, Sharon F; Moonan, Patrick K; Curran, Kathryn; Ghinai, Isaac; Doshi, Reena; Zawitz, Chad J",Clin. infect. dis,481,15

Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","Asai, Yuka; Nguyen, Paul; Hanna, Timothy P",PLoS One,481,16

They do not want the end of their being, but it comes, paradoxically, even closer because of irresponsibility. Marcus Aurelius, who lived during an epidemic, writes about how to deal with the fear of death. We present modern Stoicism and respect for Aurelius' philosophy in today's times, and suggest-although we also put forward some counter-arguments against the suggestion-that a person in crisis can benefit from the Stoic doctrine and with it seek to overcome the fear of death or, in a figurative sense, the fear of crisis, as well as become more prudent and responsible instead of following their own metaphysical-ethical laws, which may also be harmful to themselves. According to Stoicism, overcoming the fear of death is a person's moral responsibility as otherwise their ethicality can be lost in the time of a crisis of humanity.","Vrecko, Z.

This was reinforced through tensions between the heavily centralized healthcare delivery and a partially decentralized public health system. Using the pillars of pandemic response proposed by the World Health Organisation, this article explores the planning assumptions, resource estimations and strategies adopted to equip the health system with resources for the pandemic response. The resource need estimates based on projections for COVID-19 identified a shortfall of medical professionals to care for patients while maintaining 55% of the workforce for regular healthcare across the atolls. The findings show that while the policy of lockdown bought time to increase hospital beds and devices, the country was unable to increase the healthcare workforce. Furthermore, as the lockdown eased, the exponential increase of cases took Maldives to the global one per capita incidence. Despite this, with cautious planning and use of resources, the country has so far managed to maintain low mortality from COVID-19. The lessons from this experience are paramount in future pandemic response planning, not only for Maldives, but other small island LMICs.","Usman, Sofoora Kawsar; Moosa, Sheena; Abdullah, Aminath Shaina",Int J Health Plann Manage,481,32

Despite considerable attention dedicated to COVID-19, the link between metabolic syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome-related serum biomarkers measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to test biomarker levels and biomarker-associated genetic variants with SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and negative controls, a 10 mg/dl increase in serum HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 levels was associated with â¼10% reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of known genetic variants for HDL-cholesterol revealed that individuals homozygous for apolipoprotein E4 alleles had â¼2- to 3-fold higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality from COVID-19 compared with apolipoprotein E3 homozygotes, even after adjustment for HDL-cholesterol levels. However, cumulative effects of all evaluated HDL-cholesterol-raising alleles and Mendelian randomization analyses did not reveal association of genetically higher HDL-cholesterol levels with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results implicate serum HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels measured prior to SAR-CoV-2 exposure as clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection but do not provide evidence that genetically elevated HDL-cholesterol levels are associated with SAR-CoV-2 infection.","Hilser, James R; Han, Yi; Biswas, Subarna; Gukasyan, Janet; Cai, Zhiheng; Zhu, Ruowei; Tang, W H Wilson; Deb, Arjun; Lusis, Aldons J; Hartiala, Jaana A; Allayee, Hooman",J Lipid Res,481,31

Nurses adapted to the work using personal protective equipment, but its initial scarcity contributed to stressful working conditions. Nurses in the United States can take several lessons from the experiences of their Chinese nurse colleagues, including the benefit of centralized management of the epidemic, the need for specialized treatment facilities, and the importance of a national stockpile of critical equipment and supplies. A fully funded United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Pandemics and Emerging Threats is necessary. A nursing department within the office and a national mobilization plan to send nurses to support local efforts during a pandemic or other threat are likewise essential.

The understanding of genomics, structural biology, and innate/adaptive immunity have expanded the toolkits available for current vaccine development. However, sudden outbreaks and the requirement of population-level immunization still pose great challenges in today's vaccine designs. Well-established vaccine development protocols from previous experiences are in place to guide the pipelines of vaccine development for emerging viral diseases. Nevertheless, vaccine development may follow different paradigms during a pandemic. For example, multiple vaccine candidates must be pushed into clinical trials simultaneously, and manufacturing capability must be scaled up in early stages. Factors from essential features of safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and distributions to administration approaches are taken into consideration based on advances in materials science and engineering technologies. In this review, we present recent advances in vaccine development by focusing on vaccine discovery, formulation, and delivery devices enabled by alternative administration approaches.

The present study reviewed all studies with imaging findings presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search in online databases, including Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane library, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies (68 cases), including 60 (88.2%) females and eight (11.8%) males with a presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination, were reviewed. LAP was identified after first or second dosages of three types of COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech (nâ¯=â¯30, 44.1%), Moderna (nâ¯=â¯17, 25%), and Oxford-AstraZeneca (nâ¯=â¯1, 1.5%). In 20 (29.4%) cases, vaccine type was not reported or only reported as mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The median days of LAP presentation after the first and second dosages of COVID-19 vaccination, were 12 and 5 days, respectively. Most of the LAP imaging findings related to COVID-19 vaccination (nâ¯=â¯66, 97%) were seen from first day to 4 weeks after vaccination. However, LAP remained after 5 and 6 weeks of the first and second dosages of COVID-19 vaccination with decreased lymph nodes' size and residual cortical thickening in two cases. CONCLUSION: This review study of cases with LAP-associated COVID-19 vaccination guides radiologists and physicians to rely on patient's clinical context and updated resources to prevent potential disease upstaging and change in therapy.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Rafiee, Faranak; Mizandari, Malkhaz",Acad. radiol,481,1

Although RNTD and some of its transformation products (TPs) have been studied under chlorination and photo-irradiation, the relationship between RNTD TPs and NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) remaining after those processes is still unclear. This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP. The results showed that NDMA-FP remained due to the presence of RNTD TPs, although RNTD itself was significantly removed by chlorination and/or photo-irradiation. TP-364 was only formed by chlorination of RNTD and could not be removed by photo-irradiation. TP-314 (a stereoisomer of RNTD), -299, and -286, which were mainly formed by photo-irradiation of RNTD but not by photo-irradiation after chlorination, had strong positive correlations with NDMA-FP (R2 > 0.90; F-test, P < 0.01).","Zhao, Bo; Zhou, Jiajun; Nakada, Norihide",Chemosphere,481,21

In order to study the cause of myocardial pathology in COVID-19 patients, we used a hamster model to determine whether following infection SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can be detected in heart tissues. Here, we clearly demonstrate that viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is present in cardiomyocytes in the hearts of infected hamsters. Interestingly, functional cardiomyocyte associated gene expression was decreased in infected hamster hearts, corresponding to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). This data using an animal model was further validated using autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that CCL2 is secreted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters. Using single cell RNA-seq, we also show that macrophages are able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection of CMs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects CMs in vivo and proposes a mechanism of immune-cell infiltration and pathology in heart tissue of COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Shuibing; Yang, Liuliu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin; Han, Yuling; Jaffré, Fabrice; Zhu, Jiajun; Wang, Pengfei; Zhang, Tuo; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Møller, Rasmus; Hoagland, Daisy; Horiuchi, Shu; Acklin, Joshua; Lim, Jean; Bram, Yaron; Richardson, Chanel; Chandar, Vasuretha; Borczuk, Alain; Huang, Yaoxing; Xiang, Jenny; Ho, David; Schwartz, Robert; tenOever, Benjamin; Evans, Todd",,481,1

The hybrid film exhibits excellent light transmittance, high electrical conductivity, ultra-flexibility, and strong adhesion. These outstanding performances benefit from the filling and adhesion of hydrophilic TCNT layers to the AgNW networks. Besides, we introduced the post-treatment process of mechanical pressing and covering polymer conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, which obtained three layers of TCNT/AgNW/PEDOT hybrid film and greatly improved the comprehensive properties. The hybrid film can reach a sheet resistance of 9.2 &#937;/sq with a transmittance of 83.4% at 550 nm wavelength, and a low root mean square (RMS) roughness (approximately 3.8 nm). After 10000 bends and tape testing, the conductivity and transmittance of the hybrid film remain stable. The resistance of the film has no significant degradation after 14 days of exposure to high temperature of 85 °C and humidity of 85%, indicating excellent stability.

The literature already provides some interesting exploratory studies on the community's response to the applications by analyzing information from different sources, such as news and users' reviews of the applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution that automatically analyzes users' reviews and extracts the evoked sentiments. In this work, we propose a pipeline starting from manual annotation via a crowd-sourcing study and concluding on the development and training of AI models for automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews.

These five dimensions are then used to interpret the results of the quantitative survey. In particular, we direct our attention to potential ritualized properties of new instrumental behavior such as hand sanitation;to changes in both collective and private rituals as well as to the new virtual rituals;and, in particular, on how virtual community singing has flourished as a ritual of social cohesion.

Flow cytometry was introduced to evaluate cell apoptosis. The protein levels of C-caspase 3 were determined by western blot. The starBase was used to predict the interaction between miR-195-5p and AFAP1-AS1. Xenograft tumor model was established to investigate the biological role of AFAP1-AS1 in PTX resistance in vivo. The levels of AFAP1-AS1 and FKBP1A were upregulated in PCa tissues and cells, as well as PTX-resistant PCa cells, while the expression of miR-195-5p was declined. Knockdown of AFAP1-AS1 promoted the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, induced apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells, whereas the impacts could be reversed by reducing the expression of miR-195-5p. FKBP1A overexpression could rescue the effects of miR-195-5p-mediated enhancement on the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, promotion on apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells. AFAP1-AS1 interacted with miR-195-5p and miR-195-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of FKBP1A. AFAP1-AS1 silencing inhibited the tumor growth in mice implanted with PC3-TXR cell.

Non-COVID-19 ED visits and hospitalizations showed a stable trend until the first Italian case of COVID-19 has been recorded, on February 19th, 2020, when they dropped simultaneously. The reduction of ED visits was observed in all age groups and across all severity and diagnosis groups. In the lockdown period a significant increase was found in overall out-of-hospital mortality (43.2%) and cause-specific out-of-hospital mortality related to neoplasms (76.7%), endocrine, nutritional and metabolic (79.5%) as well as cardiovascular (32.7%) diseases. The pandemic caused a sudden drop of ED visits and hospitalizations of non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown period, and a concurrent increase in out-of-hospital mortality mainly driven by deaths for neoplasms, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases.

Successful inhibition of the TMPRSS2 can be one of the crucial strategies to stop the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, a set of bioactive molecules from Morus alba Linn. were screened against the TMPRSS2 through two widely used molecular docking engines such as Autodock vina and Glide. Molecules having a higher binding affinity toward the TMPRSS2 compared to Camostat and Ambroxol were considered for in-silico pharmacokinetic analyses. Based on acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness, finally, five molecules were found to be important for the TMPRSS2 inhibition. A number of bonding interactions in terms of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions were observed between the proposed molecules and ligand-interacting amino acids of the TMPRSS2. The dynamic behavior and stability of best-docked complex between TRMPRSS2 and proposed molecules were assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several parameters from MD simulation have suggested the stability between the protein and ligands. Binding free energy of each molecule calculated through MM-GBSA approach from the MD simulation trajectory suggested strong affection toward the TMPRSS2. Hence, proposed molecules might be crucial chemical components for the TMPRSS2 inhibition.","Shakya, Anshul; Chikhale, Rupesh V; Bhat, Hans Raj; Alasmary, Fatmah Ali; Almutairi, Tahani Mazyad; Ghosh, Surajit Kumar; Alhajri, Hassna Mohammed; Alissa, Siham A; Nagar, Shuchi; Islam, Md Ataul",Mol. divers,481,30

Lessons for Post-COVID-19 Revival,15.808902,3.260909,2020,"We perform interface-resolved simulations of finite-size evaporating droplets in weakly-compressible homogeneous shear turbulence (HST). The study is conducted by varying three dimensionless physical parameters: the initial gas temperature over the critical temperature $T_{g,0}/T_c$, the initial droplet diameter over the Kolmogorov scale $d_0/\eta$ and the surface tension, i.e. the shear-based Weber number, $We_{\mathcal{S}}$. For the smallest $We_{\mathcal{S}}$, we first discuss the impact on the evaporation rate of the three thermodynamic models employed to evaluate the gas thermophysical properties: a constant property model and two variable-properties approaches where either the gas density or all the gas properties are allowed to vary. Taking this last approach as reference, the model assuming constant gas properties and evaluated with the""1/3""rule, is shown to predict the evaporation rate better than the model where the only variable property is the gas density. Moreover, we observe that the well-known Fr\""ossling/Ranz-Marshall correlation underpredicts the Sherwood number at low temperatures, $T_{g,0}/T_c=0.75$. Next, we show that the ratio between the actual evaporation rate in turbulence and the one computed in stagnant condition is always much higher than one for weakly deformable droplets: it decreases with $T_{g,0}/T_c$ without approaching unity at the highest $T_{g,0}/T_c$ considered. This suggests an evaporation enhancement due to turbulence also in conditions typical of combustion applications. Finally, we examine the overall evaporation rate and the local interfacial mass-flux at higher $We_{\mathcal{S}}$, showing a positive correlation between evaporation rate and interfacial curvature, especially at the lowest $T_{g,0}/T_c$.","Scapin, Nicolo; Barba, Federico Dalla; Lupo, Giandomenico; Rosti, Marco Edorardo; Duwig, Christophe; Brandt, Luca",,481,24

Yet the TPJ is also recruited in processes with no affective or social component, such as visuo-spatial processing and mathematical cognition. We present serendipitous findings from a perceptual decision-making task on a bistable stimulus, the Necker Cube, performed in an MRI scanner. The Necker cube is a transparent, wire-frame cube that evokes spontaneous switches in perception. Individuals can view the cube from below or from above, though a consistent bias is shown towards seeing the cube from above. We replicate this behavioral bias, finding participants spend more time in the from-above percept. However, in testing for BOLD differences between percept orientations, we find robust responses in bilateral TPJ for the from-above > from-below perceptual state. We speculate that this neural response comes from the sensory incongruence of viewing an object from above while lying supine in the scanner. We further speculate that the TPJ resolves this incongruence by facilitating an egocentric projection. Such a function would explain the TPJ's ubiquitous response to other-regarding, visuo-spatial and mathematical cognition, as all these phenomena demand an ability to ambulate through the coordinate space. Our findings suggest the TPJ may not play a specific role in social or moral components of other-regarding behavior such as altruism and further indirectly suggest that ""pure"", allocentric altruism may not correlate with the TPJ. Results further have implications on how the TPJ may be modulated by activities such as flight or drone operation.

Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study was performed between July 16, 2020 and August 31, 2020, in the retina clinic of a tertiary care eye hospital in south India. All patients undergoing elective retinal surgical procedures underwent RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 before being posted for surgery and after obtaining informed consent. Patients planned for surgery under general anesthesia underwent additional computed tomography of the chest. Testing strategies and outcomes were documented. Results: Out of a total of 413 patients who were given appointments for surgery during this period, nine patients (2.2%) were found to have positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and their surgeries were postponed. The test positivity (prevalence) rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection among all elective vitreoretinal surgical patients in our hospital was 2.2%. None of the patients were symptomatic for COVID-19. Conclusion: Our results showed that among patients visiting high volume ophthalmic centers in the near future, approximately 1 in 45 patients may be asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may lead to chances of transmission of the virus inside healthcare facilities among other visiting patients and healthcare workers.","Kannan, Naresh Babu; Sen, Sagnik; Reddy, Harshavardhan; Kumar, Karthik; Rajan, Renu P; Ramasamy, Kim",Indian J Ophthalmol,481,1

Culturally tailored interventions to increase access to and uptake of CRC stool-based tests are one effective strategy to increase benefits of screening among African Americans. The objectives of this study were to obtain feedback from African Americans on CRC educational materials being developed for a subsequent behavioral clinical trial and explore participants' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRC and CRC screening. Seven focus groups were conducted between February and November 2020. Participants were African Americans recruited through community contacts. Four focus groups were held in-person and three were conducted virtually due to Covid-19 restrictions. Participants ranked CRC educational text messages and provided feedback on a culturally tailored educational brochure. A focus group guide with scripted probes was used to elicit discussion and transcripts were analyzed using traditional content analysis. Forty-two African Americans participated. Four themes were identified from focus group discussions: (1) knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs on CRC and CRC screening; (2) reliable sources of cancer education information; (3) cultural factors affecting perspectives on health; and (4) community insights into cancer education. Participant input on the brochure was incorporated in content creation. Engaging African American community members to qualitatively examine cancer prevention has value in improving implementation strategy and planning for behavioral clinical trials.","Luque, John S; Vargas, Matthew; Wallace, Kristin; Matthew, Olayemi O; Tawk, Rima; Ali, Askal A; Kiros, Gebre-Egziabher; Harris, Cynthia M; Gwede, Clement K",J. cancer educ,481,16

This study was conducted in Malaysia in light of the 2020 outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from structural equation modeling indicate that uncertainty, and perceptions of scarcity are positively associated with anxiety but not with the panic purchasing behavior of consumers.

Cardiotocography is the best indicator for fetal surveillance during labour in low resource country. Objective To assess on admission cardiotocography and predict perinatal outcome of antenatal mothers admitted to labour room for delivery at Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method A prospective, observational study was conducted from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2017. Antenatal mothers were evaluated in admission cardiotocography for 20 minutes. Cardiotocography studies were interpreted and categorized according to the classification proposed by National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)- clinical guidelines 2007. Result Total 204 mothers were enrolled, the mean age is 24.06±4.331. Cardiotocography interpretation shows, 81.4% of Normal, 13.7% suspected and only 4.9% accounts pathological. Mother having CTG of pathological had more operative delivery 80% compare to normal and suspicious (0.0001). Similarly, more meconium stained liquor fall in pathological group with p value of 0.002. Fetal distress in labour is seen in all groups, showing 13.3% in normal, 32.1% in suspicious and 80% in pathological with p value 0.000. The duration of on admission cardiotocography to occurrence of fetal distress found to be mean hour of 9.57. Conclusion The admission cardiotocography test is useful to detect fetal distress which is already present at the time of test and can predict fetal wellbeing during the next few hours of labour. This test might lead to higher incidence of operative delivery at low resource countries because of lack of fetal blood sampling test to confirm fetal hypoxia during labour.","Shrestha, S; Shrestha, I",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),481,16

497114,497114,497114,Perspectives in the study of the political economy of COVID-19 vaccine regulation,15.852106,3.1513538,2021,"Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC;an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19. However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons. Plain Language Summary There is growing scientific interest in the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and its links to climate variables. This study aims to determine whether four environmental variables, namely temperature, humidity, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), and ultraviolet radiation (UV), are probable environmental determinants for the observed seasonal dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence, based on extensive country-level data spanning the first year of the pandemic. Although the influence of socio-economic factors may be dominant, we here suggest that ADC and UV are key environmental determinants of COVID-19 and can potentially affect the transmission and seasonality of the disease across a wide range of climates.

Yes 6-hourly temperature, dew point temperature and surface pressure data, and hourly UV fields are taken from the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al. 2018) at 0.25 by 0.25 horizontal resolution, for the period ranging from March 1st, 2020 to January 13th, 2021. With this data we calculate daily mean temperature, specific humidity, and ADC (see Section 2.2). Since population is not uniformly distributed within each country, we avoid simple country-averaged climate variables which do not correctly reflect the climate conditions to which the population is exposed. Instead, we calculate population-weighted average temperature, specific humidity, ADC, and UV across all grid cells contained in a given country, based on weights obtained from a gridded distribution of population density, following Carleton et al. (2021). Population density data is taken from the gridded population of the world (GPW) v4 dataset (CIESIN, 2018). Daily data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of tests, stringency index (i.e., a composite index of political measures) and population for each country are from the Our World in Data database (available at https://ourworldindata.org/). Subnational-level COVID-19 epidemiological data for the Australia, China, and Canada are available at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE;https://data.humdata.org/). Daily COVID-19 data at the scale of different states within the United States are provided at the COVID Tracking Project (available at https://covidtracking.com/). A threshold of at least 10,000 cumulative COVID-19 tests per 1 million people was retained to discard countries with unrepresentative data. This criterion can somewhat ensure the reliability of the data, although it still has severe limitations (see discussion). This approach yields 54 countries in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, and six tropical countries (Table 1), which are predominantly influenced by tropical monsoon systems with hot-humid summers. To isolate the role of environmental factors in modulating the spread and potential seasonality of COVID-19, five representative countries are carefully selected, which have different climate conditions and constant social controls (i.e., stringency index does not change significantly) over the analysis period (Fig. S1). The list of analyzed countries are provided in Table 1. To consider the incubation period of COVID-19 which is generally regarded as 4 to 7 days but can be as long as 10 days and uncommonly even longer, we mainly use biweekly average or biweekly cumulative values (Li et al., 2020). &lt;https://ourworldindata.org/&gt; &lt;https://data.humdata.org/&gt; &lt;https://covidtracking.com/&gt;","Choi, Yeon‐Woo Tuel Alexandre Eltahir Elfatih A.

manufacturer’s recalls” list because using these methanol-containing products may result in serious adverse health events (e g , blindness and death), and 3) NEVER swallow ABHSR and only use them for their intended purpose Clinicians should be highly suspicious of methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion, compatible signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed with the New Mexico Department of Health and the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center that serious adverse health events occurred in seven patients who had purportedly ingested ABHSR in June 2020 Significant blood methanol concentrations were detected in all patients;four died, one critically ill patient recovered with loss of vision, and outcomes are pending on the remaining two critically ill patients Two product samples were available for testing;preliminary results showed one product tested positive for methanol at the Scientific Laboratory Division, New Mexico Department of Health;the result on the second product is pending CDC also confirmed with the Arizona Department of Health Services that the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center reported an additional six patients who purportedly ingested ABHSR in June 2020 Significant blood methanol concentrations were detected in these critically ill patients;two patients have been discharged from the hospital, one has permanent blindness, and four outcomes are pending Hand hygiene is an important part of the response to the emergence of COVID-19 in the United States Practicing hand hygiene, which includes using ABHSR, is a simple and effective way to decrease the spread of pathogens and infections Commercially available ABHSR usually contain either ethanol or isopropanol However, some ABHSR that were manufactured in Mexico (https://www fda gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanolexternal icon) have been found to contain a significant amount of methanol Repeated use of these products on the skin may result in methanol poisoning However, the highest risk for methanol poisoning is by swallowing ABHSR products containing methanol Examples include young children who accidentally swallow these products and adolescents or adults who intentionally swallow these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute The clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e g , headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), but methanol poisoning may result in severe metabolic acidosis and blindness, and can be fatal if untreated Clinicians should be highly suspicious of methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion, compatible signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings (e g , elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis) Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e g , fomepizole), and hemodialysis Recommendations for Clinicians and Public Health Officials Clinicians should advise patients to immediately seek medical treatment if they have been exposed to methanol-containing alcohol-based hand sanitizers on the “FDA’s testing and manufacturer’s recalls” list (https://www fda gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitzers-methanolexternal icon) and are experiencing symptoms Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when a patient presents with a history of ABHSR ingestion or repeated use of these products on the skin Signs and symptoms include headache, blurred vision or blindness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, decreased level of consciousness, and laboratory findings such as anion gap metabolic acidosis Clinicians and public health practitioners should educate patients and the public to use alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs only for hand hygiene Clinicians and public health practitioners should educate patients and the public on the serious adverse health risks of ingesting alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs Clinicians and public health practitioners should educate patients and the public that some alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs may contain a significant amount of methanol and using these products may result in serious adverse health events (e g , blindness and death) Clinicians should contact the local poison center (1-800-222-1222) to report cases and to obtain specific medical management advice of methanol poisoning Recommendations for the Public Seek immediate medical attention if you have swallowed alcohol-based hand sanitizer or rub or are experiencing symptoms from repeated use of these products on your skin and contact your poison center (1-800-222-1222) for advice Signs and symptoms include headache, blurred vision or blindness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased alertness Do not swallow any alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs These chemicals are not intended for human consumption and can lead to serious health issues, including death Only use alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs for their intended purpose – to clean hands Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers or rubs out of reach of children and supervise their use Check your hand sanitizer products against the “FDA’s testing and

Alternatively, we question whether the use of LN2-vapor storage tanks for open-VTF systems alleviates potential airborne viral cross-contamination, while they most certainly create a greater risk for potential embryo wastage as discussed by Pomeroy et al (2010) and overtly realized by recent tank failure experiments and known catastrophic events Finally, it is worth noting that embryos vitrified in an insulated straw environment are more resistant to detrimental additive temperature fluxes that can occur under sub-optimal cryostorage handling procedures So, we ask, is it time to reconsider the status quo of embryo good tissue practices when viral pandemics are a reality?

Our analyses indicated a statistically significant association between the resolution of caregiver's transportation needs and children's clinical improvement in the 2019 (pre-pandemic) sample; there was no such association found in the 2020 (pandemic) sample.

The gold standard methods for evaluating the swallowing function have several problems, including the need for specialized equipment, the risk of radiation exposure and aspiration, and general physicians not possessing the requisite training to perform the examination. Hence, several simple and non-invasive techniques have been developed for evaluating swallowing function, such as those for measuring tongue pressure and tongue thickness. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between tongue thickness ultrasonography and tongue pressure in the Japanese elderly. We evaluated 254 elderly patients, who underwent tongue ultrasonography and tongue pressure measurement. To determine tongue thickness, we measured the vertical distance from the surface of the mylohyoid muscle to the tongue dorsum using ultrasonography. The results of the analyses revealed that tongue thickness was linearly associated with tongue pressure in both sexes. In male participants, dyslipidemia, lower leg circumference, and tongue pressure were independently and significantly associated with tongue thickness. In female participants, body mass index and tongue pressure were independently and significantly associated with tongue thickness. The optimal cutoff for tongue thickness to predict the tongue pressure of < 20 kPa was 41.3 mm in males, and 39.3 mm in females. In the Japanese elderly, tongue thickness using ultrasonography is associated with tongue pressure. Tongue thickness and tongue pressure, which are sensitive markers for oral frailty, decrease with age. We conclude that tongue ultrasonography provides a less invasive technique for determining tongue thickness and predicts oral frailty for elderly patients.","Nakamori, Masahiro; Imamura, Eiji; Fukuta, Masako; Tachiyama, Keisuke; Kamimura, Teppei; Hayashi, Yuki; Matsushima, Hayato; Ogawa, Kanami; Nishino, Masami; Hirata, Akiko; Mizoue, Tatsuya; Wakabayashi, Shinichi",PLoS One,481,5

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The viral entry into human cell depends on the attachment of spike (S) protein via its receptor binding domain (RBD) to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Thus, blocking the virus attachment to hACE2 could serve as potential therapeutics for viral infection. We have designed a peptide inhibitor (&#916;ABP-&#945;2) targeting the RBD of S protein using in-silico approach. Docking studies and computed affinities suggested that peptide inhibitor binds at the RBD with â¼95-fold higher affinity than hACE2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirms the stable binding of inhibitor to hACE2. Immunoinformatics studies suggest non-immunogenic and non-toxic nature of peptide.

We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply constraints. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made available will determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in the US.","Kohli, Michele; Maschio, Michael; Becker, Debbie; Weinstein, Milton C",Vaccine,481,10

CONCLUSIONS: While there is near-universal consensus that social determinants of mental health education are critical for fellowship training, program directors feel that social determinants of mental health topics differ in importance and are taught at varying levels of effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for intra-institutional and or inter-institutional collaboration for social determinants of mental health educational content development if CAP programs are to prepare trainees to best serve their most vulnerable patients.","Kronsberg, Hal; Bettencourt, Amie F; Vidal, Carol; Platt, Rheanna E",Acad. psychiatry,481,26

The authors study the extent to which police departments used their websites to inform the public about COVID-19, changes to their policies and additional information they felt necessary to give members of the public. This is important for understanding how the police inform the public during a pandemic and how the pandemic affected their police role. Design/methodology/approach: The data gathered for this project came from a content analysis of the official websites of the largest municipal police departments in the USA. The researchers collected quantitative data from the official websites of law enforcement agencies who serve the 200 largest cities in the USA in March 2020 and coded the information from the websites to determine what themes were most prevalent. Findings: The messages most often provided on department websites included information about COVID-19 (52% of websites included this information), modifications to services (33%) and informing users that services such as fingerprinting would be altered (42%). Websites also reminded the public of restrictions on public gatherings (25%) and stay-at-home orders (38%). Further logistic regression analyses explored significant associations among these variables to understand how police/public communications influenced the role of law enforcement during the pandemic. Originality/value: Little is known about how law enforcement communicates online with the public during a global pandemic like COVID-19 or how this might affect the police role. Police departments can use their websites to communicate important information to citizens and keep communities updated. Policy implications suggest that agencies continue to update websites with important information and be direct about expectations from the public regarding compliance while also being transparent about how police roles might change. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Farmer, A.

Healthcare workers, including mental health providers, may experience increased emotional and behavioral health concerns to a greater degree than the general public. The objective of the present study was to examine the frequency and the perceived effectiveness of various coping strategies implemented by mental health practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as differences across career stages (i.e., trainees versus licensed practitioners [LPs]). Survey data were collected from mental health practitioners (N = 888) assessing the strategies they used to manage COVID-19-associated anxiety/distress and the perceived effectiveness of these strategies. Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and t-tests were conducted to assess differences by career stage. Overall, respondents used various coping strategies, most commonly behavioral strategies such as distraction/engaging in an enjoyable activity (88.63%), spending time with loved ones (77.82%), and exercise (72.64%). Over one-quarter reported using alcohol to cope (28.27%). Respondents generally perceived their coping strategies as somewhat to very effective; no strategies were generally perceived as ineffective. Compared to LPs, trainees were significantly more likely to manage COVID-19-related anxiety/distress using supervision (p < .001) and substances other than alcohol or tobacco (p < .001). There were no significant differences in how effective trainees and LPs perceived each strategy. U.S. mental health practitioners' use of predominantly behavioral coping strategies, which were generally perceived as effective, during the first months of COVID-19 offers implications for interventions as the pandemic progresses.","Reilly, Shannon E; Soulliard, Zachary A; McCuddy, William T; Mahoney, James J",Curr Psychol,481,25

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We analyzed a case series of COVID-19-positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc &#8805;500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc &#8805;550 ms (if QRS &#8805;120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of &#8805;60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19-positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 62±17 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36 ms (P=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms versus -0.2±28 ms in women; P=0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (17±39 ms versus 0.5±40 ms; P=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.","Ramireddy, Archana; Chugh, Harpriya; Reinier, Kyndaron; Ebinger, Joseph; Park, Eunice; Thompson, Michael; Cingolani, Eugenio; Cheng, Susan; Marban, Eduardo; Albert, Christine M; Chugh, Sumeet S",J Am Heart Assoc,481,16

Medical waste management during this pandemic is one of the major issues facing public service organizations such as municipalities, which is of great importance in terms of logistics, environment and social aspects. The discussion of logistics operations is related to the collection, transportation and disposal of waste, which imposes high expenses. Many methods have been applied to develop and improve waste management policies in the literature. Apart from these studies, very few researchers have improved vehicle operations in waste management considering environmental aspects and the possibility of outsourcing. In this paper, by examining the gaps in the field, we try to explain and formulate the sustainable medical waste management problem for pandemics.

Although multiple studies have sought to address possible effects of these variables on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, results of these studies have been varied. It is possible that at least some of the differing results are due to insufficient understanding of atmospheric science, including certain physical and chemical principles underlying selected meteorological variables, and how global seasons differ between tropical and temperate zones. The objective of this brief perspective is to provide information that may help explain some of the differing results of studies regarding the influence of environmental variables on transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.

The current study aimed to assess the knowledge; practices of Pakistani residents regarding COVID-19 and factors associated with adequate knowledge and positive practices. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15-April 2020 to 20 May 2020 among 689 Pakistanis by using a validated self-administered questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha 0.77). The questionnaire included questions on the assessment of demographics, the source of information, knowledge, and practice of COVID-19 on google forms and shared links with the WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages and other online platforms. Regression analysis was applied to find potential predictors of knowledge and practices. Results: Of 689 participants, 431 (62.6%) were male, 64.3% (n = 443) were aged <30 years, and\328 (47.6%) of participants were married. 48.19% (n = 332) had adequate knowledge; 81% (n = 555) had positive practices regarding COVID-19 and majority (66.62%, n = 459) seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR > 1.00, p < 0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR > 1.00, p < 0.05) related to the older age (&#8805;50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: The study concluded that Pakistani residents had average knowledge and good practices toward COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns.

Despite decades of targeted research on prediction in adults, methodological limitations still exist for investigating prediction in infancy. In this article, we argue that pupillometry, or the measurement of pupil size, is an effective method to examine predictive processing in infants and will expand on existing methods (namely looking time and anticipatory eye movements). In particular, we argue that there are three specific features of pupillometry that make it particularly useful for augmenting the investigation of prediction in infancy. First, pupillometry has excellent temporal resolution that will facilitate the differentiation of prediction subcomponents. Second, pupillometry is highly continuous across the life span, allowing researchers to directly compare responses between infants and adults using an identical paradigm. Third, pupillometry can be used in conjunction with other behavioral measures, allowing for different yet complementary results. In addition, we review relevant adult and infant pupillometry studies that will facilitate infancy researchers to adopt this technique. Overall, pupillometry is particularly useful in investigating prediction in infancy and opens up several avenues for developmental research.","Zhang, Felicia; Emberson, Lauren L",,481,16

This review will provide a short description of these conditions, their diagnosis and therapy for use by the practicing cardiologist.","Gori, T.",Biomedicines,481,1

Likewise, the effects of patients' conditions such as age, gender and comorbidity on prognosis will be analyzed. METHODS: The files were retrospectively scanned for all COVID-19 patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to the ED and hospitalized between January 1, 2021 and March 15, 2021. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess each scoring system discriminatory for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. RESULTS: There were 464 patients included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 62.4±16.7, of which 245 were men and 219 were women. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension 200 (43.1%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 174 (37.5%) and coronary artery disease 154 (33.2%). In terms of in-hospital mortality, the AUC of SI, and mSI were 0.719, and 0.739, respectively. In terms of ICU requirement, the AUC of SI, and mSI were 0.704, and 0.729, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was concluded that SI and mSI are useful in predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU requirement in COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is another important result of the study that advanced age, male gender and hypertension may be associated with poor prognosis.","Kurt, Erdem; Bahadirli, Suphi",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,481,26

We investigated the coagulation pattern of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), comparing patients who survived to those who did not. Methods: In this prospective cohort study on 20 COVID-19 ARDS patients, the following biomarkers were measured: thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF 1 + 2)), fibrinolysis activation (tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and inhibition (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2)), fibrin synthesis (fibrinopeptide A) and fibrinolysis magnitude (plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP) and D-dimers). Measurements were done upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and after 10-14 days. Results: There was increased thrombin generation; modest or null release of t-PA; and increased levels of PAI-2, fibrinopeptide A, PAP and D-dimers. At baseline, nonsurvivors had a significantly (p = 0.014) higher PAI-2/PAP ratio than survivors (109, interquartile range (IQR) 18.1-216, vs. 8.7, IQR 2.9-12.6). At follow-up, thrombin generation was significantly (p = 0.025) reduced in survivors (PF 1 + 2 from 396 pg/mL, IQR 185-585 to 237 pg/mL, IQR 120-393), whereas it increased in nonsurvivors. Fibrinolysis inhibition at follow-up remained stable in survivors and increased in nonsurvivors, leading to a significant (p = 0.026) difference in PAI-2 levels (161 pg/mL, IQR 50-334, vs. 1088 pg/mL, IQR 177-1565). Conclusion: Severe patterns of COVID-19 ARDS are characterized by a thrombin burst and the consequent coagulation activation. Mechanisms of fibrinolysis regulation appear unbalanced toward fibrinolysis inhibition. This pattern ameliorates in survivors, whereas it worsens in nonsurvivors.","Ranucci, Marco; Sitzia, Clementina; Baryshnikova, Ekaterina; Di Dedda, Umberto; Cardani, Rosanna; Martelli, Fabio; Corsi Romanelli, Massimiliano",,481,18

To understand protective immunity against COVID-19, we screened over 60,000 asymptomatic individuals in the Southeastern United States for IgG antibody positivity against the viral spike protein, and approximately three percent were positive. Of these three percent, individuals with the highest anti-S or anti-RBD IgG level showed a strong correlation with inhibition of ACE2 binding and cross-reactivity against non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus S-proteins. We also analyzed samples from 94 SARS-CoV-2 patients and compared them to asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients had decreased antibody responses, ACE2 binding inhibition, and antibody cross-reactivity. Our study shows that healthy individuals can mount robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms.

AIMS: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. METHODS: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. RESULTS: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. CONCLUSION: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexual practices were predicted by living arrangements, relationship status, and gender. The present findings suggest that the assessment of sexual fantasy and solitary sexual activities may benefit patients presenting with pandemic-related stress. Although mostly exploratory, significant changes in sexual fantasy and solitary sexual practices were observed.

An “infodemic” is defined as “an overabundance of information – some accurate and some not – occurring during an epidemic”. This paper describes the characteristics of an infodemic, which combines an inordinately high volume of information (leading to problems relating to locating the information, storage capacity, ensuring quality, visibility and validity) and rapid output (making it hard to assess its value, manage the gatekeeping process, apply results, track its history, and leading to a waste of effort). This is bound up with the collateral growth of misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Solutions to the problems posed by an infodemic will be sought in improved technology and changed social and regulatory frameworks. One solution could be a new trusted top-level domain for health information. The World Health Organization has so far made two unsuccessful attempts to create such a domain, but it is suggested this could be attempted again, in the light of the COVID-19 infodemic experience. The vital role of reliable information in public health should also be explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals, with explicit targets. All countries should develop knowledge preparedness plans for future emergencies.","Zielinski, Chris",Rev. panam. salud pública,481,16

SETTING: Nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital payment and cost data. DESIGN: Retrospective review and economic impact analysis. METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges that were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and also stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1,230,992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2,350 million USD, with a total hospital payment of 3,624-3,786 million USD. This led to an estimated net income of 1,278-1,440 million USD overall to U.S. hospitals in the NASS dataset from elective ophthalmic surgery (approximately 107-120 million USD per month), with a larger proportion performed in teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The cessation of elective ophthalmic surgeries at HOPDs during COVID-19 resulted in a significant loss of income for hospitals in the U.S. as well as teaching experiences for trainees at academic medical centers.","Fliotsos, Michael J; Best, Matthew J; Field, Matthew G; Srikumaran, Uma; Repka, Michael X; Woreta, Fasika A; Srikumaran, Divya",J. cataract. refract. surg,481,16

The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications. SUBJECT AND METHOD: SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""antivirals,"" ""therapy""), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and drug repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.","von Hentig, Nils",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,481,16

However, most of these corpora are exclusively for English. As the pandemic is a global problem, it is worth creating COVID-19 related datasets for languages other than English. In this paper, we present the first manually-annotated COVID-19 domain-specific dataset for Vietnamese. Particularly, our dataset is annotated for the named entity recognition (NER) task with newly-defined entity types that can be used in other future epidemics. Our dataset also contains the largest number of entities compared to existing Vietnamese NER datasets. We empirically conduct experiments using strong baselines on our dataset, and find that: automatic Vietnamese word segmentation helps improve the NER results and the highest performances are obtained by fine-tuning pre-trained language models where the monolingual model PhoBERT for Vietnamese (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) produces higher results than the multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020).

METHODS: An online survey was conducted among Israeli adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB predictor variables as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R squared = 0.78). Men (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Providing data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public.","Shmueli, Liora",BMC Public Health,481,24

We collected clinical data of COVID-19 patients between January 18 and March 29 2020 in Wuhan, China . Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR) model, and simplified LR were built to predict the mortality of COVID-19. We also evaluated different models by computing area under curve (AUC), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) under fivefold cross-validation. A total of 2924 patients were included in our evaluation, with 257 (8.8%) died and 2667 (91.2%) survived during hospitalization. Upon admission, there were 21 (0.7%) mild cases, 2051 (70.1%) moderate case, 779 (26.6%) severe cases, and 73 (2.5%) critically severe cases. The GBDT model exhibited the highest fivefold AUC, which was 0.941, followed by LR (0.928) and LR-5 (0.913). The diagnostic accuracies of GBDT, LR, and LR-5 were 0.889, 0.868, and 0.887, respectively. In particular, the GBDT model demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.899) and specificity (0.889). The NPV of all three models exceeded 97%, while their PPV values were relatively low, resulting in 0.381 for LR, 0.402 for LR-5, and 0.432 for GBDT. Regarding severe and critically severe cases, the GBDT model also performed the best with a fivefold AUC of 0.918. In the external validation test of the LR-5 model using 72 cases of COVID-19 from Brunei, leukomonocyte (%) turned to show the highest fivefold AUC (0.917), followed by urea (0.867), age (0.826), and SPO2 (0.704). The findings confirm that the mortality prediction performance of the GBDT is better than the LR models in confirmed cases of COVID-19. The performance comparison seems independent of disease severity.

However, It is worth noting that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), has been widely applied in mainland China since outbreak, bringing new hope for the prevention and control of COVID-19. A comprehensive literature searching was conducted in 7 electronic databases from their inception up to June 21, 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for COVID-19. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2275 patients were enrolled. Most of CHMs were originated from classical Chinese herbal formulas.

Although SARS-CoV-2 infections are not more prevalent in Parkinson's disease patients, a higher mortality rate has been reported not only associated with older age and longer disease duration, but also through several mechanisms, such as interactions with the brain dopaminergic system and through systemic inflammatory responses. Indeed, a number of the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, as well as the alterations in the gut microbiome, are also prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, biochemical pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation have shared commonalities between Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 disease progression.

Group testing offers a way to increase throughput by testing pools of combined samples; however, most proposed designs have not yet addressed key concerns over sensitivity loss and implementation feasibility. Here, we combined a mathematical model of epidemic spread and empirically derived viral kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 infections to identify pooling designs that are robust to changes in prevalence and to ratify sensitivity losses against the time course of individual infections. We show that prevalence can be accurately estimated across a broad range, from 0.02 to 20%, using only a few dozen pooled tests and using up to 400 times fewer tests than would be needed for individual identification. We then exhaustively evaluated the ability of different pooling designs to maximize the number of detected infections under various resource constraints, finding that simple pooling designs can identify up to 20 times as many true positives as individual testing with a given budget. Crucially, we confirmed that our theoretical results can be translated into practice using pooled human nasopharyngeal specimens by accurately estimating a 1% prevalence among 2304 samples using only 48 tests and through pooled sample identification in a panel of 960 samples. Our results show that accounting for variation in sampled viral loads provides a nuanced picture of how pooling affects sensitivity to detect infections.

In California, due to a high burden of cases, a lockdown order was announced on March 19th, 2020. This study investigated the impact of the lockdown on the epidemiology and outcomes of trauma admissions at the largest trauma center in Los Angeles. METHODS: Retrospective study comparing epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of trauma admissions, during the lockdown period (03/20/2020 to 06/30/2020) to a similar period in the previous year (03/20/2019 to 06/30/2019). Data collection included demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital transportation, substance use, injury severity, resource utilization, and outcomes. FINDINGS: There were 1,202 admissions during the lockdown period in 2020 and 1,143 during the same calendar period in 2019. Following the lockdown, there was a reduction in the automobile versus pedestrian admissions by 42.5%, motorcycle injuries by 38.7%, and bicycle accidents by 28.4%, but no significant effect on the number of motor vehicle accident admissions. There was an increase in ground level falls by 32.5%, especially in the elderly group. The absolute number of gunshot wounds increased by 6.2% and knife injuries by 39.3%. Suicides increased by 38.5%. Positive testing for substance use increased by 20.9%. During the lockdown patients suffered less severe trauma, with ISS<9 (p<0.001), as well as less severe head (p=0.001) and severe chest trauma (p<0.001). Trauma deaths were reduced by 27.9% and the crude overall mortality was significantly lower during the lockdown period (4.1% vs 5.9%, p= 0.046). ICU admission rates, mechanical ventilation, and ICU LOS were all reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had a significant effect on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and critical care resource utilization of trauma admissions in a large academic trauma center.

Only by understanding it more profoundly and comprehensively can it be soundly defeated. This paper is dedicated to studying the spatial-temporal characteristics of the epidemic development at the provincial-level in mainland China and the civic-level in Hubei Province. Moreover, a correlation analysis on the possible factors that cause the spatial differences in the epidemic's degree is conducted. After completing these works, three different methods are adopted to fit the daily-change tendencies of the number of confirmed cases in mainland China and Hubei Province. The three methods are the Logical Growth Model (LGM), Polynomial fitting, and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The analysis results on the spatial-temporal differences and their influencing factors show that: (1) The Chinese government has contained the domestic epidemic in early March 2020, indicating that the number of newly diagnosed cases has almost zero increase since then. (2) Throughout the entire mainland of China, effective manual intervention measures such as community isolation and urban isolation have significantly weakened the influence of the subconscious factors that may impact the spatial differences of the epidemic. (3) The classification results based on the number of confirmed cases also prove the effectiveness of the isolation measures adopted by the governments at all levels in China from another aspect. It is reflected in the small monthly grade changes (even no change) in the provinces of mainland China and the cities in Hubei Province during the study period.

Micro-credentials are short competency-based industry-aligned units of learning, while the gig economy comprises contingent work by individual ‘suppliers’. Both can be facilitated by (often the same) digital platforms, and both are underpinned by social relations of precariousness in the labour market and in society. They are mutually reinforcing and each has the potential to amplify the other. Rather than presenting new opportunities for social inclusion and access to education, they contribute to the privatisation of education by unbundling the curriculum and blurring the line between public and private provision in higher education. They accelerate the transfer of the costs of employment preparation, induction, and progression from governments and employers to individuals. Micro-credentials contribute to ‘disciplining’ higher education in two ways: first by building tighter links between higher education and workplace requirements (rather than whole occupations), and through ensuring universities are more ‘responsive’ to employer demands in a competitive market crowded with other types of providers. Instead of micro-credentials, progressive, democratic societies should seek to ensure that all members of society have access to a meaningful qualification that has value in the labour market and in society more broadly, and as a bridge to further education. This is a broader vision of education in which the purpose of education is to prepare individuals to live lives they have reason to value, and not just in the specifics required of particular jobs.","Wheelahan, Leesa; Moodie, Gavin",High Educ (Dordr),481,1

Here, we showed that the down-regulation of E is not dependent on the lysine residues on 8b and the reduction of polyubiquitination of E mutants is not correlated with their down-regulation by 8b, suggesting an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway is involved. A time-course study revealed that 8b was expressed at late-stages of SARS-CoV infection. By using Vero E6 cells stably expressing green fluorescence protein-tagged 8b, ectopic expression of 8b was shown to significantly reduce the production of progeny virus and down-regulate E expression. Taken together, these results suggest that 8b negatively modulates virus replication by down-regulating E via an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway.","Keng, Choong-Tat; Åkerström, Sara; Leung, Cynthia Sau-Wai; Poon, Leo L.M.; Peiris, J.S.

Exocytosis of large cargo is essential for many physiological processes, including collagen and lipoprotein secretion, and defects in the process lead to disease. In addition, enveloped viruses that bud into the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex must also be transported through Golgi cisternae for secretion from the infected cell.

Sixteen, 3–4 week-old piglets, from a PRRSv and Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) free herd were used. Animals were equally and randomly allocated in four groups which were treated according the following schedule: Group I: negative controls; Group II: inoculation with only PRRSV; Group III: inoculation with PRRSV and P. multocida; Group IV: inoculation with ADV and P. multocida (positive controls). PRRSV and ADV were inoculated intranasally, at the doses of 104.6 and 104.5 TCID50/ml, respectively. Five days later, pigs from groups III and IV were inoculated intranasally, with two ml of a 109 CFU/ml suspension of equal parts of P. multocida, strains A52 and A24. No lesions were observed in piglets of group I. Microscopically, interstitial pneumonia was identified in all piglets of groups II and III and 3 4 piglets from group IV. Bronchopneumonia was detected in 3 4 of the piglets from group III and in all animals of group IV which, additionally, showed meningo-encephalitis and purulent rhinitis. Macroscopically, only piglets of groups III and IV had lung consolidation. However, much lower pneumonic scores (2.3%) were observed in group III, where 3 of 4 piglets were affected. On the other hand, all piglets of group IV showed some degree of pulmonary consolidation, with a mean score of 13.7%. Based on these results, it appears that the role of PRRSV as a initiator of secondary diseases is still undefined, but is probably mild. There was no clear interaction between PRRSv and Pasteurella multocida under the conditions and strains tested here.","Carvalho, Luiz F.O.S.; Segalés, Joaquim; Pijoan, Carlos",Veterinary Microbiology,481,26

The results clearly document an inverse correlation of age with the incidence of SGVHD. Virtually a 100% incidence of SGVHD occurs in Lewis rats when syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy are started when the animals are 4 wk of age. Thereafter, there is a dramatic decline in the incidence of SGVHD with the increasing age of the animals. Although the age of the recipient was important, the most significant effect was the age of the marrow donor. Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was virtually incapable of eliciting SGVHD after BMT and CsA therapy. Furthermore, mixing the marrow from mature and immature animals resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD, implicating a regulatory effect present in the marrow from older rats. This regulatory effect was due to the presence of mature T cells in the marrow from animals 6 mo of age. Despite the fact that marrow from young animals possesses mature T lymphocytes, this regulatory activity was absent, suggesting that the host resistance mediated by T lymphocytes develops as the animal ages. These data further implicate the importance of a host resistance mechanism in preventing the induction of SGVHD with CsA, which appears to be mediated by the clonal inactivation of autoreactive cells.",,J Exp Med,481,18

Here, we show that cost-effective metrics for methane that minimize the overall mitigation costs are time-dependent, primarily determined by the pathway, and strongly influenced by temperature overshoot. Parties to the Paris Agreement have already adopted the conventional GWP100 (100-year global warming potential), which is shown to be a good approximation of cost-effective metrics for the coming decades.

AIM: Our objective was to identify risk factors predictive of severe disease and death in France. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we included patients ≥ 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalised in Strasbourg and Mulhouse hospitals (France), in March 2020. We respectively compared patients who developed severe disease (admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death) and patients who died, to those who did not, by day 7 after hospitalisation. RESULTS: Among 1,045 patients, 424 (41%) had severe disease, including 335 (32%) who were admitted to ICU, and 115 (11%) who died. Mean age was 66 years (range: 20–100), and 612 (59%) were men. Almost 75% of patients with body mass index (BMI) data (n = 897) had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (n = 661). Independent risk factors associated with severe disease were advanced age (odds ratio (OR): 1.1 per 10-year increase; 95% CrI (credible interval): 1.0–1.2), male sex (OR: 2.1; 95% CrI: 1.5–2.8), BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m(2) (OR: 1.8; 95% CrI: 1.2–2.7) or ≥ 30 (OR: 2.2; 95% CrI: 1.5–3.3), dyspnoea (OR: 2.5; 95% CrI: 1.8–3.4) and inflammatory parameters (elevated C-reactive protein and neutrophil count, low lymphocyte count). Risk factors associated with death were advanced age (OR: 2.7 per 10-year increase; 95% CrI: 2.1–3.4), male sex (OR: 1.7; 95% CrI: 1.1–2.7), immunosuppression (OR: 3.8; 95% CrI: 1.6–7.7), diabetes (OR: 1.7; 95% CrI: 1.0–2.7), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.3; 95% CrI: 1.3–3.9), dyspnoea (OR: 2.1; 95% CrI: 1.2–3.4) and inflammatory parameters.

We investigated whether deformation indices of left atrium (LA) at transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) correlate with those of LAA assessed by TEE in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing electrical cardioversion (ECV). Consecutive patients with NVAF of ≥ 48 h or unknown duration, who underwent TEE and TTE at our Institution before ECV were retrospectively investigated. Standard echo-Doppler and LA and LAA myocardial strain and strain rate parameters were analyzed. A total of 115 NVAF patients (71.3 ± 8.1 yr/o, 59.1% men) were included: LAAT was diagnosed in 25 (21.7%) patients. Compared to patients without LAAT, those with LAAT had significantly higher CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Risk score (4.5 ± 1.4 vs. 3.5 ± 1.1, p < 0.001), and lower ejection fraction (46.0 ± 14.8 vs. 57.6 ± 8.6%, p < 0.001). In LAAT patients, global strain of LA (8.7 ± 2.6 vs. 16.3 ± 4.5%, p < 0.001) and LAA (7.0 ± 1.7 vs. 11.7 ± 2.0%, p < 0.001) was significantly reduced compared to non-LAAT patients. A close relationship between left atrial strain reservoir (LASr) and LAA-global strain was demonstrated (r = 0.81). By univariable analysis, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Risk Score (OR 2.01, 95%CI 1.34–3.00), NT-proBNP (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.19–1.54), ejection fraction (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.88–0.96), E/e’ ratio (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.51–2.85), and LASr (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.25–0.62) were strongly associated with LAAT presence at TEE. By multivariable analysis, only LASr (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.24–0.70) retained statistical significance. ROC curve analysis revealed that an LASr cut-off value ≤ 9.3% had 98.9% sensibility and 100% specificity to identify LAAT by TEE (AUC = 0.98). In patients with NVAF of ≥ 48 h or unknown duration, scheduled to undergo ECV, LA deformation assessment by TTE might substitute invasive measurement of LAA function by TEE, simplifying diagnostic approach and possibly contributing to reduce COVID-19 infection diffusion.

SP-A interacts with the sentinel innate immune cell in the alveolus, the alveolar macrophage (AM), and modulates its function and regulation. SP-A also plays a role in pulmonary surfactant-related aspects, including surfactant structure and reorganization. For most (if not all) pulmonary diseases there is a dysregulation of host defense and inflammatory processes and/or surfactant dysfunction or deficiency. Because SP-A plays a role in both of these general processes where one or both may become aberrant in pulmonary disease, SP-A stands to be an important molecule in health and disease. In humans (unlike in rodents) SP-A is encoded by two genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) and each has been identified with extensive genetic and epigenetic complexity. In this review, we focus on functional, structural, and regulatory differences between the two SP-A gene-specific products, SP-A1 and SP-A2, and among their corresponding variants. We discuss the differential impact of these variants on the surfactant structure, the alveolar microenvironment, the regulation of epithelial type II miRNome, the regulation and function of the AM, the overall survival of the organism after infection, and others. Although there have been a number of reviews on SP-A, this is the first review that provides such a comprehensive account of the differences between human SP-A1 and SP-A2.","Floros, Joanna; Thorenoor, Nithyananda; Tsotakos, Nikolaos; Phelps, David S.",Front Immunol,481,1

A community-based study led by members of the local National Black Nurses Association (NBNA) was conducted in a Midwest metropolitan city to identify barriers to mask-wearing experienced by business owners and employees in predominantly African American neighborhoods. Neighborhood business owners and their employees are essential to the life of a community as they provide needed goods and services from convenient neighborhood locations. Thus, attitudes and behaviors exhibited by business owners, supervisors, and other employees are important to combat COVID-19 in underserved communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 39 business owners or supervising employees. Simple content analysis was used to identify codes and themes from the narrative data. Responses to the question ‘What can make mask-wearing easier for your business and businesses in the neighborhood?’ yielded three themes. Themes included ‘a sense of community’, the ‘need for external support’, and ‘internal leadership’. These themes can be used to develop interventions to improve mask-wearing behaviors, support business owners and their customers, and lower the spread of COVID-19 in high-risk communities.","Jones, Holly J.; Hutchins, Regina; Brown, Peggy; Crute, Sheeva; Ntumba, Linda; Ward, Carolyn",J Community Health,481,1

We therefore analysed individual-level data on socioeconomic differences in the prevalence and perceived dangerousness of SARS-CoV-2 infections in local populations. Data were obtained from a population-based seroepidemiological study of adult individuals in two early German SARS-CoV-2 hotspots (n = 3903). Infection was determined by IgG antibody ELISA, RT-PCR testing and self-reports on prior positive PCR tests. The perceived dangerousness of an infection and socioeconomic position (SEP) were assessed by self-reports. Logistic and linear regression were applied to examine associations of multiple SEP measures with infection status and perceptions of dangerousness. RESULTS: We found no evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infections by education, occupation, income and subjective social status. Participants with lower education and lower subjective social status perceived an infection as more dangerous than their better-off counterparts. In successfully contained local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, infections may have been equally distributed across the socioeconomic spectrum. But residents in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups might have experienced a higher level of mental distress due to the higher perceived dangerousness of an infection.","Wachtler, Benjamin; Müters, Stephan; Michalski, Niels; Koschollek, Carmen; Albrecht, Stefan; Haller, Sebastian; Hamouda, Osamah; Hövener, Claudia; Hoebel, Jens",BMC Res Notes,481,1

Identification of modified patterns is important for future preparedness and response. Emergency department (ED) crowding can occur because of the volume of patients waiting to be seen, which results in delays in patient assessment or treatment and impediments to leaving the ED once treatment is complete. Therefore, ED crowding has become a growing problem worldwide and represents a serious barrier to healthcare operations. METHODS: This observational study was based on a retrospective review of the epidemiologic and clinical records of patients who presented to the Foundation IRCCS Policlinic San Matteo in Pavia, Italy, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (February 21–May 1, 2020, pandemic group). The methods involved an estimation of the changes in epidemiologic and clinical data from the annual baseline data after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We identified reduced ED visits (180 per day in the control period vs 96 per day in the pandemic period; P < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic, irrespective of age and gender, especially for low-acuity conditions. However, patients who did present to the ED were more likely to be hemodynamically unstable, exhibit abnormal vital signs, and more frequently required high-intensity care and hospitalization. During the pandemic, ED crowding dramatically increased primarily because of an increased number of visits by patients with high-acuity conditions, changes in patient management that prolonged length of stay, and increased rates of boarding, which led to the inability of patients to gain access to appropriate hospital beds within a reasonable amount of time. During the pandemic, all crowding output indices increased, especially the rates of boarding (36% vs 57%; P < 0.001), “access block” (24% vs 47%; P < 0.001), mean boarding time (640 vs 1,150 minutes [min]; P 0.001), mean “access block” time (718 vs 1,223 min; P < 0.001), and “access block” total time (650,379 vs 1,359,172 min; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Crowding in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic was due to the inability to access hospital beds. Therefore, solutions to this lack of access are required to prevent a recurrence of crowding due to a new viral wave or epidemic.","Savioli, Gabriele; Ceresa, Iride Francesca; Guarnone, Roberta; Muzzi, Alba; Novelli, Viola; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Iotti, Giorgio Antonio; Bressan, Maria Antonietta; Oddone, Enrico",West J Emerg Med,481,24

The need and the rationale for global citizenship education (GCED) were ever more emphasized by many educational organizations, including UNESCO. This article reviews the GCED discourses conceptualizing global competence as instrumental action and a binary view of global-local relations. In turn, the article proposes the idea of curriculum-as-relations for GCED. Curriculum-as-relations conceptualizes competence as situated praxis and focuses on providing authentic critical-translocal learning. Authentic critical-translocal learning through the strategy of comparison offers an alternative view of global-local relations as “articulated moments created by situated praxis”. This new understanding of global-local relations may help different stakeholders to imagine GCED curricula beyond a Tylerian instrumentalist, ends-means orientation of curriculum.","Kim, Eun-Ji Amy",Prospects (Paris),481,16

Peptides are characterized by low toxicity and small interface areas; therefore, they are good targets for therapeutic strategies, rational drug planning and protein inhibition. Approximately 10% of the ethical pharmaceutical market is protein/peptide-based. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40% of protein interactions are mediated by peptides. Despite the fast increase in the volume of biological data, particularly on sequences and structures, there remains a lack of broad and comprehensive protein–peptide databases and tools that allow the retrieval, characterization and understanding of protein–peptide recognition and consequently support peptide design. RESULTS: We introduce Propedia, a comprehensive and up-to-date database with a web interface that permits clustering, searching and visualizing of protein–peptide complexes according to varied criteria. Propedia comprises over 19,000 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank including structural and sequence information from protein–peptide complexes. The main advantage of Propedia over other peptide databases is that it allows a more comprehensive analysis of similarity and redundancy. It was constructed based on a hybrid clustering algorithm that compares and groups peptides by sequences, interface structures and binding sites. Propedia is available through a graphical, user-friendly and functional interface where users can retrieve, and analyze complexes and download each search data set. We performed case studies and verified that the utility of Propedia scores to rank promissing interacting peptides. In a study involving predicting peptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we showed that Propedia scores related to similarity between different peptide complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease are in agreement with molecular dynamics free energy calculation. CONCLUSIONS: Propedia is a database and tool to support structure-based rational design of peptides for special purposes. Protein–peptide interactions can be useful to predict, classifying and scoring complexes or for designing new molecules as well.

This review highlights and discusses the implications that climate change has already had and is expected to have for inpatient dermatologists. RECENT FINDINGS: There are a variety of conditions affected by climate changes. The distribution and frequencies of infectious diseases and their vectors are changing in line with variations in climate conditions. Increased temperatures have already been associated with exacerbation of existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and recent evidence suggests that higher temperatures will also magnify the effects of harmful ultraviolet radiation. Extreme weather events that result from climate change are followed by an array of dermatologic conditions that may be unusual for the given location. Inpatient dermatologists should be prepared to manage these potentially unfamiliar dermatologic consequences of climate change. SUMMARY: Climate change will have widespread effects on the medical field, and inpatient dermatologists will be faced with their own unique set of challenges and practice variations. Practitioners should be familiar with the ongoing and predicted effects of climate change in their locations so that they can readily identify and treat associated conditions, and they should adjust their practice to reduce their carbon footprint and serve as a model for patients to do the same.","Fathy, R.; Rosenbach, Misha",Curr Dermatol Rep,481,21

The results indicate that information seeking is primarily directed by informational subjective norms (ISN) and perceived seeking control (PSC), while the main predictors of information avoidance include ISN and attitude toward seeking. Because ISN are the strongest predictor of both information seeking and avoidance, the way the public copes with COVID-19 information may be strongly affected by individuals' social environment. Furthermore, a significant relationship between risk perception and affective risk response is identified. Our results also indicate that people who perceive greater knowledge of COVID-19 are more likely to report greater knowledge insufficiency, which results in less information avoidance.","Liu, Mei; Chen, You; Shi, Dan; Yan, Tingwu",Front Psychol,481,29

To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatiotemporal mechanistic framework to integrate individual surveillance data with geolocation data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We analyze reported cases, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the state of Georgia. First, our results show that the reproductive number reduced to below one in about 2 wk after the shelter-in-place order. Superspreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in rural areas and an increasing importance toward later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected nonelderly cases (<60 y) may be 2.78 [2.10, 4.22] times more infectious than the elderly, and the former tend to be the main driver of superspreading. Our results improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectiousness and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of superspreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.","Lau, Max S.

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi(TM) 2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. RESULTS: Maglumi(TM) IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4% versus 64.3%). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70%) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91% to 94%) after 14 days. CONCLUSION: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabel, Montesinos; Damien, Gruson; Benoit, Kabamba; Hafid, Dahma; Sigi, Van den Wijngaert; Soleimani, Reza; Vincenzo, Carbone; Olivier, Vandenberg; Beatrice, Gulbis; Fleur, Wolff; Hector, Rodriguez-Villalobos",J Clin Virol,481,5

METHODS: Among 3 PPE kits (simple, Level D, and Level C), 30 participants conducted the first simulation in their adapted way and the second following enhanced protocols. After donning, participants performed a 1-minute simulation of direct care on a patient simulator covered with fluorescent powder. For tracking contamination routes between doffing processes, fluorescent powder contamination was examined with ultraviolet lamps in the darkened room. RESULTS: Participants were mostly registered nurses (N = 27, 90%), female (87%), and on average 31.7 years old with 8.5 years of clinical experience. Among 61 total simulations, 32 had at least 1 contamination (52.5%); “Noticeable” level (40%) at the “hands-fingers” and “shirt” body areas were most frequent.

El principal inconveniente de las metodologías anteriormente citadas es el tiempo necesario para obtener un diagnóstico etiológico de la infección. Las técnicas basadas en la biología molecular han irrumpido con fuerza en las últimas décadas como herramientas de diagnóstico rápido de las infecciones. Algunas de estas técnicas —sobre todo aquellas que pueden detectar diversos microorganismos en la misma reacción— acostumbran a ser caras, por lo que la cuestión que se plantea es si el gasto de tales ensayos se ve justificado por la información obtenida y por el impacto clínico que su implementación determina. En este artículo se pretende hacer una revisión de las diversas técnicas de biología molecular aplicadas al diagnóstico de las infecciones respiratorias, centrándose fundamentalmente en la neumonía, y analizar el impacto que pueden tener en el manejo del paciente con infección respiratoria aguda. Abstract Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide, which is why early diagnosis is crucial. Traditionally the microbiological diagnosis of these infections has been based on conventional methods including culture on artificial media for isolation of bacteria and fungi and cell cultures for virus and antibody or antigen detection using antigen-antibody reactions. The main drawback of the above mentioned methods is the time needed for an etiological diagnosis of the infection. The techniques based on molecular biology have drawn much attention in recent decades as tools for rapid diagnosis of infections. Some techniques are very expensive, especially those that can detect various microorganisms in the same reaction, therefore the question that arises is whether the cost of such testing is justified by the information obtained and by the clinical impact that its implementation will determine. In this article we make a review of the various techniques of molecular biology applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia and focus primarily on analysing the impact they may have on the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections.","Vila Estapé, Jordi; Zboromyrska, Yuliya; Vergara Gómez, Andrea; Alejo Cancho, Izaskun; Rubio García, Elisa; Álvarez-Martínez, Miriam José; la Bellacasa Brugada, Jorge Puig de; Marcos Maeso, M.

Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI-FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against the gold standard, nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection.

SO impacts public health via consumption of contaminated drinking water, aerosolization of pathogens, food-chain transmission, and direct contact with fecally-polluted rivers and beach sediments during recreation. However, no study has attempted to map the linkage between SO and public health including Covid-19 using scientometric analysis and systematic review of literature. Results showed that only few countries were actively involved in SO research in relation to public health. Furthermore, there are renewed calls to scale up environmental surveillance to safeguard public health. To safeguard public health, it is important for public health authorities to optimize water and wastewater treatment plants and improve building ventilation and plumbing systems to minimize pathogen transmission within buildings and transportation systems. In addition, health authorities should formulate appropriate policies that can enhance environmental surveillance and facilitate real-time monitoring of sewer overflow. Increased public awareness on strict personal hygiene and point-of-use-water-treatment such as boiling drinking water will go a long way to safeguard public health. Ecotoxicological studies and health risk assessment of exposure to pathogens via different transmission routes is also required to appropriately inform the use of lockdowns, minimize their socio-economic impact and guide evidence-based welfare/social policy interventions. Soft infrastructures, optimized sewer maintenance and prescreening of sewer overflow are recommended to reduce stormwater burden on wastewater treatment plant, curtail pathogen transmission and marine plastic pollution. Comprehensive, integrated surveillance and global collaborative efforts are important to curtail on-going Covid-19 pandemic and improve resilience against future pandemics.","Ao, Sojobi; Zayed, Tarek",Environmental research,481,29

Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1, N2, and E) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman's r = 0.70, p < 0.05), with the N2 gene region being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Viral sequencing showed that shifts in strain-defining variants of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples matched those in clinical isolates from the same time periods. The findings from this study support that wastewater surveillance is effective in COVID-19 trend tracking and provide sentinel warning of variant emergence and transmission within various types of communities.","Ai, Yuehan; Davis, Angela; Jones, Dan; Lemeshow, Stanley; Tu, Huolin; He, Fan; Ru, Peng; Pan, Xiaokang; Bohrerova, Zuzana; Lee, Jiyoung",Sci Total Environ,481,16

While these measures are necessary to slow virus transmission, little is known regarding the secondary health consequences of social distancing. The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of injuries secondary to physical child abuse (PCA) at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fisher’s exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. RESULTS: Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8–24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %). All injuries were caused by blunt trauma, resulting in scalp/face contusions (63 %), skull fractures (50 %), intracranial hemorrhage (38 %), and long bone fractures (25 %). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at our center during the Covid-19 pandemic. Strategies to mitigate this secondary effect of social distancing should be thoughtfully implemented.","Kovler, Mark L.; Ziegfeld, Susan; Ryan, Leticia M.; Goldstein, Mitchell A.; Gardner, Rebecca; Garcia, Alejandro V.; Nasr, Isam W.",Child Abuse Negl,481,33

We present the outcomes from a single-center prospective observational study in which 89 children was included (60 with proven COVID-19, 10 symptomatic with confirmed COVID-19 contact and 19 diagnosed with MIS-C). Laboratory, instrumental, immunological, and clinical investigations were performed. Only 12% (n = 4) from the COVID-19 group (except the ICU cases), we found elevated AST and/or ALT (up to 100). All of the children with elevated transaminase were overweight or obese, presenting along with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. The majority of children with MIS-C showed typical laboratory constellations with higher levels of IL-6 (120.36 ± 35.56 ng/mL). About half of the children in the MIS-C group (52%, n = 11) showed elevated transaminases. Eleven children (57.9%) presented with abdominal pain, eight (42.1%) with ascites, two (10.5%) with hepatosplenomegaly, and four (21.1%) with symptoms such as diarrhea. Mesenteric lymphadenitis was observed more often in patients with elevated LDH (327.83 ± 159.39, p = 0.077). Ascites was associated with lymphopenia (0.86 ± 0.80, p = 0.029) and elevated LDH.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to analyze the lifestyle changes in a single-center cohort of SSc patients and if these changes were more severe than in the general population. During the Italian lockdown, we supplied two surveys to our 184 SSc patients.

The second survey, performed by 79 SSc patients and 63 healthy subjects, included questions about the lifestyle adopted during this specific period. Among our patients, COVID-19 was diagnosed only in one case, while three other subjects reported signs and symptoms suggestive for the disease. Regarding the second survey, our patients greatly changed their lifestyle during the pandemic, adopting more restrictive isolation measures, because of their awareness of frailty. To date, we do not dispose of enough data to speculate about the risk of COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients, although in our SSc patients their frailty seems to have been their shelter.

We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits (risk, time and social preferences) using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences. Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity).

Though various fast Smith-Waterman implementations are developed, they are either designed as monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools. These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical. RESULTS: To facilitate easy integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a C/C++ library, which extends Farrar’s Striped Smith-Waterman (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of efficiency. This improvement makes the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman become really useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a C/C++ software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment tool at: https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library. CONCLUSIONS: The SSW library has been used in the primary read mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS, the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR.

Once the crisis had subsided, many nurses remarked that SARS had forever altered their chosen profession; employment, which they once viewed as relatively safe, had been transformed into potentially life-threatening. This discussion provides descriptions of these expressions through nurses who experienced the crisis and chose to go on the public record. Secondly, it compares the subjective perceptions of those nurses to those held by nurses who worked through historical epidemics of unknown or contested epidemiology. The historical literature on nursing in yellow fever, cholera and influenza epidemics has been employed to offer insight. The goal is to determine whether the SARS outbreak was a unique experience for nurses or whether similar experiences were shared by nurses in the past? In summary, the reactions of nurses when confronted with the possibility of contracting a deadly disease remain altogether human, not dissimilar in past or present. Nurses’ responses to SARS can be usefully studied within a larger historical vision of crisis nursing, and information or impressions from earlier crises are potentially of interest to the nursing profession.","Rankin, John",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,481,28

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 in adult coeliac patients regularly followed-up at our centre since January 2015. METHODS: Data about general health status and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively collected over the phone. Data about CD were retrospectively collected from clinical notes. Prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 were compared between the coeliac cohort and the figures in the general population of Lombardy, Northern Italy between 20 February to 5 June 2020 provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) and the Lombardy regional government. RESULTS: Nine out of 324 patients contracted COVID-19, thus resulting in a prevalence of 2.78% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–4.58] and an incidence rate of 8.15/1000 person-month (95% CI 4.24–15.66).

Using the IV method, for every additional hospital admission, there was a 6.22% (p < 0.01) decrease in LOS and a 1.86% (p < 0.01) increase in hospital mortality. The impact of healthcare staffing levels on the quality of care varied between different hospital tiers. The quality of care in secondary hospitals was most affected by the number of admissions, with the average decrease of 18.60% (p < 0.05) in LOS and the increase of 6.05% (p < 0.01) in hospital mortality for every additional hospital admission in our sample. The findings suggested that the supply of medical services in China should be increased and a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system should be actively promoted.","Song, Jinglin; Chen, Chen; Zhao, Shaoyang; Zhou, Leming; Chen, Hong",PLoS One,481,6

Materials and Methods General dentists and dental specialists working in public and private dental practices, hospitals, and academic institutions participated in this cross-sectional study. A pilot-tested questionnaire was sent to dental professionals through an online link in Pakistan and data collection was completed in April-May 2020. The knowledge score was calculated from 22 variables about the COVID-19. Results The study included data of 343 dental professionals with 47.2% of males and 52.8% of females. The mean knowledge score was 16.78 ± 2.25, and it significantly differed between general dentists (16.55 ± 2.36) and dental specialists (17.15 ± 2.04) ( p = 0.020), and those with up to 10 years of experience (16.58 ± 2.28) and those with more than 10 years of experience (17.05 ± 2.2) ( p = 0.026). Only 15.5% of the participants were comfortable in treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A workshop/seminar on the COVID-19 was attended by 23% of the participants. In multivariate analysis, being comfortable in treating patients (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% confidence interval = 1.63, 6.73) was associated with the attendance of workshop/seminar on COVID-19. Conclusions Dental professionals had adequate knowledge about COVID-19, but a few of them were comfortable in treating patients during the pandemic. A minority of dental professionals attended a workshop/seminar on the COVID-19. Continuous education activities should be provided to dental professionals to enhance their role in the prevention of COVID-19 spread and promotion of oral health.","Almas, Khalid; Khan, Abdul Samad; Tabassum, Afsheen; Nazir, Muhammad Ashraf; Afaq, Ashar; Majeed, Abdul",Eur J Dent,481,20

As the aviation sector has faced disease outbreaks and extreme events before—albeit not at the same scale—and will, in all likelihood, face them again, we provide an assessment in this study that a) gives an overview of the effects of the pandemic, b) categorizes the response mechanisms that were observed, and c) proposes a framework for a coordinated global response to future disease outbreaks. We highlight that of the many lessons, recommendations, and suggestions that emerged during previous outbreaks, few were introduced effectively into civil aviation practices and operations. Based on multiple data sources for passengers, cargo, and flight schedules, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on the global aviation industry and compare the data of some prominent airports to highlight the need for a coordinated response to effectively deal with future disruptions. As global aviation navigates its ongoing recovery, we discuss different responses during the pandemic including guidelines issued by bodies such as International Civil Aviation Organization, operational decisions such as closing terminals, increased cleaning frequencies, and mask mandates etc. We emphasize the need for resilience to accommodate disease outbreaks in future planning, design, and preparedness strategies for airports and airlines. We further argue that the existing civil aviation system needs a coordinated global response mechanism to combat future outbreaks and propose a framework with a threat response matrix to keep aviation safe and operational during future pandemics and mitigate socioeconomic fallout.","Arora, Mohit; Tuchen, Stefan; Nazemi, Mohsen; Blessing, Lucienne",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,481,33

SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was also associated with a cytokine response in the fetal circulation (i.e. umbilical cord blood) without compromising the cellular immune repertoire. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection neither altered fetal cellular immune responses in the placenta nor induced elevated cord blood levels of IgM. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the placental tissues, nor was the sterility of the placenta compromised by maternal viral infection.

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. SUMMARY: Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M.; Craig, Timothy J.",Pulm Ther,481,22

The molecular characteristics of the virus that predict better or worse outcome are largely still being discovered. Methods: We downloaded 155,958 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from GISAID and evaluated whether variants improved prediction of reported severity beyond age and region. We also evaluated specific variants to determine the magnitude of association with severity and the frequency of these variants among the genomes. Results: Logistic regression models that included viral genomic variants outperformed other models (AUC=0.91 as compared with 0.68 for age and gender alone; p<0.001). Among individual variants, we found 17 single nucleotide variants in SARS-CoV-2 have more than two-fold greater odds of being associated with higher severity and 67 variants associated with [≤]0.5 times the odds of severity. The median frequency of associated variants was 0.15% (interquartile range 0.09%-0.45%). Altogether 85% of genomes had at least one variant associated with patient outcome. Conclusion: Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have two-fold or greater association with odds of mild or severe outcome and collectively, these variants are common. In addition to comprehensive mitigation efforts, public health measures should be prioritized to control the more severe manifestations of COVID-19 and the transmission chains linked to these severe cases.","Voss, J.

Many studies successfully applied machine learning to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no comprehensive survey with bibliometric analysis has been conducted yet on the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to bridge this gap by carrying out an in-depth survey with bibliometric analysis on the adoption of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective, including an extensive systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. METHODS: We applied a literature survey methodology to retrieved data from academic databases and subsequently employed a bibliometric technique to analyze the accessed records. Besides, the concise summary, sources of COVID-19 datasets, taxonomy, synthesis and analysis are presented in this study. It was found that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is mainly utilized in developing COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis tools, mostly from chest X-ray and chest CT scan images. Similarly, in this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis of machine learning-based COVID-19 related publications in the Scopus and Web of Science citation indexes. Finally, we propose a new perspective for solving the challenges identified as direction for future research. We believe the survey with bibliometric analysis can help researchers easily detect areas that require further development and identify potential collaborators. RESULTS: The findings of the analysis presented in this article reveal that machine learning-based COVID-19 diagnose tools received the most considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, the analyses of results show that energy and resources are more dispenses towards COVID-19 automated diagnose tools while COVID-19 drugs and vaccine development remains grossly underexploited. Besides, the machine learning-based algorithm that is predominantly utilized by researchers in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan images. CONCLUSIONS: The challenges hindering practical work on the application of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 and new perspective to solve the identified problems are presented in this article. Furthermore, we believed that the presented survey with bibliometric analysis could make it easier for researchers to identify areas that need further development and possibly identify potential collaborators at author, country and institutional level, with the overall aim of furthering research in the focused area of machine learning application to disease control.","Chiroma, Haruna; Ezugwu, Absalom E.; Jauro, Fatsuma; Al-Garadi, Mohammed A.; Abdullahi, Idris N.; Shuib, Liyana",PeerJ Comput Sci,481,16

We combined individual clinical risk predictions with epidemic modelling to examine simulations of isolation and exit policies. Methods: We developed a method to include personalised risk predictions in epidemic models based on data science principles. We extended a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to account for predictions of severity, defined by the risk of an individual needing intensive care in case of infection. We studied example isolation policies using simulations with the risk-extended epidemic model, using COVID-19 data and estimates in France as of mid April 2020 (4 000 patients in ICU, around 7 250 total ICU beds occupied at the peak of the outbreak, 0.5% percent of patients requiring ICU upon infection). We considered scenarios varying in the discrimination performance of a risk prediction model, in the degree of social distancing, and in the severity rate upon infection. Confidence intervals were obtained using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. The framework may be used with other epidemic models, with other risk predictions, and for other epidemic outbreaks. Findings: Based on the data for France as of mid April 2020, simulations indicated that an exit policy considering clinical risk predictions starting on May 11, as planned by the government, could enable to immediately relax restrictions for an extra 10% (6 700 000 people) or more of the lowest-risk population, and consequently relax the restrictions on the remaining population up to two times (or several months) faster, with only a small proportion of the population remaining in isolation for an extended period of time -- while abiding to the current ICU capacity. In contrast, implementing the same exit policy without risk predictions would exceed the ICU capacity by a multiple. Sensitivity analyses showed that when the assumed percentage of severe patients among the population decreased, or the prediction model discrimination improved, or ICU capacity increased, policies based on risk models had a greater impact on the results of epidemic simulations. At the same time, sensitivity analyses also showed that differential isolation policies require that higher risk individuals comply with recommended restrictions. In general, our simulations showed that risk prediction models could always improve policy effectiveness, keeping everything else constant, in line with value of information arguments, even for models with moderate discrimination power. Interpretation: Clinical risk prediction models should be considered to manage outbreaks using a framework as the one developed. They can inform personalised isolation policies, for example by gradually restricting (relaxing) isolation from the highest (lowest) to the lowest (highest) predicted risk individuals, when such policies are considered. This may lead to both safer and faster outcomes than what can be achieved without such prediction models. They enable personalisation of policies, which are known to improve effectiveness in other non-healthcare contexts.","Evgeniou, T.; Fekom, M.; Ovchinnikov, A.; Porcher, R.; Pouchol, C.; Vayatis, N.",,481,16

Here, we developed a recombinant type 5 adenovirus vector encoding the gene for the SARS‐CoV‐2 S1 subunit antigen (Ad5.SARS‐CoV‐2‐S1) for COVID‐19 immunization and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice. A single immunization with Ad5.SARS‐CoV‐2‐S1 via S.C. injection or I.N delivery induced robust antibody and cellular immune responses. Vaccination elicited significant S1‐specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a endpoint titers as early as 2 weeks, and the induced antibodies were long lasting. I.N. and S.C. administration of Ad5.SARS‐CoV‐2‐S1 produced S1‐specific GC B cells in cervical and axillary LNs, respectively. Moreover, I.N. and S.C. immunization evoked significantly greater antigen‐specific T‐cell responses compared to unimmunized control groups with indications that S.C. injection was more effective than I.N. delivery in eliciting cellular immune responses. Mice vaccinated by either route demonstrated significantly increased virus‐specific neutralization antibodies on weeks 8 and 12 compared to control groups, as well as BM antibody forming cells (AFC), indicative of long‐term immunity. Thus, this Ad5‐vectored SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine candidate showed promising immunogenicity following delivery to mice by S.C. and I.N. routes of administration, supporting the further development of Ad‐based vaccines against COVID‐19 and other infectious diseases for sustainable global immunization programs.","Kim, Eun; Weisel, Florian J.; Balmert, Stephen C.; Khan, Muhammad S.; Huang, Shaohua; Erdos, Geza; Kenniston, Thomas W.; Carey, Cara Donahue; Joachim, Stephen M.; Conter, Laura J.; Weisel, Nadine M.; Okba, Nisreen M.

Thirty-five school aged children with at least three months of weightlifting experience were randomized to one of three training conditions: VF-PA, VF or the Control group (CONT). Subjects underwent test sessions one week before (T0) and one day after (T1) a six-session training period and a retention test session a week later (T2). During each test session, the Kinovea version 0.8.15 software measured the kinematic parameters of the snatch performance. Following distance learning sessions (T1), the VF-PA improved various kinematic parameters (i.e., barbell horizontal displacements, maximum height, looping and symmetry) compared with T0 (p < 0.5; Cohen’s d = 0.58–1.1). Most of these improvements were maintained during the retention test (T2) (p<0.01, Cohen’s d = 1.2–1.3) when compared withT0. However, the VF group improved only twoparameters (i.e., barbell symmetry and horizontal displacement) at T1 (p < 0.05; Cohen’s d = 0.9), which were not maintained at T2. Better horizontal displacement and looping values were registered during the retention test in the VF-PA group compared with theCONT group (p < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 1.49–1.52).

However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor airflow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airflow-induced infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow–aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely reported incident. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the need for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.","Liu, Han; He, Sida; Shen, Lian; Hong, Jiarong",Phys Fluids (1994),481,16

However, the clinical relevance of picornavirus detection by PCR is unclear. Immunofluorescence (IF), widely used to detect other respiratory viruses, has recently been introduced as a promising detection method for respiratory picornaviruses. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical manifestations of respiratory picornavirus infections detected by IF with those of respiratory picornavirus infections detected by xTAG multiplex PCR in hospitalized children. STUDY DESIGN: During a 1-year period, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from all children hospitalized due to an acute respiratory infection were prospectively analyzed by IF. All respiratory picornavirus positive IF samples and 100 IF negative samples were further tested with xTAG multiplex PCR. After exclusion of children with co-morbidities and viral co-infections, monoinfections with respiratory picornaviruses were detected in 108 NPA of 108 otherwise healthy children by IF and/or PCR. We compared group 1 children (IF and PCR positive, n = 84) with group 2 children (IF negative and PCR positive, n = 24) with regard to clinical manifestations of the infection. RESULTS: Wheezy bronchitis was diagnosed more often in group 1 than in group 2 (71% vs. 46%, p = 0.028). In contrast, group 2 patients were diagnosed more frequently with pneumonia (17% vs. 6%, p = 0.014) accompanied by higher levels of C-reactive protein (46 mg/l vs. 11 mg/l, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Picornavirus detection by IF in children with acute respiratory infection is associated with the clinical presentation of wheezy bronchitis. The finding of a more frequent diagnosis of pneumonia in picornavirus PCR positive but IF negative children warrants further investigation.","Schindera, Christina; Kraemer, Ann Lea; Regamey, Nicolas; Aebi, Christoph; Gorgievski-Hrisoho, Meri; Barbani, Maria Teresa",J Clin Virol,481,1

The results show contamination of clean water sources, and community drinking water is vulnerable. Additionally, there is evidence that sputum, feces, and urine contain SARS-CoV-2, which can maintain its viability in sewage and the urban-rural water cycle to move towards seawater or freshwater; thus, the risk associated with contracting COVID-19 from contact with untreated water or inadequately treated wastewater is high. Moreover, viral loads have been detected in surface water, although the risk is lower for countries that efficiently treat their wastewater. Further investigation is immediately required to determine the persistence and mobility of SARS-CoV-2 in polluted water and sewage as well as the possible potential of disease transmission via drinking water. Conventional wastewater treatment systems have been shown to be effective in removing the virus, which plays an important role in pandemic control. Monitoring of this virus in water is extremely important as it can provide information on the prevalence and distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in different communities as well as possible infection dynamics to prevent future outbreaks.","Girón-Navarro, Rocío; Linares-Hernández, Ivonne; Castillo-Suárez, Luis Antonio",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,481,16

A major opportunity to reduce emissions is to improve building construction, and in particular the effectiveness of building envelope, which leads to a decrease in operational energy consumption. Improving the performance of a building's thermal envelope can substantially reduce energy consumption from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning while maintaining occupant comfort. In previous work, a computational model of a biomimetic building façade design was found to be effective in temperate climates in an office context. Through a case study example based on animal fur and blood perfusion, this paper tests the hypothesis that biomimetic building facades have a broader application in different building typologies across a range of climate zones. Using bioinspiration for innovation opens new ideas and pathways for technological development that traditional engineering design does not provide. This study exemplifies the process in a building façade, integrating a new form of insulation, heating and cooling. Methods of mathematical modelling and digital simulation methods were used to test the energy reduction potential of the biomimetic façade was tested in a set of operational applications (office, school, and aged care) and across different climate zones (tropical, desert, temperate, and cool continental). Results indicated that the biomimetic façade has potential to reduce energy consumption for all building applications, with the greatest benefit shown in residential aged care (67.1% reduction). Similarly, the biomimetic building façade showed potential to reduce operational services energy consumption in all climate zones, with the greatest energy reductions achieved in the tropical (55.4% reduction) and humid continental climates (55.1% reduction). Through these results the hypothesis was confirmed suggesting that facades engineered to mimic biological functions and processes can improve substantially decrease building operational energy consumption and can be applied in different building classifications and different climate zones. These results would significantly decrease operational greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetime of a building and provide substantial savings in energy bills. Such facades can contribute to the further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in a broad range of contexts in the built environment and other areas of technology and design. The flexibility and adaptability of biomimetic facades exemplify how biological strategies and characteristics can augment and improve performance in different environments, since the organisms that inspire innovation are already well-adapted to the conditions on earth.

However, after more than 20 years of construction, problems such as system barriers and information islands have emerged in the digital construction of university systems. In order to solve such problems between the university systems, this paper proposes an easily expandable and configurable open information integration architecture by considering traditional information integration methods and combining with Web service technology. The architecture handles user service invocation information through a service layer, and manages the registration and invocation of services through a service module. The permission module manages user permissions to prevent information leakage and security issues. The data module abstracts data-related services to provide a basis for the deep use of data. And other optional development services are designed to satisfy special requirements for different platforms. The architecture proposed in this paper can integrate different heterogeneous subsystems in colleges and universities, eliminating the problem of system barriers and information islands, and providing specifications for the construction of new applications.","Yang, Dongming; Wang, Daojiang; Zhou, Huan; Wang, Ye; Song, Shubing; Dong, Qiwen",Procedia Computer Science,481,16

Understanding the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of these patients is important toward developing successful treatment strategies. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In a retrospective study design, consecutive patients without baseline comorbidities hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Patients were subdivided into ≤55 and >55 years of age. Predictors of in-hospital mortality or mechanical ventilation were analyzed in this patient population, as well as subgroups. Stable parameters in overall and subgroup models were used to construct a cluster model for phenotyping of patients. Of 1207 COVID-19–positive patients, 157 met the study criteria (80≤55 and 77>55 years of age). Most reliable predictors of outcomes overall and in subgroups were age, initial and follow-up d-dimer, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels. Their predictive cutoff values were used to construct a cluster model that produced 3 main clusters. Cluster 1 was a low-risk cluster and was characterized by younger patients who had low thrombotic and inflammatory features. Cluster 2 was intermediate risk that also consisted of younger population that had moderate level of thrombosis, higher inflammatory cells, and inflammatory markers. Cluster 3 was a high-risk cluster that had the most aggressive thrombotic and inflammatory feature. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy patient population, COVID-19 remains significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. While age remains the most important predictor of in-hospital outcomes, thromboinflammatory interactions are also associated with worse clinical outcomes regardless of age in healthy patients.

Although some antiviral agents were identified and used to inhibit viral replication, the management of cytokine storm is also a critical issue. In this article, we reviewed the literature on drug candidates for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and provided a brief overview of a class of drugs that exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. These molecules mitigated inflammatory cytokine cascades induced by viral infections via Nrf2 activating capacity and might have additional anti-fibrotic and anti-remodeling properties. Besides, their effects on the regulation of scavenger receptors expression by macrophages may offer some benefits to the pulmonary antibacterial defense system after viral infection. The potential roles of these agents assessed on the basis of the pathophysiology of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome were also discussed. Further research is needed to ascertain whether Nrf2 activators are useful in the management of viral pneumonia.","Lin, Chih-Yin; Yao, Chun-An",Infect Drug Resist,481,20

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We based our approach on established rapid review methods, which were incorporated into existing WHO guideline development processes. Guidance was further informed by in-depth discussions of issues related to rapid guideline development with WHO staff (n = 6), who oversee the Organization's response to emergencies. RESULTS: We discuss criteria for considering if a rapid advice guideline is appropriate and feasible and outline the roles of various contributors across the phases of development. Further, we describe the methods and steps involved in performing rapid reviews, which are more fluid and iterative than for a standard guideline process. In general, rapid advice guidelines involve a shorter timeline, narrower scope, and the use of abbreviated methods for the evidence review. CONCLUSION: Important differences exist between developing a standard guideline and a rapid advice guideline. However, the core principles for WHO guidelines apply to rapid advice guidelines including minimizing bias, applying transparent processes and the use of explicit methods.","Garritty, Chantelle M.; Norris, Susan L.; Moher, David",J Clin Epidemiol,481,16

Here, we analyzed the placentas of 31 COVID-19-positive mothers by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. We only detected one case of placental infection, which was associated with intrauterine demise of the fetus. We then isolated and differentiated primary trophoblasts from non-pathological human placentas at term, and exposed them to SARS-CoV-2 virions. Unlike for positive control cells Vero E6, we were not able to detect the virus inside cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts or in the supernatant four days after infection. As a mechanism of defense, we hypothesized that trophoblasts at term do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS, the two main host membrane receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The quantification of these proteins in the placenta during pregnancy confirmed the absence of TMPRSS2 at the surface of the syncytium. Surprisingly, a transiently induced experimental expression of TMPRSS2 did not allow the entry or replication of the virus in differentiated trophoblasts. Altogether, these results underline that trophoblasts are not likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 at term, but the reported case raises concern about preterm infection.","Colson, Arthur; Depoix, Christophe L.; Dessilly, Géraldine; Baldin, Pamela; Danhaive, Olivier; Hubinont, Corinne; Sonveaux, Pierre; Debiève, Frédéric",Am J Pathol,481,16

Understanding policy non-decisions can be assisted by identifying power operating in relevant decision-making spaces, but trade and health research rarely explicitly engages with theories of power. This realist review aimed to synthesize evidence of different forms and mechanisms of power active in trade and health decision-making spaces to understand better why NCD policy non-decisions persist and the implications for future transformative action. We iteratively developed power-based theories explaining how transnational health-harmful commodity corporations (THCCs) utilize the international trade regime to encourage NCD policy non-decisions. To support theory development, we also developed a conceptual framework for analysing power in public health policymaking. We searched six databases and relevant grey literature and extracted, synthesized and mapped the evidence against the proposed theories. One hundred and four studies were included. Findings were presented for three key forms of power. Evidence indicates THCCs attempt to exercise instrumental power by extensive lobbying often via privileged access to trade and health decision-making spaces. When their legitimacy declines, THCCs have attempted to shift decision-making to more favourable international trade legal venues. THCCs benefit from structural power through the institutionalization of their involvement in health and trade agenda-setting processes. In terms of discursive power, THCCs effectively frame trade and health issues in ways that echo and amplify dominant neoliberal ideas. These processes may further entrench the individualization of NCDs, restrict conceivable policy solutions and perpetuate policymaking norms that privilege economic/trade interests over health. This review identifies different forms and mechanisms of power active in trade and health policy spaces that enable THCCs to prevent progressive action on NCDs. It also points to potential strategies for challenging these power dynamics and relations.","Milsom, Penelope; Smith, Richard; Baker, Phillip; Walls, Helen",Health Policy Plan,481,16

Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22500 - 23000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S may be connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population. Our predictions indicate that the 5 end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated complexes. We propose that these proteins, also implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication.","Vandelli, Andrea; Monti, Michele; Milanetti, Edoardo; Armaos, Alex; Rupert, Jakob; Zacco, Elsa; Bechara, Elias; Ponti, Riccardo Delli; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano",bioRxiv,481,20

To identify human genetic susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 102 A(H7N9) patients and 106 heavily-exposed healthy poultry workers, a sample size critically restricted by the small number of human A(H7N9) cases. To tackle the stringent significance cutoff of GWAS, we utilized an artificial imputation program SnipSnip to improve the association signals. In single-SNP analysis, one of the top SNPs was rs13057866 of LGALS1. The artificial imputation (AI) identified three non-genotyped causal variants, which can be represented by three anchor/partner SNP pairs rs13057866/rs9622682 (AI P = 1.81 × 10(−7)), rs4820294/rs2899292 (2.13 × 10(−7)) and rs62236673/rs2899292 (4.25 × 10(−7)) respectively. Haplotype analysis of rs4820294 and rs2899292 could simulate the signal of a causal variant. The rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG, in association with protection from A(H7N9) infection (OR = 0.26, P = 5.92 × 10(−7)) correlated to significantly higher levels of LGALS1 mRNA (P = 0.050) and protein expression (P = 0.025) in lymphoblast cell lines. Additionally, rs4820294 was mapped as an eQTL in human primary monocytes and lung tissues.

The unprecedented restrictions on mobility have imposed in the form of isolation, quarantines, and lockdowns to curb the profound effects of the pandemic and retain physical health. This study examined the relationship between various pain levels, demographic variables and patient satisfaction with COVID-19 during isolation. METHODS: The primary data in this study were collected from isolated patients during their isolation and treatment in a public hospital. We obtained information from patients with COVID-19 (N = 100) about their demographic characteristics, varying levels of pain, and satisfaction with the services provided during the isolation period. We computed the descriptive statistics to explain the profile of participants, ANOVA was used to find out the difference between various groups on patient satisfaction, and structural equation modeling was performed to examine the link between pain levels, demographic factors, and patient satisfaction. This analysis was performed with STATA and SmartPLS-3. RESULTS: The findings of this study ascertained that respondent’s education (Beta, β = 2.961, p = 0.003), assets such as possession of a house (β = 4.563, p = 0.000), perception of income adequacy during the lockdown (=2.299, p = 0.022), and negligence in prevention (β = 1.975, p = 0.049) significantly affects patient satisfaction during the isolation period. Moreover, satisfaction with life, physicians and medicine, income adequacy, and fear of the participants was significantly linked to the pain level (Model F-stat = 86.323, p = 0.0001). Patients who were satisfied with their treatment had significantly lower odds of having pain (OR 0.023, 95% CI [0.001–0.0452]). Patients who had enough income to meet their basic necessities were found to have significantly lower odds of having pain (OR 0.155, 95% CI [0.032–0.740]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We conclude that a higher level of education, low income, and living in a rented house contributes significantly to the feeling of more satisfaction with the provided services. This implies that people with more affluent backgrounds are less likely to be satisfied with the provided services as low-income and living in rented house groups are more satisfied during isolation than others. The pain level is also affected by subjective factors such as fear and satisfaction which need to be considered while doing patient management. This study can be helpful in improving the delivery of public services of isolation centers by considering various characteristics and demographic factors of patients.","Haq, Wajiha; Irfan, Siddrah; Raza, Syed Hassan; Ahmed, Waqar; Alam, Mian; Wasif, Samia; Malik, Muhammad Wasif; Ahmad, Saeed",PeerJ,481,5

This cohort is comprised of young healthy adults, ages 18-26, with a high rate of asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms, and therefore differs from previously reported longitudinal studies on humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, which often focus on more diverse age populations and worse clinical presentation. 80.9% (119/147) of the participants presented with circulating IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) at 6 weeks PO, of whom 97.3% (111/114) remained positive, with significantly decreased levels, at 10 weeks PO. Neutralizing activity was detected in all sera from SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive participants tested (n=38) at 6 and 10 weeks PO, without significant loss between time points. IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, S2, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, as well neutralization activity, were generally comparable between those participants that had asymptomatic infection or mild disease. A multiplex assay including S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and related zoonotic and human endemic betacoronaviruses revealed a positive correlation for polyclonal cross-reactivity to S after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While other terms to describe these events have been proposed there is no consensus on terminology which has led to multiple terms being used across the UK. Respiratory nurses are part of a multi-disciplinary team managing COPD patients, however, the nursing perspective on the term ‘exacerbation’ is unknown. METHODS: An anonymised survey of 17 questions was sent to respiratory nurses through an email invitation link. The survey link was open for one month. The aim was to understand the nurse perspective on ‘exacerbation’. Alternative terms used in the UK were compared versus the term 'exacerbation’. RESULTS: Responses were received from 113 nurses. The majority (88%) were female. There was no consensus on preference or meaning for the term ‘exacerbation’ between nurses. Less than 5% of nurses thought that patients with COPD would understand the term ‘exacerbation’. In ranked order, the nurses preferred the following terms: ‘flare-up’, ‘lung attack’, ‘crisis’, ‘exacerbation’ and ‘chest infection’. The term ‘crisis’, although new, was considered to be the term that most resonated with clinical practice.

Adopting an ego–network perspective, we study support Italian elders provide to kin or non–kin. More specifically, using Italian survey data, we build the ego–centered networks of social contacts elders entertain and the ego–networks of support elders provide to other non–cohabitant kin or non–kin. Since ego–network data are inherently multilevel, we use Bayesian multilevel models to analyze variation in support ties, controlling for the characteristics of elders and their contacts. This modeling strategy enables dealing with sparseness and alter–alter overlap in the ego support network data and to disentangle the effects related to the ego (the elder), the dyad ego–alter, the kind of support provided, as well as social contacts and contextual variables. The results suggest that the elderly in Italy who provide support outside their household — compared to all elders in the sample — are younger, healthier, more educated, and embedded in a more diversified ego–network of social contacts. The latter also conveys both the type and the recipient of the support, with the elderly who entertain few relationships with kin being more prone to provide aid to non–kin. Further, a “peer homophily” effect in directing elder support to a non–kin is also found.","Pelle, Elvira; Zaccarin, Susanna; Furfaro, Emanuela; Rivellini, Giulia",Stat Methods Appt,481,24

The Japanese government focused on mitigating the emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases continued to appear until early April 2020, many with unclear infection routes and no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from the COVID-19 cases that appeared until early April 2020 and to characterize their genealogical networks in order to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February 2020 in Japan descended directly from the Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates from China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that the COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have created an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. In conclusion, genome surveillance has suggested that there were at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Japan from China and other countries. IMPORTANCE This study aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases and to characterize their genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan.

Many gastrointestinal congenital anomalies are fatal without timely access to neonatal surgical care, but few studies have been done on these conditions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We compared outcomes of the seven most common gastrointestinal congenital anomalies in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries globally, and identified factors associated with mortality. METHODS: We did a multicentre, international prospective cohort study of patients younger than 16 years, presenting to hospital for the first time with oesophageal atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intestinal atresia, gastroschisis, exomphalos, anorectal malformation, and Hirschsprung's disease. Recruitment was of consecutive patients for a minimum of 1 month between October, 2018, and April, 2019. We collected data on patient demographics, clinical status, interventions, and outcomes using the REDCap platform. Patients were followed up for 30 days after primary intervention, or 30 days after admission if they did not receive an intervention. The primary outcome was all-cause, in-hospital mortality for all conditions combined and each condition individually, stratified by country income status. We did a complete case analysis. FINDINGS: We included 3849 patients with 3975 study conditions (560 with oesophageal atresia, 448 with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 681 with intestinal atresia, 453 with gastroschisis, 325 with exomphalos, 991 with anorectal malformation, and 517 with Hirschsprung's disease) from 264 hospitals (89 in high-income countries, 166 in middle-income countries, and nine in low-income countries) in 74 countries. Of the 3849 patients, 2231 (58·0%) were male. Median gestational age at birth was 38 weeks (IQR 36–39) and median bodyweight at presentation was 2·8 kg (2·3–3·3). Mortality among all patients was 37 (39·8%) of 93 in low-income countries, 583 (20·4%) of 2860 in middle-income countries, and 50 (5·6%) of 896 in high-income countries (p<0·0001 between all country income groups). Gastroschisis had the greatest difference in mortality between country income strata (nine [90·0%] of ten in low-income countries, 97 [31·9%] of 304 in middle-income countries, and two [1·4%] of 139 in high-income countries; p≤0·0001 between all country income groups). Factors significantly associated with higher mortality for all patients combined included country income status (low-income vs high-income countries, risk ratio 2·78 [95% CI 1·88–4·11], p<0·0001; middle-income vs high-income countries, 2·11 [1·59–2·79], p<0·0001), sepsis at presentation (1·20 [1·04–1·40], p=0·016), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score at primary intervention (ASA 4–5 vs ASA 1–2, 1·82 [1·40–2·35], p<0·0001; ASA 3 vs ASA 1–2, 1·58, [1·30–1·92], p<0·0001]), surgical safety checklist not used (1·39 [1·02–1·90], p=0·035), and ventilation or parenteral nutrition unavailable when needed (ventilation 1·96, [1·41–2·71], p=0·0001; parenteral nutrition 1·35, [1·05–1·74], p=0·018). Administration of parenteral nutrition (0·61, [0·47–0·79], p=0·0002) and use of a peripherally inserted central catheter (0·65 [0·50–0·86], p=0·0024) or percutaneous central line (0·69 [0·48–1·00], p=0·049) were associated with lower mortality. INTERPRETATION: Unacceptable differences in mortality exist for gastrointestinal congenital anomalies between low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. Improving access to quality neonatal surgical care in LMICs will be vital to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 of ending preventable deaths in neonates and children younger than 5 years by 2030.

There are currently no antiviral therapies approved for the treatment or prevention of mild to moderate COVID-19 as remdesivir is only approved for severe COVID-19 cases. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of a Propylamylatin formula, which is a mixture of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates. The Propylamylatin formula was investigated in gaseous and liquid phases against 1 mL viral suspensions containing 10(5) PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Viral suspensions were sampled at various times post-exposure and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Propylamylatin formula vapors were effective at inactivating infectious SARS-CoV-2 to undetectable levels at room temperature and body temperature, but the decline in virus was substantially faster at the higher temperature (15 min versus 24 h). The direct injection of liquid Propylamylatin formula into viral suspensions also completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and the rapidity of inactivation occurred in an exposure dependent manner. The overall volume that resulted in 90% viral inactivation over the course of the direct injection experiment (EC(90)) was 4.28 µls. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the antiviral effect was attributed to the propionic acid which yielded an overall EC(90) value of 11.50 µls whereas the isoamyl hexanoates provided at most a 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. The combination of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates was much more potent than the individual components alone, suggesting synergy between these components. These findings illustrate the therapeutic promise of the Propylamylatin formula as a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 and future studies are warranted.","Brown, Ashley N.; Strobel, Gary; Hanrahan, Kaley C.; Sears, Joe",Viruses,481,30

However, the myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccine has been reported recently in adolescents and young adults. This study was performed to answer the urgent questions about the basic epidemiology and clinical course of myocarditis/pericarditis in hospitalized patients prior to the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in pediatric population. METHODS: A retrospective medical record analysis including frequency, clinical characteristics, etiology and outcome of myocarditis/pericarditis was conducted in 17 years and younger patients who were hospitalized in two referral hospitals in Korea between 2010 and 2019. RESULTS: Total 142 patients with myocarditis (n = 119) and/or pericarditis (n = 23) were identified. Median age was 5.4 years (interquartile range, 0.6–12.9 years; range, 11 days–17.8 years), and male was 61%. In adolescents aged 12–17 years, the male to female ratio was 3.2. Myocarditis/pericarditis occurred 0.70 per 1,000 in-patients during the study period: 0.96 (< 1 year), 0.50 (1–5 years), 0.67 (6–11 years) and 1.22 (12–17 years) per 1,000 in-patients, respectively. There was an increasing tendency for the annual frequency from 0.34 in 2010 to 1.25 per 1,000 in-patients in 2019 (P = 0.021). Among the 56 (40%) proven pathogens at admission, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 11, 8%) and enterovirus (n = 10, 7%) were most common. Of the 142 patients, 99 (70%) required pediatric intensive care unit care and 10 (7%) received heart transplantation. In addition, 61 patients (61/131, 47%) without heart medication at admission needed heart medication when they were discharged. Eleven (7.7%) patients died, of which five patients were previously healthy. The median age of deceased patients was lower than the survival group (0.8 vs. 6.3 years, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The frequency of myocarditis/pericarditis was highest among male adolescent in-patients; however, the outcome was favorable in this group without any mortality.","Park, Hwanhee; Yun, Ki Wook; Kim, Kyung-Ran; Song, Seung Ha; Ahn, Bin; Kim, Doo Ri; Kim, Gi Beom; Huh, June; Choi, Eun Hwa; Kim, Yae-Jean",J Korean Med Sci,481,16

To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in Yunnan province, China during 2009–2016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung tissues of bats. This study highlights the importance of virus surveillance in natural reservoirs and emphasizes the need for preparedness against the potential spill-over of these viruses to local residents living near bat caves.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of severe, critically ill adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. All vital parameters were recorded in real time for all patients. Moreover, the results of chest computed tomography (CT), when available, were analyzed. RESULTS: PP was applied in 21 patients who were breathing spontaneously. The application of PP was associated with a significant increase in oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) from 82%±12% to 96%±3% (P<0.001) 1 hour later. Moreover, PP was associated with a significant reduction in respiratory rate from 31±10 to 21±4 breaths/min (P<0.001). Furthermore, the number of patients who exhibited signs of respiratory distress after PP was reduced from 10 (47%) to 3 (14%) (P=0.04). Early PP application also led to a clear improvement on CT imaging. It was not, however, associated with a reduction in mortality rate or in the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (P>0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the early application of PP can improve hypoxemia and tachypnea in COVID-19 patients with spontaneous breathing. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of PP in COVID-19 patients with spontaneous breathing.","Bahloul, Mabrouk; Kharrat, Sana; Hafdhi, Malek; Maalla, Anis; Turki, Olfa; Chtara, Kamilia; Ammar, Rania; Suissi, Basma; Hamida, Chokri Ben; Chelly, Hedi; Mahfoudh, Khaiereddine Ben; Bouaziz, Mounir",Acute Crit Care,481,16

The number of collisions registered during these two periods was also compared to those registered in the equivalent weeks of 2018–2019. During lockdown, the number of traffic accidents fell by 74% compared to the period before lockdown and by 76% with respect to the equivalent period in 2018–2019. This reduction of accidents has been higher than the decrease of mobility during that period (55%). This suggests a multiplicative positive effect of traffic reduction on roads safety.

Previous studies reveal that individuals who experienced child abuse (CA), especially those who suffer from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), are at a higher risk of reacting with fear and stress when faced with stressful life-events. OBJECTIVE: To test whether exposure to CA is implicated in a higher risk of COVID-19-related fear and acute stress, and whether CPTSD intervenes in such processes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A convenience sample of 837 adults participated in the study during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel. METHODS: Participants completed self-report questionnaires, assessing child physical, sexual and emotional abuse, CPTSD (ITQ), COVID-19-related acute stress disorder (COVID-19 ASD; ASDS) and fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that participants who experienced CA were higher than participants who did not experience CA in COVID-19 ASD (p = .032), but not in fear of COVID-19 (p = .65). Mediation analyses demonstrated two significant paths: in the first, CA was associated with elevated fear of COVID-19 (effect = .061, .059; p < 0.05) and COVID-19 ASD (effect = .14, .084; p < 0.05) through the mediation of CPTSD; in the second path, when controlling for the mediation of CPTSD, CA was associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 (effect = −.15; p = 0.001), and COVID-19 ASD (effect = −.12; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a complex pattern, indicating that CPTSD may be a risk factor for elevated levels of COVID-19 distress among individuals who experienced CA.

The energy monitoring and control architecture of the proposed system consists of four main parts; 1) Low-cost energy meter for real-time data acquisition for multiple renewable energy sources (Solar PV, Biomass), VRFB storage, grid and loads. 2) Monitoring, control & fault detection using Raspberry-Pi (Single Board Computer) platform and MODBUS over TCP/IP platform. 3) Cloud-based remote monitoring unit (RMU) using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server and ThingSpeak Middleware. 4) Capacity measurement of biogas production along with automatic start/stop control of biogas engine-generator. 5) VRFB storage scheduling for peak demand shaving. A PSCAD simulation study has been done to realize the hybrid microgrid interconnection. The developed smart communication system performance is validated by a practical 10kW(P) solar PV, 15kVA biogas plant, 6 kWh VRFB storage integrated hybrid microgrid which satisfies peak demand management and ensures zero loss of power supply probability for dynamic load profile. Four real-life case studies have been done for the practical realization of the proposed energy management algorithm performance. Another significant contribution of this paper is the utilization of the solar PV power even during grid outage scenario at day time. It is made possible by intelligent interfacing of biogas power generator which acts as a reference AC bus for the grid-tied solar inverter and thus the available solar PV power can be used to serve the critical loads during grid outage condition. The proposed smart hybrid microgrid solution claims to be a generalized one, low cost compared to existing alternatives and applicable to satisfy scalable community energy security as well.","Samanta, Hiranmay; Bhattacharjee, Ankur; Pramanik, Moumita; Das, Abhijit; Bhattacharya, Konika Das; Saha, Hiranmay",J Energy Storage,481,24

The scientific community is fighting against time for the production of a vaccine, but it is difficult to place a safe and effective product on the market as fast as the virus is spreading. Similarly, for drugs that can directly interfere with viral pathways, their production times are long, despite the great efforts made. For these reasons, we analyzed the possible role of non-pharmacological substances such as supplements, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in reducing the risk of Sars-CoV-2 infection or mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19. These substances could have numerous advantages in the current circumstances, are generally easily available, and have negligible side effects if administered at the already used and tested dosages. Large scientific evidence supports the benefits that some bacterial and molecular products may exert on the immune response to respiratory viruses. These could also have a regulatory role in systemic inflammation or endothelial damage, which are two crucial aspects of COVID-19.

In all cases, G614 Spike pseudovirions were moderately more susceptible to neutralization, indicating this is not an escape mutation that would impede current vaccines. Rather, the gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies.","Weissman, D.; Alameh, M.-G.; LaBranche, C. C.; Edwards, R.

Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. Research Design and Methods This observational cohort study included all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020 and followed till May 15, 2020. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and the studied predictor was hyperglycaemia [any blood glucose ≥ 7.78 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) during hospitalization]. Results Of the 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 51 (12.7%) died; 335 (83.1%) were discharged while 17 (4%) were still in hospital. Hyperglycaemia occurred in 228 (56.6%) patients; 83 of these hyperglycaemic patients (36.4%) had no prior history of diabetes. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes / no-hyperglycaemia patients the no-diabetes / hyperglycaemia patients showed higher mortality [1.8% versus 20.5%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), P < 0.001]; improved prediction of death (P = 0.01) and faster progression to death (P < 0.01). Hyperglycaemia within the first 24 and 48 hours was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). Conclusions Hyperglycaemia without prior diabetes was common (20.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of progressive disease.","Mamtani, M.; Athavale, A. M.; Abraham, M.; Vernik, J.; Amarah, A.

We describe a compassionate use program that offered this therapy to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: NaIHS (50 mg ibuprofen, tid) was provided in addition to standard of care (SOC) to hospitalized COVID-19 patients until oxygen saturation levels of > 94% were achieved on ambient air. Patients wore a containment hood to diminish aerosolization. Outcome data from participating patients treated at multiple hospitals in Argentina between April 4 and October 31, 2020, are summarized. Results were compared with a retrospective contemporaneous control (CC) group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SOC alone during the same time frame from a subset of participating hospitals from Córdoba and Buenos Aires. RESULTS: The evolution of 383 patients treated with SOC + NaIHS [56 on mechanical ventilation (MV) at baseline] and 195 CC (21 on MV at baseline) are summarized. At baseline, NaIHS-treated patients had basal oxygen saturation of 90.7 ± 0.2% (74.3% were on supplemental oxygen at baseline) and a basal respiratory rate of 22.7 ± 0.3 breath/min. In the CC group, basal oxygen saturation was 92.6 ± 0.4% (52.1% were on oxygen supplementation at baseline) and respiratory rate was 19.3 ± 0.3 breath/min. Despite greater pulmonary compromise at baseline in the NaIHS-treated group, the length of treatment (LOT) was 9.1 ± 0.2 gs with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 11.5 ± 0.3 days, in comparison with an ALOS of 13.3 ± 0.9 days in the CC group. In patients on MV who received NaIHS, the ALOS was lower than in the CC group. In both NaIHS-treated groups, a rapid reversal of deterioration in oxygenation and NEWS2 scores was observed acutely after initiation of NaIHS therapy. No serious adverse events were considered related to ibuprofen therapy. Mortality was lower in both NaIHS groups compared with CC groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of COVID-19 pneumonitis with inhalational nebulized NaIHS was associated with rapid improvement in hypoxia and vital signs, with no serious adverse events attributed to therapy.

METHODS: Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of selected potential cases were assessed through serum blood specimens, medical record reviews, and interviews with surviving outbreak members, household contacts, and healthcare personnel. Cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified using 3 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention serologic tests for detection of anti–MERS-CoV antibodies. RESULTS: Specimens and interviews were obtained from 124 subjects. Seven previously unconfirmed individuals tested positive for anti–MERS-CoV antibodies by at least 2 of 3 serologic tests, in addition to 2 fatal cases identified by rRT-PCR. The case-fatality rate among the 9 total cases was 22%. Six subjects were healthcare workers at the outbreak hospital, yielding an attack rate of 10% among potentially exposed outbreak hospital personnel. There was no evidence of MERS-CoV transmission at 2 transfer hospitals having acceptable infection control practices. CONCLUSIONS: Novel serologic tests allowed for the detection of otherwise unrecognized cases of MERS-CoV infection among contacts in a Jordanian hospital-associated respiratory illness outbreak in April 2012, resulting in a total of 9 test-positive cases. Serologic results suggest that further spread of this outbreak to transfer hospitals did not occur. Most subjects had no major, underlying medical conditions; none were on hemodialysis. Our observed case-fatality rate was lower than has been reported from outbreaks elsewhere.","Al-Abdallat, Mohammad Mousa; Payne, Daniel C.; Alqasrawi, Sultan; Rha, Brian; Tohme, Rania A.; Abedi, Glen R.; Nsour, Mohannad Al; Iblan, Ibrahim; Jarour, Najwa; Farag, Noha H.; Haddadin, Aktham; Al-Sanouri, Tarek; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Kuhar, David T.; Swerdlow, David L.; Erdman, Dean D.; Pallansch, Mark A.; Haynes, Lia M.; Gerber, Susan I.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,481,24

One of the obligations of the Romanian land owners and farmers is to avoid the installation of unwanted vegetation on their land plots. This vegetation is represented by some species of herbaceous or woody plants, annual or perennial, that spontaneously invade the agricultural lands, diminishing the production capacity of the cultivated plants. Included in this category are 10 meadow weeds, without fodder value or even toxic to animals: Arctium lappa L., Carduus nutans L., Conium maculatum L., Eryngium campestre L., Euphorbia cyparissias L., Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Rumex acetosella L., Veratrum album L., Xanthium spinosum L., and Xanthium strumarium L. Various and multiple uses in traditional medicine of these meadow weed species have been reported for Romania and other nine neighboring East European countries, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Kosovo, Russia, Turkey, Serbia, and Ukraine. For A. lappa were recorded the highest number of ethnomedicinal uses, in the largest number of East European countries, including Romania. C. maculatum and V. album are not recommended for human consumption but can be further investigated as potential sources of pharmaceutically active compounds. Once removed by landowners and farmers from their land, the raw plant material of these 10 species become readily and easily available to the Romanian local communities and the industry of herbal food supplements, while the biodiversity of the agro-ecosystems is maintained.","Grosu, Elena; Ichim, Mihael Cristin",Front Pharmacol,481,5

Essential oil is reported to exhibit pharmacological properties, besides its common and well-known function as aromatherapy. Therefore, this study herein aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of essential oil extracted from leaves of Garcinia atroviridis (EO-L) against PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line. The cell growth inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC(50)) and selective index (SI) values of EO-L analyses were determined as 78 µg/mL and 1.23, respectively. Combination index (CI) analysis revealed moderate synergism (CI values of 0.36 to 0.75) between EO-L and 2 deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatments. The treatments of PANC-1 cells with EO-L, 2-DG and EOL+2DG showed evidence of depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The molecular mechanism causing the anti-proliferative effect between EO-L and 2-DG is potentially through pronounced up-regulation of P53 (4.40-fold), HIF1α (1.92-fold), HK2 (2.88-fold) and down-regulation of CYP3A5 (0.11-fold), as supported by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Collectively, the current data suggest that the combination of two anti-proliferative agents, EO-L and 2-DG, can potentially be explored as therapeutic treatments and as potentiating agents to conventional therapy against human pancreatic cancer.","Nik Mohamed Kamal, Nik Nur Syazni; Abdul Aziz, Fatin Athirah; Tan, Wen-Nee; Fauzi, Agustine Nengsih; Lim, Vuanghao",Molecules,481,30

From 2006 to 2013, data from cohorts of creative adolescents attending a counseling laboratory supported these results. Clinical findings of increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality among creative students in 2014 led the researchers to create 3 studies to explore these clinical findings. Once artifactual causes of these changes were ruled out, a quantitative study was conducted. Study 1, an analysis of mean differences of pre-2014 and post-2014 cohorts showed that post-2014 cohorts scored significantly higher in Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness and lower in Extraversion on Big 5 inventories. Regression analyses suggested that while Neuroticism was associated with gender, Conscientiousness and Grade Point Average for the earlier group, Neuroticism in the post 2014 groups was related to complex interplay of all personality dynamics except Agreeableness. In the qualitative Study 2, focus groups of 6–10 students, for a total of 102 participants were queried about the reasons they perceived for increased anxiety and depression in creative students. Increased achievement pressures and awareness of environmental and social problems were major sources of external stressors; perfectionism and desire to fulfill expectations of others were the primary sources of internal stress. The authors suggest that creative students' openness to experience and advanced knowledge made it possible for these students to see the potential for environmental and social crises and respond to their inability to solve these problems with anxiety and depression. Study 3 was a qualitative study that followed up 19 participants from the post-2014 cohort to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and creativity. While the majority perceived a negative effect of the pandemic on their mental health, most also produced a surprising variety of creative works during that time. In conclusion, rapid changes in the lives of creative adolescents since 2014 suggest that scholars focus on current cohorts and the ways in which adolescent personality is shaped by internal expectation and external pressures and global events.

The associations between changes in the BPSD of relatives with dementia (RwD) and in their caregivers’ distress, and sense of social and emotional loneliness, and resilience were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five caregivers of RwD attending formal healthcare services before the COVID-19 lockdown volunteered for the study, and were interviewed by phone during the lockdown. Caregivers completed the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess their care recipients’ BPSD and their own distress, and two questionnaires assessing their social and emotional loneliness, and their resilience. RESULTS: No clear changes emerged in either the BPSD of the RwD or the caregivers’ distress during lockdown compared with before the pandemic. Caregivers reporting more frequent and severe BPSD in their RwD before the lockdown scored higher on emotional loneliness. Those reporting more frequent and severe BPSD under lockdown, especially men and those taking care of RwD with more advanced dementia, scored higher on both social and emotional loneliness. A significant negative correlation also emerged between caregivers’ resilience and changes in their level of distress due to the lockdown, with female caregivers reporting greater resilience. DISCUSSION: Our findings offer preliminary insight on the effects of loneliness and resilience, and on the influence of individual characteristics on the experience and consequences of informal caregiving for RwD in times of restrictions imposed by a pandemic.","Carbone, Elena; Palumbo, Rocco; Di Domenico, Alberto; Vettor, Silvia; Pavan, Giorgio; Borella, Erika",Front Aging Neurosci,481,16

Although corticosteroids are recommended for selected COVID-19 patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, there is no consensus regarding patient subgroups, dose, and duration. In this study, it was aimed to examine the contribution of corticosteroid treatment to the management of COVID-19 pneumonia without ARDS, septic shock both in acute and recovery setting. Materials and Methods: The study population was divided into two as those who used corticosteroids during the recovery phase (who did not develop sufficient radiological or clinical improvement) and those who did so during the activation phase (non-ARDS/septic shock condition, clinical, laboratory or radiological progression). Result: We identified 47 patients, 26 of which were males, and mean age was 60.5 ± 16.5 years. Seventeen patients were found to receive corticosteroids during the recovery phase and the rest (n= 30) during the activation period. After corticosteroid therapy, we found reduction of increased pre-treatment levels of D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, CRP, increment of decreased pre-treatment lymphocyte count and saturation. Complete symptomatic improvement was detected in 6.9% and 17.6% of the patients in the activation phase and recovery phase, respectively. Complete radiological improvement was found in 11.5% and 35.3% of the patients in the activation phase and recovery phase, respectively. While corticosteroid treatment was initiated on day 4.2 ± 2.6 and continued for a mean of 5.9 ± 2.8 days in the activation group, it was started on day 8.1 ± 11.3 and administered for 7.8 ± 3.8 days in the recovery group. In both groups, methylprednisolone was given at a median dose of 40 mg/day. Conclusions: Short-term low-dose corticosteroid therapy may improve clinical, radiological, laboratory outcomes in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia during the activation period without ARDS and non-septic shock and during recovery period with no satisfactory response.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are considered effective therapeutic targets of acute lung inflammatory injury. This study aimed to explore the effects of PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib on IAV-induced lung injury and the underlying mechanisms. Male wild-type C57BL/6 mice were intranasally infected with IAV strain H1N1 to mimic pneumonia experimentally. Olaparib at different doses was intraperitoneally injected 2 days before and 5 consecutive days after virus stimulation. On day 6 post-infection, lung tissues as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were sampled for histological and biochemical analyses. Olaparib increased the survival rate of IAV mice dose-dependently. Olaparib remarkably reduced IAV mRNA expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) level, and inflammatory cell infiltration in IAV lungs. Moreover, olaparib significantly reduced the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, and IL-4 and increased IL-10 in IAV lungs. Also, olaparib efficiently reduced IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), TNF-α, chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand (CXCL)1, CXCL10, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand (CCL)3, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) release in IAV BALF. Olaparib decreased PARylated protein content and p65, IκBα phosphorylation in IAV lung tissues. This study successfully constructed the pneumonia murine model using IAV. Olaparib decreased IAV-induced mortality in mice, lung injury, and cytokine production possibly via modulation of PARP-1/NF-κB axis.

However, this is still controversial, which brings challenges to clinical treatment. Here, we reviewed the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), coagulation indexes, and clinical manifestations of a patient with severe COVID-19 after Tocilizumab administration. In this case, the patient’s body temperature quickly dropped to normal after using Tocilizumab, while C reactive protein progressively decreased and stabilized at a lower level. However, IL-6 and D-dimers increased and were accompanied by a continuous decrease of the oxygenation index. After anticoagulant therapy with heparin, D-dimer decreased slowly, gradually improving the oxygenation index and disease remission. This case suggests that the formation of microthrombus might be the main reason for COVID-19-derived hypoxemia. However, the mechanism of hypoxemia and the role of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 need further research.

Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question “How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?” For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity [Formula: see text] of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with [Formula: see text] could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy.

Here, we establish a protein engineering path for how a stable, long-acting drug candidate can be generated out of such a VHH building block. When fused to human IgG1-Fc, the prototype VHH72 molecule prophylactically protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and −2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage. This work led to the selection of XVR011 for clinical development, a highly stable anti-COVID-19 biologic with excellent manufacturability.

Generally manual diagnosis is used for detection of malaria using 100 × to 600 × microscope but time required for this process is very large and false report chances are more, which results in death of a person. A high speed, low cost and result accurate biosensor plays a key role in diagnosis of malaria. When malaria parasite’s infects RBC’s, its mechanical, physical and biochemical structure will get modified results in change of refractive index of RBC. Therefore, refractive index varies from normal RBC to infected RBC. This factor is utilized to design the photonic biosensor for detection of malaria in humans and it is label free detection method. The proposed photonic crystal sensor has 10 µm × 10 µm dimension. The extracted sample is placed in the sensor holes and light beam with a wavelength of 1.85–1.95 µm is fed inside the bio sensor. If the malaria parasites are present then there will be variation in RI from normal sample results in the wavelength shift. FDTD technique is used for the simulation of this model. Quality factor achieved for this design is 214 and the sensitivity for change in refractive index is 225 nm/RIU.","Kumar, B. M. Hemanth; Srikanth, P. C.; Vaibhav, A. M.",Int J Inf Technol,481,23

We employed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis of HEV3 and HEV4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype. The data imply coevolution among ~70% of polymorphic sites from all HEV proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans. BN models for individual proteins and domains of the nonstructural polyprotein detected the host origin of HEV strains with accuracy of 74–93% and 63–87%, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008–16, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies. METHODS: We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008–2016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics. RESULTS: Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports. The highest level of completion was for drawing conclusion in outbreak investigation (98%) and the lowest completion (29%) was for developing a case definition by time, place and person followed by conducting an analytic study (24%). CONCLUSIONS: Outbreak reports from India either lacked application of systematic steps for investigation or failed to report the actual procedures followed. We recommend improving systematic investigation of outbreaks through training and supervision of outbreak response teams and encouraging publications.","Kurup, Karishma K.; John, Denny; Ponnaiah, Manickam; George, Tijo",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,481,16

METHODS: We conducted 290 cervical cancer screening outreach clinics in the MSU. Screening was performed by trained nurses/ health care providers using visual inspection with 5% acetic acid (VIA). Screen positive women when eligible were treated by thermal ablation during the same sitting. Women with large lesions not eligible for treatment with thermal ablation were referred for colposcopy and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 10, 925 women were screened between Nov 2016 and June 2019 in 290 outreach clinics in the MSU. The overall screen positivity was 6.6% (95% CI 6.1, 7.0) with a declining trend over time. A total of 304/717 (42.4%, 95% CI 38.7, 46.1) women received treatment with thermal ablation. About 3.6% (11/304) reported minor side effects and 1.6% (5/304) reported lower abdominal pain and all of them subsided after treatment. Among the 413 women who were advised colposcopy, only 84 (20.33%) women underwent the procedure. Of these 84 women, 64 (76.19%) had normal colposcopy/ histopathology, 7 (8.33%) had CIN1, 2 (2.38%) had CIN 2, 9 (10.71%) had CIN 3 disease and 2 (2.38%) women were diagnosed with invasive cancer.

Time-integrated PM(2.5) filters were collected at a residential site in Milan metropolitan area from April 11th to June 3rd at 2020, encompassing full-lockdown (FL), the followed partial-lockdown (PL2), and full-relaxation (FR) periods of COVID-19 restrictions. The collected filters were analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), individual organic species (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and levoglucosan), and metals. According to online data, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and benzene (C(6)H(6)) levels significantly decreased during the entire COVID-19 period compared to the same time span in 2019, mainly due to the government-backed shutdowns and curtailed road traffic. Similarly, with a few exceptions, surrogates of tailpipe emissions (e.g., traffic-associated PAHs) as well as re-suspended road dust (e.g., Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Ti) were relatively lower during FL and PL2 periods in comparison with year 2019, whereas an increasing trend in mass concentration of mentioned species was observed from FL to PL2 and FR phases due to the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions. In contrast, comparable concentrations of ambient PM(2.5) and black carbon (BC) between lockdown period and the same time span in 2019 were attributed to the interplay between decreased road traffic and elevated domestic biomass burning as a result of adopted stay-home strategies. Finally, the curtailed road traffic during FL and PL2 periods led to ~25% drop in the PM(2.5) oxidative potential (measured via 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) and dithiothreitol (DTT) assays) with respect to the FR period as well as the same time span in 2019. The results of this study provide insights into the changes in components and oxidative potential of PM(2.5) in the absence of road traffic during COVID-19 restrictions.","Altuwayjiri, Abdulmalik; Soleimanian, Ehsan; Moroni, Silvia; Palomba, Paolo; Borgini, Alessandro; De Marco, Cinzia; Ruprecht, Ario A.; Sioutas, Constantinos",Sci Total Environ,481,7

Ces patients présentent une altération du fonctionnement du système immunitaire. Description Nous avons souhaité évaluer la réponse humorale au vaccin à ARN messager par Pfizer chez les patients hémodialysés ainsi que les facteurs y étant associés. Méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude observationnelle monocentrique. Nous avons inclus 58 patients qui avaient reçu les deux injections de Pfizer-BioNTech, avec un intervalle de 21 jours. Une sérologie SARS-CoV-2 a été réalisée le premier jour de la vaccination et un mois après la seconde injection. La technique utilisée au cours de ce test biologique est la technique Abbott quantifiant le nombre d’IgG (immunoglobulines gamma) se fixant à la protéine S (spike) du virus. Le seuil de positivité de la sérologie est 50AU/mL (unités arbitraires par millilitre). Nous avons étudié différentes variables cliniques et biologiques. Résultats La majorité des hémodialysés est capable de produire des anticorps dirigés contre le SARS-CoV-2, puisque 96 % (n =56/58) ont obtenu une sérologie positive. Le taux médian d’IgG est de 1690 (531–3921) UA/mL. D’après la corrélation de Spearman, le taux d’anticorps est significativement associé à l’âge, la normalized catabolic rate (nPCR) et au taux de lymphocytes. Dans le modèle de régression linéaire, une meilleure réponse vaccinale est associée à la nPCR (coefficient bêta: 0.29, 95% CI (0.05, 0.53), p <0.05) et à un taux de lymphocytes élevé (coefficient bêta: 0.61, 95% CI (0.35, 0.87), p <0.0001). Elle est moins bonne chez les femmes (coefficient bêta: –0.39, 95% CI (–0.66, –0.11), p <0.01). Conclusion Les patients hémodialysés sont donc capables d’obtenir une sérologie post-vaccinale positive après vaccination par le vaccin à ARN Pfizer-BioNTech. Un état nutritionnel satisfaisant évalué par la nPCR et un taux élevé de lymphocytes sont associés significativement à une réponse humorale positive.","Jacq, A.; Legendre, M.; Rebibou, J.

SUMMARY: PPE shortages impacted hospitals throughout the nation in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The PPE requirement for sterile compounding and need to maintain supplies within the pharmacy cleanroom are often overlooked. A sustained supply of PPE is critical to ensure an uninterrupted supply of compounded medications to our patient population. Multiple conservation strategies, including staffing changes, communication, adjustments to training, and even reuse of select PPE, can assist with conservation. CONCLUSION: PPE in pharmacy cleanrooms is critical for the continued provision of sterile compounds with appropriate beyond-use dates and effective patient care. Pharmacy departments must employ multiple conservation strategies to ensure PPE is available for continued compounding of sterile products, and early planning and implementation of conservation strategies are key.","Wollitz, Amanda Danielle; Hong, Christine; Blanco, Fernando",Am J Health Syst Pharm,481,14

However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412–419 (epitope I) and 434–446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.","Zhang, Pei; Wu, Charles G.; Mihalik, Kathleen; Virata, Maria Luisa; Yu, Mei-ying W.; Alter, Harvey J.; Feinstone, Stephen M.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,481,22

The contribution of public spaces to the propa- gation of SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced to a level necessary for a declining epidemic, i.e. an overall reproduction rate below one. Here, we revisit the quantitative assessment of indoor and outdoor transmission risk. We show that the long-range aerosol transmission is controlled by the flow rate of fresh air and by the mask filtering quality, and is quantitatively re- lated to the CO2 concentration, regardless the room volume and the num- ber of people. The short-range airborne transmission is investigated ex- perimentally using dedicated dispersion experiments performed in two shopping malls. Exhaled aerosols are dispersed by turbulent draughts in a cone, leading to a concentration inversely proportional to the squared dis- tance and to the flow velocity. We show that the average infection dose, called the viral quantum, can be determined from epidemiological data in a manner consistent with biological experimental data. Practical implications. The results provide quantitative guidance useful for making rational public health policy decisions to prevent the dominant routes of viral transmission through reinforced ventilation, air purification, mechanical dispersion using fans, and incentivizing the wear- ing of correctly fitted, quality facial masks (surgical masks, possibly cov- ered by another fabric mask, or non-medical FFP2 masks).

Higher stress and burnout in health professionals is linked with the delivery of poorer quality, less safe patient care across healthcare settings. In order to understand how we can better support healthcare professionals in the workplace, this study evaluated a tailored resilience coaching intervention comprising a workshop and one-to-one coaching session addressing the intrinsic challenges of healthcare work in health professionals and students. METHODS: The evaluation used an uncontrolled before-and-after design with four data-collection time points: baseline (T1); after the workshop (T2); after the coaching session (T3) and four-to-six weeks post-baseline (T4). Quantitative outcome measures were Confidence in Coping with Adverse Events (‘Confidence’), a Knowledge assessment (‘Knowledge’) and Resilience. At T4, qualitative interviews were also conducted with a subset of participants exploring participant experiences and perceptions of the intervention. RESULTS: We recruited 66 participants, retaining 62 (93.9%) at T2, 47 (71.2%) at T3, and 33 (50%) at T4. Compared with baseline, Confidence was significantly higher post-intervention: T2 (unadj. β = 2.43, 95% CI 2.08–2.79, d = 1.55, p < .001), T3 (unadj. β = 2.81, 95% CI 2.42–3.21, d = 1.71, p < .001) and T4 (unadj. β = 2.75, 95% CI 2.31–3.19, d = 1.52, p < .001). Knowledge increased significantly post-intervention (T2 unadj. β = 1.14, 95% CI 0.82–1.46, d = 0.86, p < .001). Compared with baseline, resilience was also higher post-intervention (T3 unadj. β = 2.77, 95% CI 1.82–3.73, d = 0.90, p < .001 and T4 unadj. β = 2.54, 95% CI 1.45–3.62, d = 0.65, p < .001). The qualitative findings identified four themes. The first addressed the ‘tension between mandatory and voluntary delivery’, suggesting that resilience is a mandatory skillset but it may not be effective to make the training a mandatory requirement. The second, the ‘importance of experience and reference points for learning’, suggested the intervention was more appropriate for qualified staff than students. The third suggested participants valued the ‘peer learning and engagement’ they gained in the interactive group workshop. The fourth, ‘opportunities to tailor learning’, suggested the coaching session was an opportunity to personalise the workshop material. CONCLUSIONS: We found preliminary evidence that the intervention was well received and effective, but further research using a randomised controlled design will be necessary to confirm this.

Objectives: To assess: 1) the association between caregiver's stress and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures. Participants and settings: Caregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (n=466 participants) Methods: We randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village. Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown experiences specifically for this study. Results: Caregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj.

However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study. Caveat is advised in the interpretation of the study findings.","Jeharsae, R.; Jae-noh, M.; Jae-a-lee, H.; Waeteh, S.; Nimu, N.; Chewae, C.; Yama, M.; Dureh, N.; Wichaidit, W.",,481,1

Data were derived from a large US-based case series of patients with COVID-19, captured from a quaternary academic health network covering New York City and Long Island. From March 2 to May 24, 2020, 11,512 patients who were hospitalized were tested for COVID-19, with 4,446 (38.62%) receiving a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Among those who tested positive, 959 (21.57%) died of COVID-19-related complications at the hospital. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling showed mortality risks were strongly associated with greater age (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.04–1.05), ethnic minority (Asians, Non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics) (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10–1.44), low household income (HR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.49), and male sex (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.97). Higher mortality risks were also associated with a history of COPD (HR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.02–1.58), obesity (HR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04–1.37), and peripheral artery disease (HR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05–1.69). Findings indicate patients with COPD had the highest odds of COVID-19 mortality compared with patients with pre-existing metabolic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Sociodemographic factors including increased age, male sex, low household income, ethnic minority status were also independently associated with greater mortality risks.","Girardin, Jean-Louis; Seixas, Azizi; Ramos Cejudo, Jaime; Osorio, Ricardo S; Avirappattu, George; Reid, Marvin; Parthasarathy, Sairam",Chron Respir Dis,481,1

Increasing knowledge about the complex interplay of skin-associated cell types in the development of cutaneous immune responses has fueled efforts to target the skin for vaccination as well as for immunotherapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview on skin layers and their resident immunocompetent cell types. Advantages and shortcomings of standard methods and innovative technologies to circumvent the outermost skin barrier are addressed. Studies employing fractional skin ablation by infrared lasers for cutaneous delivery of drugs, as well as high molecular weight molecules such as protein antigens or antibodies, are reviewed, and laserporation is introduced as a versatile transcutaneous vaccination platform. Specific targeting of the epidermis or the dermis by different laser settings, the resulting kinetics of uptake and transport and the immune response types elicited are discussed, and the potential of this transcutaneous delivery platform for allergen-specific immunotherapy is demonstrated. EXPERT OPINION: Needle-free and painless vaccination approaches have the potential to replace standard methods due to their improved safety and optimal patient compliance. The use of fractional laser devices for stepwise ablation of skin layers might be advantageous for both vaccination against microbial pathogens, as well as immunotherapeutic approaches, such as allergen-specific immunotherapy. Thorough investigation of the underlying immunological mechanisms will help to provide the knowledge for a rational design of transcutaneous protective/therapeutic vaccines.","Scheiblhofer, Sandra; Thalhamer, Josef; Weiss, Richard",Expert Opin Drug Deliv,481,20

Early diagnosis of these cases is a powerful tool to control the pandemic. Our objective was to characterize patients with AC status and identify associated sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design and the national database of daily occurrence of COVID-19, we characterized both socially and demographically all ACs. Additional Correspondence Analysis and Logistic Regression Model were performed to identify characteristics associated with AC state (OR, 95% CI). Results: 2338 ACs (11.8%; 95% CI, 11.3-12.2%) were identified, mainly in epidemiological week 18 [EW] (3.98; 3.24-4.90). Age [â¤]39 years (1.56; 1.42-1.72). Male sex (1.39; 1.26-1.53), cases imported from Argentina, Spain, Peru, Brazil, Costa Rica or Mexico (3.37; 1.47-7.71) and autochthonous cases (4.35 ; 2.12-8.93) increased the risk of identifying AC. We also identified groups of departments with moderate (3.68; 3.13-4.33) and strong (8.31; 6.10-7.46) association with AC. Discussion: Sociodemographic characteristics strongly associated with AC were identified, which may explain its epidemiological relevance and usefulness to optimize mass screening strategies and prevent person-to-person transmission.","Teheran, Anibal A; Camero, Gabriel; Guardia, Ronald Prado de la; Hernandez, Carolina; Herrera, Giovanny; Pombo, Luis M; Avila, Albert; Florez, Carolina; Barros, Esther C; Garcia, Luis Perez; Mondolfi, Alberto Paniz; Ramirez, Juan David",,481,0

The need for speed to understand the virus and develop new vaccines, medicines, and therapies for patients has provided unprecedented learning opportunities and revealed how the pharmaceutical industry can improve upon traditional processes. To stay competitive while remaining compliant with agency regulations and guidance, companies need to implement new process/tools that allow for more flexible work models, consider expanding the use of decentralized/hybrid trials, and capitalize on the use of real-world evidence (RWE) and cloud-based data systems. In addition, regulatory agencies should retain the agility exhibited during current reviews of potential new therapies, applying this momentum to other areas of unmet medical need. Further, agencies should consider a globally acceptable application platform. This article, by the Pharmaceuticals’ Head of Regulatory Affairs at Bayer AG, examines how impacts of the COVID-19 crisis will continue beyond the pandemic period to the benefit of patients, drug developers, regulators, clinicians, and caregivers.","Wegner, Max",Ther Innov Regul Sci,481,10

IFITM1-3 are unique amongst the currently described viral restriction factors in their apparent ability to block viral entry. This restrictive property is dependant on the localisation of the proteins to plasma and endosomal membranes, which constitute the main portals of viral entry into cells. The topology of the IFITM proteins within cell membranes is an unresolved aspect of their biology. Here we present data from immunofluorescence microscopy, protease cleavage, biotin-labelling and immuno-electron microscopy assays, showing that human IFITM1 has a membrane topology in which the N-terminal domain resides in the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal domain is extracellular. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this topology is conserved for all of the human interferon-induced IFITM proteins. This model is consistent with that recently proposed for murine IFITM3, but differs from that proposed for murine IFITM1.","Weston, Stuart; Czieso, Stephanie; White, Ian J.; Smith, Sarah E.; Kellam, Paul; Marsh, Mark",PLoS One,481,3

OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID‐19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID‐19‐suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. COVID‐19 positive patients were more likely to present with fever (p=0.02), cough (p=0.03) and pneumonia at CT‐scan (p=0.002) at admission. Prevalence of D‐dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID‐19 positive patients (74.2% vs. 43.3%; p=0.007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D‐dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in ROC curve analysis significantly increased AUC for COVID‐19 diagnosis. COVID‐19 positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (p=0.008) than COVID‐19 negative ones. COVID‐19 positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had less CECs (p=0.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and ACEi or ARBs had even lesser CECs (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion.","Khider, Lina; Gendron, Nicolas; Goudot, Guillaume; Chocron, Richard; Hauw‐Berlemont, Caroline; Cheng, Charles; Rivet, Nadia; Pere, Helene; Roffe, Ariel; Clerc, Sébastien; Lebeaux, David; Debuc, Benjamin; Veyer, David; Rance, Bastien; Gaussem, Pascale; Bertil, Sébastien; Badoual, Cécile; Juvin, Philippe; Planquette, Benjamin; Messas, Emmanuel; Sanchez, Olivier; Hulot, Jean‐Sébastien; Diehl, Jean‐Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Smadja, David M.",J Thromb Haemost,481,16

For them the coronavirus is an enemy that should be defeated as a part of one’s job. They do, however, also have a daily life with family while doing their work obligations. The purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the frontline healthcare professionals’ experience of balancing work life and family life during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 22 frontline healthcare professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 was included and interviewed individually from May to August 2020. Ricoeur’s phenomenological hermeneutical philosophy inspired the methodology in this study. RESULT: Frontline healthcare professionals treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are, voluntarily or involuntarily, forced to be ready to change departments as well as being ready to face the unknown coronavirus. The frontline work leads to feelings of being abandoned among their families and friends due to the threat of bringing the infection home and spreading the virus. Although healthcare professionals are facing a working life filled with uncertainty and unpredictability impacting their family life, they express opposing feelings of being a part of something bigger. CONCLUSIONS: The work life balance for these healthcare professionals is threatened by changes in professional responsibilities, working hours and shifts. Fear of bringing the infection home challenges them ethically and creates a distance between healthcare professionals and their families, leading to a conflict within the individual if their work on the frontline is worth it - or if it is a too high price to pay. Despite facing a working life filled with uncertainty and unpredictability the healthcare professionals are being a part of something bigger that contributes to a fighting spirit and professional pride outweighing the negative consequences; like being soldiers on the front.","Dagyaran, Ilkay; Risom, Signe Stelling; Berg, Selina Kikkenborg; Højskov, Ida Elisabeth; Heiden, Malin; Bernild, Camilla; Christensen, Signe Westh; Missel, Malene",BMC Health Serv Res,481,20
