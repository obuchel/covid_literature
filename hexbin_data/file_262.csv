1091,Extreme water-related weather events and waterborne disease,2012-08-09,"Global climate change is expected to affect the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme water-related weather events such as excessive precipitation, floods, and drought. We conducted a systematic review to examine waterborne outbreaks following such events and explored their distribution between the different types of extreme water-related weather events. Four medical and meteorological databases (Medline, Embase, GeoRef, PubMed) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED) were searched, from 1910 to 2010. Eighty-seven waterborne outbreaks involving extreme water-related weather events were identified and included, alongside 235 ProMED reports. Heavy rainfall and flooding were the most common events preceding outbreaks associated with extreme weather and were reported in 55·2% and 52·9% of accounts, respectively. The most common pathogens reported in these outbreaks were Vibrio spp. (21·6%) and Leptospira spp. (12·7%). Outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events were often the result of contamination of the drinking-water supply (53·7%). Differences in reporting of outbreaks were seen between the scientific literature and ProMED. Extreme water-related weather events represent a risk to public health in both developed and developing countries, but impact will be disproportionate and likely to compound existing health disparities.","CANN, K.

1431,The Spatial Resolution of Epidemic Peaks,2014-04-10,"The emergence of novel respiratory pathogens can challenge the capacity of key health care resources, such as intensive care units, that are constrained to serve only specific geographical populations. An ability to predict the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at the scale of a single large population would help to accurately assess the value of interventions designed to reduce that peak. However, current disease-dynamic theory does not provide a clear understanding of the relationship between: epidemic trajectories at the scale of interest (e.g. city); population mobility; and higher resolution spatial effects (e.g. transmission within small neighbourhoods). Here, we used a spatially-explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution to determine the effect of resolution on model-derived epidemic trajectories. We simulated an influenza-like pathogen spreading across theoretical and actual population densities and varied our assumptions about mobility using Latin-Hypercube sampling. Even though, by design, cumulative attack rates were the same for all resolutions and mobilities, peak incidences were different. Clear thresholds existed for all tested populations, such that models with resolutions lower than the threshold substantially overestimated population-wide peak incidence. The effect of resolution was most important in populations which were of lower density and lower mobility. With the expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets in the near future, our objective was to provide a framework for how to use these data correctly in a spatial meta-population model. Our results suggest that there is a fundamental spatial resolution for any pathogen-population pair. If underlying interactions between pathogens and spatially heterogeneous populations are represented at this resolution or higher, accurate predictions of peak incidence for city-scale epidemics are feasible.","Mills, Harriet L.; Riley, Steven",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983068/,262
1444,Bayesian Analysis for Inference of an Emerging Epidemic: Citrus Canker in Urban Landscapes,2014-04-24,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases require a rapid response from policy makers. The choice of an adequate level of response relies upon available knowledge of the spatial and temporal parameters governing pathogen spread, affecting, amongst others, the predicted severity of the epidemic. Yet, when a new pathogen is introduced into an alien environment, such information is often lacking or of no use, and epidemiological parameters must be estimated from the first observations of the epidemic. This poses a challenge to epidemiologists: how quickly can the parameters of an emerging disease be estimated? How soon can the future progress of the epidemic be reliably predicted? We investigate these issues using a unique, spatially and temporally resolved dataset for the invasion of a plant disease, Asiatic citrus canker in urban Miami. We use epidemiological models, Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and advanced spatial statistical methods to analyse rates and extent of spread of the disease. A rich and complex epidemic behaviour is revealed. The spatial scale of spread is approximately constant over time and can be estimated rapidly with great precision (although the evidence for long-range transmission is inconclusive). In contrast, the rate of infection is characterised by strong monthly fluctuations that we associate with extreme weather events. Uninformed predictions from the early stages of the epidemic, assuming complete ignorance of the future environmental drivers, fail because of the unpredictable variability of the infection rate. Conversely, predictions improve dramatically if we assume prior knowledge of either the main environmental trend, or the main environmental events. A contrast emerges between the high detail attained by modelling in the spatiotemporal description of the epidemic and the bottleneck imposed on epidemic prediction by the limits of meteorological predictability. We argue that identifying such bottlenecks will be a fundamental step in future modelling of weather-driven epidemics.","Neri, Franco M.; Cook, Alex R.; Gibson, Gavin J.; Gottwald, Tim R.; Gilligan, Christopher A.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998883/,262
2261,Towards Identifying and Reducing the Bias of Disease Information Extracted from Search Engine Data,2016-06-06,"The estimation of disease prevalence in online search engine data (e.g., Google Flu Trends (GFT)) has received a considerable amount of scholarly and public attention in recent years. While the utility of search engine data for disease surveillance has been demonstrated, the scientific community still seeks ways to identify and reduce biases that are embedded in search engine data. The primary goal of this study is to explore new ways of improving the accuracy of disease prevalence estimations by combining traditional disease data with search engine data. A novel method, Biased Sentinel Hospital-based Area Disease Estimation (B-SHADE), is introduced to reduce search engine data bias from a geographical perspective. To monitor search trends on Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in Guangdong Province, China, we tested our approach by selecting 11 keywords from the Baidu index platform, a Chinese big data analyst similar to GFT. The correlation between the number of real cases and the composite index was 0.8. After decomposing the composite index at the city level, we found that only 10 cities presented a correlation of close to 0.8 or higher. These cities were found to be more stable with respect to search volume, and they were selected as sample cities in order to estimate the search volume of the entire province. After the estimation, the correlation improved from 0.8 to 0.864. After fitting the revised search volume with historical cases, the mean absolute error was 11.19% lower than it was when the original search volume and historical cases were combined. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reduce search engine data bias levels through the use of rigorous spatial sampling strategies.","Huang, Da-Cang; Wang, Jin-Feng; Huang, Ji-Xia; Sui, Daniel Z.; Zhang, Hong-Yan; Hu, Mao-Gui; Xu, Cheng-Dong",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4894584/,262
3247,"Assessment of transport stress on cattle travelling a long distance (≈648 km), from Jessore (Indian border) to Chittagong, Bangladesh",2018-06-26,"The effect of long-distance transport on cattle health has not frequently been studied in Bangladesh. The current study investigated the health conditions, and the extent and pattern of cattle injuries, along with haemato-biochemical and hormonal changes, before and after long-distance transportation (≈648 km) from the market of origin to the market of destination. A total of 100 adult cattle were selected at the Benapole live cattle market, Bangladesh, for physical examination before and after transportation. Fifty of these cattle were randomly selected for additional haemato-biochemical evaluation just before the start of transportation (0 hour), immediately after arrival at the destination market (13.8±0.9 hours after the start of transportation) and 24 hours after arrival at the destination market. The external health conditions and injuries were assessed. Animals were fasting in the vehicle during transportation and provided only with paddy straw and water before sale at the destination market. Before and after transportation, the overall frequency of cattle injuries varied significantly (26 per cent before v 47 per cent after transportation; P<0.001). Cattle health conditions diverged significantly (such as nasal discharge: 15 per cent v 28 per cent; P=0.03). The values of haemoglobin (P=0.01), total erythrocyte count (P=0.001), total leucocyte count (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P=0.005), neutrophil (P=0.01) and eosinophil (P=0.01) varied significantly. The values of serum total protein (P=0.006), creatine kinase (P<0.001), triglyceride (P=0.04), calcium (P=0.003), phosphorus (P<0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (P=0.04) significantly differed. The overall findings indicate a high degree of transport stress and poor animal welfare.","Alam, Mahabub; Hasanuzzaman, Md; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Rakib, Tofazzal Md; Hossain, Md Emran; Rashid, Md Harun; Sayeed, Md Abu; Philips, Lindsay B; Hoque, Md Ahasanul",Vet Rec Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6018847/,262
4224,Designer DNA architecture offers precise and multivalent spatial pattern-recognition for viral sensing and inhibition,2019-11-25,"DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures.","Kwon, Paul S.; Ren, Shaokang; Kwon, Seok-Joon; Kizer, Megan E.; Kuo, Lili; Xie, Mo; Zhu, Dan; Zhou, Feng; Zhang, Fuming; Kim, Domyoung; Fraser, Keith; Kramer, Laura D.; Seeman, Nadrian C.; Dordick, Jonathan S.; Linhardt, Robert J.; Chao, Jie; Wang, Xing",Nat Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6925649/,262

During a genetically confirmed RSV outbreak, eight patients underwent both chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). Among these, 5 cases had newly appearing abnormalities on CT, although chest X-ray was able to detect abnormalities in only 2 cases (40%). Although bronchial wall thickening was common, other findings and their distribution were variable, even in an outbreak setting. All patients with both a history of anticancer chemotherapy against hematological cancer and lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, sputum, and hypoxemia, had abnormalities on CT, suggesting that these two factors might be important for predicting the existence of LRTI in RSV-infected patients.","Nabeya, Daijiro; Kinjo, Takeshi; Parrott, Gretchen Lynn; Nakachi, Sawako; Yamashiro, Tomoko; Ikemiyagi, Nanae; Arakaki, Wakako; Masuzaki, Hiroaki; Fujita, Jiro",Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7008051/,262
5854,China steps up drive to vaccinate all domestic birds,2005-11-23,"We studied five patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute polyneuropathy. All had previously presented severe infectious processes, accompanied by diverse organ failure accompanied by the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in all cases. Two patients died and the three survivors suffered severe motor deficiencies. Electromyographic studies revealed axonal damage which predominately affected motor neurons. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal in all the patients except one, who showed a moderate increase of lymphocytes. The common causes of polyneuropathy were excluded, but in all cases a nutritional disorder was detected, based on laboratory values of proteins, serum albumin and transferrin. We conclude that polyneuropathy is relatively frequent among critically ill patients and must be closely monitored because of diagnostic difficulties and the repercussions on the progress of these patients. In spite of uncertainties about its cause, it appears to be related to severe infectious processes, ARDS, and nutritional disorders.","Lopez Messa, J.

6206,Synthetic DNA firms embrace hazardous agents guidance but remain wary of automated 'best-match',2010-12-07,"Pandemic-09-H1N1 virus caused the pandemic starting in the second quarter of 2009. The world was prepared to face the pandemic since it was anticipated for over one decade. Most countries, including India, had made detailed pandemic preparedness plans well ahead of its actual occurrence. The infection rapidly spread to the whole country within 2-3 months. The national tactics were to slow down its importation through international air travelers and to slow down its spread in cities and major towns. More than 75% of all infected persons were urban dwellers, suggesting that efforts were concentrated in urban communities. In general the illness of pandemic influenza has been similar to endemic/seasonal influenza; however, there is insufficient epidemiological and clinical data on the latter. We hope that the unprecedented experience of managing the pandemic will encourage the Government of India to plan to confront endemic/seasonal influenza more systematically. The pandemic seems to have reached a peak in September/October and has been on the decline since then.","John, T.

6210,CORRECTIONS,2019-01-03,"Mineralization of organic molecules by microbes is essential for the carbon cycle to operate. The massive mobilization of compounds stored in natural resources, or the introduction of xenobiotics into the biosphere, leads to unidirectional fluxes, which result in the persistance of a number of chemicals in the biosphere, and thus constitute a source of pollution. Molecular biology offers the tools to optimize the biodegradative capacities of microorganisms, accelerate the evolution of “new” activities, and construct totally “new” pathways through the assemblage of catabolic segments from different microbes. Although the number of genetically engineered microbes (GEMs) for potential use in biodegradation is not large, these recombinant microbes function in microcosms according to their design. The survival and fate of recombinant microbes in different ecological niches under laboratory conditions is similar to what has been observed for the unmodified parental strains. rDNA, both on plasmids and on the host chromosome, is usually stably inherited by GEMs. The potential lateral transfer of rDNA from the GEMs to other microbes is significantly diminished, though not totally inhibited, when rDNA is incorporated on the host chromosome. The behavior and fate of GEMs can be predicted more accurately through the coupling of regulatory circuits that control the expression of catabolic pathways to killing genes, so that the GEMs survive in polluted environments, but die when the target chemical is eliminated.","Ramos, Juan L.; Díaz, Eduardo; Dowling, David; Lorenzo, Victor de; Molin, Søren; O'Gara, Fergal; Ramos, Cayo; Timmis, Kenneth N.",Biotechnology (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097320/,262

7084,President’s Plenary Session,2013-12-30,"Many different surfactant preparations derived from animal sources, as well as synthetic surfactants, are available for the treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Natural, modified surfactants containing surfactant-associated proteins appear to be more effective than non-protein-containing synthetic surfactants. Comparative trials with poractant alfa at a higher initial dose of 200 mg/kg appear to be associated with rapid weaning of FiO(2), less need for additional doses, and decreased mortality in infants <32 weeks gestation when compared with beractant. Early rescue (<30 min of age) surfactant therapy is an effective method to minimize over treatment of some preterm infants who may not develop RDS. Surfactant therapy followed by rapid extubation to nasal ventilation appears to be more beneficial than continued mechanical ventilation. In near-term or term newborns with acute RDS, surfactant therapy has been shown to be 70% effective in improving respiratory failure.","Ramanathan, R",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104450/,262

Removal of plastic-adherent cells, including the majority of B cells, did not change these activities. The plastic-non-adherent cells were further separated into two subsets of roughly similar size by panning using a monoclonal, anti-T, and anti-null cell antibodies (81+cells). NK activity and IFN production were found in the 81 − cell fraction. A significantly higher proportion of null lymphocytes from blood and of splenic Fc-gamma receptor-bearing lymphocytes was also found among the 81 − cell fraction as compared to the 81 + fraction, without any change among other subsets. Similar proportions of helper (PT4+), cytotoxic (PT8+) and total T cells (MSA4+) were found among lymphocytes bound to target K562 cells and among the whole lymphocyte population. In contrast, lymphocytes that bound K562 cells demonstrated a striking increase in the proportion of Fc-gamma receptor-positive cells of high affinity. These results show that NK cells and IFN-producing cells are mainly included in the same blood and spleen fraction, and suggest that among 81 − cells only those expressing an Fc-gamma receptor of high affinity are active.","Salmon, H.; Charley, B.; Labonnardiere, C.; Olivier, M.; Kelley, K.; Paraf, A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133630/,262

Owing to the different incidences in males and females, this study aims to analyze the features involved in the transmission of shigellosis among male (subscript m) and female (subscript f) individuals using a newly developed sex-based model. METHODS: The data of reported shigellosis cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. A sex-based Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious/Asymptomatic–Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset, and a sex-age-based SEIAR model was applied in 2010 to explore the sex- and age-specific transmissions. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 130 770 shigellosis cases (including 73 981 male and 56 789 female cases) were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model exhibited a significant fitting effect with the shigellosis data (P < 0.001). The median values of the shigellosis transmission were 2.3225 × 10(8) for SAR(mm) (secondary attack rate from male to male), 2.5729 × 10(8) for SAR(mf), 2.7630 × 10(-8) for SAR(fm), and 2.1061 × 10(-8) for SAR(ff). The top five mean values of the transmission relative rate in 2010 (where the subscript 1 was defined as male and age ≤ 5 years, 2 was male and age 6 to 59 years, 3 was male and age ≥ 60 years, 4 was female and age ≤ 5 years, 5 was female and age 6 to 59 years, and 6 was male and age ≥ 60 years) were 5.76 × 10(-8) for β(61), 5.32 × 10(-8) for β(31), 4.01 × 10(-8) for β(34), 7.52 × 10(-9) for β(62), and 6.04 × 10(-9) for β(64). CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of shigellosis differed among male and female individuals. The transmissibility between the genders was higher than that within the genders, particularly female-to-male transmission. The most important route in children (age ≤ 5 years) was transmission from the elderly (age ≥ 60 years). Therefore, the greatest interventions should be applied in females and the elderly.","Zhao, Ze-Yu; Chen, Qi; Zhao, Bin; Hannah, Mikah Ngwanguong; Wang, Ning; Wang, Yu-Xin; Xuan, Xian-Fa; Rui, Jia; Chu, Mei-Jie; Yu, Shan-Shan; Wang, Yao; Liu, Xing-Chun; An, Ran; Pan, Li-Li; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Su, Yan-Hua; Zhao, Ben-Hua; Chen, Tian-Mu",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162736/,262

Only 11 addressed communication of genetic information with family members, with differences in who would be responsible for this process. Several forms offered patients options regarding communication, even in countries where national guidelines and legislation allow for the disclosure of results in the absence of patient consent. These findings are concerning because they show how forms may potentially mislead patients and health care professionals about whether communication is permissible in cases where the patient does not consent.

Two kinds of plasma sterilizers containing six- or three-chamber cabinets were evaluated. There was no noticeable difference between the two configurations in the inactivation of microorganisms. Both cabinet configurations were shown to be able to reduce microbes dramatically, i.e., to the nondetectable range.

Millions of membrane proteins are found in the lipid membrane layer that surrounds cells, and in the lipid membrane layers that surround smaller cellular compartments. Many medicines interact with membrane proteins; these include drugs that treat cancer, heart disease and pain. Research into membrane proteins is therefore important to the design and development of new medicines. Membrane proteins are difficult to work with, partly because they are so small. However, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, structural biologists, including those at the Membrane Protein Laboratory, are able to see the atomic detail of membrane proteins. There has been great progress in the field of membrane protein structural biology over the past fifteen years. Here, we review the recent advances in membrane protein structural biology, highlight key methods and give an overview of techniques. We also discuss the challenges that remain in this field, and suggest areas for future research. ABSTRACT: Membrane proteins are essential components of many biochemical processes and are important pharmaceutical targets. Membrane protein structural biology provides the molecular rationale for these biochemical process as well as being a highly useful tool for drug discovery. Unfortunately, membrane protein structural biology is a difficult area of study due to low protein yields and high levels of instability especially when membrane proteins are removed from their native environments. Despite this instability, membrane protein structural biology has made great leaps over the last fifteen years. Today, the landscape is almost unrecognisable. The numbers of available atomic resolution structures have increased 10-fold though advances in crystallography and more recently by cryo-electron microscopy. These advances in structural biology were achieved through the efforts of many researchers around the world as well as initiatives such as the Membrane Protein Laboratory (MPL) at Diamond Light Source. The MPL has helped, provided access to and contributed to advances in protein production, sample preparation and data collection. Together, these advances have enabled higher resolution structures, from less material, at a greater rate, from a more diverse range of membrane protein targets. Despite this success, significant challenges remain. Here, we review the progress made and highlight current and future challenges that will be overcome.","Birch, James; Cheruvara, Harish; Gamage, Nadisha; Harrison, Peter J.; Lithgo, Ryan; Quigley, Andrew",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696871/,262

Thirty-nine patients died or developed CV events during hospitalization, and 453 were followed up from the date of C-ICU discharge to evaluate subsequent major adverse CV events. The GI bleeding group had a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (20.2 ± 8.2 vs. 15.1 ± 6.8, p < 0.001), higher frequency of mechanical ventilator use (29.6% vs. 13.1%, p = 0.039), and longer C-ICU admission duration (8 [5–16] days vs. 5 [3–8] days, p < 0.001) than the non-GI bleeding group. The in-hospital mortality rate did not differ between the groups. Of those who were followed-up, CV events after C-ICU discharge were identified in 34.6% and 14.3% of patients in the GI and non-GI bleeding groups, respectively, during a median follow-up period of 228 days (log rank, p < 0.001). GI bleeding was an independent risk factor for subsequent CV events (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.06–4.71; p = 0.035). GI bleeding during C-ICU admission was independently associated with subsequent CV events in such settings.","Sakai, Shin; Tara, Shuhei; Yamamoto, Takeshi; Asano, Kazuhiro; Kimura, Tokuhiro; Fujimoto, Yuhi; Shiomura, Reiko; Matsuda, Junya; Kadooka, Kosuke; Takahashi, Kenta; Ko, Toshinori; Sangen, Hideto; Saiki, Yoshiyuki; Nakata, Jun; Hosokawa, Yusuke; Takano, Hitoshi; Shimizu, Wataru",Heart Vessels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937548/,262

Hence, abstracts should allow readers to evaluate the objectives, key design features, and main results of the study. Several evaluations have shown deficiencies in the reporting of journal and conference abstracts across study designs and research fields, including systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies. Incomplete reporting compromises the value of research to key stakeholders. The authors of this article have developed a 12 item checklist of preferred reporting items for journal and conference abstracts of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies (PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts).

16391,Inferring latent temporal progression and regulatory networks from cross-sectional transcriptomic data of cancer samples,2021-03-05,"Testing for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patient urine may facilitate medical treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate interobserver variability by 2 independent observers compared to laboratory staff in the visual interpretation of factor Xa (DXI) and thrombin inhibitors (DTI) using the DOAC Dipstick test. We also examined whether test pads reacted to other anticoagulants and abnormal urine colors. The colors of the DOAC Dipstick direct factor Xa inhibitor and thrombin inhibitor pads were interpreted with 100% accuracy (95% confidence interval 0.862 to 1.000) for urine samples from persons treated with apixaban (n = 26), rivaroxaban (n = 24), and dabigatran (n = 29) and without anticoagulant therapy (n = 29). The factor Xa and thrombin inhibitor pads did not interact with heparin, nadroparin, fondaparinux, or coumadin. One µg/mL r-Hirudin and 6 µg/mL argatroban interacted with the DTI pad; however, this is unlikely to cause clinical problems because dabigatran is unlikely to be administered together with r-Hirudin and argatroban in clinical circumstances. Abnormal urine color was reliably detected by the urine color pad, so can prevent false interpretation of the DOAC Dipstick pad colors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that interobserver variability when interpreting the DOAC Dipstick test strip is low and that factor Xa and thrombin inhibitor pads do not react to other anticoagulants such as heparins and coumadin. R-Hirudin and argatroban can be detected by the thrombin inhibitor pad and abnormal urine colors can be detected by the urine color pad to prevent false interpretation of the results in patient urine samples.","Harenberg, Job; Martini, Andrea; Du, Shanshan; Krämer, Sandra; Weiss, Christel; Hetjens, Svetlana",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983466/,262

Understanding the mechanisms underlying HIV control in elite controllers (ECs), which maintain undetectable viral load in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, may facilitate the development of new effective therapeutic strategies. We developed an original pipeline for an analysis of the transcriptional profiles of CD8(+) cells from ECs, treated and untreated progressors. Hierarchical cluster analysis of CD8(+) cells’ transcription profiles allowed us to identify five distinct groups (EC groups 1–5) of ECs. The transcriptional profiles of EC group 1 were opposite to those of groups 2–4 and similar to those of the treated progressors, which can be associated with residual activation and dysfunction of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. The profiles of groups 2–4 were associated with different numbers of differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls, but the corresponding genes shared the same cellular processes. These three groups were associated with increased metabolism, survival, proliferation, and the absence of an “exhausted” phenotype, compared to both untreated progressors and healthy controls. The CD8(+) lymphocytes from these groups of ECs may contribute to the control under HIV replication and slower disease progression. The EC group 5 was indistinguishable from normal. Application of master regulator analysis allowed us to identify 22 receptors, including interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and androgen receptors, which may be responsible for the observed expression changes and the functional states of CD8(+) cells from ECs. These receptors can be considered potential targets of therapeutic intervention, which may decelerate disease progression.","Ivanov, Sergey; Filimonov, Dmitry; Tarasova, Olga",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113781/,262

Recently, it has been identified that PIR positively regulates breast cancer cell proliferation, xenograft tumor formation, and metastasis, through an enforced transition of G1/S phase of the cell cycle by upregulation of E2F1 expression at the transcriptional level. Keeping in view the importance of PIR in many crucial cellular processes in humans, we used a variety of computational tools to identify non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PIR gene that are highly deleterious for the structure and function of PIR protein. Out of 173 SNPs identified in the protein, 119 are non-synonymous, and by consensus, 24 mutations were confirmed to be deleterious in nature. Mutations such as V257A, I28T, and I264S were unveiled as highly destabilizing due to a significant stability fold change on the protein structure. This observation was further established through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation that demonstrated the role of the mutation in protein structure destability and affecting its internal dynamics. The findings of this study are believed to open doors to investigate the biological relevance of the mutations and drugability potential of the protein.","Suleman, Muhammad; Tahir ul Qamar, Muhammad; Saleem, Shoaib; Ahmad, Sajjad; Ali, Syed Shujait; Khan, Haji; Akbar, Fazal; Khan, Wajid; Alblihy, Adel; Alrumaihi, Faris; Waseem, Muhammad; Allemailem, Khaled S.",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273169/,262
19501,Sample size calculation for phylogenetic case linkage,2021-07-06,"Despite its proven high utility, integration of pocked-sized portable ultrasound (US) into internal medicine residency training remains inconsistent. For 10 years, we have held a 1-d seminar biannually, consisting of lecture (half-day) and hands-on training (half-day) on pocket-sized US of the abdomen and lungs. The lecture consists of training on US physics and clinical applications of pocket-sized US, followed by a lecture covering the basic anatomy of the abdomen and lungs and introducing the systemic scanning method. Given the simple structure of pocket-sized US devices, understanding the basic physics is sufficient yet necessary to operate the pocket-sized US device. It is important to understand the selection of probes, adjustment of B mode gain, adjustment of color gain, and acoustic impedance. Basic comprehension may have a significant positive impact on the overall utilization of pocket-sized US devices. The easiest and most reliable way to observe the whole abdomen and lungs is a combination of transverse, sagittal, and oblique scanning, pursuing the main vascular system from the center to the periphery of the organ in the abdomen and systemic scanning of the pleura. There is usually a marked change in knowledge and attitudes among the program participants, although skill gaps remain among them.

21310,Episome partitioning and symmetric cell divisions: Quantifying the role of random events in the persistence of HPV infections,2021-09-07,"IMPORTANCE: The results of numerous large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have changed clinical practice in gastric cancer (GC). However, research waste (ie, unpublished data, inadequate reporting, or avoidable design limitations) is still a major challenge for evidence-based medicine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of GC RCTs in the past 20 years and the presence of research waste and to explore potential targets for improvement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study of GC RCTs, ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for phase 3 or 4 RCTs registered from January 2000 to December 2019 using the keyword gastric cancer. Independent investigators undertook assessments and resolved discrepancies via consensus. Data were analyzed from August through December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were descriptions of the characteristics of GC RCTs and the proportion of studies with signs of research waste. Research waste was defined as unpublished data, inadequate reporting, or avoidable design limitations. Publication status was determined by searching PubMed and Scopus databases. The adequacy of reporting was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline checklist. Avoidable design limitations were determined based on existing bias or lack of cited systematic literature reviews. In the analyses of research waste, 125 RCTs that ended after June 2016 without publication were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 262 GC RCTs were included. The number of RCTs increased from 25 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 97 trials in 2015 to 2019, with a greater increase among RCTs of targeted therapy or immunotherapy, which increased from 0 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 36 trials in 2015 to 2019. The proportion of RCTs that were multicenter was higher in non-Asian regions than in Asian regions (50 of 71 RCTs [70.4%] vs 96 of 191 RCTs [50.3%]; P = .004). The analysis of research waste included 137 RCTs, of which 81 (59.1%) were published. Among published RCTs, 65 (80.2%) were judged to be adequately reported and 63 (77.8%) had avoidable design defects. Additionally, 119 RCTs (86.9%) had 1 or more features of research waste. Study settings that included blinding (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.93; P = .03), a greater number of participants (ie, ≥200 participants; OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.51; P = .01), and external funding support (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.60; P = .004) were associated with lower odds of research waste. Additionally, 35 RCTs (49.3%) were referenced in guidelines, and 18 RCTs (22.2%) had their prospective data reused. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the characteristics of GC RCTs in the past 20 years, and it found a research waste burden, which may provide evidence for the development of rational RCTs and reduction of waste in the future.","Lu, Jun; Xu, Bin-bin; Shen, Li-li; Wu, Dong; Xue, Zhen; Zheng, Hua-Long; Xie, Jian-Wei; Wang, Jia-Bin; Lin, Jian-Xian; Chen, Qi-Yue; Cao, Long-Long; Lin, Mi; Tu, Ru-Hong; Huang, Ze-Ning; Lin, Ju-Li; Huang, Chang-Ming; Zheng, Chao-Hui; Li, Ping",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449283/,262

While the extraordinarily rapid isolation and full genome sequencing of SARS-CoV constituted a remarkable scientific achievement, identification of the actual animal reservoir(s) of SARS-CoV is more difficult. Initial evidences indicated that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) was the primary suspect of the animal origin of SARS (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005). Recent studies suggested that horseshoe bat is one of the real reservoirs (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) and masked palm civet may have only served as an intermediate amplification host for SARS-CoV and fulfilled efficient interspecies transmission (Lau et al., 2005).

25393,Infektionen,2008,"Kupffer cells (KC), the resident macrophages of the liver, represent the largest population of mononuclear phagocytes in the body. Phenotypic, developmental, and functional aspects of these cells in steady state and in different diseases are the focus of this review. Recently it has become evident that KC precursors seed the liver already early in fetal development, and the population can be maintained independently from circulating monocytes. However, inflammatory conditions allow rapid differentiation of monocytes into mature cells that are indistinguishable from genuine KC. KC are located in the lumen of sinusoids that receive blood both from the portal vein, carrying nutrients and microbial products from the gut, and from the hepatic artery. This positions KC ideally for their prime function, namely surveillance and clearance of the circulation. As such, they are important in iron recycling by phagocytosing effete erythrocytes, for instance. The immunophenotype of KC, characterized by a wide variety of endocytic receptors, is indicative of this scavenger function. In maintaining homeostasis, KC have an ambivalent response to exogenous triggers. On the one hand, their surveillance function requires alert responses to potentially hazardous substances. On the other hand, continuous exposure of the cells to the trigger-rich content of blood originating from the gut dampens their responsiveness to further stimuli. This ambivalence is also reflected in their diverse roles in disease pathogenesis. For the latter, we sketch the contribution of KC by giving examples of their role in metabolic disease, infections, and liver injury.","Woltman, Andrea M.; Boonstra, Andre; Naito, Makoto; Leenen, Pieter J.

Infection with gastroenteritis agents can be asymptomatic or can be followed by mild or severe disease, including vomiting or diarrhea or both, and can be fatal because of severe dehydration. The spectrum of causative agents differs in developed and developing countries. Besides rotaviruses (RVs) as the main etiologic agent, there are many other viral causes of diarrhea. The main diarrheagenic agents comprise four virus families: RVs, enteric adenoviruses (Ads), human caliciviruses (CVs), and astroviruses. Treatment of infantile diarrhea is mainly by oral or intravenous rehydration.

32024,Combining Networks Using Cherry Picking Sequences,2020-02-01,"ABSTRACT. Viral findings were prospectively studied in lower respiratory tract infections in small children with and without expiratory difficulties. On first admission, a viral aetiology was found in 71 of 127 children (56%). On re‐admission, a viral etiology was found in only two of 31 cases (6%). Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were responsible for 71% of the cases with viral diagnoses. A recently‐developed method for the direct detection of viral antigens in nasopharyngeal specimens by radio‐immunoassay was more sensitive than complement fixation serology, especially in patients aged less than six months. Viral diagnosis was reached using this new method alone in 43% of infections caused by RSV and in 27% of infections caused by other viruses. In children under six months, RSV were found in 89% by direct antigen detection and in 22% by serology. We suggest that direct antigen detection should be used as the primary virological method in small children with lower respiratory tract infections. The aetiological agents were the same in cases with and without expiratory difficulties, RSV being found in about 40% of children in both instances. It is concluded that host factors are critical to the development of expiratory difficulties.","KORPPI, M.; HALONEN, P.; KLEEMOLA, M.; LAUNIALA, K.",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188333/,262
32025,A 3.5-Approximation Algorithm for Sorting by Intergenic Transpositions,2020-02-01,"summary The etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis for a newly emerging disease are generally unknown to clinicians. Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing.","Lam, K. F.; Deshpande, J. V.; Lau, E. H. Y.; Naik‐Nimbalkar, U. V.; Yip, P. S.

32028,Parallel Generalized Suffix Tree Construction for Genomic Data,2020-02-01,"Background Mucosal exudation of plasma is a non‐injurious, physiological response of the airway microcirculation to different inflammatory processes. The exudative response is similar in the nose and bronchi and exudation occurs in both allergic asthma and rhinitis. The educative response is a specific end‐organ function of the mucosal microcirculation that may be altered in airway diseases. Objective This study examines the hypothesis of altered responsiveness of the superficial airway microcirculation to vascular permeability‐increasing challenges in sustained allergic inflammation. Methods Fourteen patients with birch‐pollen induced allergic rhinitis were studied for 7 weeks during a Swedish birch‐pollen season. Nasal symptoms (itching, sneezing. blockage, and discharge) were recorded and the occurrence of pollen was determined. The plasma exudation response was examined by topical histamine challenges at the end (May) and well out of (December) the season. Challenge and lavage were carried out concomitantly using a‘nasal pool’ ‐device. The unilateral nasal cavity was filled for consecutive 10 minute periods with saline and two concentrations of histamine (80μg/ mL and 400μg/mL). The lavage fluid levels of different‐sized plasma proteins (albumin‐66 000 D. fibrinogen‐340000 D, and α (2)‐macroglobulin‐725000D) were determined. Results The pollen season was mild resulting in only minor nasal symptoms. Histamine produced exudation of all plasma proteins across the microvascular epithelial barriers with particularly strong correlation between the levels of albumin and α (2)‐macroglobulin (r =0.98; P< 0.001). The exudative response to histamine was concentration‐dependent (P<0.05) and, furthermore, it was significantly greater late into the season compared with outside the pollen season (albumin: P < 0.05. tibrinogen: P<0.05. α (2)‐macroglobulin: P<0.01). Conclusion We conclude that histamine produced concentration‐dependent nasal airway exudation of bulk plasma in subjects with seasonal rhinitis and that this response is abnormally great during the pollen season. Whether angiogenesis or increased responsiveness of the mierovascular endothelium may explain this phenomenon now remains unknown. We suggest that a mierovascular exudative hyperresponsiveness may characterize allergic airway disease.","SVENSSON, C.; ANDERSSON, M.; ALKNER, L. GREIFF. U.; PERSSON, C. G.

We describe the case of a 64-year-old male, without known immunodeficiency, with 1-year-long clinical history of mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathies and recurrent pulmonary infections. Histopathological evaluation of a mediastinal lymph node revealed the presence of scattered atypical large cells with Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg morphology in a background of lymphocytes and extensive areas of fibrosis. The large cells were positive for HHV8 and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), with a clonal pattern of IGH gene rearrangement. A descriptive diagnosis of “HHV8-positive, EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma-like large B-cell lymphoma” was rendered. Interestingly, the retrospective evaluation of a previous biopsy, diagnosed as reactive lymphadenitis, revealed the presence of HHV8- and EBV-positive cells, with a polyclonal pattern and a small peak corresponding to that of the most recent biopsy. This case presents diagnostic challenges due to the presence of particular features not clearly related to current HHV8-associated entities, and also suggests the possibility for disease progression in the spectrum of HHV8- and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.","Sanchez, Sandra; Veloza, Luis; Wang, Luojun; López, Mónica; López-Guillermo, Armando; Marginet, Marta; Martínez, Antonio; Balagué, Olga; Campo, Elias",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7287409/,262

Allocation is usually done on the basis of a workload estimation, which is performed by human experts. Experts have to dedicate a significant amount of time to the workload estimation, and the usefulness of estimations depends on the expert’s ability to understand very different conditions and situations. Machine learning-based predictors can help in reduce the burden on human experts, and can provide some guarantees at least in terms of repeatability of the delivered performance. However, it is unclear how good their estimations would be, compared to those of experts. In this paper we address this question by exploiting 6 algorithms for estimating the workload of future activities of a real-world department.

In this work, we present a new approach to quantum Hopfield neural networks with classical inputs and outputs. The approach is easily extendable to quantum inputs or outputs.

35219,Repetitions in Toeplitz Words and the Thue Threshold,2020-06-24,"One of the most important problems in contemporary science, and especially in biology, is to reveal mechanisms of pattern formation. On the level of biological tissues, patterns form due to interactions between cells. These interactions can be long-range if mediated by diffusive molecules or short-range when associated with cell-to-cell contact sites. Mathematical studies of long-range interactions involve models based on differential equations while short-range interactions are modelled using discrete type models. In this paper, we use cellular automata (CA) technique to study formation of patterns due to short-range interactions. Namely, we use von Neumann cellular automata represented by a finite set of lattices whose states evolve according to transition rules. Lattices can be considered as representing biological cells (which, in the simplest case, can only be in one of the two different states) while the transition rules define changes in their states due to the cell-to-cell contact interactions. In this model, we identify rules resulting in the formation of stationary periodic patterns. In our analysis, we distinguish rules which do not destroy preset patterns and those which cause pattern formation from random initial conditions. Also, we check whether the forming patterns are resistant to noise and analyse the time frame for their formation. Transition rules which allow formation of stationary periodic patterns are then discussed in terms of pattern formation in biology.","Rasolonjanahary, Manan’Iarivo; Vasiev, Bakhtier",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304752/,262

Depression has a negative impact on both mental and physical health and is mainly associated with suboptimal HIV treatment outcomes. To encourage successful aging and the achievement of the 3 × 90 objectives in older PLHIV, the psychological domain must not be neglected. In this context and as data are scarce in West Africa, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and the factors associated with severe depressive symptoms in older PLHIV living in this region of the world. METHODS: Data from PLHIV aged ≥50 years and on ART since ≥6 months were collected in three clinics (two in Côte d’Ivoire, one in Senegal) participating in the West Africa International epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) collaboration. The severity of depressive symptoms was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D), and associated factors were identified using logistic regressions. RESULTS: The median age of the 334 PLHIV included in the study was 56.7 (53.5–61.1), 57.8% were female, and 87.1% had an undetectable viral load. The prevalence of severe depressive symptoms was 17.9% [95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 13.8–22.0]. PLHIV with severe depressive symptoms were more likely to be unemployed (adjusted Odd Ratio (aOR) = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4–5.7), and to be current or former tobacco smokers (aOR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3–5.4) but were less likely to be overweight or obese (aOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of severe depressive symptoms is high among older PLHIV living in West Africa. Unemployed PLHIV and tobacco smokers should be seen as vulnerable and in need of additional support.

43130,Panorama,2020-12-16,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic created a major public health threat to patients and health care systems around the world. Many hospitals cancelled elective surgeries to brace for the pandemic thus impacting many neurosurgical patients that had their surgeries postponed. METHODS: We implemented several measures for staff and patients to minimize the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For surgical clearance, all patients needed to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 within 48h prior to the non-elective surgery. A triage protocol was implemented to manage patients in need of non-elective surgeries. A “drive-through” testing center was developed for preoperative surgical clearance to triage cases in need of non-elective surgery. Similarly, all patients admitted to the hospital were tested. Telemedicine played a big role in evaluating the need of surgery. We reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data for all patients that underwent surgery within the neurosurgery department from March 26th to April 22nd 2020. RESULTS: Using a combination of preoperative outpatient COVID-19 drive-through and inpatient testing to help obtain surgical clearance with selected telemedicine evaluations, 103 non-elective neurosurgical procedures were performed on 102 patients. No patients tested positive for the COVID-19 testing prior to surgery. None of the operated patients developed any COVID-19 symptoms during their hospitalization or were re-admitted to our ED postoperatively for COVID-19 symptoms. A subset of patients developed symptoms suspect for COVID-19 post-operatively but were retested and all tested negative. CONCLUSION: We describe a multi-faceted preoperative triage protocol for safely performing non-elective neurosurgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could help other neurosurgical departments and hospitals minimize coronavirus exposure for patients and healthcare workers. We believe this triage strategy helps safely identify selected patients in need of neurosurgical care amidst hospital capacity concerns, COVID-19 testing limitations, limited personal protective equipment, and this approach could be implemented at other centers to gradually restart a process towards elective surgeries in a safe way.","De Biase, Gaetano; Freeman, William; Elder, Benjamin D; Nottmeier, Eric W; Abel, Martin; Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo; Abode-Iyamah, Kingsley",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717378/,262

43763,Photocatalysts on Wastewater Treatment and Sustainable Applications,2021-01-04,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Mitochondria are central hubs of cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and redox balance. The plasticity of these cellular organelles is an essential requisite for the cells to cope with different stimuli and stress conditions. Cancer cells are characterized by changes in energy metabolism, mitochondrial signaling, and dynamics. These changes are driven by alterations in the mitochondrial proteome. For this reason, in the last years a focus of basic and cancer research has been the implementation and optimization of technologies to investigate changes in the mitochondrial proteome during cancer initiation and progression. This review presents an overview of the most used technologies to investigate the mitochondrial proteome and recent evidence on changes in the expression levels and delocalization of certain proteins in and out the mitochondria for shaping the functional properties of tumor cells. ABSTRACT: Mitochondria are highly dynamic and regulated organelles implicated in a variety of important functions in the cell, including energy production, fatty acid metabolism, iron homeostasis, programmed cell death, and cell signaling. Changes in mitochondrial metabolism, signaling and dynamics are hallmarks of cancer. Understanding whether these modifications are associated with alterations of the mitochondrial proteome is particularly relevant from a translational point of view because it may contribute to better understanding the molecular bases of cancer development and progression and may provide new potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as novel molecular targets for anti-cancer treatment. Making an inventory of the mitochondrial proteins has been particularly challenging given that there is no unique consensus targeting sequence that directs protein import into mitochondria, some proteins are present at very low levels, while other proteins are expressed only in some cell types, in a particular developmental stage or under specific stress conditions. This review aims at providing the state-of-the-art on methodologies used to characterize the mitochondrial proteome in tumors and highlighting the biological relevance of changes in expression and delocalization of proteins in and out the mitochondria in cancer biology.","Moro, Loredana",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766083/,262
44199,Response,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly affected the US, where obesity is present in over 40% of the population. Evidence suggests that obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease and complications. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at Henry Ford Health System in metropolitan Detroit from March-May 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness, complications, treatment and outcomes of obese (BMI > 30) and non-obese (BMI < 30) patients were compared. Data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: Summary of results comparing non-obese and obese patients is presented in tables 1 and 2. Median BMI (kg/m(2)) in each group was 26 and 36.5, respectively. Age and black race differed significantly between the two groups (p< 0.001). Younger patients were more obese compared to older patients. Diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were significantly more common in obese patients. Obese patients were significantly more likely to receive antibiotics in the ED (p=0.015), require vasopressors for shock (p=0.004), and undergo renal replacement therapy (p=0.005). Although 37% of obese patients were intubated, obesity was not a significant risk factor for mechanical ventilation (MV). 30-day readmission and mortality were significantly higher in non-obese patients. In the regression analysis, age over 60, tachypnea at admission, acute kidney injury, and diabetes were significantly associated with need for MV, but not BMI.

44222,Response,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: In December 2009, a cluster of patients with pneumonia was reported in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China, caused by a novel coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2. The epidemiological compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model has been previously used during the initial wave of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. This study investigates whether the SEIR model, associated to mobility changes parameters, can determine the likelihood of establishing control over an epidemic in a city, state or country. METHODS: The critical step in the prediction of COVID-19 by a SEIR model are the values of the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infectious period, in days. R0 and the infectious periods were calculated by mathematical constrained optimization, and used to determine the numerically minimum SEIR model errors in a country, based on COVID-19 data until april 11(th). The Community Mobility Reports from Google Maps (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) provided mobility changes on april 5(th) compared to the baseline (Jan 3(th) to Feb 6(th)). The data was used to measure the non-pharmacological intervention adherence. The impact of each mobility component was made by logistic regression models. COVID-19 control was defined by R0 of the SEIR model in a country less than 1.0. Algorithm for the SEIR model applied to COVID-19 (initialization) [Image: see text] Table 01: Algorithm for the SEIR model applied to COVID-19 (calculation of new COVID-19 cases day-by-day) [Image: see text] RESULTS: Residential mobility restriction presented the higher logistic coefficient (17.7), meaning higher impact on outbreak control. Workplace mobility restriction was the second most effective measure, considering a restriction minimum of 56% for a 53% chance of outbreak control. Retail and recreation mobility presented 53%, and 86% respectively. Transit stations (96% and 54%) were also assessed. Park mobility restriction demonstrated the lowest effectiveness in outbreak control, considering that absolute (100%) restriction provided the lowest chance of outbreak control (46%).

CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-month-old boy with a history of accident ingestion of meperfluthrin was admitted to our hospital’s emergency department. He exhibited severe dyspnea, and lung radiograph showed multiple patchy and cord-like high-density shadows bilaterally in a short time. He also suffered 35 min of seizures which were finally controlled by the intravenous infusion of propofol. He was diagnosed with meperfluthrin poisoning, status epilepticus and severe pneumonia. After treated with methylprednisolone, aerosolized beclomethasone dipropionate, anti-infection, and some critical supportive therapy, the patient was in good health and showed no symptoms during 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Meperfluthrin poisoning is rare. Oral meperfluthrin poisoning shows neurotoxic effects and pulmonary toxicity. Controlling seizures rapidly and ensuring an adequate oxygen supply are critical to the successful treatment.","Zheng, Shengkun; Zhang, Shengxin; Hong, Shaoxian; Lou, Qing",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829090/,262

New technologies are pervasive and create opportunities for new business models and lifestyles. Recently, the term “Corporate Digital Responsibility” has been coined to summarize the emerging responsibilities of corporations relating to their digitalization-related impacts, risks, challenges, and opportunities. The paper at hand reviews the topic of CDR using a multi-step approach. First, results from an opinion poll of 509 US-based respondents are reported which illustrate the perceived opportunities and threats associated with the topic of digitalization, underlining the need for a strategic approach to CDR implementation. Second, existing uses and definitions of the CDR terminology are summarized and a definition of CDR is derived. Third, twenty important topics related to CDR are identified, summarized and categorized into three categories using the ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) framework. Finally, results are discussed with regards to their theoretical and managerial contributions and a hands-on guide which companies can use to implement a suitable CDR strategy is presented.","Herden, Christina J.; Alliu, Ervin; Cakici, André; Cormier, Thibaut; Deguelle, Catherine; Gambhir, Sahil; Griffiths, Caleb; Gupta, Shrishti; Kamani, Sahil R.; Kiratli, Yonca-Selda; Kispataki, Máté; Lange, Greta; Moles de Matos, Leandro; Tripero Moreno, Laura; Betancourt Nunez, Hector Alain; Pilla, Venkata; Raj, Bairesh; Roe, James; Skoda, Markus; Song, Youye; Ummadi, Praveen Kumar; Edinger-Schons, Laura Marie",NachhaltigkeitsManagementForum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849964/,262

RTBs have been particularly important in areas where local agri‐food systems are under stress. Under such circumstances, growers, processors and traders often see opportunities to improve food security or increase their incomes with those crops due to shifting tastes and preferences for food and non‐food products. Since the early 1990s, cassava output surged in sub‐Saharan Africa, while potato production expanded rapidly in Asia. RTBs are consumed by over three billion people in developing countries with a market value of US$ 339 billion. This paper analyses the major changes in production, utilisation and trade of RTBs over the last six decades, assesses estimates of their future trajectory and offers recommendations so that they might achieve their full potential.","Scott, Gregory J.",Int J Food Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983897/,262

METHODS: We searched six electronic academic databases for studies published between January 1990 and September 2019: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, CINAHL and Cochrane. For intervention description and data extraction we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and Template for Intervention Description and Replication guide. Quality was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tools. Grey literature results were deemed beyond the scope of this review due to the large number of interventions and lack of available outcomes data. RESULTS: Of 4501 studies, 7 met the eligibility criteria of UK-based community interventions targeting mental health in adults from ethnic minority populations: four randomised controlled trials, one pre/post-pilot study, one cross-sectional study and one ethnographic study. Interventions included therapy-style sessions, peer-support groups, educational materials, gym access and a family services programme. Common components included a focus on tackling social isolation, using lay health workers from within the community, signposting and overcoming structural barriers to access. Four studies reported a statistically significant positive effect on mental health outcomes and six were appraised as having a high risk of bias. Study populations were ethnically heterogeneous and targeted people mainly from South Asia. No studies examined interventions targeting men. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding community-centred interventions focused on improving public mental health among ethnic minority groups. Decision makers need scientific evidence to inform effective approaches to mitigating health disparities. Our next steps are to map promising community activities and interventions that are currently being provided to help identify emerging evidence.","Baskin, Cleo; Zijlstra, Geiske; McGrath, Mike; Lee, Caroline; Duncan, Fiona Helen; Oliver, Emily J; Osborn, David; Dykxhoorn, Jen; Kaner, Eileen F S; LaFortune, Louise; Walters, Kate R; Kirkbride, James; Gnani, Shamini",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039264/,262
52494,What We Might Find If We Only Looked,2021-05-05,"Introduction: Neonatal hypocalcemia is an uncommon condition but clinical presentation can include severe manifestations such as neuromuscular irritability, tetany, seizure or cardiac conduction abnormalities that require prompt intervention to normalize calcium levels. To our knowledge there have been no reports of neonatal hypocalcemia following maternal SARS-CoV2 infection at the time of birth. Here we report a case of transient late-onset neonatal hypocalcemia complicated by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of delivery. Clinical Case: A 13-day old full-term appropriate for gestational age female was born to an asymptomatic mother who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 at the time of delivery. Caretakers noticed minor twitching movements in the first few days of life that were progressively worsening. Initial ionized calcium was 0.6 mmol/L, and labs at time of transfer to our hospital were notable for total calcium of 5.5mg/dL(n 8.9–9.9), and ionized calcium of 0.67mmol/L (n 1.12–1.37 mmol/L). Calcium levels improved after she received IV calcium boluses and was started on continuous IV calcium infusion. Initial phosphorus was 8.3 mg/dL (n 3.2–7.4 mg/dL) and magnesium was 1.2 mg/dL (n 1.5–2.2 mg/dL), while intact PTH was inappropriately low at 12.2 pg/mL (n 10–65 pg/mL), and urine calcium to urine creatinine ratio was below the limits of assay detection (n <0.86), consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal hypoparathyroidism. The 25-hydroxy vitamin D was 11.1 ng/mL (n 30–100 ng/mL), which may have also been a contributing factor. She had no dysmorphic features on examination concerning for 22q deletion syndrome, and tested negative for SARS-CoV2. Chromosomal microarray did not reveal clinically relevant copy number alterations or areas of homozygosity. Calcium stabilized on enteral calcium carbonate, calcitriol, and cholecalciferol, and she was weaned off of all supplementation. Prior to discharge PTH recovered to 36.9 pg/ml with a calcium of 9.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 7.7 mg/dL, normal magnesium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (31.3 ng/ml). She was discharged on Similac PM 60/40 formula to reduce her dietary phosphorus content, and 400 IU of cholecalciferol. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia in patients with severe COVID-19 is being increasingly reported. There is minimal data on the effect of perinatal SARS-CoV2 infections on neonatal health. While this report does not establish causation, expanding awareness of neonatal abnormalities following maternal SARS-CoV2 infection at delivery will help to recognize causal associations and improve patient care.","Grundman, Jody B; Persky, Rebecca W; Shankar, Roopa Kanakatti",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089517/,262
53457,Preparation of MgO–MnO(2) nanocomposite particles for cholesterol sensors,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen fundamental organisational changes to emergency departments internationally. Specialties throughout the hospital setting have been asked to change their working practice, often with the aim of adapting to new processes in emergency departments. Early in the pandemic, the orthopaedic team at one district general hospital were required to provide 24/7 onsite cover in a multi-specialty area. Confusion over the referral pathways of two specialties (orthopaedics and plastic surgery) led to increase waiting times, constrained patient flow and poor patient and staff satisfaction. METHOD: This quality improvement project occurred over three cycles of data collection and intervention over a two-month period. A novel referral pathway was developed and implemented after discussion with consultants in orthopaedics, plastics, and emergency medicine. Interventions included staff teaching, clarifying of roles at morning meetings and the deployment of posters. RESULTS: In cycle 1, 39% of orthopaedic referrals were inappropriately referred. By cycle 3, 0% of orthopaedic patients were inappropriately referred. Average time in department for patients referred to orthopaedics improved from 124 minutes to 88 minutes. Staff reported increased satisfaction, with appreciation for the clarification on referral criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This QUIP demonstrates how simple interventions during times of crisis can solve complex organisational issues.","Gordon, G; Fadulelmola, A; Scott, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135885/,262

Because of the high predictability of human movements, numerous successful solutions to perform such forecasting have been proposed. However, most focus on predicting human displacements on an intra-urban spatial scale. This study proposes a predictor for nation-wide mobility that allows anticipating inter-urban displacements at larger spatial granularity. For this goal, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) was used to consider the latent relationships among large geographical regions. The solution has been evaluated with an open dataset including trips throughout the country of Spain and the current weather conditions. The results indicate a high accuracy in predicting the number of trips for multiple time horizons, and more important, they show that our proposal only needs a single model for processing all the mobility areas in the dataset, whereas other techniques require a different model for each area under study.","Terroso-Sáenz, Fernando; Muñoz, Andrés",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8288072/,262

56204,"Influence of Mg substitution on structural, magnetic and electrical properties of Zn-Cu ferrites",2021-07-26,"Unlike bolus insulin secretion mechanisms, basal insulin secretion is poorly understood. It is essential to elucidate these mechanisms in non-hyperinsulinaemia healthy persons. This establishes a baseline for investigation into pathologies where these processes are dysregulated, such as in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), certain cancers and dementias. Chronic hyperinsulinaemia enforces glucose fueling, depleting the NAD+ dependent antioxidant activity that increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Consequently, beta-cell mitochondria increase uncoupling protein expression, which decreases the mitochondrial ATP surge generation capacity, impairing bolus mediated insulin exocytosis. Excessive ROS increases the Drp1:Mfn2 ratio, increasing mitochondrial fission, which increases mtROS; endoplasmic reticulum-stress and impaired calcium homeostasis ensues. Healthy individuals in habitual ketosis have significantly lower glucagon and insulin levels than T2DM individuals. As beta-hydroxybutyrate rises, hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis supply extra-hepatic glucose needs, and osteocalcin synthesis/release increases. We propose insulin’s primary role is regulating beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis, while the role of bone regulates glucose uptake sensitivity via osteocalcin. Osteocalcin regulates the alpha-cell glucagon secretory profile via glucagon-like peptide-1 and serotonin, and beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis via regulating basal insulin levels. Establishing metabolic phenotypes aids in resolving basal insulin secretion regulation, enabling elucidation of the pathological changes that occur and progress into chronic diseases associated with ageing.","Cooper, Isabella D.; Brookler, Kenneth H.; Kyriakidou, Yvoni; Elliott, Bradley T.; Crofts, Catherine A.

To elucidate the nutritional regulation of adipogenic TN from diets containing different sources of fatty acids (saturated, n-6, n-3) in adipocytes, we cloned the coding region of porcine TN from a cDNA library and analyzed tissue expressions in weaned piglets fed with 2% soybean oil (SB, enriched in n-6 fatty acids), docosahexaenoic acid oil (DHA, an n-3 fatty acid) or beef tallow (BT, enriched in saturated and n-9 fatty acids) for 30 d. Compared with tissues in the BT- or SB-fed group, expression of TN was reduced in the adipose, liver and lung tissues from the DHA-fed group, accompanied with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterols. This in vivo reduction was also confirmed in porcine primary differentiated adipocytes supplemented with DHA in vitro. Then, promoter analysis was performed. A 1956-bp putative porcine TN promoter was cloned and transcription binding sites for sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-1c or forkhead box O proteins (FoxO) were predicted on the TN promoter. Mutating binding sites on porcine TN promoters showed that transcriptional suppression of TN by DHA on promoter activity was dependent on specific response elements for SREBP-1c or FoxO. The inhibited luciferase promoter activity by DHA on the TN promoter coincides with reduced gene expression of TN, SREBP-1c, and FoxO1 in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells supplemented with DHA. To conclude, our current study demonstrated that the adipogenic TN was negatively regulated by nutritional modulation of DHA both in pigs in vivo and in humans/pigs in vitro. The transcriptional suppression by DHA on TN expression was partly through SREBP-1c or FoxO. Therefore, down-regulation of adipogenic tetranectin associated with fibrinolysis and adipogenesis may contribute to the beneficial effects of DHA on ameliorating obesity-induced metabolic syndromes such as atherosclerosis and adipose dysfunctions.","Yang, Jui-Ting; Chen, Yu-Jen; Huang, Chao-Wei; Wang, Ya-Chin; Mersmann, Harry J.; Wang, Pei-Hwa; Ding, Shih-Torng",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308646/,262

This analysis quantifies and compares online and social media attention to hurricanes and wildfires over time and geographic space. Hurricanes studied included: Michael, Maria, Irma, Harvey, and Florence. Fires studied included: Woolsey, Mendocino, Carr, and Camp. It was hypothesized that total volume of online media content, measured in posts and mentions, varied measurably over the phases of the disasters. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the anatomy of the disaster, specifically the number and timing/dates, of posts and mentions varied inside versus outside impacted zones/geographies. Social media content, in sheer volume, related to hurricanes was larger than that devoted to fires. A mismatch between the time periods that people post about natural disasters on social media and the times when aid is needed to rebuild was found. Mentions fell rapidly after landfall for hurricanes, and long before fires were officially contained or extinguished. This rapid fall in media attention may leave directly impacted populations without help and support during the rebuilding process. Greater understanding of volume of posts over time, or the anatomy of disasters in online media space, may help government agencies, private industry, and relief organizations understand public attentiveness before, during, and after various types of natural disasters.","Olynk Widmar, Nicole; Rash, Kendra; Bir, Courtney; Bir, Benjamin; Jung, Jinho",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387670/,262

The scholarship shows that while they can provide opportunities for cooperation and ‘disaster diplomacy’ between parties to a conflict, they can also intensify tension and hostility. This article uses the Israeli–Palestinian conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, exploring the impact of the crisis on relations between the rival parties and examining the conditions under which an ongoing pandemic might lead to either conflict or cooperation in a conflict area. The research is based on within-case analysis, comparing three conflict arenas: Israel–Palestinian Authority relations in the West Bank; relations between Israel and the Palestinian community in East Jerusalem; and Israel–Hamas government relations in the Gaza strip. The article outlines the possibilities and limitations of ‘disaster diplomacy’ in intractable conflicts and contributes to the literature by identifying how different contexts, relations and actors in each conflict arena affect the development of patterns of conflict and cooperation with regard to the pandemic. The study analyses the factors that shape how the pandemic affects the conflict, and the COVID-19-related diplomacy, in each sub-case, with attention to three main variables: the structure of the conflict arena, domestic politics and the developments in the pandemic. The analysis addresses the unique conditions of an ongoing global pandemic, as opposed to an isolated disaster event, and traces the changing impact of the pandemic on the conflict and on disaster-related cooperation at various stages.","Lehrs, Lior",Int Aff,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499986/,262

We compared the pathogenicity of different passages (SZ50, SZ100, SZ150, SZ200 and SZ250) of strain SZ by clinical signs, gross lesions, viral load, tissue tropism, weight gain and tracheal ciliary activity. As the passaging increased in the chicken embryos, the strain lost its ability to infect many organs, and the viral pathogenicity gradually decreased.

The Gamma Knife was the most published SRS method for CNS hemangioblastomas. After critical study appraisal for intra-study bias, 14 studies were used for quantitative meta-analysis of 5-year progression free survival (PFS). The pooled 5-year PFS across all eligible studies was 88.4%. No difference was observed between spine versus intracranial studies. Individual patient data (IPD) was extracted from 14 studies, representing 322 tumors. Univariate analysis of IPD revealed that VHL patients were younger, and had smaller tumors compared to those with sporadic disease. Adverse events were associated with increasing marginal dose, independent of tumor volume. VHL status, sex, radiosurgical method, tumor location, and tumor volume were not found to be significantly associated with tumor progression. Multiple studies show excellent tumor control at 5-year follow up, however, the long-term efficacy of SRS for CNS hemangioblastomas still needs to be investigated, and the studies exploring the role of SRS for early treatment of asymptomatic lesions is wanting.","Pan, James; Jabarkheel, Rashad; Huang, Yuhao; Ho, Allen; Chang, Steven D",Journal of neuro-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-017-2697-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204841/,262

These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","Manansala, Michael; Baughman, Robert; Novak, Richard; Judson, Marc; Sweiss, Nadera",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779588/,262

An RCT.,2014,"BACKGROUND Overweight and obesity of women is a growing concern all over the world. However, an understanding on the socio-economic inequalities in overweight and obesity of women received little attention, especially in the context of Bangladesh. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh as well as to explore the effect of various socio-economic factors on this inequality. METHODS This study used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 which is a nationally representative data. The concentration index of overweight and obesity was applied to measure the extent of socio-economic inequality. Finally, the concertation index was decomposed in order to understand the contribution of different socio-economic variables in inequality in overweight and obesity of women. RESULTS This study included a total of 16,624 women of reproductive age. The study found that the prevalence of overweight was about 29% and the rate of obesity was approximately 11%. The value of concentration index for overweight and obesity was 0.37 (p < 0.001). This study also observed that about 52% inequality was explained by household's wealth status followed by watching television (25%), husband/partner's educational status (around 7%), women's educational status (about 5%), place of residence (approximately 4%). CONCLUSIONS This study found notable level of overweight and obesity among the women of Bangladesh. Various socio-economic factors like wealth status, education levels of women and partners, urban settings, women watching television predominantly contributed to the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. Therefore, the study suggests adopting necessary interventions targeting the women of higher socio-economic status to reduce the risk of life-threatening problems caused by overweight and obesity.","Hasan, Emran; Khanam, Moriam; Shimul, Shafiun N",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-01135-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243211/,262

METHODS Review of data from Australian Bureau of Statistics and administrative sources, and recent research studies. RESULTS Trends in payment methods show continuing reliance on the Accommodation Supplement. Reasons are found in patterns of home ownership at older ages, changes in tenure and living arrangements over the age range, and increasing use of the exchange value of housing assets. Policy tensions arise between protecting access for low means residents and requiring those who are able to pay to do so. CONCLUSIONS The housing assets pillar at advanced ages is not as strong as early in retirement and makes it increasingly unreliable as a source of funding.","Howe, Anna L",Australasian journal on ageing,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajag.12854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280225/,262

64865,Laparoscopic fixation of the vaginal cuff to the uterosacral ligaments at the time of hysterectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters placed in the pelvic space without anchoring present a high rate of migration. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a single-incision approach, using a flexible endoscopic preperitoneal tunneling for catheter implantation and fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight pigs were involved in this experimental study. A 2/0 Vicryl loop was sutured at the tip of a PD catheter. In 4 pigs, a 1.5 cm incision was made on the left paramedian line and the parietal peritoneal layer was identified by splitting rectal muscles. A gastroscope was inserted in the incision and advanced in the extraperitoneal space. An exit hole was made in the peritoneum over the low pelvic cavity. A guidewire was left in the abdominal cavity, and the PD catheter was inserted over the guidewire. The endoscope was inserted in the tunnel again, and endoscopic clips were deployed over the Vicryl loop to fix the catheter. In 4 pigs, the PD catheter was inserted laparoscopically using a two-port approach. The catheter's tip was fixed with laparoscopic clips on the Vicryl loop. A strain test to assess the force required to detach clips was performed using a digital dynamometer. RESULTS Operative time for flexible endoscopic tunneling was longer when compared to the laparoscopic implant (29.5 ± 4.43 vs. 22.7 ± 2.51 min). Mean force to displace the catheter was similar after flexible endoscopic fixation when compared to laparoscopic clip fixation (5.57 N ± 2.76 vs. 4.15 N ± 1.76). CONCLUSIONS Flexible endoscopic extraperitoneal tunneling allows for minimally invasive single-incision PD catheter placement and fixation.","Liu, Yu-Yin; Diana, Michele; Halvax, Peter; Cho, Sungwoo; Légner, András; Alzaga, Amilcar; Swanström, Lee; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3951-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414067/,262
64946,Racial Disparities in Outcomes After Common Abdominal Surgical Procedures-The Impact of Access to a Minimally Invasive Approach.,2020-08-17,"Hypertrophic scar (HS) results from abnormal wound healing, accompanied by excessive hypercellularity, migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Autophagy dysregulation plays crucial roles during HS formation. The overexpressed p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in injured skin tissue after wound healing becomes a factor aggravating scar. The study was designed to investigate the role of p75NTR and p75NTR-mediated autophagy in the process of HS. The results revealed that p75NTR expression was significantly upregulated while that of autophagy proteins was downregulated in cicatrix at 3 and 6 months after burn, which was recovered at 12 months. p75NTR silencing inhibited proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSF), whereas p75NTR overexpression presented the opposite results. Silencing of p75NTR reduced the expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling molecules while enhanced that of autophagy proteins. Importantly, PI3K agonist (IGF-1) intervention notably decreased the levels of LC3B II/I and Beclin-1, and restored the inhibitory effects of p75NTR silencing on proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF. Concurrently, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment exhibited the same variation trends with IGF-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that p75NTR silencing inhibits proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF by activating autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.","Shi, Wen; Wu, Yan; Bian, Donghui",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2020-0219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726570/,262
65015,Future of robotic surgery in urology.,2017,"PURPOSE Patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with obesity, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and left-sided colon tumors are at high risk for operative conversion and complications. We hypothesized that a completely intracorporeal laparoscopic colectomy would be beneficial for high-risk patients compared with healthy, low-risk patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 136 consecutive patients undergoing a standardized totally intracorporeal laparoscopic colectomy for neoplasms from February 2004 to September 2011. Patients were stratified into a high-risk group with 1 or more factors: body mass index >30, ASA grade ≥ 3, and left-sided tumors or a low-risk group with no factors. Variables compared were case frequency during the learning curve, body mass index, estimated blood loss, operative time, conversion, 30-day complications, and length of stay. Comparisons between groups were made by χ2 analysis or t test where appropriate. Data are expressed as median ± SD, odds ratio, and significance defined as P<0.05. RESULTS Laparoscopic colectomy was performed in 136 patients with a conversion rate of 4%. There were 86 high-risk patients and 50 low-risk patients. High-risk patients had a significantly (P<0.005) longer operative time (225 ± 66 vs. 186 ± 55 min) but no significant difference in estimated blood loss, conversion rates, learning curve, complications, or length of stay compared with low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS When laparoscopic colectomy is performed totally intracorporeally, surgical outcomes in high-risk patients with obesity, high ASA grade, and left-sided tumors are equally successful to results achieved for low-risk patients that are thin, healthy, with right-sided lesions.","Iorio, Tara; Blumberg, David","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3182769441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23579509/,262

However, little information is available regarding the safety of OLV in Fontan patients when hemidiaphragmatic paralysis is present. CASE PRESENTATION A 41-year-old woman who underwent repeated Fontan procedures was re-admitted to our hospital because of worsening shortness of breath. As left hemidiaphragmatic paralysis was considered to be contributing to her symptom, an open thoracic left diaphragmatic plication surgery was scheduled. A preoperative pulmonary artery angiogram revealed a remarkably reduced blood flow to the left lung. The surgeon requested OLV during the surgery. Despite our concern regarding the impact of OLV on the Fontan circulation, OLV did not result in major hemodynamic changes. CONCLUSION OLV can be safely implemented in patients with hemidiaphragmatic paralysis with preserved Fontan circulation. Preoperative pulmonary artery angiography may provide useful information for estimating the impact of OLV on the Fontan circulation.","Sasaki, Yusuke; Kato, Jungo; Minoshima, Rie; Nagata, Hiromasa; Minamishima, Shizuka; Suzuki, Takeshi; Morisaki, Hiroshi",JA clinical reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-019-0270-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32026005/,262
66723,Evaluation and Comparison of Contemporary Energy-Based Surgical Vessel Sealing Devices.,2018,"Cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) is a powerful method to study the 3D structure of biological samples in a close-to-native state. Current state-of-the-art cryoET combined with subtomogram averaging analysis enables the high-resolution structural determination of macromolecular complexes that are present in multiple copies within tomographic reconstructions. Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described. The presented pipeline is particularly suited to maximizing the time-efficiency of tomography experiments that require a careful selection of acquisition targets and at the same time a large amount of tilt series to be collected.","Weis, Felix; Hagen, Wim J H; Schorb, Martin; Mattei, Simone",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818563/,262

Autopsy and biopsy studies reveal, alongside podocyte and tubular cell anomalies, the presence of virion within the cells. Evidence suggests that, in addition to the direct cytopathic effect of SARS- CoV2 on the glomeruli and renal tubules, there is also the indirect effect of cell-mediated immunity, the cytokines storm and the cross-talk between organs with possible systemic effects of the disease. These mechanisms are interconnected and have profound therapeutic implications involving extracorporeal removal of inflammatory cytokines. Dialysis patients, and children, in particular, should be classified as ""at high risk"" of contracting the disease. Infections are one of the most frequent causes of death in children with chronic renal failure who undergo dialysis. The reasons for this particular susceptibility are to be found in the compromised immune system, secondary to chronic malnutrition, immunosuppressive therapy, and uremia, frequent contact with healthcare personnel and other patients attending the dialysis unit and in need of the presence of other family members during treatment.","Staico, Maria Francesca; Zaffanello, Marco; Di Pietro, Giulia; Fanos, Vassilios; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.03965-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432445/,262

Objective To assess present practice and perceptions among Indian neurosurgeons with respect to type of surgeries performed, PPE usage and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Materials and Methods A 12-item questionnaire on surgeries performed in the 6 weeks prior to the survey date, PPE usage, and preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing was circulated electronically to Indian neurosurgeons from May 12, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and their responses analyzed. Results Two hundred forty-four neurosurgeons (237 males) participated in the survey; of whom, 230 had performed surgeries during the pandemic period. In total, 84.3% of respondents were performing semiemergency or emergency procedures only. N95 masks were utilized by only 83% of the respondents (n = 230) while performing surgical procedures. Only 40.9% of the respondents were satisfied regarding adequacy of available PPE. Preoperative SARS-CoV2 testing as well as testing of all asymptomatic patients prior to admission into ward/intensive care unit was perceived to be beneficial in reducing transmission risk by more than 85% respondents.

METHODS Twenty-three patients underwent DCE-MRI (using gadolinium dimeglumine) and dynamic (18)F-FDG PET at baseline and after 3 treatment cycles, unless treatment was terminated because of toxicity. Parameters for vasculature (rate constant between extravascular extracellular space and blood plasma [k(ep)] and volume transfer constant [K(trans)]), extracellular space (v(e)), tumor size (the maximal axial diameter of each included lesion [MAD]), and metabolism (glucose metabolic rates [MR(glc)]) were derived, and changes during treatment were correlated. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) served as outcome measures for the predictive abilities of pretreatment parameters and of treatment-related parameter changes. RESULTS Pretreatment MR(glc) and MAD were individually predictive for OS and PFS. During treatment, K(trans) increased significantly, but this increase could not be confirmed in a lesion-by-lesion analysis. MR(glc) decreased significantly (P < 0.001). No correlations were found for changes in DCE-MRI parameters and DeltaMR(glc). No relationship was found between changes in DCE-MRI parameters and OS or PFS. DeltaMR(glc) was able to predict OS (P = 0.008) after correction for confounders. CONCLUSION The efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy assessed by reduction in tumor metabolism does not depend on pretreatment properties of the tumor vasculature determined by DCE-MRI. Cytotoxic chemotherapy does not alter DCE-MRI-derived properties of tumor vasculature but decreases glucose consumption of tumor cells.","Vriens, Dennis; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; van Asten, Jack J A; Krabbe, Paul F M; Visser, Eric P; Heerschap, Arend; Punt, Cornelis J A; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee; Oyen, Wim J G","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.109.064790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837750/,262

The strategy is to search for 'Chronic Respiratory Disease' AND 'Pulmonary Rehabilitation' AND 'Home-PR', and identify relevant randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. Six reviewers working in pairs will independently screen articles for eligibility and extract data from those fulfilling the inclusion criteria. We will use the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the quality of evidence. We will perform meta-analysis or narrative synthesis as appropriate to answer our three research questions: (1) what is the effectiveness of Home-PR compared with Centre-PR or Usual care? (2) what components are used in effective Home-PR studies? and (3) what is the completion rate of Home-PR compared with Centre-PR? ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Research ethics approval is not required since the study will review only published data. The findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentation in conferences.

69326,A prospective randomized trial comparing subatmospheric wound therapy with a sealed gauze dressing and the standard vacuum-assisted closure device.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Stray energy transfer from monopolar radiofrequency energy during laparoscopy can be potentially catastrophic. Robotic surgery is increasing in popularity; however, the risk of stray energy transfer during robotic surgery is unknown. The purpose of this study was to (1) quantify stray energy transfer using robotic instrumentation, (2) determine strategies to minimize the transfer of energy, and (3) compare robotic stray energy transfer to laparoscopy. METHODS In a laparoscopic trainer, a monopolar instrument (L-hook) was activated with DaVinci Si (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA) robotic instruments. A camera and assistant grasper were inserted to mimic a minimally invasive cholecystectomy. During activation of the L-hook, the non-electric tips of the camera and grasper were placed adjacent to simulated tissue (saline-soaked sponge). The primary outcome was change in temperature from baseline (°C) measured nearest the tip of the non-electric instrument. RESULTS Simulated tissue nearest the robotic grasper increased an average of 18.3 ± 5.8 °C; p < 0.001 from baseline. Tissue nearest the robotic camera tip increased (9.0 ± 2.1 °C; p < 0.001). Decreasing the power from 30 to 15 W (18.3 ± 5.8 vs. 2.6 ± 2.7 °C, p < 0.001) or using low-voltage cut mode (18.3 ± 5.8 vs. 3.1 ± 2.1 °C, p < 0.001) reduced stray energy transfer to the robotic grasper. Desiccating tissue, in contrast to open air activation, also significantly reduced stray energy transfer for the grasper (18.3 ± 5.8 vs. 0.15 ± 0.21 °C, p < 0.001) and camera (9.0 ± 2.1 vs. 0.24 ± 0.34 °C, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Stray energy transfer occurs during robotic surgery. The assistant grasper carries the highest risk for thermal injury. Similar to laparoscopy, stray energy transfer can be reduced by lowering the power setting, utilizing a low-voltage cut mode instead of coagulation mode and avoiding open air activation. These practical findings can aid surgeons performing robotic surgery to reduce injuries from stray energy.","Overbey, Douglas M; Carmichael, Heather; Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Hirth, Douglas A; Chapman, Brandon C; Moore, John T; Barnett, Carlton C; Jones, Teresa S; Robinson, Thomas N; Jones, Edward L",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07605-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385708/,262

69785,Does self-management of vaginal pessaries improve care for women with pelvic organ prolapse?,2021-02-19,"INTRODUCTION Open access (OA) publishing often requires article processing charges (APCs). While OA provides opportunities for broader readership, authors able to afford APCs are more commonly associated with well-funded, high-income country institutions, skewing knowledge dissemination. Here, we evaluate publishing models, OA practices, and APCs in cardiology and cardiac surgery. METHODS The InCites Journal Citation Reports 2019 directory by Clarivate Analytics was searched for ""Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems"" journals. Sister journals of included journals were identified. All journals were categorized as predominantly cardiology or cardiac surgery. Publishing models, APCs, and APC waivers were defined for all journals. RESULTS One hundred sixty-one journals were identified (139 cardiology, 22 cardiac surgery). APCs ranged from $244 to $5,000 ($244-5,000 cardiology; $383-3,300 cardiac surgery), with mean $2,911±891 and median $3,000 (interquartile range [IQR]: $2,500-3,425) across 139 journals with non-zero available APCs ($2,970±890, median $3,000, IQR: $2,573-3,450, cardiology; $2,491±799, median $2,740, IQR: $2,300-3,000, cardiac surgery). Average APCs were $3,307±566 and median $3,250 (IQR: $3,000-3,500) for hybrid journals ($3,344±583, median $3,260, IQR: $3,000-3,690, cardiology; $2,983±221, median $2,975, IQR: $2,780-3,149, cardiac surgery) and $1,997±832 and median $2,100 (IQR: $1,404-2,538) for fully OA journals ($2,039±843, median $2,100, IQR: $1,419-2,604, cardiology; $1,788±805, median $2,000, IQR: $1,475-2,345, cardiac surgery). Waivers were available for 51 (86.4%) fully OA and 37 (37.4%) hybrid journals. Seventeen journals were fully OA without APCs, one journal did not yet release APCs, and four journals were subscription-only. CONCLUSION OA publishing is common in cardiology and cardiac surgery with substantial APCs. Waivers remain limited, posing barriers for unfunded and lesser-funded researchers.","Vervoort, Dominique; Luc, Jessica G Y; Sá, Michel Pompeu B O; Etchill, Eric W",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2021-0289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34617426/,262
70740,Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE): An Essential Educational Program for Operating Room Safety.,2017,"SCAR/WAVE proteins and Arp2/3 complex assemble branched actin networks at the leading edge. Two isoforms of SCAR/WAVE, WAVE1 and WAVE2, reside at the leading edge, yet it has remained unclear whether they perform similar or distinct roles. Further, there have been conflicting reports about the Arp2/3-independent biochemical activities of WAVE1 on actin filament elongation. To investigate this in vivo, we knocked out WAVE1 and WAVE2 genes, individually and together, in B16-F1 melanoma cells. We demonstrate that WAVE1 and WAVE2 are redundant for lamellipodia formation and motility. However, there is a significant decrease in the rate of leading edge actin extension in WAVE2 KO cells, and an increase in WAVE1 KO cells. The faster rates of actin extension in WAVE1 KO cells are offset by faster retrograde flow, and therefore do not translate into faster lamellipodium protrusion. Thus, WAVE1 restricts the rate of actin extension at the leading edge, and appears to couple actin networks to the membrane to drive protrusion. Overall, these results suggest that WAVE1 and WAVE2 have redundant roles in promoting Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation and lamellipodia formation, but distinct roles in controlling actin network extension and harnessing network growth to cell protrusion.

Viscoelastic methods (VEMs), including thrombelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (TEM), provide data on the nature of haemostatic disturbance. In this systematic review, we assessed the performance of TEG and TEM in the assessment of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were systematically searched for clinical studies evaluating TEG and/or TEM variables in COVID-19 individuals. Ten studies, with a total of 389 COVID-19 patients, were included, and VEMs were performed in 292 of these patients. Most patients (90%) presented severe COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. TEG and TEM variables showed that these patients displayed hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown, despite the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena and their clinical significance in COVID-19 patients who developed thrombosis, is still not clear. Further studies are warranted if VEMs might help to identify those at highest risk of thrombotic events and who therefore may derive the greatest benefit from antithrombotic therapy.","Slomka, Artur; Kowalewski, Mariusz; Żekanowska, Ewa",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1346-3178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401332/,262

Currently, this disease is spreading in rural and urban areas of non-endemic regions in Brazil. Recently, bats have gained epidemiological significance in leishmaniasis due to its close relationship with human settlements. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in blood samples from 448 bats belonging to four families representing 20 species that were captured in the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba areas of Minas Gerais State (non-endemic areas for leishmaniasis), Brazil. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 8·0% of the blood samples, 41·6% of which were Leishmania infantum, 38·9% Leishmania amazonensis and 19·4% Leishmania braziliensis. No positive correlation was found between Leishmania spp. and bat food source. The species with more infection rates were the insectivorous bats Eumops perotis; 22·2% (4/18) of which tested positive for Leishmania DNA. The presence of Leishmania in the bat blood samples, as observed in this study, represents epidemiological importance due to the absence of Leishmaniasis cases in the region.","Gómez-Hernández, César; Bento, Elaine C; Rezende-Oliveira, Karine; Nascentes, Gabriel A N; Barbosa, Cecilia G; Batista, Lara R; Tiburcio, Monique G S; Pedrosa, André L; Lages-Silva, Eliane; Ramírez, Juan D; Ramirez, Luis E",Parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182017001500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28831941/,262
72724,Pen Torch Transillumination: Difficult Venepuncture Made Easy.,2017,"Protein glycosylation drives many biological processes and serves as markers for disease; therefore, the development of tools to study glycosylation is an essential and growing area of research. Mass spectrometry can be used to identify both the glycans of interest and the glycosylation sites to which those glycans are attached, when proteins are proteolytically digested and their glycopeptides are analyzed by a combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods. One major challenge in these experiments is collecting the requisite MS/MS data. The digested glycopeptides are often present in complex mixtures and in low abundance, and the most commonly used approach to collect MS/MS data on these species is data-dependent acquisition (DDA), where only the most intense precursor ions trigger MS/MS. DDA results in limited glycopeptide coverage. Semi-targeted data acquisition is an alternative experimental approach that can alleviate this difficulty. However, due to the massive heterogeneity of glycopeptides, it is not obvious how to expediently generate inclusion lists for these types of analyses. To solve this problem, we developed the software tool GlycoPep MassList, which can be used to generate inclusion lists for liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments. The utility of the software was tested by conducting comparisons between semi-targeted and untargeted data-dependent analysis experiments on a variety of proteins, including IgG, a protein whose glycosylation must be characterized during its production as a biotherapeutic. When the GlycoPep MassList software was used to generate inclusion lists for LC-MS/MS experiments, more unique glycopeptides were selected for fragmentation. Generally, ∼30 % more unique glycopeptides can be analyzed per protein, in the simplest cases, with low background. In cases where background ions from proteins or other interferents are high, usage of an inclusion list is even more advantageous. The software is freely publically accessible. Graphical abstract Software increases the number of glycopeptides that get selected for MS/MS analysis.","Hu, Wenting; Su, Xiaomeng; Zhu, Zhikai; Go, Eden P; Desaire, Heather",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-9896-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27614974/,262
72743,Flexor tendons repair: effect of core sutures caliber with increased number of suture strands and peripheral sutures. A sheep model.,2014,"PURPOSE Life disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic are particularly salient for young adults. Some young adults may engage in unhealthy eating practices to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic, which could increase incidental weight gain. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of eating to cope with the pandemic with body weight change in young adults before versus after spread of COVID-19. METHODS Data included the baseline (October/2018-October/2019) and follow-up (May/2020-July/2020) assessments from an ongoing longitudinal cohort recruited from Southern California. A diverse sample of participants (54% Hispanic; age = 19.72[.47] years; N = 1,820) completed online self-report measures of weight at baseline and follow-up and were given a checklist of pandemic coping behaviors including overeating (yes/no) and eating high fat or sugary foods (yes/no) to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic. RESULTS With and without adjusting for confounders, young adults who did versus did not report overeating to cope with the pandemic gained more weight from baseline to follow-up (5.55 vs. 2.54 lbs). Unhealthy food intake to cope with the pandemic was not associated with weight change. Baseline weight moderated the association of eating coping practices with weight change such that individuals with higher baseline weight gained more weight if they engaged in eating to cope behaviors versus not (p's≤.001). CONCLUSIONS Unhealthy eating behavior to cope with the pandemic and corresponding body weight increases may be occurring in young adults. Interventions to promote healthy eating practices in young adults warrant consideration for weight gain prevention during the pandemic.","Mason, Tyler B; Barrington-Trimis, Jessica; Leventhal, Adam M",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288456/,262

Continued evolution in access technology has resulted in next generation catheters that afford improved trackability and proximal support. OBJECTIVE Assess safety and patterns of use at two high volume centers, and conceptualize usage patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 608 cases in which a 'next generation' catheter was used during 2008-2010 at Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio, USA) and throughout 2009-2010 at Emory University Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) was conducted, and the cases classified by indication. Catheter placement, distal most location, and related complications were recorded and experience summarized. We also reviewed the differences in the catheters and the rationale for catheter selection, as well as relative costs for each approach. RESULTS 311 Neuron 053, 166 Neuron 070, 36 distal access catheter (DAC) 3.9 F, 61 DAC 4.3 F, and 34 DAC 5.2 F catheters were deployed. Of these, 459 placements were in the anterior circulation, 130 in the posterior circulation, 11 in the external carotid artery, and eight were used intravenously. Complication rates were 9/131 (6.9%) for the DAC catheter group, 16/311 (5.1%) for the Neuron 053 group, and 14/166 (8.4%) for the Neuron 070 group (p=0.37, χ(2) test).

DESIGN Pre-post observational study. SETTING and Participants: 623 nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, between March 2020 and June 2020. METHODS We used GPS location data from mobile devices to approximate connectivity between all 623 nursing homes in Ontario during the 7 weeks before (March 1-April 21) and after (April 22-June 13) the policy restricting staff movement was implemented. We constructed a network diagram visualizing connectivity between nursing homes in Ontario and calculated the number of homes that had a connection with another nursing home and the average number of connections per home in each period. We calculated the relative difference in these mobility metrics between the 2 time periods and compared within-home changes using McNemar test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS In the period preceding restrictions, 266 (42.7%) nursing homes had a connection with at least 1 other home, compared with 79 (12.7%) homes during the period after restrictions, a drop of 70.3% (P < .001). Including all homes, the average number of connections in the before period was 3.90 compared to 0.77 in the after period, a drop of 80.3% (P < .001). In both periods, mobility between nursing homes was higher in homes located in larger communities, those with higher bed counts, and those part of a large chain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Mobility between nursing homes in Ontario fell sharply after an emergency order by the Ontario government limiting long-term care staff to a single home, though some mobility persisted. Reducing this residual mobility should be a focus of efforts to reduce risk within the long-term care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jones, Aaron; Watts, Alexander G; Khan, Salah Uddin; Forsyth, Jack; Brown, Kevin A; Costa, Andrew P; Bogoch, Isaac I; Stall, Nathan M",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.01.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516671/,262

The comparative effectiveness and safety among PCC products are not fully understood. METHODS Patients in an academic level one trauma center who received PCC3 or PCC4 for EWR were identified. Patient characteristics, PCC dose and time of dose, pre- and post-INR and time of measurement, fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K doses, and patient outcomes were collected. Patients whose pre-PCC International Normalized Ratio (INR) was > 6 h before PCC dose or the pre-post PCC INR was > 12 h were excluded. The primary outcome was achieving an INR ≤ 1.5 post PCC. Secondary outcomes were the change in INR over time, post PCC INR, thromboembolic events (TE), and death during hospital stay. Logistic regression modelled the primary outcome with and without a propensity score adjustment accounting for age, sex, actual body weight, dose, initial INR value, and time between INR measurements. Data are reported as median (IQR) or n (%) with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS Eighty patients were included (PCC3 = 57, PCC4 = 23). More PCC4 patients achieved goal INR (87.0% vs. 31.6%, odds ratio (OR) = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.80-54.93, p < 0.001). This result remained true after adjusting for possible confounders (AOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 2.17-51.24, p < 0.001). The post-PCC INR was lower in the PCC4 group (1.3 (1.3-1.5) vs. 1.7 (1.5-2.0)). The INR change was greater for PCC4 (2.3 (1.3-3.3) vs. 1.1 (0.6-2.0), p = 0.003). Death during hospital stay (p = 0.52) and TE (p = 1.00) were not significantly different.

Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we included 23 cases with CTDH underwent laparoscopy in our hospital between June 2015 and October 2019 was performed. The patient characteristics were recorded. We compared the diameter of hernia ring, surgery duration, intraoperative bleeding volume, means of repairing, as well as the follow-up data. Results: All the patients underwent laparoscopic diaphragmatic hernia repair, without conversion to laparotomy or thoracotomy. The operation time ranged from 60 min to 200 min (mean, 108.04 ± 42.93 min). The blood loss volume ranged from 10 to 300 ml (mean volume, 63.48 ± 71.69 ml). The postoperative hospital stayed ranged from 5 to 15 days (mean, 6.22 ± 2.11 days). The patients were followed up for 1-50 months (mean, 17.5 ± 10.90 months). No recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia was found. Conclusions: Laparoscopic repair of CTDH is featured by fast recovery, high security, and effectiveness. Reducing the hernia contents and close of the hernia ring are crucial for the surgery that is performed based on the size and location of the diaphragmatic hernia.","Liu, Qiaonan; Luan, Li; Zhang, Guangyong; Li, Bo",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2021.706824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336921/,262
74553,On the front lines of the coronavirus-vaccine battle.,2020-04-16,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To review the mechanistic evidence for early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients within the first week of ICU admission. RECENT FINDINGS There is a lack of recent large randomized controlled trials showing clinically important outcome benefits related to early enteral nutrition. Most supporting studies are based on the animal models, and explore mechanisms of benefit related to gut immunity and oxidative stress. In addition, the impact of nutrient deprivation on the microbiome recently shown in a human trial is compelling. Large randomized controlled clinical trials have emerged in the last 2 years, however, comparing minimal enteral nutrition therapy and enteral nutrition versus parenteral nutrition. They call into question the low quality of clinical evidence and the widespread support for early enteral nutrition as a primary recommendation. As a result, the questions of whether or not enteral nutrition should be initiated in the first week versus standard of care or parenteral nutrition and how clinicians justify this recommendation are raised. SUMMARY Despite the wide range of quality in the current clinical outcomes evidence, early enteral nutrition within the first week of ICU admission, delivered to the appropriate patient, promotes gut-mediated immunity, lowers metabolic response to stress, maintains microbial diversity, and improves clinical outcomes versus standard of care or parenteral nutrition therapy.","Martindale, Robert G; Warren, Malissa",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mco.0000000000000146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635598/,262

75108,"Commentary: Parental Leave Policies: Have We Come a Long Way, Baby?",2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) remains the primary synthetic osteoinductive material used in spinal fusion surgery today. The early inflammation reaction to rhBMP-2 manifesting with radicular symptoms has been previously reported in patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). There is a disagreement with regard to the factors affecting its occurrence and whether such symptoms are dose dependent. PURPOSE The purpose of this analysis was to determine the incidence of rhBMP-2-induced radiculitis and its relationship to dose. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of the prospectively collected data. PATIENT SAMPLE All consecutive patients (n=204) who underwent one- or two-level TLIF and instrumented posterolateral fusion with an off-label rhBMP-2 use were included in this analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES The patients who developed new radicular symptoms after initial improvement postoperatively and had sterile fluid collections indicative of inflammatory process, or in the absence of any structural abnormalities that would explain these symptoms on imaging studies, were deemed to have rhBMP-2-induced radiculitis. METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for all patients who developed postoperative radicular symptoms. Correlations between the total rhBMP-2 dose, dose per spinal level, and incidence of radiculitis were evaluated while controlling for age, sex, number of TLIF levels, and surgeon. RESULTS The incidence of postoperative radiculitis was 11.3% (23 out of 204). The average total rhBMP-2 dose was 4.9 mg (range=2.1-12) and the average dose per spinal level was 3.8 mg (range=1.05-12). Logistic regression analysis did not identify any significant correlations between the rhBMP-2 doses and the incidence of radiculitis (p=.6). CONCLUSION The incidence of rhBMP-2-induced radiculitis in patients undergoing TLIF is quite high, but there were no dose-related correlations found. The study, however, cannot rule out a possibility that a larger variation in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) doses could still be a factor in the development of rhBMP-2-associated radiculitis.","Villavicencio, Alan T; Burneikiene, Sigita",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2016.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27343729/,262
75324,Monitoring respiration and oxygen saturation in patients during the first night after elective bariatric surgery: A cohort study.,2017,"Background Ablation therapies for tumours are becoming more used as ablation modalities evolve and targeting solutions are getting better. There is an increasing body of long-term results challenging resection and proving lower morbidities and costs. The aim of this paper is to share the experiences from a high-volume centre in introducing computer assisted targeting solutions and efficient ablation modalities like microwave generators and irreversible electroporation. Material and methods One thousand consecutive treatments in one high-volume centre were evaluated retrospectively from prospectively collected data. Results The purpose of this paper is to present the benefits of going into computer assisted targeting techniques and microwave technology; pitfalls and overview of outcomes. The main target organ was the liver and the main indications were ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas and colorectal liver metastases. With the assistance of computer assisted targeting the local recurrence rate within 6 months has dropped from 30 to near 10%. The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases is not worse if the tumour can be retreated after a local recurrence. Multiple colorectal liver metastases can be treated successfully. Discussion The incorporation of computer assisted targeting technologies for ultrasound-, ct guided- and laparoscopic tumour ablation has been very successful and without a noticeable learning curve. The same is true for switching from radiofrequency energies to microwave generators and irreversible electroporation. Conclusion It is well worthwhile upgrading ablation and targeting technologies to achieve excellent and reproducible results and minimizing operator dependency.","Beermann, Marie; Lindeberg, Johan; Engstrand, Jennie; Galmén, Karolina; Karlgren, Silja; Stillström, David; Nilsson, Henrik; Harbut, Piotr; Freedman, Jacob",European journal of radiology open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2018.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547062/,262

In Mpro, there is a Cys-His catalytic dyad, and ligands that interact with the Cys145 assumed to be an effective approach to inhibit the Mpro. In this study, approximately 1400 cysteine-focused ligands were screened to identify the best candidates that can act as potent inhibitors against Mpro. Our results show that the selected ligands strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. Covalent docking was performed for the selected candidates containing the acrylonitrile group, which can form a covalent bond with Cys145. All atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the selected four inhibitors including L1, L2, L3 and L4 to validate the docking interactions. Our results were also compared with a control ligand, α-ketoamide (11r). Principal component analysis on structural and energy data obtained from the MD trajectories shows that L1, L3, L4 and α-ketoamide (11r) have structural similarity with the apo-form of the Mpro. Quantitative structure-activity relationship method was employed for pattern recognition of the best ligands, which discloses that ligands containing acrylonitrile and amide warheads can show better performance. ADMET analysis displays that our selected candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our combined studies suggest that the best cysteine focused ligands can help to design an effective lead drug for COVID-19 treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

76346,The fecal virome of pigs on a high-density farm.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Tumour-associated urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a critical marker of invasion and metastasis, and it is recognised as having strong prognostic relevance as well as being a therapeutic target. The specific uPA inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2, SerpinB2) specifically targets cell bound uPA and is internalised. Furthermore, preclinical studies have established the ""proof-of-principle"" of uPA-targeting by PAI-2-cytotoxin conjugates in human carcinoma models. However, these studies also suggest that PAI-2 is rapidly cleared via the renal system with low total dose reaching the tumour. In this study, a comparative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and biodistribution (BD) analysis of different forms of PAI-2 labelled with the radioisotopes iodine-123 ((123)I) and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) was undertaken. METHODS The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and BD of wild-type, ΔCD-loop and PEGylated ΔCD-loop PAI-2 labelled with the commonly used diagnostic SPECT radioisotopes (99m)Tc or (123)I were compared in mouse models of human prostate carcinoma. Whole body SPECT imaging was also performed. RESULTS Both wild-type and the shorter but active ΔCD-loop form of PAI-2 (123)I-labelled indirectly via conjugation to free amine groups (termed (123)I-Bn-PAI-2) exhibited low tumour uptake, rapid excretion and similar PK profiles. Preliminary studies with a short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 ΔCD-loop indicated an increase in blood retention time and tumour uptake. All (123)I-Bn-labelled radiotracers were largely excreted through the kidneys. By comparison, both wild-type (123)I-PAI-2 (labelled directly via tyrosine residues) and (99m)Tc-PAI-2 displayed different PK/BD patterns compared to (123)I-Bn-PAI-2, suggesting greater liver based catabolism and thus slower elimination. SPECT imaging mimicked the BD results of all radiotracers. CONCLUSION The different labelling methods gave distinct PAI-2 BD and tumour uptake profiles, with radioiodination resulting in the best non-tumour organ clearance profiles. Preliminary analyses with short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 ΔCD-loop suggest that further investigations with other PEGylation reagents are required to optimise this approach for tumour imaging. These findings impact on the use of PAI-2 for drug delivery and/or diagnostic development.","Ranson, Marie; Berghofer, Paula; Vine, Kara L; Greguric, Ivan; Shepherd, Rachael; Katsifis, Andrew",Nuclear medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2012.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817872/,262

The aim of this study is to identify specific surgical tools and methods for laparoscopic colorectal operations for obese patients, applying knowledge of previous literature as well as our expertise in both laparoscopic and bariatric operations. CONCLUSIONS Current knowledge of bariatric surgery is invaluable in establishing a ""customized"" approach for laparoscopic colorectal operations in obese patients. The instruments routinely used during surgery on patients with normal body mass index (BMI) should often be modified and substituted according to the patient's BMI.

77069,Laparoendoscopic single site surgery in pediatric urology: does it require specialized tools?,2016,"ISSUE ADDRESSED Physical activity is lower and rates of preventable common diseases are higher in regional/rural than urban Australia. Active commuting (walking/bicycling to get from one place to another) may benefit health through increased physical activity, but most evidence of its correlates come from urban studies. This study aimed to investigate associations between active commuting, socio-demographic characteristics, behaviours, total physical activity and health in a regional/rural Australian state. METHODS This study used data from the 2016 Tasmanian Population Health Survey, a representative cross-sectional self-report survey of 6,300 adults in Tasmania, Australia. Logistic regression modelling investigated associations between socio-demographic, behavioural and health characteristics and past week active commuting frequency. RESULTS In multivariable models, being younger, having tertiary qualifications, living in a socio-economically advantaged area, being physically active, having a healthy body mass index, and good/excellent self-rated health were associated with engaging in more active commuting. Inner regional dwellers were no more likely than outer regional dwellers to actively commute after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSION Strategies to promote active commuting in regional/rural areas might consider targeting older adults, those less educated, those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, those less physically active, those with poorer health, and those with higher body mass index. Research could further investigate why these groups appear to be less active for commuting purposes. SO WHAT?: Increasing physical activity and active commuting may help to reduce rates of preventable common diseases in regional/remote areas.","Stanesby, Oliver; Long, Michael; Ball, Kylie; Blizzard, Leigh; Cocker, Fiona; Greaves, Stephen; Harpur, Siobhan; Johnston, Fay; Jose, Kim; Marshall, Elaine; Palmer, Andrew J; Sharman, Melanie; Venn, Alison; Williams, Julie; Cleland, Verity",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991774/,262
77723,China bans sale of wildlife following coronavirus.,2020-02-08,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders that affect individuals throughout life. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are largely unknown, studies with animal models of colitis indicate that dysregulation of host/microbial interactions are requisite for the development of IBD. Patients with long-standing IBD have an increased risk for developing colitis-associated cancer (CAC), especially 10 years after the initial diagnosis of colitis, although the absolute number of CAC cases is relatively small. The cancer risk seems to be not directly related to disease activity, but is related to disease duration/extent, complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis, and family history of colon cancer. In particular, high levels and continuous production of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, by colonic epithelial cells (CECs) and immune cells in lamina propria may be strongly associated with the pathogenesis of CAC. In this article, we have summarized animal models of CAC and have reviewed the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlining the development of carcinogenic changes in CECs secondary to the chronic inflammatory conditions in the intestine. It may provide us some clues in developing a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of IBD and CAC in the near future.","Kanneganti, Manasa; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Mizoguchi, Emiko",Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/342637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21274454/,262

Transcription factors share their binding sites with other factors, co-factors and/or DNA-binding proteins. These proteins form complexes which bind to the DNA as one-units. The binding of two factors to a shared site does not always lead to a functional interaction. RESULTS We propose a method to predict the combined functions of two factors using comparable binding and expression data (target). We based this method on binding and expression target analysis (BETA), which we re-implemented in R and extended for this purpose. target ranks the factor's targets by importance and predicts the dominant type of interaction between two transcription factors. We applied the method to simulated and real datasets of transcription factor-binding sites and gene expression under perturbation of factors. We found that Yin Yang 1 transcription factor (YY1) and YY2 have antagonistic and independent regulatory targets in HeLa cells, but they may cooperate on a few shared targets.

Identifying patients most likely to suffer from this complication could potentially be used for future treatment selection. Reperfusion after endovascular therapy could be associated with different risk factors for HT than intravenous thrombolytics as these treatments largely differ. In this study, we aimed to identify clinical and imaging markers that are associated with HT subtypes in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) population. Methods- In this post hoc analysis, all patients with follow-up imaging were included. HT was classified according to ECASS II (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study). Variables with an association of P<0.1 were included in the multivariable logistic regression to identify clinical and radiological variables associated with petechial hemorrhagic infarction, parenchymal hematoma (PH), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Results- Of the 478 out of 500 included patients in this subanalysis, 46% had HT (n=222). Of these, 66% had hemorrhagic infarction (n=147) and 34% PH (n=75). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 7.3% (n=35) of all patients. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (odds ratio [OR], 1.05,95% CI, 1.01-1.09 per point) and absent/poor collaterals (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.42) were significantly associated with hemorrhagic infarction. Increased systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31 per 10 mm Hg) and atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.08-3.48) were associated with PH. Increased systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48) and antiplatelet use (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.08-6.3) were associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions- Clinical and imaging stroke severity parameters were associated with HT, both in hemorrhagic infarction and PH, whereas baseline patients characteristics like systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and antiplatelet use were only associated with PH or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

To further mitigate this problem, it is important to identify the drivers of under-five mortality in order to achieve the United Nations SDG Goal 3 target 2. Methods In this study, we investigated the effects of some selected risk factors on child mortality using data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic Health Survey. We modelled the relationship between child mortality and the risk factors using a logistic regression model under the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. We used the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to simulate parameter estimates from the posterior distributions, and statistical analyses were carried out using STATA version 14.1. Results Results from the frequentist framework are in line with those from the Bayesian framework. The results showed an increased risk of death among children who were delivered through caesarean and reduced relative odds of death among children whose sizes are average or large at birth and whose mothers have formal education. Conclusions There is a need for improved health facilities for better health-care for mothers and children. Education should, among other things, emphasise on the need for mothers to go for regular check-ups during antinatal and postnatal periods for improved mother and child health.","Iddrisu, Abdul-Karim; Tawiah, Kassim; Bukari, Francis Kwame; Kumi, Williams",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8168479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083485/,262

It is unknown, however, whether these antigen-activated T cells differentiate into long-lived memory T cells that are capable of mediating rapid-recall responses to tissue antigens. To test the hypothesis that pregnancy induces an alternative fate in fetal-specific maternal T cells, we used a murine model to track longitudinally fetal-specific T cells in pregnant and postpartum animals and test the response of these cells when challenged with the same antigen during sequential pregnancy or skin transplantation. Fetal-specific CD8+ T cells were robustly primed during pregnancy but failed to acquire robust effector functions. These primed cells persisted long term in postpartum animals, frequently maintained a programmed death 1 (PD-1)+ phenotype, and failed to expand or produce cytokines robustly in response to second pregnancy or skin transplantation. However, whereas there was no impact on second pregnancy as a result of the persistence of fetal-primed memory CD8+ T cells in the mother, skin grafts bearing the same antigen were rejected more rapidly. Altogether, our data suggest that fetal antigen exposure during pregnancy induces the differentiation of long-lived maternal CD8+ T cells with context-dependent, selective effector dysfunction. This programmed effector dysfunction provides temporal and systemic restraint of maternal anti-fetal alloreactivity to promote reproductive fitness efficiently, while preserving potentially protective effector T cell responses.","Barton, Brendan M; Xu, Rong; Wherry, E John; Porrett, Paige M",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.1a0316-135r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27810945/,262

Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the PACT which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in two categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine.

79430,The Impact of C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio on 1-Year Mortality after Discharge.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND The Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observation Scale (REPOS) has not yet been validated for institutionalised cognitively impaired adults. To fill this gap of knowledge, we tested psychometric properties of the REPOS when used for pain assessment in this population. METHODS In this multicentre observational study, residents were filmed during a possibly painful moment and at rest. Healthcare professionals were asked to rate residents' pain by means of a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)-proxy. Two researchers assessed pain with the REPOS and the Chronic Pain Scale for Non Verbal Adults with Intellectual Disabilities (CPS-NAID) from video-recordings. RESULTS In total, 168 observations from 84 residents were assessed. Inter-observer reliability between the two researchers was good, with Cohen's kappa 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.79]. Correlation between the REPOS and CPS-NAID for a possibly painful moment was 0.73 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79). Sensitivity (85%) and specificity (61%) for the detection of pain were calculated with REPOS ≥ 3 and NRS ≥ 4 as a reference value. Item response theory analysis shows that the item grimace displayed perfect discrimination between residents with and without pain. CONCLUSION The REPOS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess pain in cognitively impaired individuals.","Boerlage, A A; Sneep, L; van Rosmalen, J; van Dijk, M",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955082/,262

80151,Review of available methods of simulation training to facilitate surgical education.,2011,"BACKGROUND Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) is a recommended method of treatment for comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. However, the proper site of temperature measurement in MTH is still not defined. The aim of this study was to compare temperature measurements in the esophagus and urinary bladder in comatose post-OHCA patients treated with MTH. METHODS This temperature comparison protocol was a part of a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study. The study population included 36 unconscious patients after resuscitation for OHCA. The patient's core temperature was independently measured every hour during MTH in the urinary bladder and in the esophagus. RESULTS The mean temperature was lower in the esophagus (differences during induction phase: 1.04 ± 0.92ºC, p < 0.0001; stabilization phase: 0.54 ± 0.39ºC, p < 0.0001; rewarming phase: 0.40 ± 0.47ºC, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, a strong correlation between both sites was found (R² = 0.83, p < 0.001). The decrease in temperature observed in the esophagus during the induction phase was faster when compared with the urinary bladder (1.09 ± 0.71°C/h vs. 0.83 ± 0.41°C/h; p = 0.002). As a consequence, time to reach temperature < 34.0°C was longer when temperature was measured in the urinary bladder (the difference between medians of the time 1.0 [0-1.5] h, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Urinary bladder temperature measurements may lag behind temperature changes measured in the esophagus.Monitoring temperature simultaneously in the esophagus and in the urinary bladder is an accessible and reliable combination, although esophageal measurements seem to better reflect the dynamics of temperature changes, thus it seems to be more appropriate for MTH control.

Severe forms are marked by a high mortality rate. The objective of this study is to identify routine biomarkers that can serve as early predictors of the disease progression. This is a prospective, single-center, cohort study involving 330 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted at the University Hospital of Blida, Algeria in the period between the 27th of March and 22nd of April 2020. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the predictive performance of biomarkers, assessed at admission, in the early warning of progression toward severity. Multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify the independent risk for each marker. After an average follow-up period of 13.9 ± 3.5 days, 143 patients (43.3%) were classified as severe cases. Six biological abnormalities were identified as potential risk markers independently related to the severity: elevated urea nitrogen (>8.0 mmol/L, OR = 9.3 [2.7-31.7], p < .00001), elevated CRP (>42mg/L, OR = 7.5 [2.4-23.3], p = .001), decreased natremia (<133. 6 mmol/L, OR = 6.0 [2.0-17.4], p = .001), decreased albumin (<33.5 g/L, OR = 5.2 [1.7-16.6], p = .003), elevated LDH (>367 IU/L, OR = 4.9 [1.7-14.2], p = .003) and elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>7.99, OR = 4.2, [1.4-12.2], p = .009). These easy-to-measure, time-saving and very low-cost parameters have been shown to be effective in the early prediction of the COVID-19 severity. Their use at the early admission stage can improve the risk stratification and management of medical care resources in order to reduce the mortality rate.","Bennouar, Salam; Bachir Cherif, Abdelghani; Kessira, Amel; Hamel, Hadjer; Boudahdir, Adel; Bouamra, Abderrazek; Bennouar, Djameleddine; Abdi, Samia",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365513.2020.1821396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945705/,262

Clinical implementation of remote video visits may benefit from an understanding of potential barriers to participation. Methods We enrolled one hundred and thirty participants from a university-based musculoskeletal clinic with a large uninsured population. We asked participants to complete a survey, including demographics and scaled perception questions about remote video visits. Data from these surveys were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with willingness to participate in video visits, as well as the situations in which patients would consider a video visit. Results Willingness to participate in video visits was associated with the perception of video visits being more convenient (OR 3.0) and a decreased perceived importance of physical exam (OR 0.36) but not age, technology comfort, or travel distance to the clinic. Additionally, those with prior video visit experience were more comfortable with technology, perceived video visits to be more convenient, and were more willing to have another video visit. Fifteen percent were willing to have a video visit for their first visit, while 78% would participate for a routine non-surgical follow-up. Conclusion Musculoskeletal telemedicine programs can become established by focusing on people that prioritize convenience, place less importance on a hands-on exam, and are established patients.","Miner, Harrison; Ring, David; Koenig, Karl M",The archives of bone and joint surgery,https://doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2020.50024.2480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423094/,262

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom™ D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase Ⅱ promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The expression of circRNA in PBMC of mild and severe influenza pneumonia patients is significantly different, and it may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of influenza pneumonia through multiple signal pathways.","Yin, Y D; Cao, D; Shen, H; Feng, S H; Chen, X; Yang, C X; Gu, L",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20201007-02776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663188/,262
81260,Robotic partial nephrectomy: surgical technique.,2011,"PURPOSE To identify the nursing care problems related to the clinical process of disease by COVID-19. METHOD The study applied the taxonomic triangulation technique on a clinical management guide to coronavirus disease, COVID-19, from the World Health Organization. The technique is divided into the phases: extraction of knowledge in natural language about assessment, planning and intervention, translation into standard language NOC and NIC, linking to NANDA-I diagnoses, triangulation looking for diagnostic matches in the three sets, and, finally, validation by a panel of experts from a hospital and a university. FINDINGS The extraction identified 159 terms in natural language that were translated into 173 variables: 34 NOC for assessment, 19 NOC for planning, and 120 NIC for intervention. The relationships to NANDA-I diagnoses recorded 2,182 links and the triangulation returned 109 diagnoses, 54 of them for a critical situation. The panel of experts unanimously validated the 29 diagnoses with the highest number of links. CONCLUSION Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, involves a complex situation with multiple associated care problems that can be identified using the taxonomic triangulation technique. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE The links between taxonomies and the taxonomic triangulation technique are an important tool for generating knowledge. The results of this study may guide the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, as well as similar processes that occur with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","González-Aguña, Alexandra; Jiménez-Rodríguez, María Lourdes; Fernández-Batalla, Marta; Herrero-Jaén, Sara; Monsalvo-San Macario, Enrique; Real-Martínez, Verónica; Santamaría-García, José María",International journal of nursing knowledge,https://doi.org/10.1111/2047-3095.12301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798300/,262

81349,Arterial Access Port: A Shunt-Less Vascular Access Using a Blind-Ending Artificial Graft Anastomosed to the Brachial Artery.,2017,"BACKGROUND In response to growing anti-vaccine activism on social media, the #DoctorsSpeakUp event was designed to promote pro-vaccine advocacy. This study aimed to analyze Twitter content related to the event to determine (1) characteristics of the Twitter users who authored these tweets, (2) the proportion of tweets expressing pro-vaccine compared to anti-vaccine sentiment, and (3) the content of these tweets. METHODS Data were collected using Twitter's Filtered Streams Interface, and included all publicly available tweets with the ""#DoctorsSpeakUp"" hashtag on March 5, 2020, the day of the event. Two independent coders assessed a 5% subsample of original tweets (n = 966) using a thematic content analysis approach. Cohen's κ ranged 0.71-1.00 for all categories. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between tweet sentiment, type of account, and tweet content (personal narrative and/or statement about research or science). Accounts were analyzed for likelihood of being a bot (i.e. automated account) using Botometer. RESULTS Of 847 (87.7%) relevant tweets, 244 (28.8%) were authored by a Twitter user that identified as a parent and 68 (8.0%) by a user that identified as a health professional. With regard to sentiment, 167 (19.7%) were coded as pro-vaccine and 668 (78.9%) were coded as anti-vaccine. Tweet sentiment was significantly associated with type of account (p < 0.001) and tweet content (p = 0.001). Of the 575 unique users in our dataset, 31 (5.4%) were classified as bots using Botometer. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a highly coordinated response of devoted anti-vaccine antagonists in response to the #DoctorsSpeakUp event. These findings can be used to help vaccine advocates leverage social media more effectively to promote vaccines. Specifically, it would be valuable to ensure that pro-vaccine messages consider hashtag use and pre-develop messages that can be launched and promoted by pro-vaccine advocates.","Hoffman, Beth L; Colditz, Jason B; Shensa, Ariel; Wolynn, Riley; Taneja, Sanya Bathla; Felter, Elizabeth M; Wolynn, Todd; Sidani, Jaime E",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863574/,262

These probes were fabricated by photolithography and mounted in 1.5-mm diameter catheters. We measured the local impedance and thermal conductivity, respectively, of the artificially perfused liver at different flow rates and, by rotating the probes, in different directions. The results show that both the local electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity varied location to location, that thermal conductivity increased with decreased distance to large blood vessels, and that significant directional differences exist in both electrical and thermal conductivities. Measurements at different perfusion rates demonstrated that both the local electrical and local thermal conductivities increased linearly with the square root of perfusion rate. These correlations may be of great value to many energy-based biomedical applications.","Podhajsky, Ronald J; Yi, Ming; Mahajan, Roop L",Conference proceedings : ...

Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.","Kritas, S K; Ronconi, G; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-editorial-kritas; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013309/,262

Our goal is to understand how patients are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, including where they receive relevant information, how it has affected medical care, and what measures they use to protect themselves. METHODS This is a prospective online survey study at large academic practice. All patients with a neuromuscular junction disorder diagnosis code in the Duke Health System were invited to participate. RESULTS 1,848 patients were approached to participate and 75 completed the survey between April 16, 2020 and May 28, 2020. The most frequently used information sources were non-presidential federal government (75%), state government (57%), local healthcare provider (37%), and television news (36%). Non-presidential federal government (80%), local healthcare providers (55%), state government (33%) and patient support organizations (29%) were considered the most trusted information sources. Thirty-three (44%) of survey responders had attended a telemedicine visit. Patients were taking recommended precautions during the pandemic and remained very concerned (69%) about COVID-19. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores were moderate-severe in 20% of responders. DISCUSSION Health care providers, the government, and patient organizations play a critical role in communicating with the MG patient community. Use of targeted messaging strategies by these groups to convey accurate information may increase effectiveness and lead to more informed patients with reduced anxiety.","Li, Yingkai; Emmett, C Douglas; Cobbaert, Marjan; Sanders, Donald B; Juel, Vern C; Hobson-Webb, Lisa D; Massey, Janice M; Gable, Karissa L; Raja, Shruti M; Gonzalez, Natalia L; Guptill, Jeffrey T",Muscle & nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280141/,262

Innovations such as centrifugation-enhanced shell vial and multiwell plate cultures and the use of genetically engineered and mixed cell lines, coupled with faster detection of viral replication, have allowed for reasonable turnaround times for even some of the most slowly growing clinically important human viruses. However, molecular methods, in particular, the PCR, have usurped the role of viral culture in many laboratories, limiting the use of this traditional method of virus detection or replacing it altogether. Advances and improvements in molecular technology over time have also resulted in newer generations of more rapid and accurate molecular assays for the detection, quantification, and genetic characterization of viruses. For this point-counterpoint, we have asked two individuals, Richard L.

This trend is expected to continue with the broadening application of biomaterials and rapid expansion of aging populations. One major factor that limits the potential of implantable materials and devices is the foreign body response, an immunologic reaction characterized by chronic inflammation, foreign body giant cell formation, and fibrotic capsule formation. METHODS The English literature on the foreign body response to implanted materials and devices is reviewed. RESULTS Fibrotic encapsulation can cause device malfunction and dramatically limit the function of an implanted medical device or material. Basic science studies suggest a role for immune and inflammatory pathways at the implant-host interface that drive the foreign body response. Current strategies that aim to modulate the host response and improve construct biocompatibility appear promising. CONCLUSIONS This review article summarizes recent basic science, preclinical, and clinicopathologic studies examining the mechanisms driving the foreign body response, with particular focus on breast implants and synthetic meshes. Understanding these molecular and cellular mechanisms will be critical for achieving the full potential of implanted biomaterials to restore human tissues and organs.","Major, Melanie R; Wong, Victor W; Nelson, Emily R; Longaker, Michael T; Gurtner, Geoffrey C",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000001193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919260/,262
85736,Mechanical behavior of surgical meshes for abdominal wall repair: In vivo versus biaxial characterization.,2018,"Objective: To explore the clinical application value of routine indicators such as blood routine and liver and kidney function in auxiliary diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: SNK-q and other methods were used to retrospectively analyzed the differences of blood routine test, liver and kidney function and other inflammatory indexes of 30 patients with covid-19, 29 patients with other viral pneumonia, 35 patients with influenza A/B and 25 healthy persons from January 28 to February 14, 2020 in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Results: The neutrophils count increased gradually in COVID-19 group, influenza A/B group and other types of viral pneumonia group, and the difference between COVID-19 group and other viral pneumonia groups was statistically significant(H=-19.064,P<0.05); The lymphocyte count decreased gradually in the control group, influenza A/B group, other viral pneumonia group and COVID-19 group. In addition, DB, UA and GLU were also different among groups. Subgroup analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in N(F=9.581,t=-0.152,P<0.05), N%(F=5.723,t=-0.600, P<0.05), NLR(F=4.773, t=-1.161, P<0.05), PCT(F=17.464, t=-1.477, P<0.05)and CRP(F=7.656, t=-1.973, P<0.05) between patients with lung involvement +-++ and patients with lung involvement +++-++++. There were statistically significant differences in NLR(F=63.931, t=-2.815, P<0.01), AST(F=15.704, t=-1.930, P<0.01), ALT(F=35.551, t=-2.199, P<0.01), LDH(F=7.715, t=-2.703, P<0.05) and GLU(F=6.306, t=-5.116, P<0.05) between the light+common subgroup and the heavy+critical subgroup of COVID-19 clinical classification. Correlation analysis showed that clinical stage and imaging credit period were significantly correlated with NLR (r=0.406, P=0.026; r=0.397, P=0.030), ALT (r=0.403, P=0.049; r=0.418, P=0.047), LDH (r=0.543, P<0.01; r=0.643, P<0.01) and GLU(r=0.750, P<0.01; r=0.471, P=0.042). A total of 5 principal components were extracted from all the included indicators, and the comprehensive information extraction rate was 82.86%. Indicators of a large load included Ur, PCT and CRP in PC1; ALT, AST and GLU in PC2; N%, L%, L and NLR in PC3. It indicated that the indicators of acute infection, liver function and blood routine had certein warning effect on disease surveillance. The results of ROC curve analysis showed that the combined detection of N+TB+Urea was the best practice to distinguish COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia, while the combined detection of N+L+UA was the most effective solution to make a distinction between COVID-19 and influenza A/B patients. In the aspect of disease evaluation, NL+LDH+GLU+ALT combined detection represent the best diagnostic performance to distinguish the clinical stage of light+common type and heavy+critical type, achieving the AUC (ROC) to 0.904, with the sensitivity 75% and the specificity 100% at the cut-off value of 0.477. Conclusion: In addition to etiology and imaging examination, doctors can also improve the routine laboratory tests such as blood routine test, liver and kidney function to assist diagnosis and disease prediction of patients with respiratory tract infection.","Liang, Y L; Ma, Y T; Huang, K K; Luo, H D; Wang, A M; Xiong, Z; Luo, Y; Yi, B",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200629-00947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455138/,262
85837,A novel method of urethrovesical anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using a unidirectional barbed wound closure device: feasibility study and early outcomes in 51 patients.,2010,"The ongoing worldwide SARS-CoV-2 epidemic clearly has a tremendous influence on public health. Molecular detection based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, high false negative rates were reported. We describe here the development of a point-of-care (POC) serological assay for the detection of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 μL of the analyte solution containing 10 μL of serum and 70 μL sample diluent. The performance of the established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results indicated that the LFIAs for SARS-CoV-2 had satisfactory stability and reproducibility. As a result, our fast and easy LFIAs could provide a preliminary test result for physicians to make the correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections along with alternative testing methods and clinical findings, as well as seroprevalence determination, especially in low-resource countries.","Wen, Tian; Huang, Chao; Shi, Feng-Juan; Zeng, Xiao-Yan; Lu, Tian; Ding, Shou-Nian; Jiao, Yong-Jun",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an00629g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568341/,262

We report our experience with flow-diversion treatment using low-profile braided stents as a stent monotherapy procedure for treating distally located very small or uncoilable aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our data bases to identify patients with aneurysms located at or distal to the circle of Willis who were treated with stent monotherapy using low-profile braided stents. The immediate and follow-up angiographic findings and clinical status of the patients were assessed. RESULTS Twenty aneurysms in 19 patients were included in the study. The mean size of the aneurysms was 4.7 ± 2.4 mm. Patients were treated via telescopic implantation of 2 stents for 11 aneurysms; single-stent placement was used for the remaining aneurysms. The technical success rate was 95%. We observed a technical complication in 1 case (5.3%) and a late ischemic event in another (5.3%). The final angiographies during a mean follow-up of 14.7 months showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 73.7%. The complete occlusion rate of the aneurysms treated with telescopic stent placement was 81.8%. The modified Rankin scale scores of all patients at the last follow-up were between 0 and 2. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion with low-profile braided stents as a stent monotherapy procedure for very small or uncoilable intracranial aneurysms located at or beyond the circle of Willis is a promising, relatively safe, and durable endovascular procedure.","Aydin, K; Barburoglu, M; Sencer, S; Berdikhojayev, M; Coskun, B; Akpek, S",AJNR.

86860,Ambulatory varicosity avulsion later or synchronized (AVULS): a randomized clinical trial.,2015,"OBJECTIVES Renal sympathetic denervation has been studied as a potential therapeutic option for patients with therapy-resistant hypertension; however, a significant proportion of patients do not show a significant reduction in blood pressure and are classified as non-responders. The objective of the present study was to assess whether a redo renal denervation procedure increases response rates. METHODS We present a case series of three consecutive renal denervation non-responders treated with the multi-electrode radiofrequency St. Jude EnligHTN catheter after an average of 22 months. Patients were followed for 6 months. RESULTS Mean age was 66 years and two patients were male. Patients were previously treated using either ReCor's Paradise system, the Vessix V2 system or the Covidien OneShot system. Mean office blood pressure one year after the initial procedure was 187/102 mm Hg with a mean 24 h ambulatory blood pressure of 166/102 mm Hg. All patients underwent a successful redo procedure using the EnligHTN system because of persistent therapy-resistant hypertension. At 6 months a significant drop in both office and ambulatory blood pressure of -27/-6 mm Hg and -15/-13 mm Hg, respectively, was observed. No significant renal artery stenosis was observed at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with therapy-resistant hypertension who do not respond to an initial renal denervation procedure, a redo procedure using the St. Jude EnligHTN system may help to significantly improve blood pressure control.","Daemen, J; Feyz, L; Van Zandvoort, L; Van Mieghem, N M",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-017-0986-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405824/,262

The goal of this study was to analyze the perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALPs) performed at our center. Methodology. We retrospectively reviewed 300 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent RALP with a posterior dissection approach to the seminal vesicle between May 2011 and November 2013. The mean patient age was 67.2 ± 5.5 years (range: 41-78 years), and the mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, at diagnosis of prostate cancer, was 9.16 ± 6.50 ng/mL (range: 2.20-55.31 ng/mL). Results. The median duration of robotic surgery was 160 min (mean: 165 ± 40 min; range: 75-345 min). Median estimated blood loss, including that in urine, was 200 mL (mean: 277 ± 324 mL; range: 4-3250 mL). Intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications occurred in 3.0% of patients; 4 patients required allogeneic blood transfusion. As a measure of patient continence, 82.4% did not use more than 1 absorbent pad in 24 h, at 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion. RALP with an initial posterior dissection to the seminal vesicle was a safe and efficient method for controlling prostate cancer, even in these initial cases.","Yasui, Takahiro; Tozawa, Keiichi; Okada, Atsushi; Kurokawa, Satoshi; Kubota, Hiroki; Mizuno, Kentaro; Umemoto, Yukihiro; Kawai, Noriyasu; Sasaki, Shoichi; Hayashi, Yutaro; Kohri, Kenjiro",International scholarly research notices,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/565737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27379313/,262
87054,Influence of mesh materials on the expression of mediators involved in wound healing.,2011,"INTRODUCTION The objectives were to prepare, characterize and in vivo evaluate different ibuprofen (IBU) nanosuspensions prepared by ultra-homogenization, after oral administration to rabbits. METHODS The nanosuspensions produced by ultra-homogenization were tested and compared with a marketed IBU suspension for particle size, in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption. Five groups of rabbits received orally 25 mg/kg of IBU nanosuspension, nanoparticles, unhomogenized suspension, marketed product and untreated suspension. A sixth group received 5 mg/kg IBU intravenously. Serial blood samples were obtained after IBU administration. RESULTS The formulated nanosuspensions showed significant decrease in particle size. Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone K30 (PP) was found to improve IBU aqueous solubility much better than the other tested polymers. Addition of Tween 80 (TW), in equal amount as PP (IBU: PP:TW, 1:2:2 w/w) resulted in much smaller particle size and better dissolution rate. The Cmax achieved were 14.8±1.64, 11.1±1.37, 9.01±0.761, 7.03±1.38 and 3.23±1.03 μg/ml and the tmax were 36±8.2, 39±8.2, 100±17.3, 112±15 and 105±17 min for the nanosuspension, nanoparticle, unhomogenized suspension, marketed IBU suspension and untreated IBU suspension in water, respectively. Bioavailability of the different formulations relative to the marketed suspension were the highest for nanosuspension> unhomogenized suspension> nanoparticles> untreated IBU suspension. CONCLUSION IBU/PP/TW nanosuspensions showed enhanced in vitro dissolution as well as faster rate and higher extent of absorption as indicated from the higher Cmax, shorter tmax and larger AUC. The in vivo data supported the in vitro results. Nanosuspensions prepared by ultra-high-pressure-homogenization technique can be used as a good formulation strategy to enhance the rate and extent of absorption of poorly soluble drugs.","Hedaya, Mohsen; Bandarkar, Farzana; Nada, Aly","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",https://doi.org/10.1159/000516299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823524/,262

88535,Protecting and Supporting the WHO International Code During COVID-19.,2020-08-01,"CONTEXT A number of systematic reviews have evaluated the impacts of continuing professional development (CPD). These reviews, due to their focused nature, may fail to capture the full range of impacts of CPD. This scoping review aims to explore the broader impacts of CPD with the intention of developing a categorisation of the types of impact of CPD. METHODS The authors searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and ERIC databases for studies published between 2007 and 2017 that looked at the impacts of formal CPD programmes for all health professionals. Studies were independently screened for eligibility; one reviewer charted data for all included studies, a sample of 10% was reviewed by a second reviewer. The charted data were analysed using both qualitative and quantitative content analysis. RESULTS The search returned 2750 manuscripts; 192 manuscripts describing 191 studies were included in this review. Most articles were from the USA (78 studies, 41%) and included medical doctors in the population (105 studies, 55%). Twelve categories of impact were generated through conventional content analysis: knowledge, practice change, skill, confidence, attitudes, career development, networking, user outcomes, intention to change, organisational change, personal change and scholarly accomplishments. Knowledge was most commonly measured (103 studies, 54%), whereas measurement of scholarly accomplishments was the least common (10 studies, 5%). CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence takes a narrow view when assessing the impacts of CPD. Emphasis on measuring impacts as knowledge, behaviour, confidence, skills and attitudes may be due to the widely accepted four levels of evaluation from the Kirkpatrick Model or because the majority of studies used quantitative methods. The categories proposed in this review may be used to capture a broader view of the impacts of CPD programmes, contributing to the evidence base for their value and translating into CPD programmes that truly transform health professionals, their careers and their practice.","Allen, Louise M; Palermo, Claire; Armstrong, Elizabeth; Hay, Margaret",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.13922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396999/,262

89314,Cholecystitis in situs inversus totalis.,2019,"Purpose To investigate whether laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (LOC) affects ovarian reserve. Patients and Methods In 46 premenopausal women, who underwent either LOC (study group, n=26) or laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) (control group, n=20), serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured pre-operatively (AMH0), and postoperatively at 7 days (AMH1), 2 months (AMH2), and 6 months (AMH3). Changes in AMH from baseline level (AMH0) in each group were compared. Results AMH0 did not differ between the two groups (3.5 ± 3.33 in LOC vs 2.4 ± 2.72 in LM, P=0.250). AMH1, AMH2, and AMH3 in each group were also similar. However, a significant decline of AMH (ie more than 50% decrease compared to AMH0) at postoperative 6 months occurred more frequently in the LOC group than in the LM group. In the sub-analysis of the LOC group, a significant decline of AMH at postoperative 2 months and 6 months was highly correlated with bilateral ovarian tumors (P=0.001). Conclusion Compared to LM, serum AMH level showed a minimal decrease after 1 week following LOC, which did not revert to normal over 6 months of follow-up. In addition, a significant decline of ovarian reserve at postoperative 6 months was significantly more frequent in the LOC group, suggesting that LOC may have more adverse effects on ovarian reserve compared to the LM (control) group. Thus, care is required during the LOC procedure, specifically in women with bilateral tumors.","Cho, Hye-Yon; Park, Sung-Taek; Park, Sung-Ho; Kyung, Min Sun",International journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijwh.s320264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285593/,262
89511,"Acknowledgement, Reflection, and Action: The American Board of Surgery Leans into Antiracism.",2020-12-18,"PURPOSE Reaction time, classically divided into premotor time and electromechanical delay (EMD), can be determinant in daily life or sport situations. While some previous studies reported a negative impact of both muscle and mental fatigue on reaction time, the respective contributions of premotor time and EMD to the changes of reaction time remains unclear. The aim of the study was, therefore, to assess the effects of both muscle and mental effort on reaction time and its components. METHODS Thirteen subjects performed three conditions (mental effort condition, i.e., 14 min of a mathematical cognitive task; muscle effort condition, i.e., intermittent contractions of the biceps brachii; control condition, i.e., watching a documentary). Before and after each condition, reaction time, premotor time and EMD were measured during voluntary contractions of the biceps brachii. EMD was also measured during evoked contractions of the biceps brachii to separate the parts due to the onset of muscle fascicle motion and the onset of force production. RESULTS Reaction time and premotor time remained stable regardless of the condition considered (all P values > 0.05). EMD increased only after the muscle effort condition (+ 25% during voluntary contractions, no significant; + 17% during evoked contractions, P = 0.001), mainly due to an increase in the passive part of the series elastic component. CONCLUSION Our study showed that neither mental nor muscle effort has a negative effect on simple reaction time during voluntary contractions.","Le Mansec, Yann; Dorel, Sylvain; Nordez, Antoine; Jubeau, Marc",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-019-04124-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879187/,262
89527,First Rounders: Ted Love.,2020-07-10,"Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are involved in a wide variety of biological processes. Following microbial infection, there is often robust chemokine signaling elicited from infected cells, which contributes to both innate and adaptive immune responses that control growth of the invading pathogen. Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by the neuroadapted John Howard Mueller (JHM) strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) provides an excellent example of how chemokines aid in host defense as well as contribute to disease. Intracranial inoculation of the CNS of susceptible mice with JHMV results in an acute encephalomyelitis characterized by widespread dissemination of virus throughout the parenchyma. Virus-specific T cells are recruited to the CNS, and control viral replication through release of antiviral cytokines and cytolytic activity. Sterile immunity is not acquired, and virus will persist primarily in white matter tracts leading to chronic neuroinflammation and demyelination. Chemokines are expressed and contribute to defense as well as chronic disease by attracting targeted populations of leukocytes to the CNS. The T cell chemoattractant chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-inducible protein 10 kDa, IP-10) is prominently expressed in both stages of disease, and serves to attract activated T and B lymphocytes expressing CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), the receptor for CXCL10. Functional studies that have blocked expression of either CXCL10 or CXCR3 illuminate the important role of this signaling pathway in host defense and neurodegeneration in a model of viral-induced neurologic disease.","Skinner, Dominic; Marro, Brett S; Lane, Thomas E",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2018.0073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109979/,262

High doses of UV-C required for high-level disinfection were found to cause oxidation and photodegradation of endogenous species. Lower UV-C doses maintaining inactivation of clinically relevant pathogens to a level of increased operator safety were found to be less destructive to the tissue metabolome and xenobiotics. These doses caused less alterations of the tissue metabolome and allowed elucidation of the biodistribution of the endogenous metabolites.

Their professional identity may affect whether they can actively participate and be competent in care tasks during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To examine the level of and changes in professional identity of Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses as the COVID-19 pandemic builds. METHODS A cross-sectional survey composed of the Professional Identity Scale for Nurses plus 2 open-ended questions was administered to Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses through an online questionnaire. RESULTS Emergency and intensive care unit nurses had a medium level of professional identity. Participants' total and item mean scores in 5 professional identity dimensions were higher than the professional identity norm established by Liu (P < .001). The greatest mean item score difference was in the dimension of professional identity evaluation (3.57 vs 2.88, P < .001). When asked about their feelings witnessing the COVID-19 situation and their feelings about participating in frontline work, 68.9% and 83.9%, respectively, reported positive changes in their professional identity. CONCLUSIONS The professional identity of emergency and intensive care unit nurses greatly improved during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may be attributed to more public attention and recognition of nurses' value, nurses' professional fulfillment, and nurses' feelings of being supported, motivated, respected, and valued.","Zhang, Feifei; Zuo, Qiantao; Cheng, Jingxia; Li, Zhuyue; Zhu, Longling; Li, Yingying; Xuan, Lijuan; Zhou, Yu; Jiang, Xiaolian","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2021245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768231/,262

Because COVID-19 has already begun to precipitate huge increases in mental health problems, clinical psychological science must assert a leadership role in guiding a national response to this secondary crisis. In this article, COVID-19 is conceptualized as a unique, compounding, multidimensional stressor that will create a vast need for intervention and necessitate new paradigms for mental health service delivery and training. Urgent challenge areas across developmental periods are discussed, followed by a review of psychological symptoms that likely will increase in prevalence and require innovative solutions in both science and practice. Implications for new research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues are discussed to highlight the opportunities for clinical psychological science to emerge as an updated, contemporary field capable of addressing the burden of mental illness and distress in the wake of COVID-19 and beyond.

90712,Operative time and other outcomes of the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (LigaSure) versus other methods for surgical hemostasis: a meta-analysis.,2008,"BACKGROUND The use of a robotic surgical system is claimed to allow precise traction and counter-traction, especially in a narrow pelvis. Whether this translates to improvement of the quality of the resected specimen is not yet clear. The aim of the study was to compare the quality of the TME and the short-term oncological outcome between robotic and laparoscopic rectal cancer resections. METHODS 20 consecutive robotic TME performed in a single institution for rectal cancer (Rob group) were matched 1:2 to 40 laparoscopic resections (Lap group) for gender, body mass index (BMI), and distance from anal verge on rigid proctoscopy. The quality of TME was assessed by 2 blinded and independent pathologists and reported according to international standardized guidelines. RESULTS Both samples were well matched for gender, BMI (median 25.9 vs. 24.2 kg/m(2), p = 0.24), and level of the tumor (4.1 vs. 4.8 cm, p = 0.20). The quality of the TME was better in the Robotic group (complete TME: 95 vs. 55 %; p = 0.0003, nearly complete TME 5 vs. 37 %; p = 0.04, incomplete TME 0 vs. 8 %, p = 0.09). A trend for lower positive circumferential margin was observed in the Robotic group (10 vs. 25 %, p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that robotic-assisted surgery improves the quality of TME for rectal cancer. Whether this translates to better oncological outcome needs to be further investigated.","Allemann, Pierre; Duvoisin, Céline; Di Mare, Luca; Hübner, Martin; Demartines, Nicolas; Hahnloser, Dieter",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-015-3303-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552907/,262

91126,Risk factors for 30-day readmissions and modifying postoperative care after gastric bypass surgery.,2014,"BACKGROUND Treatment of children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a difficult balance between hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism. Biochemical monitoring of treatment is not well defined. OBJECTIVE Cluster analysis of the urinary steroid metabolome obtained by targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for treatment monitoring of children with CAH. METHODS We evaluated 24-h urinary steroid metabolome analyses of 109 prepubertal children aged 7.0 ± 1.6 years with classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. 24-h urinary steroid metabolite excretions were transformed into CAH-specific z-scores. Subjects were divided into groups (metabotypes) by k-means clustering algorithm. Urinary steroid metabolome and clinical data of patients of each metabotype were analyzed. RESULTS Four unique metabotypes were generated. Metabotype 1 (N = 21 (19%)) revealed adequate metabolic control with low cortisol metabolites (mean: -0.57z) and suppressed androgen and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) metabolites (-0.79z). Metabotype 2 (N = 23 (21%)) showed overtreatment consisting of a constellation of elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.62z) and low metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (-0.75z). Metabotype 3 (N = 32 (29%)) demonstrated undertreated patients with low cortisol metabolites (-0.69z) and elevated metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (0.50z). Metabotype 4 (N = 33 (30%)) presented patients with treatment failure reflected by unsuppressed androgen- and 17OHP metabolites (0.71z) despite elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.39z). CONCLUSION Metabotyping, which means grouping metabolically similar individuals, helps to monitor treatment of children with CAH using GC-MS urinary steroid metabolome analysis. This method allows classification in adequately-, over-, or undertreated children as well as identification of patients with treatment failure.","Kamrath, Clemens; Hartmann, Michaela F; Pons-Kühnemann, Jörn; Wudy, Stefan A",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916150/,262
91293,Miniature surgical robots in the era of NOTES and LESS: dream or reality?,2015,"Metal electrodeposition in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) often shows high overpotentials. Although this is often explained by the formation of a negatively charged metal complex due to the coordination of RTIL anions and the hindrance of its close approach onto the negatively charged electrode, we propose an alternative model based upon surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements under Co electrodeposition. We found that the anionic first layer exists on the negatively charged electrode, and its replacement with a cationic one and Co electrodeposition both begin at an identical onset potential. The correlation between the interfacial structure and the electrodeposition reaction that can be modified by additives indicated that the high overpotential can be mainly attributed to the restructuring of the characteristic interfacial multilayer structure stabilized by its charge order, which is required for the reorganization of solvent ions after the reduction of Co2+.","Motobayashi, Kenta; Shibamura, Yuhei; Ikeda, Katsuyoshi",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991809/,262

91722,The effect of adding active flexion to modified Kleinert regime on outcomes for zone 1 to 3 flexor tendon repairs. A prospective randomized trial.,2017,"AIMS Premix insulin is commonly used in some regions of the world, despite the higher risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain compared with basal insulin, based on the premise that it offers a simplified insulin regimen. iGlarLixi is a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio formulation that combines basal insulin glargine 100 units/mL (iGlar) and the GLP-1 RA, lixisenatide, which offers a single-injection option for treatment intensification, with improved HbA1c reductions, similar hypoglycaemia risk and more favourable bodyweight profiles over iGlar alone. This randomised controlled study directly compares, for the first time, treatment intensification with iGlarLixi versus premix insulin analogue (70/30) in adults with T2D inadequately controlled on basal insulin in combination with one or two oral antihyperglycaemic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is an open-label, active-controlled, comparative, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3b study. In total, 887 adults with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin were randomised to switch to either iGlarLixi once daily, or premix (BiAsp) 70/30 twice daily, for 26 weeks. RESULTS Overall, 887 participants have been enrolled (mean age 59.8 years, 50.2% female) from 89 centres in 17 countries. At baseline, 65.6% had a duration of T2D ≥10 years, and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.6 %. CONCLUSIONS The study directly compares efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi versus premix 70/30 in people with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin and one or more oral agents. These results will provide robust clinical data that may inform clinicians in their therapeutic management of people with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin requiring additional therapy.

With an experience of over 3,000 autologous breast reconstructions, we have refined both our surgical technique and overall approach to breast reconstruction to improve the efficiency in free flap based breast reconstruction surgery. METHODS Through a process mapping approach similar to that employed by large-scale industry, we have broken down free flap based breast reconstruction into multiple smaller processes. By looking at various steps as a simple component of the whole, we have improved our theatre efficiency to maximize patient throughput and improve our outcomes for breast reconstruction patients. RESULTS Since beginning free flap breast reconstruction surgery, we have improved overall efficiency by applying a process mapping approach. In our early experience, we undertook a single patient undergoing breast reconstruction with a free flap per theatre list, moving to two patients having breast reconstruction, and now carry out three free flap based reconstructions in a single theatre per day as a routine. Specific times are demonstrated, with no increased complication rate. CONCLUSIONS Through clearly defined processes, operative efficiency in autologous breast reconstruction can achieve three free flaps per day in a single theatre.","Marsh, Dan; Patel, Nakul Gamanlal; Rozen, Warren Matthew; Chowdhry, Muhammed; Sharma, Hrsikesa; Ramakrishnan, Venkat V",Gland surgery,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2227-684x.2015.07.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27047779/,262

Our objective focuses on the in silico study to screen for an alternative drug that can block the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a key protein in the physiology of Covid-19, necessary for the entry of the SARS-Cov-2 virus into the host's cells using natural compounds especially phenolic antioxidants, polyphenolics and pharmaceutically phytochemicals derived from the leaves of Corchorus olitorius Linn, appear to be very potential in controlling virus-induced infection. The results of the docking simulation revealed that méthyl-1,4,5-tri-O-caféoyl quinate has a stronger bond, high affinity and gives the best docking scores compared to, the co-crystallized inhibitor (PRD_002214) of the enzyme ACE2, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, captopril and simerprevir antiviral drugs. The ADMET properties, Pharmacokinetics and Medicinal Chemistry & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore Mapper enzyme revealed that the compound méthyl-1,4,5-tri-O-caféoyl quinate generates a hypothesis which can be applied successfully in biological screening for further experiments. The novel MD computational technique study showed better conformational movements result for the méthyl-1,4,5-tri-O-caféoyl quinate-ACE2 docked complex. Therefore méthyl-1,4,5-tri-O-caféoyl quinate may be considered to be potential inhibitor of the main protease enzyme of virus, but need to be investigated in vivo and in vitro for further drug development process.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Most studies on CD10 expression have dealt with tumor pathology. Since no data are available for specific role in the fetal kidney, this study aimed at investigating CD10 expression during the different phases of renal embryogenesis. To this end, the expression of CD10 was evaluated in the kidney of two human fetus and in three newborns. In both fetuses, immunostaining for CD10 was compartmentalized and mainly concentrated in the mid-deep cortex. Reactivity for CD10 was stronger in the glomerular epithelium, in proximal tubules and in metanephric mesenchymal cells. At 25 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also detected in the subcapsular regions, including some pretubular aggregates of cap mesenchymal cells and renal vesicles. At 34 weeks of gestation, we observed an increased immunoreactivity for CD10 in visceral and parietal glomerular epithelium. At 39 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also expressed in the collecting tubules and in the Henle loops. Our data show a strong expression of CD10 in all stage of human kidney development, characterized by dynamic changes and support the hypothesis that CD10 plays a relevant role in renal embryogenesis.","Faa, G; Gerosa, C; Fanni, D; Nemolato, S; Marinelli, V; Locci, A; Senes, G; Mais, V; Van Eyken, P; Iacovidou, N; Monga, G; Fanos, V","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2011.599457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22272689/,262

92963,Does Barbed Suture Repair Negate the Benefit of Peripheral Repair in Porcine Flexor Tendon?,2016,"Human-dominated environments alter the availability and quality of resources for many species, especially for scavengers that have large home ranges and plastic foraging behaviors that enable them to exploit novel resources. Along the western slope of the Andes, the modification of natural landscapes have resulted in significant declines in native prey, the introduction of non-native species, and an increase in the availability of anthropogenic resources. These factors have likely influenced the resources available to Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), however, data are lacking as to how condor's diet vary along their large latitudinal range. We evaluated differences in Andean condor diet along a ~2500 km latitudinal gradient in Chile from the heavily modified Central zone (32-34°S) to the more pristine Austral zone (44-56°S). We assessed diet composition through the identification of prey remains in condor pellets, and carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of condor feathers and their primary prey identified from pellet analysis. Our results identified medium- and large-bodied domesticated mammals (ungulates) and introduced exotic species (lagomorphs) as common prey across the study area. Condors from the Central zone had the largest isotopic niche width, probably related to consumption of anthropogenic resources with distinctly high carbon isotope values indicative of C4-based foods likely acquired from landfills or corn-fed livestock. Isotopic niches for condors from the Southern and Austral zones almost completely overlapped. Andean condor diet is strongly influenced by local conditions determining differential access to prey sources. The high dependence of Andean condors on livestock across a large geographical area, and landfills in more (sub)urban areas, may help stabilize their populations via anthropogenic resources subsidies. Long-term dependence on such resources, however, may have health costs including contaminant exposure and greater mortality risk. These data will help identify potential threats related to resource availability and use, and better inform management and conservation decisions.","Duclos, Melanie; Sabat, Pablo; Newsome, Seth D; Pavez, Eduardo F; Galbán-Malagón, Cristóbal; Jaksic, Fabian M; Quirici, Verónica",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887000/,262

To investigate the pathogenicity of this variant, TTR-2/JPN/2014, we performed experimental infection using colostrum-deprived piglets and compared the results with those from the North American type PEDV, OKN-1/JPN/2013. Fifteen newborn piglets were divided into two groups of 7-8 piglets each and inoculated orally with one of PEDV isolates maintained at the eighth passage in Vero cell culture. Although all PEDV-inoculated piglets showed acute watery diarrhoea, lethality clearly differed between both PEDV-inoculated groups. Moreover, there were differences in virus distribution and lesions on the intestines between the two PEDV-inoculated groups. Therefore, our data suggest that the OKN-1/JPN/2013 PEDV isolate is virulent, whereas the TTR-2/JPN/2014 PEDV isolate is avirulent.","Suzuki, Tohru; Shibahara, Tomoyuki; Yamaguchi, Ryosaku; Nakade, Keisuke; Yamamoto, Takehisa; Miyazaki, Ayako; Ohashi, Seiichi",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27226332/,262
93560,Natural orifice imaging of the abdominal wall.,2009,"BACKGROUND Although frailty has been associated with major morbidity/mortality and increased length of stay after cardiac surgery, few studies have examined functional outcomes. We hypothesized that frailty would be independently associated with decreased functional status, increased discharge to a nonhome location, and longer duration of hospitalization after cardiac surgery, and that delirium would modify these associations. METHODS This was an observational study nested in 2 trials, each of which was conducted by the same research team with identical measurement of exposures and outcomes. The Fried frailty scale was measured at baseline. The primary outcome (defined before data collection) was functional decline, defined as ≥2-point decline from baseline in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score at 1 month after surgery. Secondary outcomes were absolute decline in IADL score, discharge to a new nonhome location, and duration of hospitalization. Associations were analyzed using linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models with adjustments for variables considered before analysis (age, gender, race, and logistic European Score for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [EuroSCORE]) and in a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Data were available from 133 patients (83 from first trial and 50 from the second trial). The prevalence of frailty was 33% (44 of 133). In adjusted models, frail patients had increased odds of functional decline (primary outcome; odds ratio [OR], 2.41 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.03-5.63]; P = .04) and greater decline at 1 month in the secondary outcome of absolute IADL score (-1.48 [95% CI, -2.77 to -0.30]; P = .019), compared to nonfrail patients. Delirium significantly modified the association of frailty and change in absolute IADL score at 1 month. In adjusted hypothesis-generating models using secondary outcomes, frail patients had increased discharge to a new nonhome location (OR, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.37-7.69]; P = .007) and increased duration of hospitalization (1.35 days [95% CI, 1.19-1.52]; P < .0001) compared to nonfrail patients. The increased duration of hospitalization, but no change in functional status or discharge location, was partially mediated by increased complications in frail patients. CONCLUSIONS Frailty may identify patients at risk of functional decline at 1 month after cardiac surgery. Perioperative strategies to optimize frail cardiac surgery patients are needed.","Nakano, Mitsunori; Nomura, Yohei; Suffredini, Giancarlo; Bush, Brian; Tian, Jing; Yamaguchi, Atsushi; Walston, Jeremy; Hasan, Rani; Mandal, Kaushik; Schena, Stefano; Hogue, Charles W; Brown, Charles H",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384343/,262

Longitudinal, randomized, parallel-group intervention study in periodontitis patients with reduced oral hygiene quality undergoing anti-infective therapy. Patients were randomly and equally assigned to one of four groups: laypeople using a manual or powered toothbrush or dental professionals using a manual or powered toothbrush. Plaque reduction (Quigley-Hein-Index (QHI), Marginal Plaque Index (MPI)), gingivitis (papilla bleeding index), and cleaning time (seconds) were investigated. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients participated in the study. Neither the choice of toothbrush (p = 0.399) nor the use of a dental professional (p = 0.790) had a significant influence on plaque levels achieved. However, multivariate modeling indicated statistically significant differences in the external cleaning time between brushing groups, with longer time required by laypeople (p = 0.002) and longer use of the powered toothbrush (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION When the ability to carry out personal oral hygiene is reduced, external brushing by dental professionals or instructed laypeople who meet previously defined criteria such as sufficient personal oral hygiene at home could help to fill the emerging dental care gap. A combination of oral hygiene approaches adapted to the individual needs of the patients in need of external help is necessary for optimum oral hygiene.

94147,"Paleoindian ochre mines in the submerged caves of the Yucatán Peninsula, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION Gabapentin immediate-release formulations (G-IR) administered three times a day is an efficacious treatment for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), but its potential benefits may not be fully realized due to tolerability issues as well as its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties such as its short half-life, and regional and saturable absorption in the proximal small intestine. The gastroretentive once-daily formulation of gabapentin (G-GR) allows for less frequent dosing while maintaining efficacy and may also reduce adverse events (AEs) associated with high plasma concentration of gabapentin occurring during the waking hours. G-GR slowly releases the drug from the tablet to the upper small intestine, where gabapentin is best absorbed, over approximately 10 h. AREA COVERED This report reviews the development of the gastroretentive technology used in the once-daily formulation of gabapentin (G-GR), and describes the clinical development of G-GR from PK studies through the Phase III efficacy and safety studies, with comparisons made with G-IR. EXPERT OPINION The technology takes advantage of the normal physiology of the stomach in the fed state to provide gastroretention, which in turn allows for gradual release of the active ingredient over several hours to the small intestine where gabapentin is best absorbed. The GR technology used in G-GR resulted in a decreased dosing frequency from three times per day for the IR product to once daily in the treatment of PHN, while maintaining the same efficacy with an apparent reduced incidence of AEs common to G-IR therapy.","Argoff, Charles E; Chen, Cuiping; Cowles, Verne E",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2012.709231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22809245/,262

94516,The researchers taking a gamble with antibody tests for coronavirus.,2020-04-21,"The nasal mucosa is an important component of mucosal immunity. Immunogenic particles in inspired air are known to activate the local nasal mucosal immune system and can lead to sinonasal inflammation; however, little is known about the effect of this activation on the lung immune environment. Here, we showed that nasal inoculation of murine coronavirus (CoV) in the absence of direct lung infection primes the lung immune environment by recruiting activated monocytes (Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes) and NK cells into the lungs. Unlike infiltration of these cells into directly infected lungs, a process that requires type I IFN signaling, nasally induced infiltration of Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes into the lungs is IFN-I independent. These activated macrophages ingested antigen and migrated to pulmonary lymph nodes, and enhanced both innate and adaptive immunity after heterologous virus infection. Clinically, such nasal-only inoculation of MHV-1 failed to cause pneumonia but significantly reduced mortality and morbidity of lethal pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) or influenza A virus. Together, the data indicate that the nose and upper airway remotely prime the lung immunity to protect the lungs from direct viral infections.","Hua, Xiaoyang; Vijay, Rahul; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Athmer, Jeremiah; Meyerholz, David K; Pagedar, Nitin; Tilley, Stephen; Perlman, Stanley",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.99025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875310/,262
94824,Taskforce to define veterinary nursing disbanded.,2020-10-17,"BACKGROUND Reduction of nasal bone fracture can be performed under general or local anesthesia. The aim of this study was to compare general anesthesia (GA) and monitored anesthetic care (MAC) with dexmedetomidine based on intraoperative vital signs, comfort of patients, surgeons and nurses and the adverse effects after closed reduction of nasal bone fractures. METHODS Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were divided into a GA group (n = 30) or MAC group (n = 30). Standard monitorings were applied. In the GA group, general anesthesia was carried out with propofol-sevoflurane-N2O. In the MAC group, dexmedetomidine and local anesthetics were administered for sedation and analgesia. Intraoperative vital signs, postoperative pain scores by visual analog scale and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were compared between the groups. RESULTS Intraoperatively, systolic blood pressures were significantly higher, and heart rates were lower in the MAC group compared to the GA group. There were no differences between the groups in the patient, nurse and surgeon's satisfaction, postoperative pain scores and incidence of PONV. CONCLUSIONS MAC with dexmedetomidine resulted in comparable satisfaction in the patients, nurses and surgeons compared to general anesthesia. The incidence of postoperative adverse effects and severity of postoperative pain were also similar between the two groups. Therefore, both anesthetic techniques can be used during the reduction of nasal bone fractures based on a patient%s preference and medical condition.","Lee, Kyoungkyun; Yoo, Byung Hoon; Yon, Jun Heum; Kim, Kye-Min; Kim, Mun-Cheol; Lee, Woo Yong; Lee, Sangseok; Lim, Yun-Hee; Nam, Sang Hyun; Choi, Young Woong; Kim, Hoon",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2013.65.3.209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24101954/,262

96054,Is the skillset obtained in surgical simulation transferable to the operating theatre?,2014,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is currently gaining a lot of attention. NOTES is expected to further reduce surgical trauma and improve patient care due to eliminating abdominal incisions. The interest in transrectal NOTES has grown slowly, because of concerns of bacterial contamination due to transection of the rectum at the start of the procedure. However, different studies already demonstrated that transanal TME (TaTME) can be performed without major complications. This prospective study focuses on the presence and clinical significance of peritoneal bacterial contamination after TaTME for rectal cancer. METHODS Three bacterial cultures were taken at standardized locations from the pelvic area after completion of the TaTME procedure and before closure of the incisional wounds. The cultures were evaluated for bacterial count and species identification. Furthermore, C-reactive protein and white blood cell count were measured perioperatively, and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-three consecutive patients were included between July 2013 and December 2014. Thirty-nine percent (9/23) of the cultures showed gastrointestinal flora. Four of these patients (44 %) developed presacral abscesses. The remaining 61 % (14/23) of the cultures were negative. None of these patients developed infectious complications. CONCLUSION Transanal TME procedures are associated with positive cultures in more than one-third of the patients. In these patients, postoperative locoregional infectious complications are more common.","Velthuis, Simone; Veltcamp Helbach, Marloes; Tuynman, Jurriaan B; Le, Thuy-Nga; Bonjer, H Jaap; Sietses, Colin",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4089-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25669639/,262

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study of 46 subjects, 240-296 weeks' gestation. Utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy and receiver-operating characteristic analysis, impaired cerebral autoregulation was defined as >16.5% time spent in a dysregulated state within 96 h of life. Normal and abnormal Doppler indices were compared for perinatal outcomes. RESULTS Subjects with abnormal cerebroplacental ratio (n = 12) and abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility index (n = 13) were likely to develop postnatal impaired cerebral autoregulation (p ≤ 0.02). Abnormal cerebroplacental ratio was associated with impaired cerebral autoregulation between 24 and 48 h of life (p = 0.016). These subjects have increased risk for fetal growth restriction, lower birth weight, lower Apgar scores, acidosis, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage and/or death (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Abnormal cerebroplacental ratio and umbilical artery pulsatility index are associated with postnatal impairment in cerebral autoregulation and adverse outcome.","Polavarapu, Sruthi R; Fitzgerald, Garrett D; Contag, Stephen; Hoffman, Suma B",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-018-0050-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410542/,262

97084,New fund to increase certification capacity.,2020-10-17,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.","Wang, Xinggang; Deng, Xianbo; Fu, Qing; Zhou, Qiang; Feng, Jiapei; Ma, Hui; Liu, Wenyu; Zheng, Chuansheng",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2995965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156775/,262
97121,"Postoperative hypoxemia: common, undetected, and unsuspected after bariatric surgery.",2010,"RATIONALE Urgent tracheal intubation is performed frequently in intensive care units and incurs higher risk than when intubation is performed under more controlled circumstances. Video laryngoscopy may improve the chances of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt; however, existing comparative data on outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES To compare first-attempt success and complication rates during intubation when using video laryngoscopy compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy in a tertiary academic medical intensive care unit. METHODS We prospectively collected and analyzed data from a continuous quality improvement database of all intubations in one medical intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. Propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to reduce the risk of bias and control for confounding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 809 intubations took place over the study period. Of these, 673 (83.2%) were performed using video laryngoscopy and 136 (16.8%) using direct laryngoscopy. First-attempt success with video laryngoscopy was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2-83.3%) compared with 65.4% (95% CI, 56.8-73.4%) for intubations performed with direct laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched analysis, the odds ratio for first-attempt success with video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.27-3.59). The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.","Hypes, Cameron D; Stolz, Uwe; Sakles, John C; Joshi, Raj R; Natt, Bhupinder; Malo, Josh; Bloom, John W; Mosier, Jarrod M",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201508-505oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26653096/,262
98792,Rare complication of diaphragmatic hernia in a live donor nephrectomy patient.,2020-09-02,"Use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also known as e-cigarettes, in the adolescent population has significantly increased over the past several years. This rise led to an outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) in the summer of 2019. Since that time, numerous case reports and case series on vaping and EVALI have been published but the majority of literature highlights the adult population with few articles focusing on pediatric patients. Given the addictive nature of these products and the lack of full understanding of the human health effects, there is concern that use of ENDS may have lasting impacts on users, especially adolescents and young adults. The goal of this review is to critically assess published data on ENDS use in children, report our institutional experience, discuss the reasons why the use of ENDS have increased among young individuals, outline the current understanding of EVALI as it pertains to the pediatric population, and discuss future opportunities for health policy implementation.","Kaslow, Jacob A; Rosas-Salazar, Christian; Moore, Paul E",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821574/,262
98850,Vascular inflammation in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is associated with enhanced Th2 response.,2021-04-18,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopy is a step forward toward nearly scarless surgery. Concern has been raised that single-incision laparoscopy is technically more challenging than conventional laparoscopy. This study researched the performance curves of novice trainees for single-incision laparoscopy (SILS) versus conventional laparoscopy for performing two basic tasks on a box trainer. METHODS In this study, 20 novice participants performed two tasks (peg transfer and a dissection task) on a standard box trainer. All the participants practiced each task 11 times and were randomized in two groups. The first group performed the tasks on a box trainer through three incisions. The second group used a single-incision access with the same box trainer. The assessment scores for errors and time were recorded. The 2nd, 8th, and 11th runs of both tasks in both settings were assessed to objectify the gain in basic laparoscopic skills. RESULTS The performance curves for both groups improved significantly in terms of both time and errors in performing the two tasks [P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. For the first task, no significant difference in time between the two groups was observed at the top of the performance curve (mean, 212 ± 64 vs. 182 ± 48 s), but the SILS group performed with fewer errors (1.3 ± 1.5 vs. 2.7 ± 2.11). However, the difference was not significant (P = 0.10). The dissection task was performed faster in the SILS group (mean, 205 ± 78 vs. 243 ± 40 s; P = 0, 18) with fewer errors (0.7 ± 1.05 vs. 1.9 ± 2.1; P = 0. 12), but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION This study showed a significant improvement in basic skills for both the SILS and conventional laparoscopy settings after 11 repetitions. These data suggest that box training shows no significant difference between conventional laparoscopic and single-incision laparoscopic settings in terms of error or time in performing basic tasks at a low complexity level for the novice. These data also show significant improvement in basic skills over a relatively short period.","Fransen, S A F; Mertens, L S; Botden, S M B I; Stassen, L P S; Bouvy, N D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2041-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101419/,262

The anti-viral effect of GD and LiCl on virus, on virus-infected cells or on cells pre-treated by both drugs was analysed, respectively. Our results showed that GD had a direct antiviral activity, leading to complete inhibition of cell infection. The cell infection was not alleviated by either pre-treatment of cells with GD or addition of the drug post infection, confirming that the inhibitory effect of GD, unlike LiCl, on IBV is a viral factor, rather than a cellular factor. The inhibitory effect of both drugs was confirmed by infecting primary chicken embryo kidney cells. In addition, apoptosis of infected cells was positively related with cytopathic effect and could be inhibited by effective drug treatment. Our data indicate that GD and LiCl have potential to prevent IBV infection in vitro through different antiviral mechanisms. The data are helpful for using antivirals efficiently.","Li, Jing; Yin, Jiechao; Sui, Xiuwen; Li, Guangxing; Ren, Xiaofeng",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450902912184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19468938/,262

Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (Mfsd2a) is a specific marker of the BBB. However, the mechanism by which Mfsd2a influences the BBB is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Mfsd2a is essential for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) export from endothelial cells in the brain. We found that Mfsd2a and Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) form a protein complex to ensure the efficient transport of S1P. Furthermore, the S1P-rich microenvironment in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vascular endothelium dominates the formation and maintenance of the BBB. We demonstrated that different concentrations of S1P have different effects on BBB integrity. These findings help to unravel the mechanism by which S1P regulates BBB and also provide previously unidentified insights into the delivery of neurological drugs in the CNS.","Wang, Zhifu; Zheng, Yongtao; Wang, Fan; Zhong, Junjie; Zhao, Tong; Xie, Qiang; Zhu, Tongming; Ma, Fukai; Tang, Qisheng; Zhou, Bin; Zhu, Jianhong",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay8627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523984/,262

The Speech-Language Therapy (SLT) team was monitoring twenty-five users when the first cases of COVID-19 were notified in southern Brazil. Of these, it was judged that twelve patients required at least a monitoring call every two weeks. Teleconsultations were available in this first stage, on an emergency basis, during the implementation of the project in this format. The idea was to guarantee, due to the suspension of the SLT sessions, the maintenance of the care service for patients who could suffer worsening of their cases or even comorbidities. The appointments were carried out by video calls by SLT students, therapists of the extension project, and supervised by a speech-language therapist, synchronously. All conversations and orientations during the teleconsultation were conducted as calmly as possible and, in the case of infant patients, permeated by some playful activities. Telehealth has shown to be an efficient resource for the care of patients with SLT demands, enabling remote care with the same quality as face-to-face care. Besides, it has relevant potential, once there is a significant number of patients, who need SLT assessment and live in regions where there is a shortage of qualified professionals.","Dimer, Nathalia Avila; Canto-Soares, Natália do; Santos-Teixeira, Larissa Dos; Goulart, Bárbara Niegia Garcia de",CoDAS,https://doi.org/10.1590/2317-1782/20192020144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578694/,262

Traditionally, delayed GI recovery was thought to be a routine and unavoidable consequence of surgery, but this has been shown to be false in the modern era owing to the proliferation of enhanced recovery protocols. However, impaired GI function is still common after colorectal surgery, and the current literature is ambiguous with regard to the definition of postoperative GI dysfunction (POGD), or what is typically referred to as ileus. This persistent ambiguity has impeded the ability to ascertain the true incidence of the condition and study it properly within a research setting. Furthermore, a rational and standardized approach to prevention and treatment of POGD is needed. The second Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts to review the published literature and provide consensus recommendations on this important topic with the goal to (1) develop a rational definition for POGD that can serve as a framework for clinical and research efforts; (2) critically review the evidence behind current prevention strategies and provide consensus recommendations; and (3) develop rational treatment strategies that take into account the wide spectrum of impaired GI function in the postoperative period.","Hedrick, Traci L; McEvoy, Matthew D; Mythen, Michael Monty G; Bergamaschi, Roberto; Gupta, Ruchir; Holubar, Stefan D; Senagore, Anthony J; Gan, Tong Joo; Shaw, Andrew D; Thacker, Julie K M; Miller, Timothy E; Wischmeyer, Paul E; Carli, Franco; Evans, David C; Guilbert, Sarah; Kozar, Rosemary; Pryor, Aurora; Thiele, Robert H; Everett, Sotiria; Grocott, Mike; Abola, Ramon E; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott; Kent, Michael L; Feldman, Liane S; Fiore, Julio F",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000002742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293183/,262

The study examines whether this had an effect on the life satisfaction and subjective well-being among adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHOD An online survey among students in lower secondary schools in Oslo (N = 8 116, 46 % response rate) was conducted during the period with closed schools and strict infection control measures. The results were compared to equivalent surveys conducted in Oslo in 2018 (N = 13 790, 83 % response rate) and several other counties in 2020 before the COVID-19 restrictions were introduced (N = 19 799, 49 % response rate). Identical measurements were used for life satisfaction, subjective well-being and background factors. We used logistic regression analysis and corrected for sociodemographic differences. RESULTS Among boys, the proportion reporting high life satisfaction (a score of 6 or higher on a scale from 0 to 10) declined markedly, from 88 % in 2018 and 92 % in 2020 before the COVID-19 restrictions to 71 % during the period of restrictions (p < 0.001). The equivalent figures for girls were 78 %, 81 % and 62 % (p < 0.001). The social inequality in life satisfaction was smaller during the restrictions than in other periods. Concerns about illness and infection were associated with lower life satisfaction. INTERPRETATION The reduction in life satisfaction and subjective well-being can most likely be explained by the heavy restrictions placed on activities that promote well-being and by concerns about infection. The results also indicate that resourceful adolescents experienced an especially strong reduction in their life satisfaction.","Soest, Tilmann von; Bakken, Anders; Pedersen, Willy; Sletten, Mira A","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602316/,262

It has been previously demonstrated that radiotherapy is a cost-effective and necessary tool in cancer treatment. However, globally there is a growing divide between demand and supply of radiotherapy services. In low- and middle-income countries, this resource gap is particularly problematic. By region, the Asia-Pacific has been demonstrated to have the highest absolute deficit in radiotherapy services. Radiation oncologists in Australia and New Zealand are geographically well positioned to assist departments within the Asia-Pacific to help to reduce these inequities. The Asia-Pacific Radiation Oncology Special Interest Group (APROSIG) aims to support oncology professionals in the Asia-Pacific to develop safe and sustainable cancer services. Members have already contributed to multiple projects throughout the region, supported by grants and departmental funding. However, the backbone of support comes from volunteers sharing their time and expertise. The Australasian oncological community has the skills and knowledge to help not only those within our borders but also beyond. Such efforts provide the potential to develop valuable clinical, educational, research and leadership experiences whilst establishing networking opportunities throughout the most populated regions of the world. More options for growth and work in global health must be investigated, encouraging future trainees to consider a role within the global cancer community. Without prompt and continued action, the resource deficit is likely to grow and the inequity in accessing radiotherapy and other cancer services further magnified.","Hassan, Sean; Oar, Andrew; Ward, Iain; Koh, Eng-Siew; Shakespeare, Thomas P; Yap, Mei Ling",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973359/,262

Methods Out of 50,007 total survey participants, 11,946 customer service workers were included in the current study (5613 men, 6333 women). Answers to survey questions were used to define the use of CSM, emotional burden, emotional dissonance, engaging angry customers and other covariates. Emotional burden included either depressive event or stress level. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of experiencing emotional burden was calculated by logistic regression model. Interaction effect between CSM and engaging angry customer on emotional burden was also estimated. Results Out of 11,946 subjects, total of 3279 (27.4%) have experienced emotional burden. OR (95% CI) of experiencing emotional burden was 1.40 (1.19-1.64) in men and 1.25 (1.09-1.44) in women. There was gender difference in interaction effect between the use of CSM and engaging angry customers. In men, OR (95% CI) was 3.16 (1.38-7.23) with additive effect when always engaging angry customers with CSM compared to rarely engaging without CSM, while in women OR (95% CI) was 8.85 (3.96-19.75) with synergistic effect. Moreover, the risk of depressive event increased only in women with OR (95% CI) 2.22 (1.42-3.48). Conclusions Our current study highlighted association between emotional burden and CSM in both men and women service workers. Furthermore, women were affected more severely by CSM.

This extended duration of prone positioning puts patients at risk of developing orbital compartment syndrome if direct pressure to the orbit and the globe occurs and concomitant protection of the eyes is not undertaken. Objective To report 2 cases of orbital compartment syndrome, as well as optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, in the setting of prolonged prone positioning of patients in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants The cases took place from April 27, 2020, to May 4, 2020, at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Four of 16 patients in the intensive care unit required prolonged prone-position ventilation. A bedside eye examination was performed on 4 selected patients due to the observed presence of substantial periorbital edema. Main Outcomes and Measures Intraocular pressures and fundus findings of 4 patients with periorbital edema. Results Two of 4 patients who were in the prone position for extended periods of time had bilateral fundoscopic findings of optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, possibly consistent with a papillophlebitis. Additionally, both patients had a substantial increase in intraocular pressure of 2- to 3-fold in the prone position compared with the supine position. Conclusions and Relevance Prolonged prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure from periorbital edema, direct compression on the eye, and increased orbital venous pressure. Orbital compartment syndrome can be avoided by the use of protective cushioning around the eyes and maintaining the patient's head position above heart level during prone positioning. Patients with COVID-19 may also develop papillophlebitis with optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, which may be associated with a hypercoagulable state caused by COVID-19. These observations suggest awareness for the possible presence of these ophthalmic findings while treating severely ill patients with COVID-19.","Sun, Lucy; Hymowitz, Maggie; Pomeranz, Howard D",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.4988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211075/,262
105759,"Results of More Than 11,800 Sleeve Gastrectomies: Data Analysis of the German Bariatric Surgery Registry.",2016,"Radiation countermeasures fall under three categories, radiation protectors, radiation mitigators, and radiation therapeutics. Radiation protectors are agents that are administered before radiation exposure to protect from radiation-induced injuries by numerous mechanisms, including scavenging free radicals that are generated by initial radiochemical events. Radiation mitigators are agents that are administered after the exposure of radiation but before the onset of symptoms by accelerating the recovery and repair from radiation-induced injuries. Whereas radiation therapeutic agents administered after the onset of symptoms act by regenerating the tissues that are injured by radiation. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals generated by radiation exposure by donating H atoms. The vitamin E family consists of eight different vitamers, including four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Though alpha-tocopherol was extensively studied in the past, tocotrienols have recently gained attention as radiation countermeasures. Despite several studies performed on tocotrienols, there is no clear evidence on the factors that are responsible for their superior radiation protection properties over tocopherols. Their absorption and bioavailability are also not well understood. In this review, we discuss tocopherol's and tocotrienol's efficacy as radiation countermeasures and identify the challenges to be addressed to develop them into radiation countermeasures for human use in the event of radiological emergencies.","Nukala, Ujwani; Thakkar, Shraddha; Krager, Kimberly J; Breen, Philip J; Compadre, Cesar M; Aykin-Burns, Nukhet",Antioxidants,https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox7020033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473853/,262

As worldwide, the global population contains progressively more and more older individuals there is likelihood of an increased prevalence and incidence of infectious diseases due to common and emergent pathogens. The resultant increase in mortality and morbidity would be matched by the risk of functional decline and disability. Maintaining immune function at a plateau throughout life may therefore be associated with considerable cost savings. The aim of improving immune function in older individuals may be achieved through considering a therapeutic approach to rejuvenate, stimulate or support the indigenous immune system to perform in a more optimal manner. In terms of cost effectiveness a therapeutic approach may prove difficult because of issues associated with; identifying those who would benefit the most from this treatment, identifying the type of treatment which would suit them and identifying whether the treatment was successful. The alternative of supporting or providing a stronger stimulus through vaccination, whilst more cost effective, may be a more valuable option in the short term.

We investigated pulmonologists' perception of their knowledge and practices with delivery devices for COPD management. METHODS An online survey was designed by a steering committee of American Thoracic Society clinicians and scientists and conducted by a national market research firm between January 7 and 29, 2016. RESULTS Two hundred and five respondents completed the survey. Nearly 80% of the respondents believed that they were very knowledgeable in COPD management and the use of medications; 68% believed that they were knowledgeable about preventing exacerbations. Ninety-eight percent of the respondents stated that they were at least somewhat knowledgeable about devices. Many respondents (70%) stated that small-volume nebulizers were more effective than dry powder inhalers and pressurized metered-dose inhalers in the management of COPD exacerbations, and 63% believed that these were more effective in severe COPD (modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale grade 4). Only 54% of the respondents discussed device options with their patients. Physician screening for physical or cognitive impairments that could impact device choices was 53% and 16%, respectively. Seventy percent of the respondents discussed device use, whereas 9% discussed cleaning and storage during a patient's first visit. Few respondents were very knowledgeable in teaching patients how to use devices (43%) and, specifically, how to use (32%) or clean and/or maintain (20%) small-volume nebulizers. CONCLUSIONS Most respondents were confident in their knowledge about treating COPD. Fewer respondents were confident about the use and maintenance of inhalation devices, and most respondents desired to learn more about inhalation devices.","Braman, Sidney S; Carlin, Brian W; Hanania, Nicola A; Mahler, Donald A; Ohar, Jill A; Pinto-Plata, Victor; Shah, Tina; Eubanks, David; Dhand, Rajiv",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29717099/,262

107235,IBFAN News Brief: Breastfeeding Protection and Tackling Malnutrition in the Time of COVID.,2021-06-07,"We have previously shown that 207-nm ultraviolet (UV) light has similar antimicrobial properties as typical germicidal UV light (254 nm), but without inducing mammalian skin damage. The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.","Buonanno, Manuela; Ponnaiya, Brian; Welch, David; Stanislauskas, Milda; Randers-Pehrson, Gerhard; Smilenov, Lubomir; Lowy, Franklin D; Owens, David M; Brenner, David J",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rr0010cc.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225654/,262

DESIGN Case report. SETTING Tertiary-care referral center. PATIENT(S) Since November, 2008, we have performed single-port laparoscopic surgery in nine patients diagnosed with benign adnexal disease. Patients with adnexal masses or endometriosis and a body mass index of <35 kg/m(2) were selected. INTERVENTION(S) Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. In each case, a multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneum through a 1.5-2.0-centimeter umbilical incision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Feasibility, postoperative pain score, age, BMI, estimated blood loss. RESULT(S) Eight of nine cases were completed successfully, without conversion to a standard laparoscopic approach or to laparotomy. An additional 3 mm extraumbilical port was required in one patient with stage 4 endometriosis. Seven out of nine patients had earlier abdominal surgery. The operative blood loss ranged from minimal to 75 mL. Duration of hospital stay was <24 hours in all cases. Minimal use of postoperative narcotics was required, and no intraoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION(S) The LESS surgery for benign adnexal disease is feasible in patients with or without earlier surgery.

107809,Expert Intraoperative Judgment and Decision-Making: Defining the Cognitive Competencies for Safe Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Peritraumatic distress is an important predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder and although several questionnaires are available for its measurement, none of these are specific to CoViD-19. The new CoViD-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), developed in China, is characterized as a rapid compilation tool (10 minutes), easily understandable and appreciated by people. AIM The objectives of this study were: (1) the validation of the Italian version of the CPDI, and (2) the measurement of the prevalence of peritraumatic distress in this phase 1 CoViD-19. METHOD CPDI has been translated using a standard forward-backward-translation procedure and offered online to 329 people (191 females and 137 males, aged 46.49 ± 13.58 years). The CPDI showed an internal-consistency of Cronbach's α =0.916. Content validity was judged satisfactory by two psychologists experienced in stress and trauma. The construct validity is given by the high correlation with the dimensions of Intrusion, Avoidance and Hyperarousal as measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (r=0.63, r=0.57, r=0.71, respectively). RESULTS Our results are comparable to the Chinese ones. A third of people experienced symptoms of mild/moderate and severe peritraumatic distress. Females have higher scores, compared to males. Older people are more resilient, compared to younger, and those who have been in quarantine report less distress than those didn't, as evidenced by the results of the multivariate logistic regression model. High distress was associated with use of psychotropic drugs (AOR=4.28; 95% CI=1.55-11.85), sleeping remedies (AOR=4.05; 95% CI=2.07-7.94), be worried about dying in case of contagion CoViD-19 (AOR=3.33; 95% CI=1.83-6.06), female gender (AOR=2.95; 95% CI=1.58-5.53) and have a religious belief (AOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.05-3.70). To be aged 51-71 years, to have been in quarantine and to have received psychological support were variables associated with lower distress scores. CONCLUSIONS The psychometric properties of the Italian version are satisfactory and confirm that CPDI is a tool fast, non-intrusive, administered online, and therefore 'safe' in a phase with a high risk of contagion. It allows, like a psychic thermoscan, to quickly detect the needs of the population and propose equally rapid interventions.","Costantini, Anna; Mazzotti, Eva",Rivista di psichiatria,https://doi.org/10.1708/3382.33570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489191/,262

Sustained and clinically lower blood pressure has been observed in patient clinical trials. The second approach is a catheter-based strategy which denervates the renal afferent and efferent autonomic nervous system. This strategy has also been shown to be effective in drug-resistant patients, and has also been shown to decrease renin production, preserve renal function, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy.

We defined active testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in all Canadian provinces. METHODS We identified 5 groups who should be prioritized for active RT-PCR testing: contacts of people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4 at-risk populations - hospital employees, community health care workers and people in long-term care facilities, essential business employees, and schoolchildren and staff. We estimated costs, human resources and laboratory capacity required to test people in each group or to perform surveillance testing in random samples. RESULTS During July 8-17, 2020, across all provinces in Canada, an average of 41 751 RT-PCR tests were performed daily; we estimated this required 5122 personnel and cost $2.4 million per day ($67.8 million per month). Systematic contact tracing and testing would increase personnel needs 1.2-fold and monthly costs to $78.9 million. Conducted over a month, testing all hospital employees would require 1823 additional personnel, costing $29.0 million; testing all community health care workers and persons in long-term care facilities would require 11 074 additional personnel and cost $124.8 million; and testing all essential employees would cost $321.7 million, requiring 25 965 added personnel. Testing the larger population within schools over 6 weeks would require 46 368 added personnel and cost $816.0 million. Interventions addressing inefficiencies, including saliva-based sampling and pooling samples, could reduce costs by 40% and personnel by 20%. Surveillance testing in population samples other than contacts would cost 5% of the cost of a universal approach to testing at-risk populations. INTERPRETATION Active testing of groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 appears feasible and would support the safe reopening of the economy and schools more broadly. This strategy also appears affordable compared with the $169.2 billion committed by the federal government as a response to the pandemic as of June 2020.","Campbell, Jonathon R; Uppal, Aashna; Oxlade, Olivia; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara Lisboa; Lan, Zhiyi; Law, Stephanie; Oh, Chi Eun; Russell, W Alton; Sulis, Giorgia; Winters, Nicholas; Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Brisson, Marc; Laszlo, Sonia; Evans, Timothy G; Menzies, Dick",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907820/,262

Haplotypes also provide an effective way to deal with untyped SNPs. Two major challenges arise in haplotype-based association analysis of family data. First, haplotypes may not be inferred with certainty from genotype data. Second, the trait values within a family tend to be correlated because of common genetic and environmental factors. RESULTS To address these challenges, we present an efficient likelihood-based approach to analyzing associations of quantitative traits with haplotypes or untyped SNPs. This approach properly accounts for within-family trait correlations and can handle general pedigrees with arbitrary patterns of missing genotypes. We characterize the genetic effects on the quantitative trait by a linear regression model with random effects and develop efficient likelihood-based inference procedures. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed methods. An application to family data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program Ancillary Genetic Study is provided. A computer program is freely available. CONCLUSIONS Results from extensive simulation studies show that the proposed methods for testing the haplotype effects on quantitative traits have correct type I error rates and are more powerful than some existing methods.","Diao, Guoqing; Lin, Dan-Yu",BMC genetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00902-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894040/,262
109527,Response.,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE Covid-19 has affected all people, especially those with chronic diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD). Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients. METHODS 647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) was 18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders, including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status. CONCLUSION PD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.","Salari, Mehri; Etemadifar, Masoud; Zali, Alireza; Aminzade, Zahra; Navalpotro-Gomez, Irene; Fateh, Sepand Tehrani",Neurologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2021.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366530/,262
109549,No Rush to Judgment for Bariatric Surgery.,2015,"BACKGROUND A wide range of drugs have been studied for first trimester medical abortion. Studies evaluating different regimens, including combination mifepristone and misoprostol and misoprostol alone regimens, show varying results related to safety, efficacy and other outcomes. Thus, the objectives of this systematic review were to compare the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of medical abortion and to compare medical with surgical methods of abortion ≤63 days of gestation. METHODS Pubmed and EMBASE were systematically searched from database inception through January 2019 using a combination of MeSH, keywords and text words. Randomized controlled trials on induced abortion at ≤63 days that compared different regimens of medical abortion using mifepristone and/or misoprostol and trials that compared medical with surgical methods of abortion were included. We extracted data into a pre-designed form, calculated effect estimates, and performed meta-analyses where possible. The primary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy and successful abortion. RESULTS Thirty-three studies composed of 22,275 participants were included in this review. Combined regimens using mifepristone and misoprostol had lower rates of ongoing pregnancy, higher rates of successful abortion and satisfaction compared to misoprostol only regimens. In combined regimens, misoprostol 800 μg was more effective than 400 μg. There was no significant difference in dosing intervals between mifepristone and misoprostol and routes of misoprostol administration in combination or misoprostol alone regimens. The rate of serious adverse events was generally low. CONCLUSION In this systematic review, we find that medical methods of abortion utilizing combination mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol alone are effective, safe and acceptable. More robust studies evaluating both the different combination and misoprostol alone regimens are needed to strengthen existing evidence as well as assess patient perspectives towards a particular regimen.","Abubeker, Ferid A; Lavelanet, Antonella; Rodriguez, Maria I; Kim, Caron",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-01003-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635921/,262

Further, the lysosome-tropic reagents failed to inhibit, whereas the heptad repeat peptide efficiently inhibited viral entry into cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2 affects the S protein at the cell surface and induces virus-plasma membrane fusion. On the other hand, production of virus in TMPRSS2-expressing cells did not result in S-protein cleavage or increased infectivity of the resulting virus. Thus, TMPRSS2 affects the entry of virus but not other phases of virus replication. We hypothesized that the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein is a key mechanism underling this phenomenon. To test this, the TMPRSS2 and S proteins were expressed in cells labeled with fluorescent probes of different colors, and the cell-cell fusion between these cells was tested. Results indicate that TMPRSS2 needs to be expressed in the opposing (target) cell membrane to activate S protein rather than in the producer cell, as found for influenza A virus and metapneumoviruses. This is the first report of TMPRSS2 being required in the target cell for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the S protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells. Our findings suggest that the TMPRSS2 expressed in lung tissues may be a determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity at the initial site of SARS-CoV infection.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Nagata, Noriyo; Shirato, Kazuya; Kawase, Miyuki; Takeda, Makoto; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01542-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20926566/,262

Smaller formats of antibodies have been developed to throw such restrictions. These small format antibodies include antigen binding fragments, single-chain variable fragments, single variable domain of camelid antibody (so-called nanobody (Nb) or VHH). Since their serendipitous discovery, nanobodies have been studies at length in the fields of research, diagnostics and therapy. These antigen binding fragments, originating from Camelid heavy-chain antibodies, possess unusual hallmarks in terms of (small) size, stability, solubility and specificity, hence allowing cost-effective production and sometimes out performing monoclonal antibodies. In addition, these small Camelid heavy-chain antibodies are highly adaptable tools for cancer research as they enable specific modulation of targets, enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins alike. Molecular imaging studies benefit from the rapid, homogeneous tumor accumulation of nanobodies and their fast blood clearance, permitting previously unattainable fast tumor visualization. Moreover, they are endowed with considerable therapeutic potential as inhibitors of receptor-ligand pairs and deliverers of drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles towards tumors. In this review, we shed light on the current status of nanobodies in diagnosis and imaging of tumor and exploiting nanobodies revert immunosuppressive events, modulation of immune checkpoints, and as deliverers of drugs for targeted tumor therapy.","Al-Baradie, Raid Saleem",Human antibodies,https://doi.org/10.3233/hab-200425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831197/,262

In this study, we analyzed the clinical profiles of patients with COVID 19 and acute pancreatitis. METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on Research Patient Data Registry data which was pooled from five Mass General Brigham Healthcare Network hospitals. We extracted data on demographics, symptoms, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation, laboratories' profiles, imaging findings, and patient outcomes. RESULT Of 985 screened adult patients, 17 were eligible for the study, 9 (52.9%) were admitted primarily for respiratory failure and developed acute pancreatitis after a median of 22.5 days (13-76 days) from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. On contrary, eight patients presented with typical symptoms and were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, the majority with mild severity (62.5%) on admission. Patients who were admitted primarily with severe COVID-19 illness were younger (median age 57 vs. 63 years), females (55.6 vs. 25%), of Hispanic ethnicity (55.6 vs. 25%), and obese (88.9 vs. 37.5%). The median peak lipase, C reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer were higher among patients who developed acute pancreatitis later during hospitalization. Patients who developed acute pancreatitis later also experienced higher episodes of necrotizing pancreatitis (11.1% vs. 0), thromboembolic complications (55.6 vs. 12.5%), and higher mortality (37.5 vs. 12.5%). CONCLUSION Acute pancreatitis is not common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 who had acute pancreatitis on admission had more benign course and overall better outcome as compared to the patients who developed acute pancreatitis during hospitalization.","Kumar, Vivek; Barkoudah, Ebrahim; Souza, Daniel A T; Jin, David X; McNabb-Baltar, Julia",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787541/,262

It affects primarily the amygdala, cortex, and hippocampus where neurochemical changes result in altered behavior. PTSD patients display impaired fear extinction, and past events keep haunting them. The topic presents relevant sections like PTSD pharmacotherapy, associated challenges, and the novel targets and drugs for future research and therapy.Areas covered: The authors discuss the current pharmacotherapy like SSRIs, NDRIs, SNRIs, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, used to attenuate the associated symptoms. However, the primary focus being the novel and potential targets which can be explored better to understand possible future research and advanced therapy in PTSD. For the same, an account of both preclinical and clinical studies has been covered.Expert opinion: Excessive adverse effects, limited efficacy, and lower patient compliance are some of the major challenges with conventional drugs. Moreover, they correct only fewer symptoms without halting the disease progression.

METHOD A case/non-case method was used to determine adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine as the primary suspect drug between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019, for older adults (≥ 65 years). Adverse events are preferred terms (PTs) defined in MedDRA. We used frequentist approaches, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) to measure disproportionality. We used Bayesian approaches to derive information component (IC) value and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score. Signals were defined as the number of reports>3 and the lower limit of 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ROR ≥2, PRR ≥2, IC >0, EBGM>1 RESULTS: We identified 334 adverse cardiac events comprising 71 different MedDRA PTs from 2004 to 2019 for hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Strong disproportionality signals were noted for 'Restrictive cardiomyopathy' (ROR= 272.43 (138.09-537.47); EBGM= 149.78 (77.34-264.67), 'Right ventricular hypertrophy' (219.49 (85.32-564.70); 102.74 (39.67-222.81), 'Cardiac septal hypertrophy' (226.77 (78.65-653.80); 93.82 (32.19-219.81), 'Myocardial fibrosis' (57.29 (21.06-155.85); 42.99 (14.74-100.75), and 'Cardiotoxicity' (43.90 (26.66-72.27); 40.28 (24.02-63.72). CONCLUSIONS The risk of cardiomyopathy and myocardial disorders is high following exposure to hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Due to the current lack of safety data from randomized controlled trials as well as large observational studies to confirm the risk of adverse cardiac events associated with hydroxychloroquine, findings from analyses of post-marketing data may serve as interim guidance.","Nishtala, Prasad S; Gill, Sakirat; Chyou, Te-Yuan",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.5155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078448/,262
112153,"Easy, reproducible extraperitoneal pelvic access for robot - assisted radical prostatectomy.",2019,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is one of the agents causing bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), with single infection tending to be mild to moderate; the probability of developing pneumonia in BRDC may be affected by viral and bacterial combinations. Previously, we reported that bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection enhances adherence of Pasteurella multocida (PM) to cells derived from the bovine lower respiratory tract but that BRSV infection in cells derived from the upper respiratory tract reduces PM adherence. In this study, we sought to clarify whether the modulation of bacterial adherence to cells derived from the bovine upper and lower respiratory tract is shared by other BRDC-related viruses by infecting bovine epithelial cells from the trachea, bronchus and lung with BCoV and/or PM. The results showed that cells derived from both the upper and lower respiratory tract were susceptible to BCoV infection. Furthermore, all cells infected with BCoV exhibited increased PM adherence via upregulation of two major bacterial adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R), suggesting that compared with BRSV infection, BCoV infection differentially modulates bacterial adherence. In summary, we identified distinct interaction between bovine respiratory viruses and bacterial infections.","Fahkrajang, Watcharapong; Sudaryatma, Putu Eka; Mekata, Hirohisa; Hamabe, Saori; Saito, Akatsuki; Okabayashi, Tamaki",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639390/,262

We assessed the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy in a large barrel-shaped uterus after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). Methods We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus who were treated with GnRHa (leuprolide acetate) before single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the same period, 134 patients without GnRHa pretreatment were included as control subjects. Results Patients with GnRHa treatment had an average increase in hemoglobin of 3.0 mg/dL and a decrease in uterine weight of 330.9 g (40.1%). Ancillary ports were required in 2 patients in the treatment group and none in the control group. There were no differences in uterine weights, operative time, and estimated blood loss in the 2 groups of patients. The estimated average operative time was shortened by 34 min after GnRHa treatment. However, bladder and ureter injuries were marginally higher (10.3% versus 2.2%) and days of hospital stay (3.7 versus 3.1) were significantly longer in the treatment group compared with controls. Complication rates were correlated with previous operative history, pelvic adhesion, and larger uterine weight but not with GnRHa treatment and operative sequence. Conclusions GnRHa pretreatment in patients with a large barrel-shaped uterus during SPH is feasible with shortened operative time. However, the higher complication rates in these patients suggest that a weight-reduced barrel-shaped uterus that is achieved with GnRHa treatment could still be difficult and should be handled in cautious.","Torng, Pao-Ling; Pan, Song-Po; Hsu, Heng-Cheng; Chen, I-Hui; Hwang, Jing-Shiang",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2019.00019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341378/,262

114332,"No suspension of bovine TB testing, yet.",2020-03-28,"OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine the strategies used and critical considerations among an international sample of hospital leaders when mobilizing human resources in response to the clinical demands associated with the COVID-19 pandemic surge. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, qualitative research study designed to investigate strategies used by health system leaders from around the world when mobilizing human resources in response to the global COVD-19 pandemic. Prospective interviewees were identified through nonprobability and purposive sampling methods from May to July 2020. The primary outcomes were the critical considerations, as perceived by health system leaders, when redeploying health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic determined through thematic analysis of transcribed notes. Redeployment was defined as reassigning personnel to a different location or retraining personnel for a different task. RESULTS Nine hospital leaders from 9 hospitals in 8 health systems located in 5 countries (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were interviewed. Six hospitals in 5 health systems experienced a surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the remaining 3 hospitals anticipated, but did not experience, a similar surge. Seven of 8 hospitals redeployed their health care workforce, and 1 had a redeployment plan in place but did not need to use it. Thematic analysis of the interview notes identified 3 themes representing effective practices and lessons learned when preparing and executing workforce redeployment: process, leadership, and communication. Critical considerations within each theme were identified. Because of the various expertise of redeployed personnel, retraining had to be customized and a decentralized flexible strategy was implemented. There were 3 concerns regarding redeployed personnel. These included the fear of becoming infected, the concern over their skills and patient safety, and concerns regarding professional loss (such as loss of education opportunities in their chosen profession). Transparency via multiple different types of communications is important to prevent the development of doubt and rumors. CONCLUSIONS Redeployment strategies should critically consider the process of redeploying and supporting the health care workforce, decentralized leadership that encourages and supports local implementation of system-wide plans, and communication that is transparent, regular, consistent, and informed by data.","Panda, Nikhil; Sinyard, Robert D; Henrich, Natalie; Cauley, Christy E; Hannenberg, Alexander A; Sonnay, Yves; Bitton, Asaf; Brindle, Mary; Molina, George",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797460/,262

Moreover, men are 4 times more likely than women to be diagnosed with BC. The risk factors include exposure to environmental and occupational chemicals, especially tobacco smoke, benzidine and genetic factors. Despite numerous studies, the molecular basis of BC development remains unclear. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammation, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance and angiogenesis disorders may play a significant role in the development and progression of bladder cancer. The patients with bladder cancer were characterised by an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the products of lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic factors as compared to controls. Furthermore, it was shown that polymorphisms localised in genes associated with these pathways may modulate the risk of BC. Interestingly, ROS overproduction may induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which finally activated angiogenesis. Moreover, the available literature shows that both inflammation and oxidative stress may lead to activation of angiogenesis and tumour progression in BC patients.","Wigner, Paulina; Grębowski, Radosław; Bijak, Michał; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Szemraj, Janusz",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923108/,262

School-based mass drug administration (MDA) using the anthelminthic drug Mebendazole/Albendazole have succeeded in controlling morbidity associated to these diseases but failed to interrupt their transmission. In areas were filarial diseases are co-endemic, another anthelminthic drug (Ivermectin) is distributed to almost the entire population, following the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) strategy. Since ivermectin is a broad spectrum anthelmintic known to be effective against STH-we conducted cross-sectional surveys in two health districts with very contrasting histories of Ivermectin/Albendazole-based PC in order to investigate whether CDTI might have contributed in STH transmission interruption. METHODOLOGY Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in two health districts with similar socio-environmental patterns but with very contrasting CDTI histories (Akonolinga health district where CDTI was yet to be implemented vs. Yabassi health district where CDTI has been ongoing for two decades). Stool samples were collected from all volunteers aged >2 years old and analyzed using the Kato-Katz technique. Infections by different STH species were compared between Akonolinga and Yabassi health districts to decipher the impact of Ivermectin/Albendazole-based MDA on STH transmission. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A total of 610 and 584 participants aged 2-90 years old were enrolled in Akonolinga and Yabassi health districts, respectively. Two STH species (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were found, with prevalence significantly higher in Akonolinga health district (43.3%; 95% CI: 38.1-46.6) compared to Yabassi health district and (2.5%; 95% CI: 1.1-5.1) (chi-square: 90.8; df: 1; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE These findings (i) suggest that Mebendazole- or Albendazole-based MDA alone distributed only to at-risk populations might not be enough to eliminate STH, (ii) support the collateral impact of Ivermectin/Albendazole MDA on A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections, and (iii) suggest that Ivermectin/Albendazole-based PC could accelerate STH transmission interruption.","Djune-Yemeli, Linda; Nana-Djeunga, Hugues C; Lenou-Nanga, Cédric G; Donfo-Azafack, Cyrille; Domche, André; Fossuo-Thotchum, Floribert; Niamsi-Emalio, Yannick; Ntoumi, Francine; Kamgno, Joseph",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141853/,262

The functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs ( Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.","Khan, Salman Ali; Zia, Komal; Ashraf, Sajda; Uddin, Reaz; Ul-Haq, Zaheer",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1751298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238094/,262

In Spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced an emergency switch from traditional in-person education models to distance education, but little information is available regarding experiences of pediatric survivors' coping with schooling since that time. METHODS This article presents exploratory mixed methods findings from a quality improvement project including qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey conducted with parents of pediatric oncology survivors identified through neuropsychological assessment, and the use of school-based services as having educationally relevant neurocognitive impacts of disease or treatment. The interviews explored experiences of education and instructional delivery during the COVID-19 school closures in spring of 2020 and the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year and served as the foundation for a quantitative survey to determine the generalizability of findings. RESULTS Qualitative interviews highlighted 3 emergent themes regarding the shared experiences of distance schooling for children with cancer during the COVID-19 school closures: (a) attention, (b) mental health, and (c) access to instruction. A follow-up quantitative survey supported the qualitative findings and their generalizability to the schooling experiences of other children with cancer during the pandemic. CONCLUSION This article describes and explores each theme and offers suggestions for pediatric supports and changes to provider service delivery (including weblinks to access project-developed resources) as a result of ongoing pandemic-related schooling needs.","Carey, Lisa B; Ruble, Kathy; Paré-Blagoev, Juliana; Milla, Kimberly; Thornton, Clifton P; Henegan, Sydney; Jacobson, Lisa A",Journal of pediatric psychology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643698/,262

For most of such constructions, pedigree analysis was applied to evaluate the system effectiveness of a certain panel. However, such analyses were hard to be compared to each other and could be affected by many factors, such as sample size and sampling randomness. A new indicator named predicted area under ROC curve (AUCP), where ROC curve stood for receiver operating characteristic curve, was derived applying binomial distribution theory and analyzed with simulated and real cases in this study. After comparing between the values of AUCPs and results of pedigree analyses with different loci sets and kinship types, the ability of these two methods evaluating the system effectiveness was proved to be close to each other. The implementation of AUCP was much easier than pedigree analysis, because a secondary sampling or simulation was not needed. Therefore, AUCP can be a better indicator for panels targeted to pairwise distant kinship identification and we are recommending it as an indicator calculated by default for such panels.","Ma, Guanju; Cong, Bin; Li, Shujin",Forensic science international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142188/,262

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive aneurysms treated with the PED between 2009 and 2016, at 3 academic institutions in the United States, was performed. Cases with angiographic follow-up were selected to evaluate factors predictive of incomplete aneurysm occlusion at last follow-up. RESULTS We identified 465 aneurysms treated with the PED; 380 (81.7%) aneurysms (329 procedures; median age, 58 years; female/male ratio, 4.8:1) had angiographic follow-up, and were included. Complete occlusion (100%) was achieved in 78.2% of aneurysms. Near-complete (90%-99%) and partial (<90%) occlusion were collectively achieved in 21.8% of aneurysms and defined as incomplete occlusion. Of aneurysms followed for at least 12 months (211 of 380), complete occlusion was achieved in 83.9%. Older age (older than 70 years), nonsmoking status, aneurysm location within the posterior communicating artery or posterior circulation, greater aneurysm maximal diameter (≥21 mm), and shorter follow-up time (<12 months) were significantly associated with incomplete aneurysm occlusion at last angiographic follow-up on univariable analysis. However, on multivariable logistic regression, only age, smoking status, and duration of follow-up were independently associated with occlusion status. CONCLUSIONS Complete occlusion following PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms can be influenced by several factors related to the patient, aneurysm, and treatment. Of these factors, older age (older than 70 years) and nonsmoking status were independent predictors of incomplete occlusion. While the physiologic explanation for these findings remains unknown, identification of factors predictive of incomplete aneurysm occlusion following PED placement can assist in patient selection and counseling and might provide insight into the biologic factors affecting endothelialization.","Adeeb, N; Moore, J M; Wirtz, M; Griessenauer, C J; Foreman, P M; Shallwani, H; Gupta, R; Dmytriw, A A; Motiei-Langroudi, R; Alturki, A; Harrigan, M R; Siddiqui, A H; Levy, E I; Thomas, A J; Ogilvy, C S",AJNR.

Hydrogel materials that can embed living cells for use in 3D printing are called bioinks. However, there are only limited options of bioinks currently because they require the following features at once, such as printability, repetitive layer-by-layer stacking (stackability), structure stabilization, and biological properties. A polyurethane-gelatin double network hydrogel bioink was previously reported to own tunable modulus through changing the solid content, but cell viability at the high solid content is inevitably reduced. In the present study, the reinforcement effects of a metal-organic framework (MOF), zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), in the PUG bioink were evaluated. The printability, stackability, thermoresponsiveness, and shear-thinning behavior of the PUG-ZIF-8 composite hydrogels were examined. It was found that the PUG composite hydrogel containing 1250 μg/mL ZIF-8 crystals showed significant structural stability and modulus enhancement (∼2.5-fold). However, the PUG bioink containing 1250 μg/mL ZIF-8 crystals may lead to cell senescence or death. The cytocompatible concentration of ZIF-8 crystals in the bioink was about 875 μg/mL, and this concentration was much higher than the reported tolerable amount (∼50 μg/mL) of ZIF-8 for biomedical applications. The strong reinforcement effect of ZIF-8 and the drug-loading/sensing possibilities of MOFs may open new opportunities for using MOFs in 3D bioprinting applications.","Hsieh, Cheng-Tien; Ariga, Katsuhiko; Shrestha, Lok Kumar; Hsu, Shan-Hui",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411512/,262

However, the magnitude of the disparity is unclear because race-ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. METHODS We quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 notification, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial-ethnic group using combined race-ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias analysis for misclassification. RESULTS The ratio of the absolute racial-ethnic disparity in notification rates after bias adjustment, compared with the complete case analysis, increased 1.3-fold for persons classified Black and 1.6-fold for those classified Hispanic, in reference to classified White persons. CONCLUSIONS These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in notification rates. Complete reporting of race-ethnicity information is necessary for health equity. When data are missing, quantitative bias analysis methods may improve estimates of racial-ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.","Labgold, Katie; Hamid, Sarah; Shah, Sarita; Gandhi, Neel R; Chamberlain, Allison; Khan, Fazle; Khan, Shamimul; Smith, Sasha; Williams, Steve; Lash, Timothy L; Collin, Lindsay J",Epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000001314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323745/,262

118371,Coronavirus vaccines: five key questions as trials begin.,2020-03-18,"Background Dendrobii Officinalis Caulis (DC) is a well-known tonic herbal medicine worldwide and has favorable immunomodulatory activity. Various material specifications of DC are available in herbal markets, and DC is ingested by different edible methods. However, whether these specifications and edible methods are suitable or not remains unknown. Methods In this study, we evaluated the suitability of four material specifications (fresh stem, dried stem, fengdou and powder) and three edible methods (making tea, soup and medicinal liquor) based on holistic polysaccharide marker (HPM), the major polysaccharide components in DC. First, the HPMs were extracted from the four specifications of DC by the three edible methods in different conditions. Second, qualitative and quantitative characterization of the extracted HPMs was performed using high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Third, immunomodulatory activities of the extracted HPMs were evaluated in vivo. Results The results showed that the HPMs were found to be quantitatively different from various specification of DC and edible methods. In vivo analysis indicated that the HPMs exerted positive effects on innate immune responses by increment in proliferation of splenocytes, secretion of IL-2 and cytotoxicity activity of NK cells. Moreover, the dosage amount of HPM should be defined as a certain range, but not the larger the better, for exerting strong immunological activities. Conclusion According to the both chemical and biological results, fengdou by boiling with water for 4 h is the most recommended specification and edible method for DC.","Cao, Zi-Jun; Yip, Ka-Man; Jiang, Yi-Guo; Ji, Shi-Liang; Ruan, Jian-Qing; Wang, Cheng; Chen, Hu-Biao",Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-0300-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426031/,262

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between January 2000 and May 2017. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Meta-analyses were conducted for relative measures of effect estimates. PARTICIPANTS Patients admitted to acute general medical and surgical wards, and subacute rehabilitation wards. INTERVENTION All services delivered by allied health professionals during weekends (Saturday and/or Sunday). This study limited allied health professions to: occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work, speech pathology, dietetics, art therapy, chiropractic, exercise physiology, music therapy, oral health (not dentistry), osteopathy, podiatry, psychology, and allied health assistants. OUTCOME MEASURES Hospital length of stay, hospital re-admission, adverse events, discharge destination, functional independence, health-related quality of life, and cost of hospital care. RESULTS Nineteen articles (20 studies) were identified, comprising 10 randomised and 10 non-randomised trials. Physiotherapy was the most commonly investigated profession. A meta-analysis of randomised, controlled trials showed that providing additional weekend allied health services in subacute rehabilitation wards reduced hospital length of stay by 2.35days (95% CI 0.45 to 4.24, I2=0%), and may be a cost-effective way to improve function (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.19, I2=0%), and health-related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.20, I2=0%). For acute general medical and surgical hospital wards, it was unclear whether the weekend allied health service model provided in the two identified randomised trials led to significant changes in measured outcomes.

We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman who presented for elective repeat embolization of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm with some residual aneurysmal filling. During the procedure the patient developed severe vasospasm due to vessel irritation and this led us to proceed to deploy the PED through a biaxial construct composed of the 6 French Envoy MPD DA XB, and the Marksman catheters. The biaxial construct in select patients may provide the required stability while eliminating the need for an intermediate catheter, minimizing embolic risk, and allowing for less irritation to the vessel.

119144,"Development and Evaluation of Motion-activated System for Improved Chest Drainage: Bench, In Vivo Results, and Pilot Clinical Use of Technology.",2020-06-03,"The replication of enteroviruses is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi network transport that blocks activation of guanine exchange factors (GEFs) of the Arf GTPases. Mammalian cells contain three BFA-sensitive Arf GEFs: GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2. Here, we show that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication is insensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which contain a BFA-resistant GBF1 due to mutation M832L. Further evidence for a critical role of GBF1 stems from the observations that viral RNA replication is inhibited upon knockdown of GBF1 by RNA interference and that replication in the presence of BFA is rescued upon overexpression of active, but not inactive, GBF1. Overexpression of Arf proteins or Rab1B, a GTPase that induces GBF1 recruitment to membranes, failed to rescue RNA replication in the presence of BFA. Additionally, the importance of the interaction between enterovirus protein 3A and GBF1 for viral RNA replication was investigated. For this, the rescue from BFA inhibition of wild-type (wt) replicons and that of mutant replicons of both CVB3 and poliovirus (PV) carrying a 3A protein that is impaired in binding GBF1 were compared. The BFA-resistant GBF1-M832L protein efficiently rescued RNA replication of both wt and mutant CVB3 and PV replicons in the presence of BFA. However, another BFA-resistant GBF1 protein, GBF1-A795E, also efficiently rescued RNA replication of the wt replicons, but not that of mutant replicons, in the presence of BFA. In conclusion, this study identifies a critical role for GBF1 in CVB3 RNA replication, but the importance of the 3A-GBF1 interaction requires further study.","Lanke, Kjerstin H W; van der Schaar, Hilde M; Belov, George A; Feng, Qian; Duijsings, Daniël; Jackson, Catherine L; Ehrenfeld, Ellie; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01244-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740986/,262
119312,Uterosacral ligament vaginal vault suspension using delayed absorbable monofilament suture.,2011,"OBJECTIVES To develop and validate a proof-of-concept convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning system (DLS) that classifies common hepatic lesions on multi-phasic MRI. METHODS A custom CNN was engineered by iteratively optimizing the network architecture and training cases, finally consisting of three convolutional layers with associated rectified linear units, two maximum pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Four hundred ninety-four hepatic lesions with typical imaging features from six categories were utilized, divided into training (n = 434) and test (n = 60) sets. Established augmentation techniques were used to generate 43,400 training samples. An Adam optimizer was used for training. Monte Carlo cross-validation was performed. After model engineering was finalized, classification accuracy for the final CNN was compared with two board-certified radiologists on an identical unseen test set. RESULTS The DLS demonstrated a 92% accuracy, a 92% sensitivity (Sn), and a 98% specificity (Sp). Test set performance in a single run of random unseen cases showed an average 90% Sn and 98% Sp. The average Sn/Sp on these same cases for radiologists was 82.5%/96.5%. Results showed a 90% Sn for classifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to 60%/70% for radiologists. For HCC classification, the true positive and false positive rates were 93.5% and 1.6%, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.992. Computation time per lesion was 5.6 ms. CONCLUSION This preliminary deep learning study demonstrated feasibility for classifying lesions with typical imaging features from six common hepatic lesion types, motivating future studies with larger multi-institutional datasets and more complex imaging appearances. KEY POINTS • Deep learning demonstrates high performance in the classification of liver lesions on volumetric multi-phasic MRI, showing potential as an eventual decision-support tool for radiologists. • Demonstrating a classification runtime of a few milliseconds per lesion, a deep learning system could be incorporated into the clinical workflow in a time-efficient manner.","Hamm, Charlie A; Wang, Clinton J; Savic, Lynn J; Ferrante, Marc; Schobert, Isabel; Schlachter, Todd; Lin, MingDe; Duncan, James S; Weinreb, Jeffrey C; Chapiro, Julius; Letzen, Brian",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06205-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016442/,262
119612,"CRISPR enhancement, coronavirus source and a controversial appointment.",2020-02-01,"BACKGROUND Choosing an appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT) is important in pediatric patients as an inappropriately sized ETT may result in multiple endotracheal intubation attempts or excessive pressure on the tracheal mucosa with the potential for airway damage. Although age-based formulas are generally used with choice of an ETT based on the internal diameter (ID), measurements of the outer diameter (OD) of the ETT would seem to be a more scientific approach to determine the proper size of an ETT. However, the variable OD of the ETT despite the same ID makes the selection of a proper sized ETT more difficult. The current study compares airway dimensions measured using computed tomography (CT) with the OD of ETTs from various manufacturers. METHODS The outer diameter of commonly used ETTs (12 cuffed and 5 uncuffed) were measured and compared with CT-based cricoid measurements obtained from a previous study involving 130 pediatric patients, ranging in age from 1 month to 10 years. These data were used to determine the likelihood of a clinically acceptable match. RESULTS The differences of the cricoid dimensions between the 5th and the 95th percentile in each group ranged from a minimum of 2.23mm to a maximum of 6.51mm. Depending on the manufacturer, there was significant variation in the OD of the ETTs with the same ID. These discrepancies, which varied according to manufacturer and were greater with uncuffed as compared to cuffed ETTs, impacted the chances of an acceptable fit with the cricoid diameters. CONCLUSION When choosing an ETT, age-based formulas which use the ID may not be uniformly accurate in ensuring the appropriately-sized ETT given the variation in the OD despite the same ID. These issues further support the use of cuffed ETTs as the variation in fit can be adjusted by inflation of the cuff to provide an adequate tracheal seal.","Rafiq, Mahmood; Wani, Tariq M; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Tobias, Joseph D",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2016.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240488/,262

This study aimed to analyse the spatial characteristics, distribution, and influence of nitrogen forms in two different river catchments situated in eastern China. Using sequential extraction methods, the study divided sediment nitrogen into four forms, namely, an ion-exchangeable form (IEF-N), weak acid-extractable form (WAEF-N), strong alkali-extractable form (SAEF-N), and strong oxidant-extractable form (SOEF-N). The results for the two catchments showed significant differences in the physicochemical properties as well as variations in space. The mean proportion of total transferable nitrogen (TTN) in the Anhe, Suihe, Dongtiaoxi, and Xitiaoxi rivers accounted for 50.64%, 32.87%, 34.63%, and 40.45%, respectively. The results also revealed a higher total TTN in the Hongze watershed than in the Tiaoxi watershed. The order of mean TTN in sediments from the Hongze watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > IEF-N > WAEF-N, whereas that for the Tiaoxi watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > WAEF-N > IEF-N. The distribution of nitrogen forms in the sediments was significantly impacted by the sediment composition and environmental factors, as shown by correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA).","Marip, Ja Bawk; Yuan, Xuyin; Zhu, Hai; Xu, Jian; Ye, Hongmeng; Zhou, Huihua; Nooni, Isaac Kwesi; Amankwah, Solomon Obiri Yeboah; Prempeh, Nana Agyemang; Norgbey, Eyram",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08283-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388827/,262

Here's how I'm planning to stay productive.,2020-04-01,"The coffee berry borer (CBB) is one of the main coffee pests in the world including Colombia. This pest is difficult to manage because of its cryptic habits and the continuous availability of coffee fruits. Among the new management strategies being tested is the use of volatile compounds as insect repellents. In this work, the behavioral response of female adult CBBs to terpenes previously identified in the CBB-repellent plant species Lantana camara was evaluated. α-Terpinene, (R)-limonene, farnesene and β-caryophyllene terpenes were tested via a Y-tube olfactometer in which ripe coffee fruits were accompanied by terpenes at concentrations between 25 and 200 ppm. Only β-caryophyllene induced a significant and consistent CBB repellent effect at all tested doses. The protective effect of microencapsulated β-caryophyllene was then determined under laboratory conditions by incorporating the terpene in a colloidosome-gel system at 2.8 × 105 ng/h in the middle of coffee fruits with adult CBBs. The coffee fruits in turn presented a decrease in fruit infestation. Furthermore, the protection of coffee fruits when β-caryophyllene gels were hung in coffee trees was evaluated in the field; infestations were artificially induced by the use of raisins (CBB-infested old coffee fruits) placed on the ground. Compared with unprotected trees, the trees treated with caryophyllene gels exhibited a 33 to 45% lower degree of infestation. Taken together, the results show that β-caryophyllene is a promising compound for an integrated pest management (IPM) program in commercial coffee plantations.","Góngora, Carmenza E; Tapias, Johanna; Jaramillo, Jorge; Medina, Ruben; Gonzalez, Sebastian; Casanova, Herley; Ortiz, Aristófeles; Benavides, Pablo",Journal of chemical ecology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10886-020-01202-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803512/,262

A follow-up study (Quilici et al. in Surg Endosc 23(11):2620-2623, 2009) to a novel laparoscopic approach introduced in 2009 and performed in 49 patients is presented. METHODS All procedures were performed via laparoscopy. Thirty-two patients underwent a Nissen Fundoplication, eleven a reduction of the PEH with a Nissen fundoplication, two without a fundoplication, and four with a Collis-Nissen fundoplication. In all patients, the left hepatic lobe was freed, repositioned, and anchored under and inferior to the gastroesophageal junction, propping the gastroesophageal junction anteriorly. This maneuver entirely covers and closes the diaphragmatic defect. RESULTS At the time of laparoscopy, several patients were found not to be suitable candidates for this procedure (morphology of the left hepatic lobe). Forty-nine procedures were completed. One patient was re-explored on POD 2 for a tight hiatus post-Collis fundoplication. Post-operatively, all other patients did well without notable, unusual complaints. The average length of stay was 2.2 days. Although not statistically significant, 43 patients had no recurrence of symptoms with the longest follow-up at 10 years, two patients were lost to follow-up, one patient had a recurrence of the PEH and three patients stated they were experiencing some form of gastroesophageal reflux requiring medical management. CONCLUSION In selected patients, patients with an ""at-risk"" crural closure during a laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure or PEH can safely be managed via a laparoscopic anti-reflux procedure with the hepatic shoulder technique.

DESIGN Randomized clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING Tertiary hospital. PATIENTS Forty patients with unilateral ovarian endometrioma (mean diameter, 3-10 cm) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the barbed suture group or the conventional suture group. INTERVENTIONS The endometrioma bed was sutured either with unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) or conventional suture (Vicryl; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Two layers of continuous sutures were used to control bleeding from the endometrioma bed and to reapproximate the ovarian edges. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The degree of suturing difficulty was evaluated by the surgeons using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 1 (least difficult suturing) to 10 (most difficult suturing). Operating time and suturing time were significantly shorter in the barbed suture group (43.3 ± 10.54 vs 52.8 ± 9.69 minutes; p = .005 and 8.85 ± 2.52 vs 15.7 ± 4.12 minutes; p < .001, respectively). Suturing with barbed suture was less difficult than suturing with conventional suture (3.68 ± 1.37 vs 4.77 ± 1.56; p = .025). Intraoperative blood loss was similar in the 2 groups. No perioperative complications were reported in either group. A nonsignificant decrease in serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels was observed after the operation in the barbed suture group and the conventional suture group (3.04 ± 1.5 vs 2.52 ± 1.31 ng/mL; p = .252 and 2.76 ± 1.48 vs 2.13 ± 1.14 ng/mL; p = .139, respectively). The rate of decline in serum AMH levels after the operation was 18.32% in the barbed suture group and 22.84% in the conventional suture group. CONCLUSION The unidirectional knotless barbed suture (V-Loc) facilitates suturing of the endometrioma bed after laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma. Compared with conventional smooth suture (Vicryl), the unidirectional barbed suture reduces the time needed to suture the endometrioma bed and the total operating time.","Fouda, Usama M; Elsetohy, Khaled A; Elshaer, Hesham S",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2016.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329547/,262

To increase knowledge of HCC pathogenesis, as well as discover potential novel molecules for anti-cancer therapy, mass spectrometry and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTARQ) were employed. The differences between nine HBV-related HCC and adjacent non-HCC tissue specimens were studied. In total, 222 proteins were analyzed for differential expression in the two types of samples. Among these proteins, several were further confirmed by immunohistochemical, immunoblotting, and real-time RT-PCR analysis. RNA interference induced downregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and decreased HBV replication by fivefold by the IFN pathway. Decreased G6PD expression resulted in decreased hepatoma cell migration and invasion in cell culture. In summary, the investigation provides new information on pathogenesis of HBV infection and suggests G6PD as a novel anti-HCC target. G6PD suppression may contribute to treatment strategies for inhibiting tumor progression.","Hu, Huaidong; Ding, Xiangchun; Yang, Yixuan; Zhang, Hongmin; Li, Hong; Tong, Shiwen; An, Xuan; Zhong, Qing; Liu, Xiaoyan; Ma, Lina; Liu, Qing; Liu, Bin; Lu, Zhenhui; Zhang, Dazhi; Hu, Peng; Ren, Hong",American journal of physiology.

123335,Transvesical robotic radical prostatectomy.,2008,"Abstract On April 1, 2021, the Italian Government issued the Decree Law no. 44 establishing COVID-19 compulsory vaccination for healthcare workers. In covering the news, national and international commentators have foreshadowed controversy over its constitutional status. In fact, it seems sensible to wonder if mandatory vaccination is consistent with the right to medical self-determination in the Italian Constitution, and if vaccine mandates that exclusively apply to a specific part of the population can be squared with its Equality Principle. As it happens, both answers are in the affirmative. On the one hand, the Italian Constitution acknowledges medical self-determination, but it explicitly admits of public health coercive measures, as both the text of the Constitution and its original understanding make abundantly clear. On the other, as to the Equality Principle, the scientific literature has long attested to the unique benefits of vaccinating healthcare workers, which seem all the more appropriate amidst a pandemic. Moreover, the government's choice of moderate penalties for vaccine refusal and the temporary nature of the mandatory regime further agree with the Italian Constitutional Court's interpretation of the Equality Principle - the so-called ""Reasonableness Criterion."" The Decree Law - meanwhile become, with minor modifications, Law 76 of May 28 2021 - is thus expected to pass foreseeable judicial review. However, it would be beneficial if the Italian government more vocally advocated the constitutionality of its vaccination policies in a general effort to contrast vaccine hesitancy.","Vinceti, S R",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2468.; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623372/,262
123450,Focal stimulation of the sheep motor cortex with a chronically implanted minimally invasive electrode array mounted on an endovascular stent.,2018,"Studies have shown that the calcium ion (Ca2+) plays important roles both in Alzheimer's dementia and SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion to host cell entry. An elevated level of intracellular calcium causes neuronal dysfunction, cell death, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of calcium has also been shown to increase the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein, the hallmark of Alzheimer's dementia. Reversely, deposition of Aβ is also responsible for calcium dysregulation. On the other hand, it has been well investigated that viruses can disturb host cell Ca2+ homeostasis as well as modulate signal transduction mechanisms. Viruses can also hijack the host cell calcium channels and pumps to release more intracellular Ca2+ to utilize for their life cycle. Even though evidence has not been reported on SARS-CoV-2 concerning Ca2+ regulation, however, it has been well established that Ca2+ is essential for viral entry, viral gene replication, and virion maturation and release. Recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV needs two Ca2+ ions to fuse with the host cell at the entry step. Furthermore, some calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as nimodipine, memantine, etc., have been reported to be effective in the treatment of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as have shown inhibition in various virus infections.","Danta, Chhanda Charan",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662982/,262

123601,Thoracic Wall Reconstruction with Acellular Porcine Dermal Collagen Matrix.,2016,"OBJECTIVES The vast majority of ICU patients require some form of venous access. There are no evidenced-based guidelines concerning the use of either central or peripheral venous catheters, despite very different complications. It remains unknown which to insert in ICU patients. We investigated the rate of catheter-related insertion or maintenance complications in two strategies: one favoring the central venous catheters and the other peripheral venous catheters. DESIGN Multicenter, controlled, parallel-group, open-label randomized trial. SETTING Three French ICUs. PATIENTS Adult ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement. INTERVENTION Patients were randomized to receive central venous catheters or peripheral venous catheters as initial venous access. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The primary endpoint was the rate of major catheter-related complications within 28 days. Secondary endpoints were the rate of minor catheter-related complications and a composite score-assessing staff utilization and time spent to manage catheter insertions. Analysis was intention to treat. We randomly assigned 135 patients to receive a central venous catheter and 128 patients to receive a peripheral venous catheter. Major catheter-related complications were greater in the peripheral venous catheter than in the central venous catheter group (133 vs 87, respectively, p=0.02) although none of those was life threatening. Minor catheter-related complications were 201 with central venous catheters and 248 with peripheral venous catheters (p=0.06). 46% (60/128) patients were managed throughout their ICU stay with peripheral venous catheters only. There were significantly more peripheral venous catheter-related complications per patient in patients managed solely with peripheral venous catheter than in patients that received peripheral venous catheter and at least one central venous catheter: 1.92 (121/63) versus 1.13 (226/200), p<0.005. There was no difference in central venous catheter-related complications per patient between patients initially randomized to peripheral venous catheters but subsequently crossed-over to central venous catheter and patients randomized to the central venous catheter group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION In ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement, central venous catheters should preferably be inserted: a strategy associated with less major complications.","Ricard, Jean-Damien; Salomon, Laurence; Boyer, Alexandre; Thiery, Guillaume; Meybeck, Agnes; Roy, Carine; Pasquet, Blandine; Le Mière, Eric; Dreyfuss, Didier",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31828a42c5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782969/,262

The objective of this study was to explore the role of cytological diagnosis in EBUS-TBNAs. METHODS Eight hundred and thirteen consecutive cases performed EBUS-TBNA with both cytological and histological diagnoses were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were followed up for clinical data. RESULTS Before immunohistochemical examination, the cytological sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNAs were 92.9% (421/453), 98.9% (348/352), 95.5% (769/805), respectively. After immunohistochemical examination, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 93.0% (423/455), 99.4% (348/350), 95.8% (771/805), respectively. The majority of false-negative were cases whose cytological diagnosis was ""atypical"" or the cytological diagnosis suggested ""inadequate."" ""Neoplastic"" were also prone to false-negative cytology. The diagnostic accordance rate of cytological subtyping was 90.3% for squamous-cell carcinoma, 99.2% for adenocarcinoma, and 98.1% for small-cell carcinoma before immunohistochemical examination, and became 85.9%, 98.5%, and 98.2% after immunohistochemical examination, respectively. CONCLUSION Cytological diagnosis in EBUS-TBNAs had a good sensitivity and high specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of cytological diagnosis were proved to be higher after the immunohistochemical examination. At the same time, cytology had high accordance rate in subtype diagnosis.

METHODS Between November 14, 2007, and December 2013, 712 consecutive high-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent elective or urgent placement of an Endurant bifurcated endograft in our institution. The included patients were consecutive (all comers) and treated independently from their morphologic eligibility for use of the Endurant device based on the instructions for use. The primary study outcome was freedom from all-cause reintervention. RESULTS The median follow-up was 19.2 months (interquartile range, 6.3-35.9 months). Overall, 517 patients (72.6%) were treated on the basis of instructions for use conditions. On the other hand, 195 patients (27.4%) had morphologic data not consistent with the recommendations for the use of the Endurant system. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (10 of 712). Nine patients (1.2%) were lost to follow-up because of relocation abroad. The overall mortality rate was 14.74% (101 of 703). Overall survival rate was 92.3% at 1 year, 86.4% at 2 years, and 65% at 5 years. Overall freedom from reintervention rate was 93.3%, 86.4%, and 65% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Five patients (0.7%) underwent a surgical conversion and explantation of the Endurant device. The reasons were endograft infection (n = 1), endoleak type Ia (n = 1), endoleak type II (n = 1), endograft and limb thrombotic occlusion (n = 1), and endotension (n = 1). The overall iliac limb occlusion rate was 2.1% (15 of 712). CONCLUSIONS The performance of the Endurant stent graft during a period of 7 years under real-life conditions was good, with low incidence of reinterventions and endoleaks.","Donas, Konstantinos P; Torsello, Giovanni; Weiss, Kristin; Bisdas, Theodosios; Eisenack, Markus; Austermann, Martin",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091587/,262

METHODS The study group (SG) comprised 46 pregnant women whose type II CM children underwent IUMR, while 47 pregnant women whose type II CM children were operated on postnatally constituted the control group (CG). A total of 24 SG and 20 CG patients reached the endpoint of the study. RESULTS High incidence of prelabor rupture of membranes (24 (52.2%), CI: 3.74 (1.69-8.26) (p < 0.001) was noted in the group of prenatal surgeries as compared to controls. The need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation was statistically significantly lower (p < 0.008) in the group of children after IUMR as compared to controls (5 (27.8%) and 16 (80%), respectively, CI: 0.35 (0.16-0.75). None of the postnatally treated CG children can walk without adaptive equipment. In contrast, two children from the SG (2 (11.1%) CI: 1.86 (1.00-3.48) p < 0.05) are able to walk independently.

126692,In this Issue: Graphical Abstracts.,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND There is rising interest among thoracic surgeons in anatomical segmental resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the current study we compared video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy approaches for segmentectomy to explore the safety and oncologic efficacy of VATS for stage I NSCLC. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent segmentectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC from 2000 to 2013. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were evaluated. The probabilities of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS We identified 193 segmentectomies, including 91 (47%) performed by VATS and 102 (53%) performed by thoracotomy. Patients who underwent VATS, although older (median age 72 versus 68 years; p = 0.016), had similar sex distribution (63% versus 61% women; p = 0.792) and similar clinical stages as the thoracotomy group (stage IA: VATS, 93.4% versus thoracotomy 87.3%; p = 0.152). No significant differences were found in the final pathologic stages (p = 0.439), total number of lymph nodes (LNs) sampled (7 versus 8; p = 0.104), or median number of mediastinal LN stations sampled (2 versus 2; p = 0.234). VATS was associated with decreased length of stay (4 versus 5 days; p = 0.001) and decreased pulmonary complications (13.2% versus 26.5%; p = 0.022). Five-year DFS and OS favored VATS over thoracotomy (58% versus 47%; p = 0.013 and 75% versus 62%; p = 0.017, respectively). By multivariable analysis, the only predictor of poor DFS or OS was larger tumor size. CONCLUSIONS VATS segmentectomy is a safe and oncologically effective technique for the treatment of stage I NSCLC. Patients who underwent VATS had a shorter length of stay, fewer pulmonary complications, equivalent lymphadenectomy results, and similar oncologic outcomes compared with patients undergoing thoracotomy.","Ghaly, Galal; Kamel, Mohamed; Nasar, Abu; Paul, Subroto; Lee, Paul C; Port, Jeffrey L; Stiles, Brendon M; Altorki, Nasser K",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.06.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391692/,262
126879,Seeing consciousness through the lens of memory.,2020-09-21,"Cisplatin (cis-Dichlorodiammine platinum, CP), as the first-line chemotherapy drug of choice for many cancers such as urogenital system tumors and digestive tract tumors, also causes toxicity and side effects to the kidney. Previous studies have shown that Pulsatilla chinensis has significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but the mechanism of cisplatin induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in vivo has not been thoroughly studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of pulchinenoside B4 (PB4), a representative and major component with a content of up to 10% in root of P. chinensis, on AKI induced by CP in mice. Our results indicated the significant protective effect of PB4 by evaluating renal function indicators, inflammatory factor levels and renal histopathological changes. In addition, PB4 may mainly act on NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the kidney after CP exposure, thus exerting anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, PB4 regulated MAPK signaling pathway and its downstream apoptotic factors to inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis, such as Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3 and caspase 9. Notably, the activations of caspase 3 induced by cisplatin were strikingly reduced in PB4-treated mice. Therefore, the above evidence suggested that PB4 is a potential renal protectant with significant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.","Wang, Shuang; Tang, Shan; Chen, Xuan; Li, Xin; Jiang, Shuang; Li, Hui-Ping; Jia, Pin-Hui; Song, Ming-Jie; Di, Peng; Li, Wei",Chemico-biological interactions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991863/,262

127128,Robot-assisted intracorporeal pyramid neobladder.,2015,"BACKGROUND Quercetin is a natural flavonoid, which widely exists in nature, such as tea, coffee, apples, and onions. Numerous studies have showed that quercetin has multiple biological activities such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging. Hence, quercetin has a significant therapeutic effect on cancers, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. In the past decades, a large number of studies have shown that quercetin combined with other agents can significantly improve the overall therapeutic effect, compared to single use. PURPOSE This work reviews the pharmacological activities of quercetin and its derivatives. In addition, this work also summarizes both in vivo and in vitro experimental evidence for the synergistic effect of quercetin against cancers and metabolic diseases. METHODS An extensive systematic search for pharmacological activities and synergistic effect of quercetin was performed considering all the relevant literatures published until August 2021 through the databases including NCBI PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The relevant literatures were extracted from the databases with following keyword combinations: ""pharmacological activities"" OR ""biological activities"" OR ""synergistic effect"" OR ""combined"" OR ""combination"" AND ""quercetin"" as well as free-text words. RESULTS Quercetin and its derivatives possess multiple pharmacological activities including anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular, anti-aging, and neuroprotective activities. In addition, the synergistic effect of quercetin with small molecule agents against cancers and metabolic diseases has also been confirmed. CONCLUSION Quercetin cooperates with agents to improve the therapeutic effect by regulating signal molecules and blocking cell cycle. Synergistic therapy can reduce the dose of agents and avoid the possible toxic and side effects in the treatment process. Although quercetin treatment has some potential side effects, it is safe under the expected use conditions. Hence, quercetin has application value and potential strength as a clinical drug. Furthermore, quercetin, as the main effective therapeutic ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, may effectively treat and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Zou, Haoyang; Ye, Haiqing; Kamaraj, Rajamanikkam; Zhang, Tiehua; Zhang, Jie; Pavek, Petr",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560520/,262

128273,Evidence Base for Multidisciplinary Care of Pediatric/Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Patients.,2017,"CASE Brian is a 6-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and global developmental delay at age 2. He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents. The developmental pediatrician continued to modify the medication regimen over the summer, transitioning Brian from guanfacine to clonidine and increasing his aripiprazole incrementally (with clear increased benefit); hydroxyzine was also used as needed during the episodes of highest intensity.Despite the availability of best-practice guidelines for children with Brian's presenting concerns, a confluence of barriers (geographic, economic, ABA work force, global pandemic, etc.) present serious questions for his family and care team related to the next steps in Brian's care. Should he attend in-person school in the fall, knowing that the available program may have limited educational benefit and increase his risk of COVID-19 exposure (not to mention self-injury)? Would the potential benefits of cross-country travel to an intensive behavioral treatment program outweigh the associated psychosocial and economic stressors?

To inform successful vaccination campaigns, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in the UK and the USA to quantify how exposure to online misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines affects intent to vaccinate to protect oneself or others. Here we show that in both countries-as of September 2020-fewer people would 'definitely' take a vaccine than is likely required for herd immunity, and that, relative to factual information, recent misinformation induced a decline in intent of 6.2 percentage points (95th percentile interval 3.9 to 8.5) in the UK and 6.4 percentage points (95th percentile interval 4.0 to 8.8) in the USA among those who stated that they would definitely accept a vaccine. We also find that some sociodemographic groups are differentially impacted by exposure to misinformation. Finally, we show that scientific-sounding misinformation is more strongly associated with declines in vaccination intent.","Loomba, Sahil; de Figueiredo, Alexandre; Piatek, Simon J; de Graaf, Kristen; Larson, Heidi J",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01056-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547453/,262

129191,Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Institute of Academic Surgery skills model: shifting paradigms in surgical education.,2021-06-01,"UNLABELLED The cytokine storm is an intensified, dysregulated, tissue-injurious inflammatory response driven by cytokine and immune cell components. The cytokine storm during influenza virus infection, whereby the amplified innate immune response is primarily responsible for pulmonary damage, has been well characterized. Now we describe a novel event where virus-specific T cells induce a cytokine storm. The paramyxovirus pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a model of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Unexpectedly, when C57BL/6 mice were infected with PVM, the innate inflammatory response was undetectable until day 5 postinfection, at which time CD8(+) T cells infiltrated into the lung, initiating a cytokine storm by their production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Administration of an immunomodulatory sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1R) agonist significantly inhibited PVM-elicited cytokine storm by blunting the PVM-specific CD8(+) T cell response, resulting in diminished pulmonary disease and enhanced survival. IMPORTANCE A dysregulated overly exuberant immune response, termed a ""cytokine storm,"" accompanies virus-induced acute respiratory diseases (VARV), is primarily responsible for the accompanying high morbidity and mortality, and can be controlled therapeutically in influenza virus infection of mice and ferrets by administration of sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1R) agonists. Here, two novel findings are recorded. First, in contrast to influenza infection, where the cytokine storm is initiated early by the innate immune system, for pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a model of RSV, the cytokine storm is initiated late in infection by the adaptive immune response: specifically, by virus-specific CD8 T cells via their release of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Blockading these cytokines with neutralizing antibodies blunts the cytokine storm and protects the host. Second, PVM infection is controlled by administration of an S1P1R agonist.","Walsh, Kevin B; Teijaro, John R; Brock, Linda G; Fremgen, Daniel M; Collins, Peter L; Rosen, Hugh; Oldstone, Michael B A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00464-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672024/,262

METHODS A total of 1,103 first-year high school students aged 14-17 years were included in the study. The study group comprised 916 persons with myopia, while the control group comprised 187 persons without refractive error. Volunteers underwent routine eye examinations and completed a set of questionnaires about anxiety and depression. Then, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were compared between groups, and the relationships between anxiety and the degree of myopia and between depression and the degree of myopia were analyzed. RESULTS There was a significant difference in anxiety rate between the students with normal vision and those with myopia. The SAS scores among students with mild, moderate, and severe myopia were also significantly different. However, compared with the students with normal vision, the rate of depression was not significantly increased in the students with myopia, except in cases of severe myopia. Additionally, the SAS scores correlated closely with the diopters of the participants' glasses (r = 0.43, p = .045), while the relationship between SDS scores and the diopters of glasses was not significant (r = 0.19, p = .325). CONCLUSION There was a correlation between myopia and mental health in adolescent students, especially in terms of anxiety.","Li, Qiaoli; Yang, Jiezheng; He, Yan; Wang, Ting; Zhong, Lei; Zhu, Ziqian; Wang, Tao; Ling, Shiqi",Brain and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32147959/,262

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL were searched to February 2009. A basic PubCrawler alert was run until March 2010. Trial registries, HTA websites and systematic reviews were searched. Manufacturers were contacted. Randomized trials comparing bariatric surgeries and/or standard care were selected. Evidence-based items potentially indicating risk of bias were assessed. Network meta-analysis was performed using Bayesian techniques. Of 1838 citations, 31 RCTs involving 2619 patients (mean age 30-48 y; mean BMI levels 42-58 kg/m(2) ) met eligibility criteria. As compared with standard care, differences in BMI levels from baseline at year 1 (15 trials; 1103 participants) were as follows: jejunoileal bypass [MD: -11.4 kg/m(2) ], mini-gastric bypass [-11.3 kg/m(2) ], biliopancreatic diversion [-11.2 kg/m(2) ], sleeve gastrectomy [-10.1 kg/m(2) ], Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [-9.0 kg/m(2) ], horizontal gastroplasty [-5.0 kg/m(2) ], vertical banded gastroplasty [-6.4 kg/m(2) ], and adjustable gastric banding [-2.4 kg/m(2) ]. Bariatric surgery appears efficacious compared to standard care in reducing BMI. Weight losses are greatest with diversionary procedures, intermediate with diversionary/restrictive procedures, and lowest with those that are purely restrictive. Compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding has lower weight loss efficacy, but also leads to fewer serious adverse effects.","Padwal, R; Klarenbach, S; Wiebe, N; Birch, D; Karmali, S; Manns, B; Hazel, M; Sharma, A M; Tonelli, M",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789x.2011.00866.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438991/,262
129847,Constructing and drawing regular planar split networks.,2012,"Empiricism and the application of human behavior theory to inquiry are regarded as markers of high-quality research. Unfortunately, scholars have noted that there are many gaps in theory and empiricism within the human trafficking literature, calling into question the legitimacy of policies and practices that are derived from the available data. To date, there has not been an analysis of the extent to which empirical methods and human behavior theory have been applied to domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) research as a subcategory of human trafficking inquiry. To fill this gap in the literature, this systematic review was designed to assess the degree to which DMST publications are a) empirical, and b) apply human behavior theory to inquiry. This analysis also focuses on answering research questions related to patterns within DMST study data sources, and patterns of human behavior theory application. The results of this review indicate that a minority of sampled DMST publications are empirical, a minority of those articles that were empirical apply a specific human behavior theory within the research design and reporting of results, a minority of articles utilize data collected directly from DMST victims, and that there are no discernible patterns in the application of human behavior theory to DMST research. This research note suggests that DMST research is limited by the same challenges as the larger body of human trafficking scholarship. Based upon these overarching findings, specific recommendations are offered to DMST researchers who are committed to enhancing the quality of DMST scholarship.","Twis, Mary K; Shelton, Beth Anne",Journal of evidence-informed social work,https://doi.org/10.1080/23761407.2018.1468844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764316/,262
129941,Minimally invasive partial cystectomy with bilateral vesico-ureteric junction resection and reimplantation for a large paraganglioma involving urinary bladder trigone.,2017,"INTRODUCTION The UK Government imposed a COVID19 lockdown (LD) restricting all but essential activities from 24th March 2020. Subsequently, there has been a significant reduction in casualty attendances nationwide including for ophthalmic emergencies. We aim to study the presentation of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) and significant vitreous haemorrhage caused by posterior vitreous detachment (PVD-VH) in three tertiary centres covering most of the North West of England in the 6 weeks before and during the lockdown. METHODS A retrospective multicenter non-randomised consecutive case series study was designed to collect information on all cases of RRD and PVD-VH requiring surgery presenting to the vitreoretinal departments of Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, East Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust and the Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust from 11th February to 4th May 2020. RESULTS A total of 137 eyes of 137 patients were identified between the three centres of which 132 eyes were operated for RRD. Of these, 86 (64.7%) were operated pre-LD compared with 46 eyes (34.8%) during LD. Forty-five out of 86 eyes (52.3%) were macula-off pre-LD compared with 31 out of 46 eyes (67.3%) during LD (p = 0.06). There was lower proportion of non-PVD related RRD during LD (11 pre-LD to 1 during LD, p = 0.05). PVR was present in four cases during LD compared to 2 before (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION There was a clinically significant reduction in the overall incidence of RRD in our centres with an increase in the proportion of macula-off and proliferative vitreoretinopathy during the LD period compared to a similar period before.","Jasani, Kirti M; Ivanova, Tsveta; Sabatino, Francesco; Patton, Niall; Dhawahir-Scala, Felipe; Chew, Grace; Charles, Stephen; David, Philip; Davies, Andrew; Jalil, Assad",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120965480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073599/,262

The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a remotely delivered Comprehensive Medication Management (CMM) for primary practice patients who are polypharmatic and at high risk for drug therapy problems. METHODS Using medical and prescription claims data, a list of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries at high risk for drug therapy problems were identified. Participants were enrolled in a 6-month CMM program from February - November 2020. In the program, their existing drug therapy was assessed by a pharmacist, Drug therapy problems were identified and resolved. A Collaborative Practice Agreement allowed the pharmacists to make prescription changes as needed. RESULTS Eighty-three percent (202) of contacted individuals agreed to participate in the study. All participants were on 5 medications or more, and 71% were on more than eight. A clinical pharmacist found that 86% of participants had a drug therapy problem according to classification criteria. Seventy-nine percent of all drug therapy problems identified were resolved upon completion of the study. CONCLUSION The findings of this study suggest that engagement of a remote clinical pharmacist can contribute to efficient resolution of most drug therapy problems identified in a primary care population. A service model using remote pharmacist services may be an effective means of improving team-based primary care medication management for this population.","Benson, Mark; Murphy, David; Hall, Lindsey; Vande Kamp, Philip; Cook, David J",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1934492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047254/,262

METHODS A purposive sample of 100 survivors discharged from a large University hospital were assessed 4- 8 weeks after discharge by a multidisciplinary team of rehabilitation professionals using a specialist telephone screening tool designed to capture symptoms and impact on daily life. EQ-5D-5L telephone version was also completed. RESULTS Participants were between 29 and 71 days (mean 48 days) post-discharge from hospital. Thirty-two participants required treatment in intensive care (ICU group) and 68 were managed in hospital wards without needing ICU care (ward group). New illness-related fatigue was the most common reported symptom by 72% participants in ICU group and 60.3% in ward group. The next most common symptoms were breathlessness (65.6% in ICU group; 42.6% in ward group) and psychological distress (46.9% in ICU group; 23.5% in ward group). There was a clinically significant drop in EQ5D in 68.8% in ICU group and in 45.6% in ward group.

131742,Abstract Journal Neck Surgery.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Manufacturers recommend maintaining anaesthesia at a bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) index value between 40 and 60. METHODS We prospectively studied 102 patients receiving propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia administered by anaesthetists blinded to these indices. The main endpoint was crude agreement (P(0)), defined as the proportion of agreement between BIS and SE index among three categories: <40, between 40 and 60, and >60. Discrepancies in recommendation (DR) were also considered. A DR is type 1 if BIS or SE is <40, while the other is simultaneously >60. A DR is type 2 when BIS and SE index values are on different sides of a threshold (40 or 60) with three subtypes according to the magnitude of their difference. A linear multiple regression was performed to identify covariates that are independently associated with P(0). RESULTS In total, 12 147 pairs of values were studied. P(0) was 59.9 (24.5%) [mean (sd)]. Thirty-three patients presented more than 50% discordant pairs and only seven patients presented more than 95% concordant pairs. Type 1 DR occurred in only 1.1% of all the pairs. The median (inter-quartile range) number of type 2 DR varied from 5 (3-8) to 2 (1-3) according to the degree of difference. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P=0.0004) and electrode position (P=0.0084) were independently associated with P(0). An increase in the age of 10 yr decreases P(0) by 5%. CONCLUSIONS The agreement between BIS and SE indices is moderate and deteriorates as patients' age increases. This study cannot determine which index is best adapted for elderly patients. Additional work comparing both indices with raw EEG traces is warranted.","Aimé, I; Gayat, E; Fermanian, C; Cook, F; Peuch, C; Laloë, P A; Mantz, J; Fischler, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aer457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258203/,262

PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study was carried out on 17 patients with clinically localized PCa treated between 17 August 2016 and 23 February 2017 at our urology department using the Revo-i. Patients underwent Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RS-RARP). The primary objective was to describe the RS-RARP step-by-step surgical technique using the Revo-i. In addition, the safety of the Revo-i was assessed according to intra-operative and the postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery. Early oncological outcomes were also assessed according to surgical margin status and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Continence was defined as use of no or only one pad. Surgeons' satisfaction with the Revo-i was assessed using the Likert scale. RESULTS All surgeries were completed successfully, with no conversion to open or laparoscopic surgery. The median patient age was 72 years. The median docking time, console time, urethrovesical anastomosis time and estimated blood loss were 8 min, 92 min, 26 min and 200 mL, respectively. One patient was transfused intra-operatively as a result of blood loss of 1 500 mL. Postoperatively, two patients received blood transfusion, and there were no other serious/major complications. The median hospital stay was 4 days. At 3 months, four patients had positive surgical margins, one patient had BCR, and 15 patients were continent. Most of surgeons were satisfied with the Revo-i performance. CONCLUSIONS The first human study for the treatment of patients with localized PCa using the Revo-i robotic surgical system was carried out successfully. The peri-operative, early oncological and continence outcomes are encouraging.

The success rate does not equal that of the primary procedures. This retrospective analysis aimed to assess long-term subjective and objective outcomes in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for fundoplication failure. METHODS Objective and subjective outcomes were assessed by radiological and endoscopic methods, symptom questionnaire and quality-of-life index at a minimum follow-up of 12 (mean 75·8) months. RESULTS The study included 129 consecutive patients who had laparoscopic redo surgery after fundoplication had failed. The most frequent patterns of failure were hiatal herniation (50 patients) and slippage (45). Resolution of the symptoms that led to redo surgery was achieved in 27 of 37 and 11 of 16 patients operated for recurrence and for dysphagia respectively. Objective failure was demonstrated in 16 of 39 patients with herniation and six of 22 with slippage. Seven patients underwent an additional surgical procedure. CONCLUSION Long-term assessment of objective and subjective results after laparoscopic repair for failed fundoplication revealed a high failure rate that increased with the length of follow-up. Unexpected and untreated oesophageal shortening may be responsible for this failure rate.","Dallemagne, B; Arenas Sanchez, M; Francart, D; Perretta, S; Weerts, J; Markiewicz, S; Jehaes, C",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21710482/,262

METHODS Colon samples (n = 100) were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: LigaSure group (n = 90) and Stapler group (n = 10). The LigaSure group was divided into 9 subgroups, each of 10 samples, according to the different power levels of the LigaSure system (Bar 1, Bars 2, and Bars 3) and radiofrequency application (1 application, 2 applications, and 3 applications) used. All anastomoses were tested for early burst pressure. The LigaSure subgroup having the highest burst pressure was compared with the Stapler group. Finally, the specimen was reviewed by the same pathologist. RESULTS The burst pressures of the 9 subgroups of LigaSure segments were the following: 29.7 ± 4.5 (Subgroup a); 27.4 ± 3.1 (Subgroup b); 25.3 ± 4 (Subgroup c); 32.9 ± 2.3 (Subgroup d); 30.7 ± 3.8 (Subgroup e); 25.7 ± 4.8 (Subgroup f); 42 ± 4.7 (Subgroup g); 31.8 ± 3.8 (Subgroup h); and 28.5 ± 3 (Subgroup j). Subgroup g (3 bars-power levels/1 frequency application) had the highest burst pressure (P < .001; ANOVA test). No significant difference was found between burst pressure of Subgroup g and Stapler group (42 ± 4.7 vs 42 ± 4.3, respectively, P = .9). On histological view, the LigaSure anastomosis was formed by collagen sealed without cavitation defects. CONCLUSIONS Our study seems to confirm the feasibility of creating intestinal anastomosis using LigaSure.

Secondary objectives included safety and evaluation of the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes. RESULTS 71 patients were recruited (n=15 in cohort A and 28 in each cohort B). The PFS6 rate in cohorts A, B1 and B2 was 33.3% (5/15), 42.8% (12/28) and 46.4% (13/28), respectively. Regarding safety, grade 1-2 and 3-4 toxicities occurred in 97.7% and 84.4% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (66.4%) and thrombocytopenia (11.3%). Regarding PAM50, 59 (83.1%) tumors were profiled. Luminal disease defined by PAM50 was found independently associated with longer PFS compared to non-luminal disease (10.6 vs. 4.2 months median PFS; adjusted hazard ratio=0.40; p-value=0.003). CONCLUSION Palbociclib in combination with trastuzumab is safe and exhibits promising survival outcomes in trastuzumab pre-treated ER-positive/HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with a PAM50 luminal A or B subtype. The enrollment was stopped prematurely and a new randomized cohort was opened in this population.","Ciruelos, Eva M; Villagrasa, Patricia; Pascual, Tomás; Oliveira, Mafalda; Pernas, Sonia; Paré, Laia; Escrivá-de-Romaní, Santiago; Manso, Luis; Adamo, Barbara; Martínez de Dueñas, Eduardo; Cortés, Javier; Vázquez, Silvia; Perelló, Antonia; Garau, Isabel; Melé, Mireia; Martínez Jañez, Noelia; Montaño, Alvaro; Bermejo, Begoña; Morales, Serafín; Echarri, Mª Jose; Vega, Estela; González-Farré, Blanca; Martínez, Débora; Galván, Patricia; Canes, Jordi; Nuciforo, Paolo; Gonzàlez Farré, Xavier; Prat, Aleix",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-0844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938620/,262

134308,"Effect of Inoculum History, Growth Substrates and Yeast Extract Addition on Inhibition of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans by NaCl.",2020-09-08,"UNLABELLED Fluorescence imaging is currently attracting much interest as a method for intraoperative tumor detection, but most current tracers lack tumor specificity. Therefore, this technique can be further improved by tumor-specific detection. With tumor-targeted antibodies bound to a radioactive label, tumor-specific SPECT or PET is feasible in the clinical setting. The aim of the present study was to apply antibody-based tumor detection to intraoperative optical imaging, using preclinical in vivo mouse models. METHODS Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 antibody trastuzumab were labeled with the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence dye IRDye 800CW. Tumor uptake of the fluorescent tracers and their (89)Zr-labeled radioactive counterparts for PET was determined in human xenograft-bearing athymic mice during 1 wk after tracer injection, followed by ex vivo biodistribution and pathologic examination. Intraoperative imaging of fluorescent VEGF- or HER2-positive tumor lesions was performed in subcutaneous tumors and in intraperitoneal dissemination tumor models. RESULTS Tumor-to-background ratios, with fluorescent imaging, were 1.93 ± 0.40 for bevacizumab and 2.92 ± 0.29 for trastuzumab on day 6 after tracer injection. Real-time intraoperative imaging detected tumor lesions at even the submillimeter level in intraperitoneal dissemination tumor models. These results were supported by standard histology, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence microscopy analyses. CONCLUSION NIR fluorescence-labeled antibodies targeting VEGF or HER2 can be used for highly specific and sensitive detection of tumor lesions in vivo. These preclinical findings encourage future clinical studies with NIR fluorescence-labeled tumor-specific antibodies for intraoperative-guided surgery in cancer patients.","Terwisscha van Scheltinga, Anton G T; van Dam, Gooitzen M; Nagengast, Wouter B; Ntziachristos, Vasilis; Hollema, Harry; Herek, Jennifer L; Schröder, Carolien P; Kosterink, Jos G W; Lub-de Hoog, Marjolijn N; de Vries, Elisabeth G E","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.092833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21990576/,262
134708,Improvement of sperm morphology after surgical varicocele repair.,2021-04-07,"Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. A possible unwanted effect of glucocorticoid treatment is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Factors affecting the risk of glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency (GI-AI) include the duration of glucocorticoid therapy, mode of administration, glucocorticoid dose and potency, concomitant drugs that interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism, and individual susceptibility. Patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use may develop features of Cushing's syndrome and, subsequently, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when the treatment is tapered down. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal can overlap with those of the underlying disorder, as well as of GI-AI. A careful approach to the glucocorticoid taper and appropriate patient counseling are needed to assure a successful taper. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be completely stopped until recovery of adrenal function is achieved. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting the risk of GI-AI, propose a regimen for the glucocorticoid taper, and make suggestions for assessment of adrenal function recovery. We also describe current gaps in the management of patients with GI-AI and make suggestions for an approach to the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, chronic management of glucocorticoid therapy, and education on GI-AI for patients and providers.","Prete, Alessandro; Bancos, Irina",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253540/,262

Recent studies first detected the virus from bat species in Hong Kong. To understand astrovirus distribution in the wider region further, we examined the prevalence of this virus family in bat specimens collected from a large geographical region of mainland China. We collected 500 anal swabs from 20 bat species in 51 natural habitats from 11 provinces of China and tested these for astroviruses. Our study revealed a remarkably high genetic diversity of astroviruses; five monophyletic groups were identified in bats, including two novel groups. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses from bats has been found.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study population consisted of 51 patients (39 males, 12 females; mean age 7.2 years; 11 patients under 6 years of age, including 7 males and 4 females) who underwent RFTA for osteoid osteoma and were retrospectively observed. The affected sites were the tibia (n = 22, 43%), femur (n = 13, 25%), pelvis (n = 5, 10%), anklebone (n = 3, 6%), humerus (n = 2, 4%), sacrum (n = 2, 4%), heel, radium, patella ,and rib (n = 1, 2%), respectively. Three patients had tibial intramedullary osteoid osteoma (14% of the tibial lesions, 6% of all cases). Cold mode RFTA was performed for these three patients to obtain a large ablation area without positioning two probes. The noncooled mode was used to treat cortical and subperiosteal lesions. RESULTS Following RFTA, all patients were pain-free and in good clinical condition. In the intramedullary osteoid osteoma group, no recurrences were observed during the 24-month follow-up period, but one patient, who was affected by cortical osteoid osteoma, required two RFTA treatments to heal completely. CONCLUSION Children less than 6 years of age with recurrent nocturnal pain and limb swelling should be investigated for intramedullary osteoid osteoma. Once confirmed, CT-guided RFTA should be the first treatment for intramedullary osteoid osteomas because of the high success rate and reduced invasivity, especially with cold mode RFTA. The outcome is related to the disappearance of pain, and the efficacy may be checked shortly after treatment with MR imaging to evaluate the absence of lesion in the ablation area.","Falappa, Piergiorgio; Garganese, Maria Carmen; Crocoli, Alessandro; Toniolo, Renato Maria; Lembo, Antonio; Marconi, Fabio; Campana, Andrea; De Vito, Rita; Ciofetta, Gianclaudio; Leone, Antonio",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-011-1133-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21404054/,262
135338,How does an inventor find an investor or partner? Raising funds to start a company.,2017,"BACKGROUND The discontinuation of mechanical ventilation after coronary surgery may prolong and significantly increase the load on intensive care unit personnel. We hypothesized that automated mode using INTELLiVENT-ASV can decrease duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, reduce workload on medical staff, and provide safe ventilation after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). The primary endpoint of our study was to assess the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation during different modes of weaning from respiratory support (RS) after OPCAB. The secondary endpoint was to assess safety of the automated weaning mode and the number of manual interventions to the ventilator settings during the weaning process in comparison with the protocolized weaning mode. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty adult patients undergoing elective OPCAB were enrolled into a prospective single-center study. Patients were randomized into two groups: automated weaning (n = 20) using INTELLiVENT-ASV mode with quick-wean option; and protocolized weaning (n = 20), using conventional synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) + pressure support (PS) mode. We assessed the duration of postoperative ventilation, incidence and duration of unacceptable RS, and the load on medical staff. We also performed the retrospective analysis of 102 patients (standard weaning) who were weaned from ventilator with SIMV + PS mode based on physician's experience without prearranged algorithm. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Realization of the automated weaning protocol required change in respiratory settings in 2 patients vs. 7 (5-9) adjustments per patient in the protocolized weaning group. Both incidence and duration of unacceptable RS were reduced significantly by means of the automated weaning approach. The FiO2 during spontaneous breathing trials was significantly lower in the automated weaning group: 30 (30-35) vs. 40 (40-45) % in the protocolized weaning group (p < 0.01). The average time until tracheal extubation did not differ in the automated weaning and the protocolized weaning groups: 193 (115-309) and 197 (158-253) min, respectively, but increased to 290 (210-411) min in the standard weaning group. CONCLUSION The automated weaning system after off-pump coronary surgery might provide postoperative ventilation in a more protective way, reduces the workload on medical staff, and does not prolong the duration of weaning from ventilator. The use of automated or protocolized weaning can reduce the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation in comparison with non-protocolized weaning based on the physician's decision.","Fot, Evgenia V; Izotova, Natalia N; Yudina, Angelika S; Smetkin, Aleksei A; Kuzkov, Vsevolod V; Kirov, Mikhail Y",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2017.00031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28377920/,262
135343,Early outcomes of two-stage minimally invasive oesophagectomy in an Australian institution.,2019,"Standard methods for enumerating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patient sputa can miss large populations of viable Mtb that are unable to grow either on solid media or in liquid media if not extensively diluted. Because these bacteria can be detected in liquid media after limiting dilution, they have been termed differentially culturable or differentially detectable Mtb (DD Mtb). Treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol (HRZE) for 1-2 weeks has been shown to increase the representation of DD Mtb in the sputum of drug sensitive (DS) tuberculosis (TB) patients. However, little is known about DD Mtb after longer periods of treatment with HRZE, or in patients with drug resistant (DR) TB who receive second-line therapies. Here we measured the proportion of DD Mtb in the sputum of 47 subjects, 29 with DS TB and 18 with DR TB, before initiation of their treatment regimens and at 2 weeks and 2 months thereafter. Prior to treatment, DD Mtb represented the majority of Mtb in the sputum of 21% of subjects with DS TB and this proportion rose to 65% after 2 weeks of treatment with first-line drugs. In subjects with DR TB, DD Mtb was found in the sputum of 29% of subjects prior to treatment initiation, and this proportion remained steady at 31% after 2 weeks of treatment with second-line drugs. By 2 months, DD Mtb was detected in the sputum of only 2/15 (13.3%) subjects with DS TB and 0/15 of subjects with DR TB. One of the DS subjects whose sputum was positive for DD Mtb at month 2 later experienced treatment failure.","Zainabadi, Kayvan; Walsh, Kathleen Frances; Vilbrun, Stalz Charles; Mathurin, Laurent Daniel; Lee, Myung Hee; Saito, Kohta; Mishra, Saurabh; Ocheretina, Oksana; Pape, Jean William; Nathan, Carl; Fitzgerald, Daniel W",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00608-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060896/,262
135439,Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension and sacral colpopexy: results and complications.,2014,"Bioaerosols are recognized as one of the main transmission routes for infectious diseases and are responsible for other various types of health effects through inhalation and potential ingestion. Associating exposure with bioaerosol and health problems is challenging, and adequate exposure monitoring is a top priority for aerosol scientists. The multiple factors affecting bioaerosol content, the variability in the focus of each bioaerosol exposure study, and the variations in experimental design and the standardization of methods make bioaerosol exposure studies very difficult. Therefore, the health impacts of bioaerosol exposure are still poorly understood. This paper presents a brief description of a state-of-the-art development in bioaerosol exposure studies supported by studies on several related subjects. The main objective of this paper is to propose new considerations for bioaerosol exposure guidelines and the development of tools and study designs to better interpret bioaerosol data. The principal observations and findings are the discrepancy of the applicable methods in bioaerosol studies that makes result comparison impossible. Furthermore, the silo mentality helps in creating a bigger gap in the knowledge accumulated about bioaerosol exposure. Innovative and original ideas are presented for aerosol scientists and health scientists to consider and discuss. Although many examples cited herein are from occupational exposure, the discussion has relevance to any human environment. This work gives concrete suggestions for how to design a full bioaerosol study that includes all of the key elements necessary to help understand the real impacts of bioaerosol exposure in the short term. The creation of the proposed bioaerosol public database could give crucial information to control the public health. Implications: How can we move toward a bioaerosol exposure guidelines? The creation of the bioaerosol public database will help accumulate information for long-term association studies and help determine specific exposure biomarkers to bioaerosols. The implementation of such work will lead to a deeper understanding and more efficient utilization of bioaerosol studies to prevent public health hazards.","Mbareche, Hamza; Morawska, Lidia; Duchaine, Caroline",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2019.1587552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821643/,262

Geckos represent one of the mega-diverse reptile lineages under pressure; however, limited assisted reproductive technologies currently exist for these animals. Exogenous pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) has been found to exhibit follicle stimulating hormone-like action and has been routinely used to alter reproductive hormones of vertebrates in assisted reproductive protocols. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of serial injections of 20 IU and 50 IU PMSG on circulating testosterone concentrations, testicular dynamics, and semen production in a model species of gecko. Twenty-four captive-bred, adult, male leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) were divided into three treatment groups and administered a once-weekly injection of either PMSG or saline for a total of nine weeks. Ultrasonographic testicular measurements, electrostimulation for semen collection, and venipuncture were performed on days 0, 21, 42, and 63. Right unilateral orchidectomies and epididymectomies were performed in all animals on day 63; tissues were submitted for histopathology. PMSG treated geckos had significantly higher testicular volumes and weights, spermatozoa motility, and spermatozoa concentrations compared with controls. However, there were no significant differences in testosterone concentrations by treatment or time. Under the conditions outlined, PMSG is effective at stimulating spermatogenesis and increasing testicular size, but not effective at increasing testosterone concentrations in the leopard gecko between October-December in the Northern hemisphere.","Mason, Alexandra K; Lee, Jeongha; Perry, Sean M; Boykin, Kimberly L; Del Piero, Fabio; Lierz, Michael; Mitchell, Mark A",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573443/,262

METHODS Data were derived from 2 clinical trials (Study 1, n=131; Study 2, n=139) of fentanyl sublingual tablet in patients with cancer-associated breakthrough pain (BTP). Both trials comprised a 2-week titration phase and 12-month maintenance phase. The initial dose was 100 μg, titrated to an effective dose (producing effective relief of all BTP episodes on 2 consecutive days) of 100 to 800 μg. RESULTS A total of 270 patients entered the titration phase. Mean (SD) baseline BTP opioid dose was 25.7 (88.9) mg morphine equivalent, and mean baseline around-the-clock opioid dose was 196.5 (151.6) mg morphine equivalent. Using conservative criteria for determining effective dose, 174 patients (64.4%) were successfully titrated to an effective dose (mean [SD], 498.2 [234.8] μg). The most frequent (27.6%) effective dose was 800 μg, and more than 85% of patients required an effective dose ≥300 μg. There were no significant relationships between any baseline characteristics and titration success. CONCLUSION Despite stringent criteria, 64.4% of patients achieved an effective dose of fentanyl sublingual tablet within the dose range of 100 to 800 μg. Baseline characteristics were not identified to be associated with the likelihood of successful titration or with the actual effective dose of fentanyl sublingual tablet.","Nalamachu, Srinivas R; Rauck, Richard L; Wallace, Mark S; Hassman, David; Howell, Julian",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2011.00525.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22226371/,262

Despite the pandemic is raging in most parts of the world, in a few countries COVID-19 epidemics subsided due to successful implementations of intervention measures. A unifying perspective of the beginnings, middle stages, and endings of such completed COVID-19 epidemics is developed based on the order parameter and eigenvalue concepts of nonlinear physics, in general, and synergetics, in particular. To this end, a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is used. It is shown that COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks follow a suitably defined SEIR order parameter. Intervention measures switch the eigenvalue of the order parameter from a positive to a negative value, and in doing so, stabilize the COVID-19 disease-free state. The subsiding of COVID-19 epidemics eventually follows the remnant of the order parameter of the infection dynamical system. These considerations are illustrated for the COVID-19 epidemic in Thailand from January to May 2020. The decay of effective contact rates throughout the three epidemic stages is demonstrated. Evidence for the sign-switching of the dominant eigenvalue is given and the order parameter and its stage-3 remnant are identified. The presumed impacts of interventions measures implemented in Thailand are discussed in this context.","Frank, Till; Chiangga, Surasak",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/abf426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789256/,262

Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 μM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A metaanalysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions). CONCLUSION It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARSCoV- 2.","Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Hufert, Frank; Siewert, Stefan; Reisinger, Emil",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785117/,262
141545,Pore size and pore shape--but not mesh density--alter the mechanical strength of tissue ingrowth and host tissue response to synthetic mesh materials in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair.,2015,"BACKGROUND Despite improved managements for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), its mortality remains high. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as the final option for the treatment of ARDS unresponsive to conventional measures. This study describes our experiences of venovenous ECMO support for the treatment of ARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2007 and 2010, 56 patients (aged 56.6±13.4 years, 43 males) received venovenous ECMO for the treatment of ARDS. The detailed clinical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Before the institution of ECMO support, 35 patients (55.4%) required nitric oxide inhalation, 35 patients (55.4%) received continuous renal replacement therapy, and 20 patients (35.7%) were in shock status. The median duration of ECMO support was 164 hours (range, 5 to 1,413 hours). 27 (48%) patients could be successfully weaned from ECMO. Of them, 7 (13%) survived to discharge. On logistic regression analysis, a requirement for higher inspiratory pressure before ECMO support was the only significant factor that could predict ECMO weaning failure. CONCLUSION The outcome of venovenous ECMO support for the treatment of ARDS was suboptimal. Further improvements in outcomes should be made through the accumulation of experience and establishment of a standardized protocol for the management of ECMO.","Ma, Dae Sung; Kim, Joon Bum; Jung, Sung-Ho; Choo, Suk Jung; Chung, Cheol Hyun; Lee, Jae Won",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.5090/kjtcs.2012.45.2.91; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22500278/,262

Las partículas ingresan a las mascarillas respiratorias mediante dos vías principales de penetración: infiltración a través del sellado facial y penetración a través de filtros. Sin embargo, se desconoce la forma en que la frecuencia respiratoria afecta el desempeño general de las mascarillas autofiltrantes N95 (filtering facepiece respirators, FFR) y las mascarillas quirúrgicas (MQ) contra partículas virales y otras partículas submicrómicas de importancia para la salud. En un maniquí de respiración a cuatro flujos inspiratorios medios (FIM) (15, 30, 55 y 85 L/min) y cinco frecuencias respiratorias (10, 15, 20, 25 y 30 respiraciones/min) se probaron una FFR y una MQ. En los dispositivos de protección respiratoria probados se determinaron la penetración a través del filtro (Pfiltro) y la infiltración total hacia el interior (ITI) de partículas de aerosol de cloruro de sodio (NaCl) en tamaños que oscilaban entre 20 y 500 nm. Asimismo, se calcularon las proporciones de penetración de la ""infiltración a través del sellado facial con respecto al filtro"" (ISFF). Tanto el FIM como la frecuencia respiratoria mostraron efectos significativos (p < 0.05) en el Pfiltro y la ITI. El aumento de la frecuencia respiratoria incrementó la ITI para las FFR N95 mientras que en las MQ no se observaron tendencias claras. El aumento del FIM incrementó la Pfiltro y disminuyó la ITI, lo que dio lugar a una disminución de la proporción de la ISFF. La mayoría de las proporciones de la ISFF fueron >1, lo que sugiere que la infiltración a través del sellado facial fue la vía primaria de penetración de partículas a diversas frecuencias respiratorias. La frecuencia respiratoria es otro factor (además del FIM) que puede afectar significativamente el desempeño de las FFR N95: las frecuencias respiratorias más altas aumentan la ITI. En el caso de las MQ probadas no se observó ninguna tendencia consistente de aumento o disminución de la ITI relacionada con el FIM o la frecuencia respiratoria. Para ampliar potencialmente estos hallazgos más allá del maniquí/sistema respiratorio utilizado, se necesitan estudios futuros orientados a comprender plenamente el mecanismo que hace que la frecuencia respiratoria afecte el desempeño de los dispositivos de protección respiratoria en los sujetos humanos.","He, Xinjian; Reponen, Tiina; McKay, Roy; Grinshpun, Sergey A",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1877069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822694/,262

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive report and retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow obstruction (n = 7). METHODS Medical records were searched for dogs that had a subarachnoid-subarachnoid shunt placed for treatment of CSF flow obstruction. Data collected included age, sex, breed, clinical signs and duration of signs prior to examination, neurologic status and localization prior to surgery, pre-surgical diagnostics, surgical technique, histopathology, postoperative neurologic examination, time to discharge from hospital, and outcome. RESULTS All dogs were diagnosed at surgery with a fibrotic adhesion between the arachnoid and pia mater. A subarachnoid shunting tube was implanted to allow CSF flow across the lesion site. Five dogs showed improvement of clinical signs, 3 of which showed complete recovery and 2 of which showed improvement without resolution of all clinical signs. Two dogs showed no change at 7 and 24 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION Bridging a region of pia-arachnoid fibrosis with a tube placed in the subarachnoid space can ameliorate or prevent progression of associated clinical signs.","Meren, Ilyssa L; Chavera, Jessica A; Alcott, Cody J; Barker, Andrew K; Jeffery, Nick D",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146294/,262
142103,We will see future disease outbreaks if we don't speak out on the dangers of TCMs.,2020-06-27,"Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious disease of pigs, sheep, goats, bovine, and various wild cloven-hoofed animals caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) that has given rise to significant economic loss to global livestock industry. FMDV 3B protein is an important determinant of virulence of the virus. Modifications in 3B protein of FMDV considerably decrease virus yield. In the current study, we demonstrated the significant role of 3B protein in suppression of type I IFN production and host antiviral response in both human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and porcine kidney PK-15 cells. We found that 3B protein interacted with the viral RNA sensor RIG-I to block RIG-I-mediated immune signaling. 3B protein did not affect the expression of RIG-I but interacted with RIG-I to block the interaction between RIG-I and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which prevented the TRIM25-mediated, Lys63-linked ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I. This inhibition of RIG-I-mediated immune signaling by 3B protein decreased IFN-β, IFN-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines expression, which in turn promoted FMDV replication. All of the three nonidentical copies of 3B could inhibit type I IFN production, and the aa 17A in each copy of 3B was involved in suppression of IFN-related antiviral response during FMDV infection in porcine cells. Together, our results indicate the role of 3B in suppression of host innate immune response and reveal a novel antagonistic mechanism of FMDV that is mediated by 3B protein.","Zhang, Xiangle; Zhu, Zixiang; Wang, Congcong; Yang, Fan; Cao, Weijun; Li, Pengfei; Du, Xiaoli; Zhao, Furong; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1901333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917788/,262
142172,Updates in Urologic Robot Assisted Surgery.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Uterine adenosarcomas (AS) are rare tumors composed of malignant stromal and benign epithelial components. We sought to evaluate the role of primary surgery, adjuvant treatments, and salvage therapies for patients with uterine adenosarcomas. METHODS We identified all patients diagnosed with AS from 1990 to 2009 at our institution. Patient demographics, surgical procedures, sites of metastatic disease, and histologic features (e.g., presence of sarcomatous overgrowth, and heterologous elements) were collected. Treatment regimens and survival outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Thirty-one patients were evaluable for this study: 19 (61%) received up-front treatment at our institution and 12 (39%) received treatment for recurrent disease. Most of the up-front treated patients (15, 79%) were diagnosed with stage I disease and underwent hysterectomy (100%) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (84%). Of the 19 patients treated at our institution from time of initial diagnosis, 5 (26%) patients recurred (median follow-up, 72.9 months; range, 3-154). In 5 patients with sarcomatous overgrowth (AS+SO), the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were both 20% versus 100% for 14 patients without sarcomatous overgrowth. Responses to systemic treatment of measurable disease were observed in patients with and without sarcomatous overgrowth, but no optimal treatment strategy could be identified for either groups. CONCLUSIONS Unlike AS without sarcomatous overgrowth, AS+SO is an aggressive disease with a high recurrence rate. In our series, no optimal adjuvant or systemic treatment strategy was identifiable but standard sarcoma chemotherapy regimens appear to have efficacy in both AS and AS+SO.","Tanner, Edward J; Toussaint, Thomas; Leitao, Mario M; Hensley, Martee L; Soslow, Robert A; Gardner, Ginger J; Jewell, Elizabeth L",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.12.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283300/,262
142443,In vitro evaluation of the permeability of prosthetic meshes as the possible cause of postoperative seroma formation.,2009,"BACKGROUND Minimal access surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer is topical and demanding, and approaches vary significantly. There is little data on the hybrid technique of laparoscopic-assisted two-phase oesophago-gastrectomy (LA2OG). Here we aim to review our experience, which exceeds 10 years, of this technique for oesophageal malignancy. METHODS From June 1998 to May 2009, 111 patients underwent LA2OG. Patients included 84 men and 27 women with mean age 65 years (range 35-85 years). Retrospective analysis of indications, outcome, staging, complications and survival was performed. RESULTS The majority of resections (96%) were performed for gastro-oesophageal junction or distal oesophageal pathology. Indications included adenocarcinoma (84.7%), squamous cell carcinoma (7.2%) and high-grade dysplasia (5.4%). Of patients, 67.6% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median time for the laparoscopic phase was 207 min (range 105-600 min), and 420 min (range 210-780 min) overall. Estimated blood loss was 330 ml (range 100-1,200 ml). Median critical care and post-operative stays were 3 and 14 days, respectively. Over time, the radicality of surgery increased. From 1998 to 2001 median lymph node yield was 5, from 2002 to 2005 it was 12 nodes, and from 2006 to 2009 it was 28 nodes (p < 0.001). The overall complication rate was 38.7%, minor in 24.3%, with anastomotic leak rate of 5.5%. Median survival was 38.5 ± 5.4 months. Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality were 1.8 and 2.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Two-stage laparoscopic-assisted oesophago-gastrectomy is a safe staged method of developing minimal access surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer. This study provides a useful reference for comparison with other minimally invasive methods.","Baker, Cara R; Bailey, Michael E; Soon, Yuen; Singh, Sukhpal; Preston, Shaun R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1774-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656071/,262

This presents unique challenges that differ from those faced in high-income country (HIC) contexts, due to a dearth of infrastructure and unique socio-cultural contexts. Field experiences by research teams working in these LMIC contexts are thus critical to advancing knowledge on successful research conduct in these settings. The Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has operated in The Gambia, a resource-constrained LMIC for over 70 years and has developed numerous research support platforms and systems. The unit was the lead clinical collaborator in a recently completed Expanded Program on Immunization Consortium (EPIC) study, involving a multicountry collaboration across five countries including the USA, Canada, Belgium, Papua New Guinea and The Gambia. The EPIC study recruited and completed follow-up of 720 newborn infants over 2 years. In this paper, we provide in-depth field experience covering challenges faced by the Gambian EPIC team in the conduct of this study. We also detail some reflections on these challenges.

142968,Translating academic careers into industry healthcare professions.,2020-06-01,"Recent advances in stroke reperfusion therapies have led to remarkable improvement in clinical outcomes, but many patients remain severely disabled, due in part to the lack of effective neuroprotective strategies. In this review, we show that 95% of published preclinical studies on ""neuroprotectants"" (1990-2018) reported positive outcomes in animal models of ischemic stroke, while none translated to successful Phase III trials. There are many complex reasons for this failure in translational research, including that the majority of clinical trials did not test early delivery of neuroprotectants in combination with successful reperfusion. In contrast to the clinical trials, >80% of recent preclinical studies examined the neuroprotectant in animal models of transient ischemia with complete reperfusion. Furthermore, only a small fraction of preclinical studies included long-term functional assessments, aged animals of both genders, and models with stroke comorbidities. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that 70%-80% of patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy achieve successful reperfusion. These successes revive the opportunity to retest previously failed approaches, including cocktail drugs that target multiple injury phases and different cell types. It is our hope that neurovascular protectants can be retested in future stroke research studies with specific criteria outlined in this review to increase translational successes.","Shi, Ligen; Rocha, Marcelo; Leak, Rehana K; Zhao, Jingyan; Bhatia, Tarun N; Mu, Hongfeng; Wei, Zhishuo; Yu, Fang; Weiner, Susan L; Ma, Feifei; Jovin, Tudor G; Chen, Jun",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x18798162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30191760/,262

Flow diversion with stent reconstruction is an emerging treatment and has shown promising initial results. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the experience of one institution using stent reconstruction for pseudoaneurysms of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and to compare with a review of the literature. METHODS A retrospective review from one institution identified eight patients with 'blister' aneurysms over a 47-month period. The Raymond scale was used to classify the aneurysms. Clinical data were obtained using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. A literature review was performed and compared with our results. Clinical and angiographic data were obtained. RESULTS After treatment, two aneurysms were Raymond class 1 (25%) and six were class 3 (75%). Of the class 3 aneurysms, two required retreatment, three (50%) progressed to complete occlusion and three (50%) had persistent aneurysm filling. Clinical data revealed two patients with mRS score of 0 (25%), five with mRS score of 1 (62.5%) and one with mRS score of 2 (12.5%). From the literature review, residual filling was evident in nine patients (64.3%) and complete occlusion in four (28.6%). On follow-up angiography, nine (64.3%) were occluded, two (14.3%) had residual neck filling and one (7.1%) had persistent aneurysm filling. Thirteen patients (92.9%) had an mRS score of 2 or better. Combining the available experience, patients demonstrated either improvement (n=9, 41%) or stability (n=11, 50%). Only two (9%) had progression requiring retreatment.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is required to protect healthcare workers from contracting the virus. The authors evaluated the use of full-dress rehearsals (FDR) to familiarize staff with protocols and equipment that are not often use otherwise. METHODS A single institution in Singapore performed FDR with noninfected patients for endoscopy after refresher courses with PPE were conducted. FDRs were conducted between February and March 2020, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. The FDRs involved all phases of endoscopy. Statistics from the FDRs were compared against baseline procedure statistics. A self-administered survey was conducted for the procedurists after the FDRs. RESULTS A total of 26 FDRs were conducted and 20 (77%) completed the survey. Among all the FDRs conducted, there was a slight increase in duration for colonoscopy FDRs (21.5 min vs 20.0 min, p = 0.22). There were no complications. All respondents had a good experience (score rating of 4-5/5). On qualitative analysis, the themes identified were: FDRs provided a good opportunity to have hands-on familiarization of the equipment on top of routine refresher training. Participants were cognizant of the ongoing outbreak and the evolving threat. Safety measures were reinforced. Procedurists who acknowledged weaknesses, requested for more training. CONCLUSIONS Simulation training with patients provides participants with a level of realism that is critical for rapid learning. In crisis management, the most effective protocol familiarization is important to instill confidence in the PPE, workflows and healthcare partners.","Koh, Frederick H; Ng, Aven; Tan, Alina; Li, Jinliang; Mohd-Nor, Nazeemah B; Ng, Siok-Peng; Chew, Min-Hoe",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2020.1821135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969721/,262
145420,Increase in animal abuse likely during lockdown.,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND REG1 is a novel anticoagulation system consisting of pegnivacogin, an RNA aptamer inhibitor of coagulation factor IXa, and anivamersen, a complementary sequence reversal oligonucleotide. We tested the hypothesis that near complete inhibition of factor IXa with pegnivacogin during percutaneous coronary intervention, followed by partial reversal with anivamersen, would reduce ischaemic events compared with bivalirudin, without increasing bleeding. METHODS We did a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, superiority trial to compare REG1 with bivalirudin at 225 hospitals in North America and Europe. We planned to randomly allocate 13,200 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in a 1:1 ratio to either REG1 (pegnivacogin 1 mg/kg bolus [>99% factor IXa inhibition] followed by 80% reversal with anivamersen after percutaneous coronary intervention) or bivalirudin. Exclusion criteria included ST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 48 h. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unplanned target lesion revascularisation by day 3 after randomisation. The principal safety endpoint was major bleeding. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01848106. The trial was terminated early after enrolment of 3232 patients due to severe allergic reactions. FINDINGS 1616 patients were allocated REG1 and 1616 were assigned bivalirudin, of whom 1605 and 1601 patients, respectively, received the assigned treatment. Severe allergic reactions were reported in ten (1%) of 1605 patients receiving REG1 versus one (<1%) of 1601 patients treated with bivalirudin. The composite primary endpoint did not differ between groups, with 108 (7%) of 1616 patients assigned REG1 and 103 (6%) of 1616 allocated bivalirudin reporting a primary endpoint event (odds ratio [OR] 1·05, 95% CI 0·80-1·39; p=0·72). Major bleeding was similar between treatment groups (seven [<1%] of 1605 receiving REG1 vs two [<1%] of 1601 treated with bivalirudin; OR 3·49, 95% CI 0·73-16·82; p=0·10), but major or minor bleeding was increased with REG1 (104 [6%] vs 65 [4%]; 1·64, 1·19-2·25; p=0·002).

To date, subwavelength grating mirrors have been fabricated by suspending a thin grating membrane in the air or placing it on a low refractive index material - a scheme that requires sophisticated processing and makes the gratings sensitive to mechanical stress, impeding current injection, and heat dissipation if used in active devices. Inherently MHCGs are well suited for optoelectronic devices because they can be fabricated in all possible material systems. Here we demonstrate above 90% optical power reflectance, strong polarization discrimination. Based on experimental analysis aided by numerical simulations, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the spectral characteristics of MHCGs reflectance for more than 200 nm via modification of the duty cycle of the MHCG stripes. We show our MHCG tuning method is convenient to define the properties of MHCG devices during the device processing.","Marciniak, Magdalena; Broda, Artur; Gębski, Marcin; Dems, Maciej; Muszalski, Jan; Czerwinski, Andrzej; Ratajczak, Jacek; Marona, Łucja; Nakwaski, Włodzimierz; Lott, James A; Czyszanowski, Tomasz",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.396693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680146/,262

Our aim was to review the most current data on COVID-19 to provide essential suggestions on how to manage the acute abdomen during the pandemic. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of the most relevant English language articles on COVID-19 and surgery published between 15 December 2019 and 30 March 2020. FINDINGS Access to the operating theatre is almost exclusively restricted to emergencies and oncological procedures. The use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 positive patients should be cautiously considered. The main risk lies in the presence of the virus in the pneumoperitoneum: the aerosol released in the operating theatre could contaminate both staff and the environment. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, all efforts should be deployed in order to evaluate the feasibility of postponing surgery until the patient is no longer considered potentially infectious or at risk of perioperative complications. If surgery is deemed necessary, the emergency surgeon must minimise the risk of exposure to the virus by involving a minimal number of healthcare staff and shortening the occupation of the operating theatre. In case of a lack of security measures to enable safe laparoscopy, open surgery should be considered.","De Simone, B; Chouillard, E; Di Saverio, S; Pagani, L; Sartelli, M; Biffl, W L; Coccolini, F; Pieri, A; Khan, M; Borzellino, G; Campanile, F C; Ansaloni, L; Catena, F",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.0097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352836/,262

The combination of both approaches shall revolutionize healthcare, accelerating clinical trial processes and reducing the costs and time involved in drug research and development. AREAS COVERED This review explores the basics of artificial intelligence and systems biology approaches in the vaccine development pipeline. The topics include a detailed description of epitope prediction tools for designing epitope-based vaccines and agent-based models for immune system response prediction, along with a focus on their potentiality to facilitate clinical trial phases. EXPERT OPINION Artificial intelligence and systems biology offer the opportunity to avoid the inefficiencies and failures that arise in the classical vaccine development pipeline. One promising solution is the combination of both methodologies in a multiscale perspective through an accurate pipeline. We are entering an 'in silico era' in which scientific partnerships, including a more and more increasing creation of an 'ecosystem' of collaboration and multidisciplinary approach, are relevant for addressing the long and risky road of vaccine discovery and development. In this context, regulatory guidance should be developed to qualify the in silico trials as evidence for intelligent vaccine development.","Russo, Giulia; Reche, Pedro; Pennisi, Marzio; Pappalardo, Francesco",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1791076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662677/,262

To cope with this biological invasion and to safeguard biodiversity, the LIFE+U-SAVEREDS project aims to protect the red squirrel, by limiting the growth of the current population of gray squirrels and simultaneously promoting their eradication with surgical sterilization. This study compares two different anesthetic protocols, including dexmedetomidine (40 µg/kg) and midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) associated with ketamine (15 mg/kg; n = 25 squirrels) or alfaxalone (5 mg/kg; n = 22 squirrels). A blinded investigator evaluated the quality and onset of sedation, intraoperative anesthesia, and recovery, as well as the physiologic parameters for each animal. Alfaxalone provided a good quality of anesthesia with limited cardiovascular effects (p < 0.05) and good intraoperative myorelaxation. Ketamine induced complete relaxation in a shorter time (p < 0.05) and a rapid (p < 0.001) and excellent (p < 0.05) recovery. Despite the overall superiority of ketamine, alfaxalone appeared to be an adequate alternative anesthetic drug that can be administered without requiring intravascular access. It should be rapidly metabolized and excreted; however, it requires the combination of longer acting sedatives/myorelaxants to prevent a poor recovery quality.","Nannarone, Sara; Moretti, Giulia; Bellocchi, Federica; Menchetti, Laura; Bufalari, Antonello",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10081402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806590/,262

148670,Evaluating protein similarity from coarse structures.,2009,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) can achieve excellent weight loss, yet sleeve dilatation with concomitant weight regain proves to be a relevant issue. Hence, additional restriction might improve results after LSG. METHODS In a retrospective matched-pair analysis, 42 patients who underwent banded LSG (BLSG) using a MiniMizer® ring between January 2012 and October 2014 were analysed regarding weight loss, complications and comorbidity. Median follow-up was 3 years. Forty-two patients who had undergone conventional LSG were selected as matched pairs. RESULTS Mean preoperative BMI was 54.93 ± 7.42 kg/m2 for BLSG and 53.46 ± 6.69 kg/m2 for LSG (Mann-Whitney P = 0.540). Total weight loss (%TWL) was significantly greater in the BLSG group 3 years after surgery (BLSG 38.22% ± 7.26; n = 26 vs. LSG 32.69 ± 9.47; n = 26; P = 0.0154). Ring placement had no relevant impact on new-onset reflux (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0) but a tendency towards reflux improvement when reflux pre-existed (odds ratio 1.96). The major side effect of ring implantation was regurgitation with over 44% of patients presenting with regurgitation >1 per week (Fisher's exact test P = 0.0019, odds ratio 18.07). CONCLUSION BLSG is a safe procedure showing similar comorbidity to conventional LSG. However, BLSG leads to a higher rate of postoperative regurgitation. Weight loss is significantly improved 3 years after surgery. Hence, additional ring implantation might be an option for increased restriction in LSG surgery.","Fink, Jodok M; Hoffmann, Natalie; Kuesters, Simon; Seifert, Gabriel; Laessle, Claudia; Glatz, Torben; Hopt, Ulrich T; Konrad Karcz, W; Marjanovic, Goran",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2610-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214956/,262

149456,"Citius, Altius, Fortius.",2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND The American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines for scholarly activities by family medicine residents require at least one activity per resident and encourage conference presentations. Meeting these guidelines has traditionally been challenging due to a multitude of factors from lack of time to limited administrative support. Studies have shown that resident participation in research was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with training. We aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a dedicated research curriculum in achieving ACGME goals for our residents. METHODS We performed a need assessment that identified strengths and obstacles related to research which then guided the actions taken to build the curriculum. Revised curricular elements included a research focused lecture series, a restructured journal club, financial support for presentations and project expenses, a specific timeline for project completion, and the development of a regional research day involving multiple family medicine programs. Dedicated research time was built into the resident schedule and presentations at local, regional and national conferences were encouraged and supported. RESULTS Following implementation of the curriculum there was a marked increase in the number of scholarly projects performed by residents. Prior to implementation there had only been one presentation at a national conference in the previous five years. This increased to an average of four presentations per year in the following five year period. On a regional scale, the initial success of the local research day led to a continued expansion and now includes six family medicine programs. CONCLUSION Implementation of a dedicated multifaceted research curriculum significantly increased the participation of our residents in scholarly activities and led to a near five-fold increase in presentations at regional and national levels. Additionally, resident satisfaction in scholarly activities increased and a far greater number of graduating residents went on to complete fellowships.","Arora, Vikram; Bell, Paul F; Hagberg, Stephen",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420951030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883136/,262

MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 72 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF chemotherapy in 2004-2010. CT texture and histogram analysis of the primary mass on the pretherapy CT images were performed by using TexRAD software before and after application of spatial filters at different anatomic scales ranging from fine detail to coarse features. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between overall survival and the baseline CT imaging measurements and clinical variables. RESULTS Primary mass entropy and skewness measurements with multiple spatial filters were associated with overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating clinical and imaging variables indicated that primary mass size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 for each 1-cm increase; P = .018), N stage (HR, 8.77 for N3 vs N0 or N1; P = .002; HR, 4.99 for N3 vs N2; P = .001), and primary mass entropy (HR, 2.10 for each 0.5-unit increase; P = .036) and skewness (HR, 3.67 for each 1.0-unit increase; P = .009) measurements with the 1.0 spatial filter were independently associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION Independent of tumor size, N stage, and other clinical variables, primary mass CT texture and histogram analysis parameters are associated with overall survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF.

151842,Nature Biotechnology's academic spinouts of 2019.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIM We hypothesised that the use of 50% compared to 100% oxygen maintains cerebral oxygenation and ameliorates the disturbance of cardiac mitochondrial respiration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced electrically in anaesthetised healthy adult pigs and left untreated for seven minutes followed by randomisation to manual ventilation with 50% or 100% oxygen and mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS®). Defibrillation was performed at thirteen minutes and repeated if necessary every two minutes with 1mg intravenous adrenaline. Cerebral oxygenation was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (rSO2, INVOS™5100C Cerebral Oximeter) and with a probe (NEUROVENT-PTO, RAUMEDIC) in the frontal brain cortex (PbO2). Heart biopsies were obtained 20min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with an analysis of mitochondrial respiration (OROBOROS Instruments Corp., Innsbruck, Austria), and compared to four control animals without VF and CPR. Brain rSO2 and PbO2 were log transformed and analysed with a mixed linear model and mitochondrial respiration with an analysis of variance. RESULTS Of the twenty pigs, one had a breach of protocol and was excluded, leaving nine pigs in the 50% group and ten in the 100% group. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in six pigs in the 50% group and eight in the 100% group. The rSO2 (p=0.007) was lower with FiO2 50%, but the PbO2 was not (p=0.93). After ROSC there were significant interactions between time and FiO2 regarding both rSO2 (p=0.001) and PbO2 (p=0.004). Compared to the controls, mitochondrial respiration was decreased, with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels of 57 (17)pmols-1mg-1 compared to 92 (23)pmols-1mg-1 (p=0.008), but there was no difference between different oxygen fractions (p=0.79). CONCLUSIONS The use of 50% oxygen during CPR results in lower cerebral oximetry values compared to 100% oxygen but there is no difference in brain tissue oxygen. Cardiac arrest disturbs cardiac mitochondrial respiration, but it is not alleviated with the use of 50% compared to 100% oxygen (Ethical and hospital approvals ESAVI/1077/04.10.07/2016 and HUS/215/2016, §7 30.3.2016, Funding Helsinki University and others).","Nelskylä, Annika; Nurmi, Jouni; Jousi, Milla; Schramko, Alexey; Mervaala, Eero; Ristagno, Giuseppe; Skrifvars, Markus B",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.04.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438718/,262

152215,Feature-rich covalent stains for super-resolution and cleared tissue fluorescence microscopy.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Higher tissue transcript levels of immune-related markers-including the recently discovered viral restriction factor interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM), which inhibits viral entry and replication-have been reported in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. Interestingly, mouse models of neuroinflammation have higher IFITM levels and deficits in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related markers that are similar to findings in schizophrenia, suggesting that a shared pathogenetic process might underlie diverse cortical pathology in the disorder. However, the cell types that overexpress IFITM messenger RNA (mRNA) in schizophrenia are unknown, and it is unclear whether higher IFITM mRNA levels are associated with lower GABA-related marker levels in the same schizophrenia subjects. METHODS We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization with film and grain counting analyses to quantify IFITM mRNA levels in prefrontal cortex area 9 of 57 schizophrenia and 57 healthy comparison subjects and in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. RESULTS Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization film analysis revealed markedly elevated IFITM mRNA levels (+114% and +117%, respectively) in prefrontal gray matter in schizophrenia. Interestingly, emulsion-dipped, Nissl-stained sections from schizophrenia and comparison subjects revealed IFITM mRNA expression in pia mater and blood vessels. The IFITM grain density over blood vessels was 71% higher in schizophrenia. The IFITM mRNA levels were negatively correlated with GABA-related mRNAs in the same schizophrenia subjects. CONCLUSIONS The finding that schizophrenia subjects with higher IFITM mRNA levels in cortical blood vessels have greater disturbances in cortical GABA neurons suggests that these cell-type distinct pathological disturbances might be influenced by a shared upstream insult that involves immune activation.","Siegel, Benjamin I; Sengupta, Elizabeth J; Edelson, Jessica R; Lewis, David A; Volk, David W",Biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24209773/,262

153452,Reflecting on an unprecedented year.,2020-09-05,"OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the demographic shifts in emergency service admissions, possible measures and room for improvement in emergency services during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY Our study retrospectively analysed the demographic features and clinical admission types of patients admitted to Batman District State Hospital Emergency Service at two different time periods, one between 28 March 2019 and 28 April 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the other between 28 March 2020 and 28 April 2020 (during the Covid-19 pandemic). The results were compared between the two periods designated as the pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS The number of patients admitted to emergency service was 47,681 in the pre-pandemic period and 9455 in the pandemic period (P < .01). The number of patients examined in green zone (non-urgent cases) was 27,701 (58%) in the pre-pandemic period and 3668 (38.7%) in the pandemic period (P < .01). The number of patients admitted for trauma was 1247 (2.61%) in the pre-pandemic period and 59 (0.62%) in the pandemic period (P < .01). The number of patients hospitalised to cardiology department or coronary care unit for acute coronary syndrome was 602 (1.26%) in the pre-pandemic period and 29 (0.3%) in the pandemic period (P < .01). The number of patients hospitalised to neurological intensive care unit for acute cerebrovascular disease was 542 (1.13%) in the pre-pandemic period and 22 (0.2%) in the pandemic period (P < .01). The number of patients hospitalised to pulmonary diseases department or intensive care unit for dyspnea was 622 (1.21%) in the pre-pandemic period and 515 (5.4%) in the pandemic period (P < .01). CONCLUSION Measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection have caused a significant drop in emergency service admissions. We are of the opinion that this will lead to an increase in deaths occurring at home, and we will soon encounter patients with worse prognosis and overcrowded emergency services.

Routine vagotomy during RYGB may independently affect weight loss and metabolic outcomes following bariatric surgery. We aimed to determine whether vagotomy augments percent excess weight loss in obese patients after RYGB. METHODS We examined the effect of vagotomy in 1278 patients undergoing RYGB at our institution from 2003 to 2009. Weight and percent excess weight loss (%EWL) were modelled at three months and annually up to five years using a longitudinal linear mixed model controlling for differences in age, gender, initial body mass index (BMI), ideal body weight, and presence of vagotomy. RESULTS Vagotomy was performed on 40.3% of our cohort. Vagotomy patients had significantly lower initial BMI (46.4±6.2 vs. 48.3±7.7kg/m(2), p<0.001), but there were no other significant differences at baseline. The strongest predictor of %EWL over time was initial BMI, with lower BMI patients exhibiting greater %EWL (p<0.001). Age and gender effects were also significant, with younger patients (p<0.04) and males (p<0.002) attaining greater %EWL. Vagotomy had no effect on %EWL in either simple or multiple regression models.

155007,Remote Access Robotic Facelift Thyroidectomy: A Multi-institutional Experience.,2017,"BACKGROUND Oropharyngeal dysphagia or swallowing difficulties are common in acute care and critical care, affecting 47% of hospitalised frail elderly, 50% of acute stroke patients and approximately 62% of critically ill patients who have been intubated and mechanically ventilated for prolonged periods. Complications of dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition, increased length of hospital stay and re-admission to hospital. To date, most dysphagia interventions in acute care have been tested with acute stroke populations. While intervention studies in critical care have been emerging since 2015, they are limited and so there is much to learn about the type, the delivery and the intensity of treatments in this setting to inform future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the evidence regarding the relationship between dysphagia interventions and clinically important patient outcomes in acute and critical care settings. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL and clinical trial registries from inception to the present. We will include studies conducted with adults in acute care settings such as acute hospital wards or units or intensive care units and critical care settings. Studies will be restricted to randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a new dysphagia intervention with usual care or another intervention. The main outcomes that will be collected include length of time taken to return to oral intake, change in incidence of aspiration and pneumonia, nutritional status, length of hospital stay and quality of life. Key intervention components such as delivery, intensity, acceptability, fidelity and adverse events associated with such interventions will be collected to inform future clinical trials. Two independent reviewers will assess articles for eligibility, data extraction and quality appraisal. A meta-analysis will be conducted as appropriate.

Passive diffusion rate is translatable across tissues and animal species, while the extent of absorption is dependent on drug properties, as well as in vivo physiology / pathophysiology. Design principles have been developed to guide medicinal chemistry to enhance absorption, which combine the balance of aqueous solubility, permeability and the sometimes unfavorable compound characteristic demanded by the target. Permeability assays have been implemented that enable rapid development of structure-permeability relationships for permeability improvement. Future advances in assay development to reduce nonspecific binding and improve mass balance will enable more accurately measurement of passive permeability. Design principles that integrate potency, selectivity, passive permeability and other ADMET properties facilitate rapid advancement of successful drug candidates to patients.","Di, Li; Artursson, Per; Avdeef, Alex; Benet, Leslie; Houston, Brian; Kansy, Manfred; Kerns, Edward; Lennernäs, Hans; Smith, Dennis; Sugano, Kiyohiko",ChemMedChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202000419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743945/,262

The WHO guidance states that patients with COVID-19 should be managed by staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment; however, working whilst wearing personal protective equipment is unfamiliar to many healthcare professionals. We ran high-fidelity, in situ simulation of high-risk procedures on patients with COVID-19 in a negative-pressure side room on our intensive care unit. Our aim was to identify potential problems, to test the robustness of our systems and to inform modification of our standard operating procedures for any patients with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit. The simulations revealed several important latent risks and allowed us to put corrective measures in place prior to the admission of patients with COVID-19. We recommend that staff working in clinical areas expected to receive patients with COVID-19 conduct in situ simulation in order to detect their own unique risks and aid in the creation of local guidelines of management of patients with COVID-19.","Fregene, T E; Nadarajah, P; Buckley, J F; Bigham, S; Nangalia, V",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221964/,262

The evidence for this novel medication is largely based on one pivotal phase III trial which was stopped early due to significant clinical benefits being shown. However potential limitations in trial design have been highlighted in recent literature, necessitating a thorough review of all evidence for sacubitril/valsartan. Methods: This review will be conducted using the PRISMA reporting guidelines. Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for sacubitril/valsartan will be systematically searched for in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Toxline and Scopus. Clinical trials registries will be searched, as will eight grey literature databases. In addition, unpublished clinical study reports (CSRs) of relevant trials will be requested from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Clinical Study Data Request database. Studies will be included if they involve randomising adult patients with heart failure to either sacubitril/valsartan or usual care, with either an active comparator or placebo as a control. Heart failure of any subtype or NYHA class will be included. All relevant clinical and safety outcomes will be reviewed, particularly hospitalisation due to heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Two reviewers will assess eligibility of selected studies for inclusion. Data extraction will be performed separately for trial publications, clinical trial registries and for CSRs using a piloted form. Methodological quality of included trials from published sources will be assessed separately using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2). Narrative synthesis of included studies will be conducted and, if appropriate, meta-analysis for clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. Discussion: This review will collate all available RCT data on sacubitril/valsartan including published and unpublished sources in order to obtain a more complete picture of the evidence base for sacubitril/valsartan.

Opioids can be used to treat chronic pain but at the cost of adverse effects and risk of dependence. Recently, there has been a movement to improve analgesic care in the setting of the opioid epidemic and the overprescribing of opioids, causing over-accessibility, dependence, and large numbers of overdose deaths. Opioid-specific receptors, including the μ, δ, κ, and opioid receptor like-1 (ORL-1) receptors, are each 7-transmembrane spanning proteins, which affect the G-protein and β-arrestin cascades. Each opioid class can act differently on the receptors, resulting in full, partial, or antagonizing effects. This comprehensive review looks at different agents in major classes, nonselective and mixed/partial agonists/antagonists, including the nonselective partial agonists, levorphanol and tramadol. Mixed partial agonists/antagonists include buprenorphine, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol. Oliceridine is the only current selective partial agonist that agonizes specific pathways to promote analgesic effects and discourage adverse effects.","Gress, Kyle; Charipova, Karina; Jung, Jai Won; Kaye, Alan D; Paladini, Antonella; Varrassi, Giustino; Viswanath, Omar; Urits, Ivan",Best practice & research.

A bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) examination has been shown to have a potential role in this setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential prognostic value of a new LUS protocol (evaluation of 14 anatomic landmarks, with graded scores of 0-3) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the association of LUS patterns with clinical or laboratory findings. METHODS A cohort of 52 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 underwent LUS examinations on admission in an internal medicine ward and before their discharge. A total LUS score as the sum of the scores at each explored area was computed. We investigated the association between the LUS score and clinical worsening, defined as a combination of high-flow oxygen support, intensive care unit admission, or 30-day mortality as the primary end point. RESULTS Twenty (39%) patients showed a worse outcome during the observation period; the mean LUS scores ± SDs were 20.4 ± 8.5 and 29.2 ± 7.3 in patients without and with worsening, respectively (P < .001). In a multivariable analysis, adjusted for comorbidities (>2), age (>65 years), sex (male), and body mass index (≥25 kg/m2 ), the association between the LUS score and worsening (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.29; P = .003) was confirmed, with good discrimination of the model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). A median LUS score higher than 24 was associated with an almost 6-fold increase in the odds of worsening (odds ratio, 5.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.29 to 24.8; P = .021).

OBJECTIVE The main purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence of these neurosensory impairments in patients with Covid-19, and to assess short-term recovery. METHODS We performed a multicenter case series study during the Covid-19 epidemic. All patients presenting a RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, whether hospitalized or treated at home. To analyze the prevalence and features of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, a phone interview was conducted 5 days after the positive PCR result. The questionnaire was submitted again 10 days later to patients having reported olfactory and gustatory disorders, in order to assess their recovery. RESULTS 115 patients were included in our study. 81 patients (70%) reported olfactory and gustatory disorders without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. These impairments were more frequently reported in the female population, young people, and house-bound patients with mild symptomatic forms. Short-term recovery assessed at Day 15 was complete for 64% of the patients, and incomplete in 33%. Median recovery time was 15 days (4-27 days) after olfactory or gustatory symptom onset. CONCLUSION Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions related to Covid-19 are frequently reported and prevalent in mild symptomatic forms of the disease. Recovery in most cases seems rapid and complete.","Chary, Eléonore; Carsuzaa, Florent; Trijolet, Jean-Paul; Capitaine, Anne-Laure; Roncato-Saberan, Mariam; Fouet, Kevin; Cazenave-Roblot, France; Catroux, Mélanie; Allix-Beguec, Caroline; Dufour, Xavier",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1945892420930954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527141/,262

To which extent anticoagulation affects their concentration, cellular origin and protein composition is largely unexplored. To study this, blood from 23 healthy subjects was collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD), citrate or EDTA, or without anticoagulation to obtain serum. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation or by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for fluorescence-SEC. EVs were analyzed by micro flow cytometry, NTA, TEM, Western blot, and protein mass spectrometry. The plasma EV concentration was unaffected by anticoagulants, but serum contained more platelet EVs. The protein composition of plasma EVs differed between anticoagulants, and between plasma and serum. Comparison to other studies further revealed that the shared EV protein composition resembles the ""protein corona"" of synthetic nanoparticles incubated in plasma or serum. In conclusion, we have validated a higher concentration of platelet EVs in serum than plasma by contemporary EV methods. Anticoagulation should be carefully described (i) to enable study comparison, (ii) to utilize available sample cohorts, and (iii) when preparing/selecting biobank samples. Further, the similarity of the EV protein corona and that of nanoparticles implicates that EVs carry both intravesicular and extravesicular cargo, which will expand their applicability for biomarker discovery.","Palviainen, Mari; Saraswat, Mayank; Varga, Zoltán; Kitka, Diána; Neuvonen, Maarit; Puhka, Maija; Joenväärä, Sakari; Renkonen, Risto; Nieuwland, Rienk; Takatalo, Maarit; Siljander, Pia R M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813744/,262

However literature is scanty pertaining to the profile and scoring system in sarcoidosis. This study was undertaken to understand the profile of sarcoidosis and an endeavor to assess the functional status with a simplified scoring system. This was an observational study undertaken in the department of Pulmonary Medicine at a tertiary care. The profile of these patients was studied in terms of clinical features, radiological findings, the New Modified Criteria Clinical Radiological Physiological (TNMC CRP) score, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), spirometry, arterial blood gas parameters, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and tissue biopsy histopathology. The 68 patients included 41 women and 27 men with a mean age of 42.7 years. They comprised of 18 (27%), 39 (57%), 4 (6%), 7 (10%) cases of stage 1, 2, 3, 4 sarcoidosis respectively. Most common presenting symptom and sign was progressive dyspnea 49 (72%), and peripheral lymphadenopathy 15 (22%). Serum ACE was elevated in 57 (83%). The average 6MWD was 360 meters. Most common high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding was mediastinal lymphadenopathy and peri-bronchovascular nodules. Spirometry was restrictive abnormality in 48 (96%) patients. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was present in 32 (47%) patients. Tissue diagnosis revealed granulomatous inflammation in 51 biopsies with a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) yield of 62%. The average TNMC CRP score was 5. There was a positive correlation between this score and 6MWD which was statistically significant. The score correlated with the functional status. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis warrants a comprehensive and multimodality approach. HRCT and tissue biopsy are the most important diagnostic armamentariums. Modified simplified scores help assess the functional status of the disease.","Utpat, Ketaki; Sasikumar, Chinnu; Desai, Unnati; Joshi, Jyotsna M",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594856/,262

The COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to investigate the effects of traffic volume on wildlife-vehicle collisions in the United States. We observed decreased traffic nationwide, particularly in densely populated states with low or high disease burdens. Despite reduced traffic, total collisions were unchanged; wildlife-vehicle collisions did decline at the start of the pandemic, but increased as the pandemic progressed, ultimately exceeding collisions in the previous year. As a result, nationwide collision rates were higher during the pandemic. We suggest that increased wildlife road use offsets the effects of decreased traffic volume on wildlife-vehicle collisions. Thus, decreased traffic volume will not always reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.","Abraham, Joel O; Mumma, Matthew A",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99233-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650093/,262

CLINICAL FINDINGS Clinical signs included muscle atrophy, paresis, depressed spinal reflexes, hyperesthesia of the thoracic limbs, and reduced jaw muscle tone. Pelvic limb reflexes were normal. Results of a neurologic examination were suggestive of multifocal lesions involving both brachial plexuses and the trigeminal nerves. Abnormal nerve conduction across the brachial plexus and delayed late potentials were found on electrodiagnostic testing, and diffuse subclinical involvement of other regions of the peripheral nervous system was confirmed on the basis of abnormal electromyographic findings for the masticatory muscles and conduction block of the peroneal nerve. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME No specific treatments were given, and neurologic signs resolved within a month. A relapse occurred 2 months after the first episode, with clinical signs affecting both the pelvic and the thoracic limbs on this occasion. Again, the condition resolved without specific treatment, and 13 months after the initial episode, the cat reportedly was normal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings suggested that brachial plexus neuropathy can be a multifocal disease in cats, even if clinically apparent neurologic deficits are initially subtle or absent, and that electrodiagnostic techniques can be used to identify subclinical involvement of the peripheral nerves.","Freeman, Paul M; Harcourt-Brown, Thomas R; Jeffery, Nick D; Granger, Nicolas",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.234.2.240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19210244/,262

Despite increasing demand on cost effective and easy-to-use assessment methods, a considerable amount of WCBs retains certain drawbacks such as long response time, low precision and accuracy. Furthermore, the output signal level does not correspond to a specific analyte concentration value but shows comparative quantification. Here, we utilized a neural network-based architecture to improve the aforementioned features of WCBs and engineered a gold sensing WCB which has a long response time (18 h). Two Long-Short Term-Memory (LSTM)-based networks were integrated to assess both ON/OFF and concentration dependent states of the sensor output, respectively. We demonstrated that binary (ON/OFF) network was able to distinguish between ON/OFF states as early as 30 min with 78% accuracy and over 98% in 3 h. Furthermore, when analyzed in analog manner, we demonstrated that network can classify the raw fluorescence data into pre-defined analyte concentration groups with high precision (82%) in 3 h. This approach can be applied to a wide range of WCBs and improve rapidness, simplicity and accuracy which are the main challenges in synthetic biology enabled biosensing.","Saltepe, Behide; Bozkurt, Eray Ulaş; Güngen, Murat Alp; Çiçek, A.

These include vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), an ultra-rare adverse event in which patients develop life-threatening blood clots 5-24 days following vaccination. To investigate vector-host interactions of ChAdOx1 underpinning VITT we solved the structure of the ChAdOx1 capsid by CryoEM, and the structure of the primary receptor tropism determining fiber-knob protein by crystallography. These structural insights have enabled us to unravel key protein interactions involved in ChAdOx1 cell entry and a possible means by which it may generate misplaced immunity to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein involved in coagulation. We use in vitro cell binding assays to show that the fiber-knob protein uses coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) as a high affinity binding partner, while it does not form a stable interface with CD46. Computational simulations identified a putative mechanism by which the ChAdOx1 capsid interacts with PF4 by binding in the spaces between hexon proteins, with downstream implications for the causes of VITT. Summary We present the structure of the ChAdOx1 viral vector, derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 at 4.2Å resolution1. ChAdOx1 is in global use in the AstraZeneca vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD-1222, to combat the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. Recently observed, rare, adverse events make detailed mechanistic understanding of this vector key to informing proper treatment of affected patients and the development of safer viral vectors. Here, we determine a primary mechanism ChAdOx1 uses to attach to cells is coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a protein which is identical in humans and chimpanzees. We demonstrate the vector does not form a stable CD46 interaction, a common species B adenovirus receptor, via its primary attachment protein. Further, we reveal the surface of the ChAdOx1 viral capsid has a strong electronegative potential. Molecular simulations suggest this charge, together with shape complementarity, are a mechanism by which an oppositely charged protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4) may bind the vector surface. PF4 is a key protein involved in the formation of blood clots2, and the target of auto-antibodies in heparin-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT)3, an adverse reaction to heparin therapy which presents similarly to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), a rare complication of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination4–6. We propose a mechanism in which the ChAdOx1-PF4 complex may stimulate the production of antibodies against PF4, leading to delayed blood clot formation, as observed in VITT.","Baker, Alexander T.; Boyd, Ryan J.; Sarkar, Daipayan; Vant, John; Crespo, Alicia Teijeira; Waraich, Kasim; Truong, Chloe D.; Bates, Emily; Wilson, Eric; Chan, Chun Kit; Lipka-Lloyd, Magdalena; Fromme, Petra; Nagalo, Marius Bolni; Heurich, Meike; Williams, Dewight; Chiu, Po-Lin; Rizkallah, Pierre J.; Parker, Alan L.; Singharoy, Abhishek; Borad, Mitesh J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.444882,262

170914,Response,2021,"Background We aimed to use individual patient data to describe pre-existing factors associated with severe disease, primarily admission to critical care, and death secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young people (CYP) in hospital. Methods We searched Pubmed, European PMC, Medline and Embase for case series and cohort studies that included all CYP admitted to hospital with [≥]30 CYP with SARS-CoV-2 or [≥]5 CYP with PIMS-TS or MIS-C. Eligible studies contained 1) details of age, sex, ethnicity or co-morbidities, and 2) an outcome which included admission to critical care, mechanical invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, or death. Studies reporting outcomes in more restricted grouping of co-morbidities were eligible for narrative review. Authors of eligible studies were approached for individual patient data (IPD). We used random effects meta-analyses for aggregate study-level data and multilevel mixed effect models for IPD data to examine risk factors (age, sex, comorbidities) associated with admission to critical care and death. Data shown are odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings 81 studies were included, 57 in the meta-analysis (of which 22 provided IPD) and 26 in the narrative synthesis. Most studies had an element of bias in their design or reporting. Sex was not associated with critical care or death. Compared with CYP aged 1-4 years, infants had increased odds of admission to critical care (OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.40-1.90)) and death (OR 2.08 (1.57-2.86)). Odds of death were increased amongst CYP over 10 years (10-14 years OR 2.15 (1.54-2.98); >14 years OR 2.15 (1.61-2.88)). Number of comorbid conditions was associated with increased odds of admission to critical care and death for COVID-19 in a dose-related fashion. For critical care admission odds ratios were: 1 comorbidity 1.49 (1.45-1.53); 2 comorbidities 2.58 (2.41-2.75); [≥]3 comorbidities 2.97 (2.04-4.32), and for death: 1 comorbidity 2.15 (1.98-2.34); 2 comorbidities 4.63 (4.54-4.74); [≥]3 co-morbidities 4.98 (3.78-6.65). Odds of admission to critical care were increased for all co-morbidities apart from asthma (0.92 (0.91-0.94)) and malignancy (0.85 (0.17-4.21)) with an increased odds of death in all co-morbidities considered apart from asthma. Neurological and cardiac comorbidities were associated with the greatest increase in odds of severe disease or death. Obesity increased the odds of severe disease and death independently of other comorbidities. Interpretation Hospitalised CYP at greatest vulnerability of severe disease or death from SARS-CoV-2 infection are infants, teenagers, those with cardiac or neurological conditions, or 2 or more comorbid conditions, and those who are obese. These groups should be considered higher priority for vaccination and for protective shielding when appropriate. Whilst odds ratios were high, the absolute increase in risk for most comorbidities was small compared to children without underlying conditions.","Harwood, R.; Yan, H.; Talawila Da Camara, N.; Smith, C.; Ward, J.; Tudur-Smith, C.; Linney, M.; Clark, M.; Whittaker, E.; Saatci, D.; Davis, P.

173672,Response,2021,"Technological skills development is a central issue for a country’s educational and social policies. Throughout their school career, from primary to secondary education and later in higher education, students have the opportunity to build and develop various skills, including technological. Considering the different needs and different uses that these skills encompass, these will certainly be necessary and useful in students’ academic and professional life. This study reports on an investigation of technological skills development in higher education. It aims to analyze the relevance of technologies integration, which technological skills are built and developed by higher education students, and what their perception about the importance of technological skills is. Based on a literature review, an online questionnaire was designed and applied to 217 students from three public higher education institutions located in the North, Center, and South of Portugal. This intended to verify which areas of technological skills (from the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens) are most developed and to understand respective repercussions. It is concluded that the balanced development of students’ technological skills in higher education is crucial for their personal, social, and professional future and consequently, for their quality of life, with the integration of digital technologies being relevant in the change of the academic work organization, in the relations between learners, teachers, and institutions, and in the new ways of teaching and learning.","Rodrigues, Ana Luísa Cerdeira Luísa de Lourdes Machado-Taylor Maria Alves Helena",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070326,262
175064,Gene Therapies Receive a Shot in the Arm,2021,"During the pandemic, school districts have adopted hybrid schedules to continue the education of the students while maintaining social distance. In a hybrid schedule, students in the same classroom are usually divided into two groups and students only in the same group can physically attend class together two days a week. School districts do not take preferences of the students/parents over the days they would like to come to school into account during this procedure. In this paper, we propose a solution that divides students into groups based on their preferences. Our solution respects the number of classrooms initially reserved for each grade and enables possible efficiency gains by swapping classrooms across grades. Moreover, when there are two alternative schedules provided for students, our solution is immune to preference manipulations.","Afacan, M.

In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model - susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) - is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit.

Pakistan is also experiencing fourth wave of COVID-19 with increasing number of positive cases. In order to understand the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains during fourth wave of pandemic in Pakistan, the current study was designed. The samples from 89 COVID-19 positive patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing using GeneStudio S5. The results showed that 99% (n=88) of isolates belonged to delta variant and only one isolate belonged to alpha variant. Among delta variant cases 26.1% (n=23) isolates were showing B.1.617.2 while 74% of isolates showing AY.4 lineage. Islamabad was found to be the most affected city with 54% (n=48) of cases, followed by Karachi (28%, n=25), and Rawalpindi (10%, n=9). AY.4 has slight difference in mutation profile compared to B.1.617.2. E156del, G142D and V26I mutations in spike and T181I in NSP6 were present in B.1.617.2 but not in AY.4. Interestingly, A446V mutation in NSP4 has been only observed in AY.4.

While several ophthalmology organizations have released guidance on appropriate PPE for surgical procedures and ophthalmology clinics, there is limited experimental evidence demonstrating the efficacy of various interventions that have been suggested. In this study, we evaluate high-risk aspects of the slit-lamp exam and the effect of various PPE interventions. Design: Experimental cough simulation using a fluorescent surrogate of respiratory droplets during an ophthalmic slit lamp examination. Methods: Setting: Single-center Study Population: Patient Simulation Main outcome measure(s): Presence of fluorescent particles in the air near or on slit lamp and simulated slit lamp examiner. Results: Simulated coughing without a mask or slit lamp shield resulted in widespread dispersion of fluorescent droplets during the model slit lamp examination. Coughing with a mask resulted in the most significant decrease in droplets, however, particles still escaped from the top of the mask. Coughing with the slit lamp shield alone blocked most of forward particle dispersion; however significant distributions of respiratory droplets were found on the slit lamp joystick and table. Coughing with both mask and slit lamp shield resulted in the least dispersion to the simulated examiner. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated particle sizes of 3-100m. Conclusions: Masking has the greatest effect in limiting spread of respiratory droplets, while slit lamp shields and gloves also contribute to limiting exposure to droplets from SARS-CoV-2 during slit lamp examination.","Shah, S.

183894,The Role of Family Medicine in Reducing the Risk of Myopia.,2021-04-01,"Purpose This paper aims to provide an estimation of the costs of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with a special focus on Spain. Costs include macroeconomic costs of foregone gross domestic product (GDP) attributable to the pandemic and the direct and indirect costs of prevention, treatment and lost productivity. This study also analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the test-tracking-quarantine (TTQ) strategy in Spain. Design/methodology/approach The macroeconomic costs of foregone GDP attributable to the pandemic are estimated for different countries and areas by comparing the present GDP forecasts for 2020 and 2021 with counterfactuals estimated before the COVID-19 crisis aftermath. The total cost of the COVID-19 for Spain in 2020 was obtained using the cost of illness approach with a bottom-up process. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the TTQ strategy in Spain is based on the estimation of the total costs of TTQ and the health gains and avoided health-care costs associated with the TTQ strategy. A sensitivity analysis explores the consequences of uncertainty in key parameters. Findings The GDP cost of the COVID-19 is by far larger than all the other components of the cost. The global cost of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020-2021 is estimated at 14% of 2019 GDP (around 12,206 mm$). In the specific case of Spain, it amounts to 24% of the 2019 GDP;which is 397.3 m euro. Spain is and will be by far the European country most economically affected by the pandemic. In Spain 2020, the GDP cost accounts for 94.7% of the total cost of the COVID-19 and health-care direct costs are only 2.14%. TTQ is a dominant strategy in Spain. For each euro spent on it, 7 euros will be recovered only in terms of saved health-care resources. Research limitations/implications Given the large degree of uncertainty and the fast-evolving nature of the epidemic, a number of assumptions are required to arrive at the estimates provided in this study. The results were found to be robust to the assumptions applied. Practical implications TTQ is a key strategy for the contention of the epidemy and it is justified from the economic perspective. Originality/value This is the first estimation of the cost of the COVID-19 and the cost-effectiveness of the TTQ strategy for Spain.","Lopez-Valcarcel, B.

185212,2020 National Residency Match Program Results: Where Does Family Medicine Stand and What's Next?,2020-08-15,"In the US there are approximately 4 million individuals with a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome, however, the majority are not aware and cannot benefit from genetically-targeted cancer prevention. Family cancer history (FCH) can identify high risk patients and triage them to genetic assessment, however there is wide variability in accuracy, breadth and strategies for FCH collection. We aim to evaluate whether a web-based tool (WBT) can result in improved quality of FCH versus standard FCH collection via face-to-face interview. All patients scheduled for a gynecologic oncology new patient visit between 9/2019-9/2020 were offered enrollment in an institutional review board-approved prospective trial. Patients were randomized to one of three arms: 1) standard of care FCH collection during the interview, 2) WBT administered at home prior to the visit, 3) WBT administered in the office prior to the visit. The primary endpoint was evaluation of FCH quality based on established quality measures. Chi-square test was used to compare FCH quality between intervention arms and ANOVA test for the number of relatives/generations in the pedigree. A Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparison testing. A total of 100 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 56.2 years (SD 15.2). The WBT was completed successfully by 67% (22) of patients randomized to home administration vs 94% (31) randomized to office administration (P=0.01). Patients cited the following reasons for failure to complete the WBT at home: difficulty with technology, concern about privacy and forgetting about the WBT invitation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, office WBT collection resulted in significantly higher quality FCH vs the control and home arms (Table 1). The WBT resulted in significantly greater mean number of relatives included in the pedigree (Arm 1 - 3.9 [SD 3.0], Arm 2 - 32.4 [SD 16.8], Arm 3 - 29.0 [SD 18.3], P<0.001) and significantly greater number of included generations (2.2 [SD 0.9], 3.9 [SD 0.4], 3.7 [SD 0.6], P<0.001). Patient age, race, ethnicity, and personal/family cancer history were not associated with FCH quality. When excluding patients who could not access the WBT at home, there were no differences in FCH quality when WBT was completed at home vs in the office. A total of 39 patients utilizing the WBT (74%) completed a satisfaction survey following the office visit;38 (97%) reported that the WBT was easy to understand and 30 (77%) reported being satisfied with the tool. [Display omitted] FCH collection is an exciting application of information technology in the current healthcare setting with a growing emphasis on cancer genetics, disease prevention and thoughtful use of WBTs. In our cohort of gynecologic-oncology patients, a WBT resulted in significantly higher quality and more comprehensive family cancer pedigrees. With the COVID-19 pandemic inspired drive to minimize in-office time, future studies must assess strategies to improve patient engagement with WBT at home prior to the visit.

The biodiesel market faced distinct periods, from the initial non-mandatory 2% to the actual 13% mixture in diesel. The legal and regulatory basis of the Biodiesel Program, as well as the tax benefits to poorer regions and family farmers, was also explained. The biodiesel industry increased from almost no biodiesel production in 2005 to more than 4 billion liters at the end of 2017. Soybean oil is the major raw material in Brazilian biodiesel (around 90%), although fats are also important. Other materials, such as sunflower oil, peanut oil, castor oil, palm oil (mainly in North and Northeast regions) and used oil (especially in the Southeast region) showed increased participation. Biodiesel content could reach 15% in 2023. That increase can lead to an expansion in biodiesel demand to 9 billion liters in 2024, which will need soy processing improvement, in order not to take place at the expense of an increase in deforestation and smallholder agriculture. Some recent events, such as the reduction of oil prices and the pandemic of Covid-19 can diminish the rate of that expansion.","Rodrigues, A. C.

186725,Prediction of consensus RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots.,2004,"Avian influenza is a panzootic and recurring human epidemic with pandemic potential. Pandemic requirements for a viral pathogen are: a novel virus must emerge against which the general population has little or no immunity; the new virus must be able to replicate in humans and cause serious illness; and the new virus must be efficiently transmitted from person to person. At present, only the first two conditions have been met. Nonetheless, influenza pandemics are considered inevitable. Expected worldwide human mortality from a moderate pandemic scenario is 45 million people or more than 75% of the current annual global death burden. Although mathematical models have predicted that an emerging pandemic could be contained at its source, this conclusion remains controversial among public health experts. The Terrestrial Animal Health Code and International Health Regulations are enforceable legal instruments integral to pandemic preparedness. Donor support in financial, material and technical assistance remains critical to disease control efforts - particularly in developing countries where avian influenza predominately occurs at present. Personal protective equipment kits, decontamination kits and specimen collection kits in lightweight, portable packages are becoming standardized. Air transport border control measures purporting to delay importation and spread of human avian influenza are scientifically controversial. National pandemic plans prioritize beneficiary access to antiviral drugs and vaccines for some countries. Other medical commodities including ventilators, hospital beds and intensive care units remain less well prioritized in national plans. These resources will play virtually no role in care of the overwhelming majority of patients worldwide in a pandemic. Prehospital care, triage and acute care all require additional professional standardization for the high patient volumes anticipated in a pandemic.","Bradt, David A; Drummond, Christina M",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17083631/,262

188782,"Correlation between MRI, computed tomographic findings and clinical signs in a case of ovine coenurosis.",2000,"In this paper, the authors describe a new method for assessing the impact of emerging infections on global trade flows. When one compares notifications to the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the emergency measures taken to control certain animal and plant diseases with the trade values of certain products from the United Nation's Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade) (identified through the World Customs Organization's harmonised system of tariff product codes [HS]), it is possible to estimate the extent to which trade has been diverted from the affected economies. The authors study in detail the example of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). When member countries of the WTO change their import policies towards the goods of a trading partner, as the result of an emerging disease such as BSE, they must file notifications of such changes through the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee of the WTO. To quantify the impact of BSE on trade, the authors compared these notifications against Comtrade statistics, using the HS 1996 tariff code variable. (The HS 1996 tariff codes allow the tracking and recording of the volumes of exports and imports, in quantity and value, between any two member countries between 1998 and 2000 in the database.) The authors then used this linked dataset to describe the dollar impact of the BSE-related notifications filed in 2000 on the trade flow of imports. The results of this study suggest that economies affected by BSE notifications saw a decline of US$5.6 billion from hypothetical projections in designated products. At the same time, unaffected economies saw an increase of US$1.5 billion from hypothetical projections in the same products. Thus, it may be concluded that import restrictions to control the spread of emergent spongiform encephalopathy infection had a significant effect on trade flows. These results also emphasise the interconnectedness of global trade: trade restrictions for some economies may enhance trade opportunities for others. Further studies using these methods are warranted.","Kimball, A M; Taneda, K",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15861870/,262
189574,Mimic mini-laparoscopic surgery is a simple and secure approach using direct placement of 3-mm trocars without noticeable scars.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses that include human epidemic pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), among others (e.g., COVID-19, the recently emerging coronavirus disease). The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2% (95%CI 5.6-8.7%), with 97.3% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3% (95%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence: 32.6% (95%CI 4.8-60.4%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1% (95%CI0.0-44.6%). DISCUSSION A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.","Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Cardona-Trujillo, María C; García-Barco, Alejandra; Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer; Cortes-Bonilla, Isabella; Bedoya-Arias, Hugo A; Patiño-Cadavid, Leidy Jhoana; Tamayo-Orozco, Juan David; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Zambrano, Lysien I; Dhama, Kuldeep; Sah, Ranjit; Rabaan, Ali A; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532942/,262

189782,The Medicare shared savings program.,2012,"The classical paradigm for T cell dynamics suggests that the resolution of a primary acute virus infection is followed by the generation of a long-lived pool of memory T cells that is thought to be highly stable. Very limited alteration in this repertoire is expected until the immune system is re-challenged by reactivation of latent viruses or by cross-reactive pathogens. Contradicting this view, we show here that the T cell repertoire specific for two different latent herpes viruses in the peripheral blood displayed significant contemporaneous co-fluctuations of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. The coordinated responses to two different viruses suggest that the fluctuations within the T cell repertoire may be driven by sub-clinical viral reactivation or a more generalized 'bystander' effect. The later contention was supported by the observation that, while absolute number of CD3(+) T cells and their subsets and also the cell surface phenotype of antigen-specific T cells remained relatively constant, a loss of CD62L expression in the total CD8(+) T cell population was coincident with the expansion of tetramer-positive virus-specific T cells. This study demonstrates that the dynamic process of T cell expansion and contractions in persistent viral infections is not limited to the acute phase of infection, but also continues during the latent phase of infection.","Crough, Tania; Burrows, Jacqueline M; Fazou, Chrysa; Walker, Susan; Davenport, Miles P; Khanna, Rajiv",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15597326/,262
190612,Cost analysis of bariatric surgery in Denmark made with a decision-analytic model.,2017,"Gamma interferon-deficient (IFN-gamma-/-) mice with a C57BL/6 background were infected intraperitoneally with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (JHMV). In contrast to IFN-gamma-+/- and IFN-gamma+/+ mice, JHMV persisted in IFN-gamma-/- mice and induced death during the subacute phase of the infection. Unexpectedly, infected IFN-gamma-/- mice showed severe peritonitis accompanying the accumulation of a viscous fluid in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in the subacute phase. Destructive changes of hepatocytes were not observed. Administration of recombinant IFN-gamma protracted the survival time of IFN-gamma-/- mice after JHMV infection. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma plays a critical role in viral clearance in JHMV infection. They also show that a resultant persistent JHMV infection induces another form of disease in IFN-gamma-/- mice, which bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis in cats.","Kyuwa, S; Tagawa, Y; Shibata, S; Doi, K; Machii, K; Iwakura, Y",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9765476/,262

There are many pathways to infection spread, and among the most significant from the epidemiological point of view is airborne transport. Microorganisms can become airborne when droplets are generated during speech, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or atomization of feces during sewage removal. The fate of the droplets is governed by the physical principles of transport, with droplet size being the most important factor affecting their dispersion, deposition on surfaces and determining the survival of microorganisms within the droplets. In addition, physical characteristics of the indoor environment as well as the design and operation of building ventilation systems are of critical importance. Do we understand the mechanisms of infection spread and can we quantify the droplet dynamics under various indoor conditions? Unfortunately no, as this aspect of infection spread has attracted surprisingly little scientific interest. However, investigations of numerous cases in which a large number of people were infected show how critical the physics of microorganism spread can be. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of droplet spread and solutions available to minimize the spread and prevent infections. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Every day tens of millions of people worldwide suffer from viral infections of different severity at immense economic cost. There is, however, only minimal understanding of the dynamics of virus-laden aerosols, and so the ability to control and prevent virus spread is severely reduced, as was clearly demonstrated during the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. This paper proposes the direction to significantly advance fundamental and applied knowledge of the pathways of viral infection spread in indoor atmospheric systems, through a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach and application of state-of-the-art scientific methods. Knowledge gained will have the potential to bring unprecedented economical gains worldwide by minimizing/reducing the spread of disease.","Morawska, L",Indoor air,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16948710/,262
196600,Predictors of failure of the laparoscopic approach for the management of small bowel obstruction.,2010,"The value of community development (CD) practices is well documented in the health promotion literature; it is a foundational strategy outlined in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Despite the importance of collaborative action with communities to enhance individual and community health and well-being, there exists a major gap between the evidence for CD and the actual extent to which CD is carried out by health organizations. In this paper it is argued that the gap exists because we have failed to turn the evaluative gaze inward-to examine the capacity of health organizations themselves to facilitate CD processes. This study was designed to explicate key elements that contribute to organizational capacity for community development (OC-CD). Twenty-two front-line CD workers and managers responsible for CD initiatives from five regional health authorities in Alberta, Canada, were interviewed. Based on the study findings, a multidimensional model for conceptualizing OC-CD is presented. Central to the model are four inter-related dimensions: (i) organizational commitment to CD, rooted in particular values and beliefs, leadership and shared understanding of CD; (ii) supportive structures and systems, such as job design, flexible planning processes, evaluation mechanisms and collaborative processes; (iii) allocation of resources for CD; and (iv) working relationships and processes that model CD within the health organization. These four dimensions contribute to successful CD practice in numerous ways, but perhaps most importantly by supporting the empowerment and autonomy of the pivotal organizational player in health promotion practice: the front-line worker.","Germann, Kathy; Wilson, Doug",Health promotion international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15306613/,262

Anti-microbial peptides and proteins, cytokines and chemokines are important immune weapons as they build up the protective front for the respiratory tract. The notion that susceptibility to infectious diseases may be inherited is widely accepted and, as it is the failure to activate adaptive immunity that may allow infection to become established and progress toward invasion and dissemination, the recognition of specific gene defects affecting the ability of the immune system to overcome invading pathogens may shed light upon those mechanisms of immune regulation that are playing the most critical roles. The aim of the present review is to discuss some of the advances in infection immunogenetics that may lead to identify new strategies in the development of new anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory drugs.","Bocchino, Marialuisa; Marruchella, Almerico; Saltini, Cesare",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16210881/,262

The aim of this article was to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Internal Medicine ward, as divided into those with and without pneumonia. This single-center prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary teaching public hospital in Buenos Aires City named Hospital General de Agudos Carlos G. Durand. Baseline data collection was performed within 48 hours of admission and patients were followed until discharge or in-hospital death. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics together with treatment data were obtained from the medical records. Of the 417 included, 243 (58.3%) had pneumonia. Median age was 43 years (IQR:32-57) and 222 (53.2%) were female. The overall crude case-fatality rate was 3.8%. None of the COVID-19 patients without pneumonia developed critical disease, required invasive mechanical ventilation nor died during hospitalization. However, 7 (4%) developed severe disease during follow-up. Among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in-hospital mortality rate was 6.6%, severe disease developed in 81 (33.3%), critical disease in 23 (9.5%), and 22 (9.1%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. A largely good prognosis was observed among COVID-19 patients without pneumonia, still, even among this group, unfavorable clinical progression can develop and should be properly monitored. Critical illness among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was frequent and observed rates from this cohort provide a sound characterization of COVID-19 clinical features in a major city from South America.","Melendi, Santiago E; Pérez, María M; Salas, Cintia E; Haedo, Mariana F; Xavier, Franco B; Saltos Navarrete, Jandry D; Aguirre, Camila; Baleta, María L; Balsano, Facundo J; Caldano, Mariano G; Colignon, María G; de Oliveira Brasil, Thayana; de Wolodimeroff, Nicolás; Déramo Aquino, Andrea I; Fernández de Córdova, Ana G; Fontan, María B; Galvagno, Florencia I; Iturrieta Araya, Noelia S; Mollinedo Cruz, Volga S; Olivero, Agustín; Pestalardo, Ignacio; Ricciardi, María; Vera Rueda, María L; Villaverde, María C; Lauko Mauri, Marcela; Ujeda, Carlos; Leis, Rocío",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481734/,262

We have cloned and expressed the nsp14 protein in Escherichia coli, and characterized the nature and the role(s) of the metal ions in the reaction chemistry. The purified recombinant nsp14 protein digested a 5'-labeled RNA molecule, but failed to digest the RNA substrate that is modified with fluorescein group at the 3'-hydroxyl group, suggesting a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity. The exoribonuclease activity requires Mg2+ as a cofactor. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis indicated a two-metal binding mode for divalent cations by nsp14. Endogenous tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra measurements showed that there was a structural change of nsp14 when binding with metal ions. We propose that the conformational change induced by metal ions may be a prerequisite for catalytic activity by correctly positioning the side chains of the residues located in the active site of the enzyme.","Chen, Ping; Jiang, Miao; Hu, Tao; Liu, Qingzhen; Chen, Xiaojiang S; Guo, Deyin",Journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17927896/,262
200441,A Strategy for Tumor Targeting by Higher-Order Glycan Pattern Recognition: Synthesis and In Vitro and In Vivo Properties of Glycoalbumins Conjugated with Four Different N-Glycan Molecules,2020,"OBJECTS Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is an ideal approach for gynecologic surgery and yields better cosmetic results. However, a standard umbilical approach with LESS is not appropriate for gynecologic surgery requiring intra-abdominal suturing and dissection requiring traction. Therefore, we have developed a new multitrocar access system for gynecologic LESS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gynecologic LESS using this access system. METHODS This access system consists of one 12-mm trocar, two 5-mm trocars, and a 5-mm flexible laparoscope. Two 5-mm trocars with small port heads were inserted cross-wise on opposite sides of the sleeve of the centrally positioned 12-mm trocar to maintain triangulation. Thirty-eight patients with various gynecologic conditions underwent LESS with this access system. The results of these surgeries were retrospectively compared to those of conventional laparoscopic procedures. RESULTS Of the 38 LESS procedures performed with this access system, none was up-converted, converted to an open laparotomy, or required blood transfusion. The Salpingo-oophorectomy with LESS had several benefits, such as no extension of the skin incision of the trocar site and no leakage of the contents of the ovarian cyst into the peritoneal cavity, over that with conventional laparoscopy. A comparison of LESS (11 patients) and conventional laparoscopy (16 patients) for total hysterectomy showed no significant difference in total blood loss (234.0 mL vs. 221.6 mL) or the weight of the resected uterus (276.0 g vs. 285.0 g), although the mean total operative time was greater with LESS (199.0 min vs. 168.5 min). CONCLUSION Our multitrocar access system is safe and secure, and can be adapted for various gynecologic surgeries involving complicated procedures. LESS with this access system achieves results comparable to those of conventional laparoscopy with 4 ports, although the operative time is longer.","Ichikawa, Masao; Akira, Shigeo; Mine, Katuya; Ohuchi, Nozomi; Iwasaki, Nao; Kurose, Keisuke; Takeshita, Toshiyuki",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21869557/,262

In the present study, the interaction of remdesivir and its nucleoside analog GS-441524 with OATP4C1 was evaluated to provide the detailed information about its renal handling. METHODS: We used HK-2 cells, a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal kidney, to confirm the transport of remdesivir and GS-441524. To assess the involvement of OATP4C1 in handling remdesivir and GS-441524, the uptake study of remdesivir and GS-441524 was performed by using OATP4C1-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells. Moreover, we also evaluated the IC50 and Ki value of remdesivir. RESULTS: The time-dependent remdesivir uptake in HK-2 cells was observed. The results of inhibition study using OATs and OCT2 inhibitors and OATP4C1 knockdown suggested the involvement of renal drug transporter OATP4C1. Remdesivir was taken up by OATP4C1/MDCKII cells. OATP4C1-mediated uptake of remdesivir increased linearly up to 10 min and reached a steady state at 30 min.

The rapid spreading of the virus effected, among other things, restriction on the freedom of movement. The EU member states introduced national response measures to contain the pandemic and protect public health. While broadly similar, the measures differ with regard to strictness and the manner of introduction, reflecting the political legitimacy of the respective country. With the 'Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak' - its first COVID-19-related Communication - the European Commission (EC) attempted to curb differing practices of the EU member states and ensure a coordinated approach. Ultimately, this action was aimed at upholding of fundamental rights as guaranteed to EU citizens, one such being the freedom of movement. Thus, from the very start of the pandemic, the coordinated actions of EU institutions sought to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections with the support and cooperation of EU member states. This is confirmed by the most recent Council of the EU (Council) recommendation on a coordinated approach to restrictions to freedom of movement within the EU of October 2020. While they did prevent the spread of infection and save countless lives, the movement restriction measures and the resulting uncertainty have greatly affected the people, the society, and the economy, thereby demonstrating that they cannot remain in force for an extended period. This paper examines the measures introduced by EU member states and analyses the legal basis for introducing therewith limitations on human rights and market freedoms. To what extent are the EU and member states authorized to introduce restrictions on the freedom of movement in the interest of public health? Have the EU and member states breached their obligations regarding market freedoms and fundamental rights under the Treaty? And most importantly: have they endangered the fundamental rights of the citizens of the EU?","Duic, D.; Sudar, V.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,,262

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00-3.00) and 8.00 (11.00-5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30-49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs. Our findings call for urgent psychological interventions for vulnerable groups of Pakistani HCWs.","Hayat, Khezar; Arshed, Muhammad; Fiaz, Iqra; Afreen, Urooj; Khan, Faiz Ullah; Khan, Tahir Abbas; Kadirhaz, Muhtar; Shukar, Sundus; Saeed, Azwa; Gill, Muhammad Rouf; Fang, Yu",Front Public Health,,262

237193,Response,2020,"A substantial body of prior research documents a gender gap in negotiation performance. Competing accounts suggest that the gap is due either to women's stereotype-congruent behavior in negotiations or to backlash enacted toward women for stereotype-incongruent behavior. In this article, we use a novel data set of over 2,500 individual negotiators to examine how negotiation performance varies as a function of gender and the strength of one's alternative to a negotiated agreement. We find that the gender gap in negotiation outcomes exists only when female negotiators have a strong outside option. Furthermore, our large data set allows us to examine an understudied performance outcome, rate of impasse. We find that negotiations in which at least one negotiator is a woman with a strong alternative disproportionately end in impasse, a performance outcome that leaves considerable potential value unallocated. In addition, we find that these gender differences in negotiation performance are not due to gender differences in aspirations, reservation values, or first offers. Overall, these findings are consistent with a backlash account, whereby counterparts are less likely to come to an agreement and therefore reach a potentially worse outcome when one party is a female negotiator empowered by a strong alternative.

We sought to understand what etiologic agents could explain the upper/lower respiratory tract infection-like (URTI/LRTI-like) symptoms exhibited by 88% of the 324 HCWs tested. Among the patients who had URTI/LRTI-like symptoms, only seven (2%) were positive for COVID-19, while 38 (13%) of the symptomatic participants were identified positive for another viral etiologic agent. Rhinovirus was the most common infection, with 21 (9%) of the symptomatic participants positive for rhinovirus.

246154,Welcome to volume 13 of Bioanalysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Headache is a frequent complaint in COVID-19 patients. However, no detailed information on headache characteristics is provided in these reports. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of headache and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the cases of isolated intracranial hypertension. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we selected COVID-19 patients who underwent lumbar puncture due to neurological complaints from April to May 2020. We reviewed clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of patients with refractory headache in the absence of other encephalitic or meningitic features. CSF opening pressures higher than 250 mmH2O were considered elevated, and from 200 to 250 mmH2O equivocal. RESULTS: Fifty-six COVID-19 patients underwent lumbar puncture for different neurological conditions. A new, persistent headache that prompted a CSF analysis was diagnosed in 13 (23.2%). The pain was throbbing, holocranial or bilateral in the majority of patients. All patients had normal CSF analysis and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all samples. Opening pressure >200 mmH2O was present in 11 patients and, in six of these, > 250 mmH2O. 6/13 patients had complete improvement of the pain, five had partial improvement, and two were left with a daily persistent headache. CONCLUSIONS: In a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients, headache was associated to intracranial hypertension in the absence of meningitic or encephalitic features. Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 could be an explanation, but further studies including post-mortem analysis of areas of production and CSF absorption (choroid plexuses and arachnoid granulations) are necessary to clarify this issue.","Silva, Marcus Tulius T; Lima, Marco A; Torezani, Guilherme; Soares, Cristiane N; Dantas, Claudia; Brandão, Carlos Otávio; Espíndola, Otávio; Siqueira, Marilda M; Araujo, Abelardo Qc",Cephalalgia,,262

247046,Modeling the Inactivation of Viruses from the Coronaviridae Family in Response to Temperature and Relative Humidity in Suspensions or on Surfaces,2020,"The widespread COVID-19 pandemic has been, currently, converted to a catastrophic human health challenge. Vitamin D (VD) and its metabolites have been used as a palliative treatment for chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases from ancient times. In the current study, some molecular aspects of the potential effects of VD against COVID-19 side-effects have been discussed. An arguable role in autophagy or apoptosis control has been suggested for VD through calcium signaling at the mitochondrial and ER levels. 1,25(OH)2D3 is also an immunomodulator that affects the development of B-cells, T-cells, and NK cells in both innate and acquired immunity. The production of some anti-microbial molecules such as defensins and cathelicidins is also stimulated by VD. The overexpression of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and down-regulation of NADPH oxidase are induced by VD to reduce the oxidative stress. Moreover, the multi-organ failure due to a cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 in COVID-19 may be prevented by the immunomodulatory effects of VD. It can also downregulate the renin-angiotensin system which has a protective role against cardiovascular complications induced by COVID-19. Given the many experimental and molecular evidences due to the potential protective effects of VD on the prevention of the COVID-19-induced morbidities, a VD supplementation is suggested to prevent the lethal side-effects of the infection. It is particularly recommended in VD-deficient patients or those at greater risk of serious or critical effects of COVID-19, including the elderly, and patients with pre-existing chronic diseases, especially those in nursing homes, care facilities, and hospitals.","Shiravi, Amir-Abbas; Saadatkish, Milad; Abdollahi, Zeinab; Miar, Paniz; Khanahmad, Hossein; Zeinalian, Mehrdad",Int J Vitam Nutr Res,,262

The clinical features and subsequent medical treatment, combined with the impact of a global pandemic, require specific nutritional therapy in hospitalised adults. This document aims to provide Australian and New Zealand clinicians with guidance on managing critically and acutely unwell adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have preexisting comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and affect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower-nutritional-risk patients and individualised care for high-nutritional-risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided owing to potential aerosol exposure and therefore infection risk to healthcare providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly after intensive care unit stay, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including upskilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations, and optimise food service management. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to manage the aforementioned aspects when providing nutrition support to patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Chapple, Lee-Anne S; Fetterplace, Kate; Asrani, Varsha; Burrell, Aidan; Cheng, Allen C; Collins, Peter; Doola, Ra039; eesa,; Ferrie, Suzie; Marshall, Andrea P; Ridley, Emma J",Nutr Diet,,262

METHODS: Women with a second-trimester fetus with OSB were offered intrauterine neurosurgical repair following the protocol from the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial. Pediatric follow-up with infants reaching 12 and 30 months of life was also reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight fetuses with OSB underwent intrauterine repair at an average (±SD) gestational age of 24.8 ± 0.9 weeks. There were 3 (5.1%) intrauterine deaths. The average gestational age at delivery of the remaining 55 cases was 33.3 ± 3.6 weeks, and the average birth weight was 2,172 ± 751 g. Delivery before 30 weeks occurred in 11 cases (20.0%). Two (3.6%) neonatal deaths (<28 days) occurred. At 12 months, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was required in 25% of the cases. At 30 months, 72.4% of the infants were able to walk. DISCUSSION: Prenatal neurosurgical repair of OSB is a complex and challenging intervention. Major complications include perinatal death and severe prematurity. No major maternal complications occurred in our series. A reduction in the need for cerebrospinal fluid diversion and an improved ability to walk seem to be the greatest long-term advantages of this procedure.","Sepulveda, Waldo; Corral, Edgardo; Alcalde, Juan L; Otayza, Felipe; Müller, Jose M; Ravera, Franco; Devoto, Juan C; Tapia, Mirta",Fetal Diagn Ther,,262

Similar to the course of the disease in non pregnant adults, 80% to 90% of infections were not severe.The prevalence of reported symptoms was four-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (57%) than in those negative (13%) (P < .001), suggesting that direct self-testing should open doors to confirmatory testing for COVID-19. Our findings support the need for COVID-19 screening in early pregnancy in epidemic areas to plan materno-fetal health surveillance programs.","Cosma, Stefano; Borella, Fulvio; Carosso, Andrea; Sciarrone, Andrea; Cusato, Jessica; Corcione, Silvia; Mengozzi, Giulio; Preti, Mario; Katsaros, Dionyssios; Di Perri, Giovanni; Benedetto, Chiara",J. med. virol,,262
252246,Reply,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To study risk in white-coat hypertension (WCH) by measurement of coronary artery calcium score (CACS), carotid--femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and carotid plaques. METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based cohort with randomized selection of participants from Linköping, Sweden. An Omron m10-IT oscillometric device was used for clinic and home blood pressures (HBP) in the morning and evening for 1 week. RESULTS: We recruited 5029 middle-aged and mainly defined WCH as SBP at least 140âmmHg and/or DBP at least 90âmmHg with HBP less than 135/85âmmHg. There were 2680 normotensive participants and 648 had WCH after exclusion of treated participants. More women (59.5%) than men (42.8%, Pâ<â0.001) had WCH. We found higher prevalence of CACS greater than 100 compared with less than 100 (12.4 vs. 7.2%, Pâ<â0.001), PWV (11.5â±â1.5 vs. 10.4â±â1.3âm/s, Pâ<â0.001) and a higher prevalence of one or more carotid plaques (59.5 vs. 48%, Pâ<â0.001) in participants with WCH than in normotension. Participants with WCH also had more dyslipidemia and higher glucose levels. Normotensive women scored lower on nervousness than women with WCH (Pâ=â0.022). After matching of 639 participants with WCH to normotensive participants according to age, gender and systolic HBP the prevalence of a high CACS (12.1 vs. 8.6%, Pâ=â0.003,) PWV (11.0â±â0.068 vs. 11.5â±â0.068âm/s, estimated marginal meansâ±âSE, Pâ<â0.001 by ANOVA) but not more carotid plaques (59.5 vs. 55.6%, Pâ=â0.23), remained in the participants with WCH compared with the matched normotensive participants. CONCLUSION: WCH is particularly common in middle-aged women, and it displays metabolic dysfunction and increased prevalence of arteriosclerotic manifestations in both genders. As markers of increased cardiovascular risk were present also after matching normotensive and WCH participants according to systolic HBP, age and gender, the presence of WCH signals an increased cardiovascular risk burden that is not fully explained by elevated BP levels at home.","Johansson, Martina A K; Östgren, Carl Johan; Engvall, Jan; Swahn, Eva; Wijkman, Magnus; Nystrom, Fredrik H",J. hypertens,,262
252500,Duality between Coronavirus Transmission and Air-based Macroscopic Molecular Communication,2021,"The severe respiratory insufficiency observed during COVID-19 infection may not be directly related to a cytopathogenic effect induced by the virus itself, but to an exaggerated and inappropriate immune response. In an effort to reduce the severity of organ dysfunction, including respiratory insufficiency, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that block the interleukin-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab, are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. However, blocking of just one of the many cytokines involved in the inflammatory reaction may not slow down the magnitude of the process. Since timing is important, the immune deficiency induced by IL6 blockade at the late immunodeficiency phase of sepsis that follows the initial inflammatory response may be detrimental. Finally, monitoring the degree and duration of IL6 blockade may be challenging because of the long half-life of Mabs (2-3 weeks). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines act through a common JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can be inhibited by JAK-STAT inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for JAK1, 2, blocks many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL6. Ruxolitinib has favorable pharmacodynamics and an acceptable safety profile. The short half-life (4-6 h) of the drug offers the opportunity for ideal monitoring of the degree and duration of cytokine blocking, simply by the adjusting dose and duration of therapy. From a theoretical point of view, the balanced control of cytokine blockade throughout the course of the septic process should be the cornerstone of modern management. According to this hypothesis, maximization of blocking should be attempted at the phase of hyper-inflammation for preventing severe organ damage, while pro-inflammatory blockade should be minimized at the late phase of immunoparalysis for prevention of secondary infections. Based on the above considerations, we consider that the efficacy and safety of this drug deserves testing in the context of a controlled randomized trial.","Meletiadis, Joseph; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Tsirigotis, Panagiotis",Infect Dis Ther,,262
252501,Duality between Coronavirus Transmission and Air-based Macroscopic Molecular Communication,2021,"STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in spine surgeons in Latin America. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to Latin American spine surgeons from April 4 to 6, 2020. Surgeon characteristics were recorded. The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined. All variables were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons. The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12). Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156). Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111). The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario). Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis). Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America. The long-term psychological impact should be taken into consideration to avoid a heavier burden for health care providers.","Guiroy, Alfredo; Gagliardi, Martín; Coombes, Nicolas; Landriel, Federico; Zanardi, Carlos; Camino Willhuber, Gastón; Guyot, Juan Pablo; Valacco, Marcelo",Global Spine J,,262

259989,Reply,2021,"Wild potatoes, as dynamic resource adapted to various environmental conditions, represent a powerful and informative reservoir of genes useful for breeding efforts. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are encoded by one of the largest families in plants and are involved in several biological processes such as growth and development, signal transduction, and plant defence against stress. In this study, 79 and 84 genes encoding putative WRKY TFs have been identified in two wild potato relatives, Solanum commersonii and S. chacoense. Phylogenetic analysis of WRKY proteins divided ScWRKYs and SchWRKYs into three Groups and seven subGroups. Structural and phylogenetic comparative analyses suggested an interspecific variability of WRKYs. Analysis of gene expression profiles in different tissues and under various stresses allowed to select ScWRKY045 as a good candidate in wounding-response, ScWRKY055 as a bacterial infection triggered WRKY and ScWRKY023 as a multiple stress-responsive WRKY gene. Those WRKYs were further studied through interactome analysis allowing the identification of potential co-expression relationships between ScWRKYs/SchWRKYs and genes of various pathways. Overall, this study enabled the discrimination of WRKY genes that could be considered as potential candidates in both breeding programs and functional studies.","Villano, Clizia; Esposito, Salvatore; D039,; Amelia, Vincenzo; Garramone, Raffaele; Alioto, Daniela; Zoina, Astolfo; Aversano, Riccardo; Carputo, Domenico",Sci Rep,,262

METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study in Fars province, Iran, from 22 August to 4 October 2020. People with a past history of chemical war injury and COVID-19 were studied. Two age- and sex-matched control groups, double the size of the patient group each, from the same database of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at the same time [i.e., healthy controls and pseudocontrols]. RESULTS: 46 people with a past history of chemical war injury, 92 healthy controls, and 92 pseudocontrols were studied. People with COVID-19 and a past history of chemical war injury had a significantly higher rate of chest pain compared to others. There were no other clinical differences between the groups. Mortality rate was 17.39%, 15.21%, and 27.17% in people with a past history of chemical war injury, the control group, and the pseudocontrol group, respectively.

275923,What's your risk of catching COVID? These tools help you to find out,2021,"BACKGROUND: The fear of contagion during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have potentially refrained patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from accessing the emergency system, with subsequent impact on mortality. OBJECTIVES: The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry aims to estimate the true impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment and outcome of patients with STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), with identification of ""at-risk"" patient cohorts for failure to present or delays to treatment. METHODS: This retrospective registry was performed in European high-volume PPCI centers and assessed patients with STEMI treated with PPPCI in March/April 2019 and 2020. Main outcomes are the incidences of PPCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6,609 patients underwent PPCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. In 2020, during the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in PPCI as compared with 2019 (incidence rate ratio: 0.811; 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 0.84; p < 0.0001). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19. A significant interaction was observed for patients with arterial hypertension, who were less frequently admitted in 2020 than in 2019. Furthermore, the pandemic was associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times, which may have contributed to the higher mortality during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a 19% reduction in PPCI procedures, especially among patients suffering from hypertension, and a longer delay to treatment, which may have contributed to the increased mortality during the pandemic.

276033,Coronavirus shuts down trials of drugs for multiple other diseases,2020,"In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Shoukat, Affan; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Wells, Chad R; Sah, Pratha; Pandey, Abhishek; Sachs, Jeffrey D; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,262

278293,Coronavirus vaccines leap through safety trials - but which will work is anybody's guess,2020,"PURPOSE: Mitochondrial unfolding protein are abundant in breast cancer cells, but the mechanism by which breast cancer cells resist apoptosis is still not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-related proteins in four types of breast cancer tissues. METHODS: Mitochondrial fractions were taken from four breast cancer tissues (luminal A, luminal B, Her2 -overexpression, and TNBC) and the expression of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins was observed by western blot and ELISA. In addition, the expression of hsp10, hsp60, and clpp in mitochondria was observed by western blot in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, and confirmed by ELISA. The expression levels of hsp10 and hsp60 were correlated with clinicopathological parameters in 114 breast cancer patients. RESULTS: We found an increase in the performance of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins in breast cancer tissues of luminal A, luminal B, Her2-overexpression, and TNBC. The mitochondrial hsp10, hsp60, and clpp are abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues rather than adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression levels of mitochondrial hsp10 and hsp60 were highest in histological grade 3 breast cancer tissues. Additionally, mitochondria with high hsp60 expression were more present in Her2-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that mtUPR was specifically activated in breast cancer tissues but inactivated in normal mammary tissue. MtUPR had also exhibited a particular increase in Her2-overexpression tumors but not in ER- or PR-positive tumors. Taken together, we suggested that mtUPR may act as a potential candidate for developing novel Her2-overexpression breast cancer therapy.","Chen, Fang-Ming; Huang, Li-Ju; Ou-Yang, Fu; Kan, Jung-Yu; Kao, Li-Chun; Hou, Ming-Feng",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,262

On admission, her nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19. As her respiratory distress worsened, she was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Since the patient was unable to maintain saturation even on high settings of mechanical ventilation, she underwent venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) and was monitored in surgical ICU by a multidisciplinary team. The obstetrical team was on standby to perform urgent delivery if needed. Her condition improved, and she was weaned off after 5 days on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. She was observed in the antenatal ward for another week and discharged home with the mother and fetus in good condition. VV-ECMO can be considered as rescue therapy for pregnant women with refractory hypoxaemia of severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19. It can save two lives, the mother and fetus.","Tambawala, Zenab Yusuf; Hakim, Zeinabsadat Tabatabaei; Hamza, Lama Khalid; Al Rayes, Maryam",BMJ case reports,,262

Objective: To describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of recipients of HT with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series from a single large academic heart transplant program in New York, New York, incorporates data from between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. All recipients of HT followed up by this center who were infected with COVID-19 were included. Interventions: Heart transplant and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up. Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19. Results: Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years. Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%). Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation. Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL). Among patients managed at the study institution, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 16 patients (70%), and 6 (26%) had a reduction in the dose of their calcineurin inhibitor. Treatment of COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (18 patients [78%]), high-dose corticosteroids (8 patients [47%]), and interleukin 6 receptor antagonists (6 patients [26%]). Overall, 7 patients (25%) died. Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT. Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients. Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.","Latif, Farhana; Farr, Maryjane A; Clerkin, Kevin J; Habal, Marlena V; Takeda, Koji; Naka, Yoshifumi; Restaino, Susan; Sayer, Gabriel; Uriel, Nir",JAMA cardiol.

282907,Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs,2020,"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to explore the clinical value of noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of lung lesions of Coronavirus Disease-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0â%, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0â%, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappaâ=â0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8â% (11/16), 77.8â% (7/9), 100.0â% (2/2), specificity of 85.7â% (12/14), 76.2â% (16/21), 92.9â% (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7â% (23/30), 76.7â% (23/30), 93.3â% (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION: Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","Lu, Wuzhu; Zhang, Shushan; Chen, Binghui; Chen, Jiaxin; Xian, Jianzhong; Lin, Yuhong; Shan, Hong; Su, Zhong Zhen",Ultraschall Med,,262

291241,An overview of functional nanoparticles as novel emerging antiviral therapeutic agents,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the intersection of the Sustainable Development Goals, humanitarian assistance and health, the umbrella term 'health in the last mile' has gained traction. In August 2019, the Norwegian Red Cross commissioned a global report to conceptualise and assess what 'health in the last mile' refers to, in terms of access, needs and structural and geographical barriers and vulnerabilities, and describe how these vulnerabilities overlap in different humanitarian settings and regions. AIMS: The purpose of this commentary article is to highlight the report's most important findings for an academic audience, from the perspective of the Norwegian Red Cross. DISCUSSION: The aim of the report was to propose a definition and create a methodology to help identify people and populations living in the last mile of healthcare; acknowledging that these go far beyond those affected by armed conflicts and sudden onset disasters. As the report reveals, last-mile populations are not adequately reached by current universal health coverage strategies. The report highlights the key role played by local humanitarian actors in reducing barriers to access to healthcare. Local stakeholders have first-hand knowledge of the needs of populations in the last mile and on how they navigate the barriers to healthcare access. The report also addresses questions such as: Who are the people with least access to healthcare? What are their health needs and what barriers do they face? Not least, when many live without access to healthcare services, how do we determine where the last mile begins? The report proposes a definition of 'the last mile' involving converging factors that exacerbate barriers to healthcare and identifies 18 groups that are considered potential last-mile populations. Global epidemics, such as the latest COVID-19, have shown that the concept of vulnerability is continually changing. These situations can bring new vulnerable populations to the edge of the last mile which were already vulnerable and ignored before the outset of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Millions of people do not and will not benefit from the global progress in universal health coverage under current health systems. To reach the Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 16, we need solutions to overcome the barriers they face to access basic healthcare.","Tønnessen-Krokan, Morten; Bringedal Houge, Anette",Scand J Public Health,,262

292499,Antibody tests suggest that coronavirus infections vastly exceed official counts,2020,"The intestinal microbiota is thought to be an important biological barrier against enteric pathogens. Its depletion, however, also has curative effects against some viral infections, suggesting that different components of the intestinal microbiota can play both promoting and inhibitory roles depending on the type of viral infection. The two primary mechanisms by which the microbiota facilitates or inhibits viral invasion involve participation in the innate and adaptive immune responses and direct or indirect interaction with the virus, during which the abundance and composition of the intestinal microbiota might be changed by the virus. Oral administration of probiotics, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics are major therapeutic strategies for regulating intestinal microbiota balance. However, these three methods have shown limited curative effects in clinical trials. Therefore, the intestinal microbiota might represent a new and promising supplementary antiviral therapeutic target, and more efficient and safer methods for regulating the microbiota require deeper investigation. This review summarizes the latest research on the relationship among the intestinal microbiota, anti-viral immunity and viruses and the most commonly used methods for regulating the intestinal microbiota with the goal of providing new insight into the antiviral effects of the gut microbiota.","Yang, Mengling; Yang, Yang; He, Qingnan; Zhu, Ping; Liu, Mengqi; Xu, Jiahao; Zhao, Mingyi",Front Immunol,,262

Anxiety has been shown to impact test scores, yet no anxiety measure currently exists specific to older adult neuropsychological assessment. This study piloted and validated the Feelings About Neuropsychological Testing measure (FANT), a measure of neuropsychological assessment anxiety developed to measure the cognitive, affective, and physiological aspects of test and state anxiety. The measure was validated on 105 community based older adults aged 55 and older. All participants were administered the FANT, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- seven item (GAD-7), Test Anxiety Inventory- Short Form (TAI-SF), Patient Health Questionnaire- nine item (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Dementia Worry Scale (DWS), and PROMIS Cognitive Function Short Form- 6a (CFSF).

According to the patients’ test outcomes of nucleic acid and specific IgM and IgG antibodies, the patients were grouped. Methods: Medical records of 788 COVID-19 patients were collected for retrospective analysis, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, CT outcome and laboratory indicators. According to the patients’ nucleic acid detection and the results of specific IgM and IgG antibodies, the patients were grouped, and the clinical application value of COVID-19 nucleic acid detection and specific IgM and IgG antibodies was analyzed. Results: The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients included in this study were fever (431 cases, 54.7%), cough (404 cases, 51.3%), and fatigue (232 cases, 29.4%), and the main comorbidities were hypertension (201 Cases, 25.4%), diabetes (86 cases, 10.9%), coronary heart disease (39 cases, 4.9%), etc. CT abnormalities mainly manifested as ground glass shadows (731 cases, 92.8%), mesh nodules shadows (413 cases, 52.4%), pulmonary fibrosis (118 cases, 15.0%), etc. The majority of patients were positive for IgM and IgG antibodies. There were 50 patients in the qPCR+IgM-IgG- group (only nucleic acid test result was positive), of which 6 patients (12%) were mild in symptoms, and 39 patients (78%) had mild CT findings. There were 321 patients in the qPCR+IgM+IgG+ group (nucleic acid and specific IgM and IgG antibody test results were positive), of which 49 patients (15.5%) were severe or critically ill, and 78 patients (24.8%) had severe CT findings. There were 291 patients in the qPCR-IgM+IgG+ group (specific IgM and IgG antibody test results were positive), of which 22 (7.5%) were severe or critically ill, and 94 (32.3%) patients had severe CT findings. The sensitivity of antibody detection for COVID-19 was higher than that of qPCR (84.9%, 86.4% vs. 53.9%, P&lt;0.001). There were significant differences between IgM+ patients and IgM- patients in terms of age distribution, gender, sore throat, clinical classification, and CT findings (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: IgM antibody has a high clinical detection rate, which effectively avoids the missed detection of qPCR and increases the detection rate of COVID-19 patients. There are more severe and critically ill patients with IgM tested positive, which finding has certain guiding significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

This variability may be due to uncontrolled caffeine consumption and circadian rhythms. Therefore, here we studied if caffeine consumption, systemically available caffeine measured in saliva, and daytime have effects on the excitability and plasticity of the motor cortex. Since both, time of the day and caffeine may mediate their effects via cortisol, we also quantified corticosteroids in saliva. Experiment 1 was performed in caffeine-naïve participants (n = 30) and compared the effects of PAS or tACS with different stimulation intensities on the motor cortex with or without caffeine 200 mg administered in a double-blind fashion. Experiment 2 was performed in regular caffeine consumers (n = 30) and compared the influence of time of day on the effects of tACS (true or sham) on the motor cortex also with or without caffeine administered in a double-blind fashion. Caffeine increased the saliva corticosteroid concentrations in both experimental groups, and corticosteroid concentrations were higher in the morning in caffeine consumers. Gender also affected corticosteroid concentrations. There was a positive correlation between caffeine concentrations and baseline cortical excitability in caffeine-adapted participants, and a negative correlation between poststimulation caffeine concentrations and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes after sham stimulation in caffeine-naïve subjects. No correlations were found between poststimulation caffeine or corticosteroid concentrations, and plasticity aftereffects. PAS and tACS did not elicit changes in the corticosteroid concentrations. We conclude that moderate caffeine consumption alters cortical excitability but not plasticity aftereffects.

The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two days at the early stage.","Peng, Liangrong; Yang, Wuyue; Zhang, Dongyan; Zhuge, Changjing; Hong, Liu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06563v1.pdf,262

299480,Hippocrates would be on Twitter,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine changes and factors associated with child malnutrition, obesity in women and household food insecurity before and after the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A prospective follow-up study. SETTING: In 2019, the baseline Urban Health and Nutrition Study 2019 (UHNS-2019) was conducted in 603 households, which were selected randomly from 30 clusters to represent underserved urban settlements in Colombo. In the present study, 35 % of households from the UHNS-2019 cohort were randomly selected for repeat interviews, 1 year after the baseline study and 6 months after COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Height/length and weight of children and women were re-measured, household food insecurity was reassessed, and associated factors were gathered through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Differences in measurements at baseline and follow-up studies were compared. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 207 households, comprising 127 women and 109 children were included. RESULTS: The current prevalence of children with wasting and overweight was higher in the follow-up study than at baseline UHNS-2019 (18·3 % v. 13·7 %; P = 0·26 and 8·3 % v. 3·7 %; P = 0·12, respectively). There was a decrease in prevalence of child stunting (14·7 % v. 11·9 %; P = 0·37). A change was not observed in overall obesity in women, which was about 30·7 %. Repeated lockdown was associated with a significant reduction in food security from 57 % in UHNS-2019 to 30 % in the current study (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in wasting and overweight among children while women had a persistent high prevalence of obesity. This population needs suitable interventions to improve nutrition status of children and women to minimise susceptibility to COVID-19.","Jayatissa, Renuka; Herath, Himali P; Perera, Amila G; Dayaratne, Thulasika T; De Alwis, Nawmali D; Nanayakkara, Hiyare Palliyage Laksiri K",Public Health Nutr,,262
300138,Does IHU-Mediterranee Infection influence Gilead Sciences' stock price?,2021,"We derive an analytic expression describing how health costs and death counts of the Covid-19 pandemic change over time as vaccination proceeds. Meanwhile, the disease may continue to spread exponentially unless checked by Non Pharmacological Interventions (NPI). The key factors are that the mortality risk from a Covid-19 infection increases exponentially with age and that the sizes of age cohorts decrease linearly at the top of the population pyramid. Taking these factors into account, we derive an expression for a critical threshold, which determines the minimal speed a vaccination campaign needs to have in order to be able to keep fatalities from rising. Younger countries with fast vaccination campaigns find it substantially easier to reach this threshold than countries with aged population and slower vaccination. We find that for EU countries it will take some time to reach this threshold, given that the new, now dominant, mutations, have a significantly higher infection rate. The urgency of accelerating vaccination is increased by early evidence that the new strains also have a higher mortality risk. We also find that protecting the over 60 years old, which constitute one quarter of the EU population, would reduce the loss of live by 95 percent.","Gros, Claudius; Gros, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15544v3.pdf,262
302600,Antibody therapies could be a bridge to a coronavirus vaccine - but will the world benefit?,2020,"Pioneer factors are transcriptional regulators with the capacity to bind inactive regions of chromatin and induce changes in accessibility that underpin cell fate decisions. The FOXA family of transcription factors is well understood to have pioneer capacity. Indeed, researchers have uncovered numerous examples of FOXA-dependent epigenomic modulation in developmental and disease processes. Despite the presence of FOXA being essential for correct epigenetic patterning, the need for continued FOXA presence postchromatin modulation has been debated. In a recent study in this issue of Genes & Development, Reizel and colleagues (pp. 1039-1050) show that the tissue-specific ablation of FOXA1/2/3 in the adult mouse liver results in the collapse of the epigenetic profile that maintains the hepatic gene expression profile. Thus, FOXA functions as a key, opening regions of chromatin during development, and as a doorstep, maintaining the established euchromatic structure in adult tissue.","Heslop, James A; Duncan, Stephen A",Genes Dev,,262

Information on detail pathogenesis, host immune responses and responsible biological pathways are limited. Therefore, infection specific host gut responses and dietary supplements to neutralize immune inflammation demand extensive research. This study aimed to find differences in global co-expression protein-protein interaction sub-network and enriched biological processes in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected gut enterocytes cell line. Attempts have also been made to predict some dietary supplements to boost human health. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected differential express proteins were integrated with the human protein interaction network and co-expression subnetworks were constructed. Common hubs of these sub-networks reshape central cellular pathways of metabolic processes, lipid localization, hypoxia response to decrease oxygen level and transport of bio-molecules. The major biological process enriched in the unique hub of SARS-CoV-2 significantly differ from SARS-CoV, related to interferon signaling, regulation of viral process and influenza-A enzymatic pathway. Predicted dietary supplements can improve SARS-CoV-2 infected person''s health by boosting the host immunity/reducing inflammation.

306463,Global virus tracker,2021,"The coronavirus pandemic highlights the urgent need for increased support related to mental health concerns. This study aimed to synthesize the findings of empirical studies reporting the post-traumatic stress symptoms in the general population during the coronavirus pandemic. Whittemore and Knafl's (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 546, 2005) integrative review methodology was used to analyse and synthesize the peer-reviewed studies. Five electronic databases, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar were searched using terms related to the coronavirus pandemic and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The quality of the studies was screened and evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The sample size of the 16 studies included in this review ranged from 41 to 3480 participants, with a total of 18 039 participants. The majority of the participants' ages ranged from 30 to 39 years, and 57% of the participants were female. The following factors related to post-traumatic stress symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic were identified as follows: (i) risk factors included social discrimination, fear of uncontrolled contagion and financial burden or economic instability; and, (ii) protective factors included social support and timely government action. A traumatic experience itself can trigger the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder; however, depending on the risk and protection factors, each individual can experience different post-traumatic stress symptoms. Thus, mental health nurses should comprehensively understand how to reduce the influence of risk factors and enhance protective factors when dealing with the pandemic and related trauma. This study's findings are beneficial for identifying, preventing and managing post-traumatic stress symptoms associated with the coronavirus and future pandemics.","Hong, Soyun; Kim, Heejung; Park, Min Kyung",Int J Ment Health Nurs,,262

These studies should have been published after the guide for the management of patients with COVID-19 from World Health Organization guide (available in March 13, 2020). RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, in which 143 clinical samples were identified (38 of amniotic fluid; 34 of placentas or membranes; 39 from umbilical cord blood and 32 from human milk). Among the 143 samples, nine were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (one amniotic fluid sample obtained before rupturing the membranes; six samples of placenta or membranes, although authors indicate the possibility of contamination by maternal blood in three of these, and two samples of human milk). CONCLUSIONS: Following our search criteria, we found no studies that demonstrate the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with viral isolation and the evaluation of the infective capacity of viral particles, in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood and human milk, from women with a confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. However, vertical transmission cannot be ruled out, larger studies are required that ideally locate in situ RNA and protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as isolation that demonstrate the infective capacity of the viral particles.","Sampieri, Clara Luz; Montero, Hilda","Gac. sanit.

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety of laparoscopic anterior resection with natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE-LAR) and abdominal incision specimen extraction (AISE-LAR) for sigmoid or rectum tumors. METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Scopus, and ClinicalTrials databases were systematically searched for related articles up to August 2019. The primary outcomes included postoperative complications (overall postoperative complication, incision-related complication, anastomotic fistula, and severe complication) and pathologic results (lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, and distal resection edge). The statistical analysis was performed on STATA 12.0 software. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 1787 patients were used for meta-analysis. Compared with AISE-LAR, NOSE-LAR had more advantages in terms of overall postoperative complication (odds ratio (OR) = 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P = 0.01)), incision-related complication (OR = 0.13 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.35; P < 0.01)), distal resection edge (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.17 cm (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.33 cm; P = 0.02)), recovery of gastrointestinal function (WMD = - 0.38 day (95% CI, - 0.70 to - 0.06 day; P = 0.02 )), pain scores in postoperative day 1 (WMD = - 1.64 (95% CI, - 2.31 to - 0.98; P < 0.01)), additional analgesics usage (OR = 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.40; P < 0.01)) and hospital stay (WMD = - 0.71 day (95% CI, - 1.10 to - 0.32 day; P < 0.01)), while the operation time of NOSE-LAR was prolonged (WMD = 7.4 min (95% CI, 0.17 to 14.64 min; P = 0.04)). The anastomotic fistula, severe complication, lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, intraoperative blood loss, and long-term outcomes in NOSE-LAR were comparable with AISE-LAR. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of NOSE-LAR was demonstrated, and it could be an alternative to conventional surgery in laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid and rectal tumors. However, further randomized and multi-center trials are required.","He, Jun; Yao, Hai-Bo; Wang, Chang-Jian; Yang, Qin-Yan; Qiu, Jian-Ming; Chen, Jin-Ming; Shen, Zhong; Yang, Guan-Gen",World J Surg Oncol,,262
323189,A mini-review on Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir treatment in COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: There has been noteworthy concern about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health services including the management of cancer. In addition to being considered at higher risk for worse outcomes from COVID-19, people with cancer may also experience disruptions or delays in health services. This systematic review aimed to identify the delays and disruptions to cancer services globally. METHODS: This is a systematic review with a comprehensive search including specific and general databases. We considered any observational longitudinal and cross-sectional study design. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by specific tools. The delays and disruptions identified were categorized, and their frequency was presented. RESULTS: Among the 62 studies identified, none exhibited high methodological quality. The most frequent determinants for disruptions were provider- or system-related, mainly because of the reduction in service availability. The studies identified 38 different categories of delays and disruptions with impact on treatment, diagnosis, or general health service. Delays or disruptions most investigated included reduction in routine activity of cancer services and number of cancer surgeries; delay in radiotherapy; and delay, reschedule, or cancellation of outpatient visits. Interruptions and disruptions largely affected facilities (up to 77.5%), supply chain (up to 79%), and personnel availability (up to 60%). CONCLUSION: The remarkable frequency of delays and disruptions in health care mostly related to the reduction of the COVID-19 burden unintentionally posed a major risk on cancer care worldwide. Strategies can be proposed not only to mitigate the main delays and disruptions but also to standardize their measurement and reporting. As a high number of publications continuously are being published, it is critical to harmonize the upcoming reports and constantly update this review.","Riera, Rachel; Bagattini, Ângela Maria; Pacheco, Rafael Leite; Pachito, Daniela Vianna; Roitberg, Felipe; Ilbawi, Andre",JCO Glob Oncol,,262

326157,Vaccine immune boost,2020,"We propose a Susceptible-Infected (SI) epidemic spreading model including containment measures. In absence of containment measures the epidemics spreads exponentially fast for any value of the infectivity $\lambda>0$. The containment measures are modeled by considering a time-dependent modulation of the bare infectivity $\lambda$ leading to an effective infectivity that decays in time for each infected individual, mimicking for instance the combined effect of asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies and quarantine. We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for the effective infectivity and we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic threshold, with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the exponential growth of new infected individuals. We also propose a model with pandemic caused by a growing number of new separated foci. This model provides a stylized mathematical framework that can shed light on the role of different containment measures in mitigating and suppressing the spread of an epidemics such as COVID-19.","Bianconi, Ginestra; Krapivsky, Pavel L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03934v1.pdf,262

327690,Diabetic neuropathy: are we still barking up the wrong tree and is change finally in sight?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth, the delivery of health care through telecommunication technology, has the potential to address multiple health system concerns. Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, allowing for integration into primary care pediatrics. OBJECTIVE: Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to COVID-19, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volume, child-level variation in telemedicine use and clinician attitudes towards telemedicine. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (4/19-5/2/2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) in-person visit rates to office, urgent care and emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use and (5) clinician attitudes towards telemedicine across these practices. RESULTS: Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs. 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.005), but overall more total encounters (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs. 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, but no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus in the context of the pandemic when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race/ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced nor worsened differences in utilization, suggesting further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.","Schweiberger, Kelsey; Hoberman, Alejandro; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Schoemer, Pamela; Squire, Joseph; Taormina, Jill; Wolfson, David; Ray, Kristin N",J. med. internet res,,262

We examined the association between home-and community-level characteristics and the risk of outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in retirement homes since the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 1 to Dec. 18, 2020. Our primary outcome was an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection (&#8805; 1 resident or staff case confirmed by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home- and community-level characteristics and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56 491 residents. There were 273 (35.5%) retirement homes with 1 or more outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, involving 1944 (3.5%) residents and 1101 staff (3.0%). Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 2487 (81.7%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) homes. The adjusted hazard of an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, were co-located with a long-term care facility, were part of larger chains, offered many services onsite, saw increases in regional incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were located in a region with a higher community-level ethnic concentration. INTERPRETATION: Readily identifiable characteristics of retirement homes are independently associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can support risk identification and priority for vaccination.","Costa, Andrew P; Manis, Derek R; Jones, Aaron; Stall, Nathan M; Brown, Kevin A; Boscart, Veronique; Castellino, Adriane; Heckman, George A; Hillmer, Michael P; Ma, Chloe; Pham, Paul; Rais, Saad; Sinha, Samir K; Poss, Jeffrey W",CMAJ,,262

338881,Preparation of hydrophobic macroinimer-based novel hybrid sorbents for efficient removal of organic liquids from wastewater,2021,"Access to 'universal banking services' through the post office network has been a goal of the UK governments over the last twenty years. Various policies and mechanisms have been put in place in an attempt to maintain national geographical coverage with access points while increasing the financial viability of the network. One such mechanism is represented by the six official criteria for access to post offices, expressed as a percentage of the UK population living within one mile, three miles, and six miles of a post office. The method for calculating compliance with these access criteria is not published. Nor will any granular results be published, but only an annual statement that the criteria are being met. This article examines geographical and temporal access to post offices in order to understand the territorial coverage of the network and the impact this has on the provision of basic banking services. The area under investigation is Wales, for which we are reviewing the Government's official access criteria. Through the Post Office Ltd website, we are collecting up-to-date information on the locations and opening hours of post offices in Wales. In addition, a detailed population grid is combined with calculated areas of equidistant geographical access, called isochrones, to determine the number of people who have access to the post office network. The isochrones are based on the Welsh road network and are calculated for different travel modes and thresholds using a powerful routing engine. Our results show that the official access criteria are largely unmet in Wales. In addition, and in contrast to previous studies, we show a rural-urban divide not in terms of spatial access, but in the combination of spatial and temporal access. The results are of both practical and theoretical value and will hopefully inform policy makers.","Sonea, Andra; Westerholt, René",Appl Spat Anal Policy,,262

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34+4 weeks pregnant (G4P1A2) lady was admitted to one of our satellite hospitals with one-week history of severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided facial numbness. At presentation, she had sudden decreased level of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) equal to 4, and bilateral fixed pupils. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles with 2.5cm sized round hemorrhagic lesion at the right posterior thalamic region. After medical stabilization and placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD), the patient was referred for neurosurgical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cavernous hemangioma adjacent to the right posterior wall of the third ventricle. After cesarean section and anterior interhemispheric trans-callosal approach, the mass was removed totally. However, on third postoperative day, she experienced mild hypoxia and dyspnea with fever. Chest CT-scan of the patient showed bilateral consolidation. Thereafter, COVID-19 was confirmed subsequently with positive nasopharyngeal swab testing for RT-PCR. The patient was treated as COVID-19 infection and symptoms improved on day 10 of the treatment and completely recovered.

340416,Why US coronavirus tracking can't keep up with concerning variants,2021,"Rationale: Clinical and epidemiologic data in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have accrued rapidly since the outbreak, but few address the underlying pathophysiology.Objectives: To ascertain the physiologic, hematologic, and imaging basis of lung injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.Methods: Clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collated. Radiologic (computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography [n = 39] and dual-energy CT [DECT, n = 20]) studies were evaluated: observers quantified CT patterns (including the extent of abnormal lung and the presence and extent of dilated peripheral vessels) and perfusion defects on DECT. Coagulation status was assessed using thromboelastography.Measurements and Results: In 39 consecutive patients (male:female, 32:7; mean age, 53 ± 10 yr [range, 29-79 yr]; Black and minority ethnic, n = 25 [64%]), there was a significant vascular perfusion abnormality and increased physiologic dead space (dynamic compliance, 33.7 ± 14.7 ml/cm H2O; Murray lung injury score, 3.14 ± 0.53; mean ventilatory ratios, 2.6 ± 0.8) with evidence of hypercoagulability and fibrinolytic ""shutdown"". The mean CT extent (±SD) of normally aerated lung, ground-glass opacification, and dense parenchymal opacification were 23.5 ± 16.7%, 36.3 ± 24.7%, and 42.7 ± 27.1%, respectively. Dilated peripheral vessels were present in 21/33 (63.6%) patients with at least two assessable lobes (including 10/21 [47.6%] with no evidence of acute pulmonary emboli). Perfusion defects on DECT (assessable in 18/20 [90%]) were present in all patients (wedge-shaped, n = 3; mottled, n = 9; mixed pattern, n = 6).Conclusions: Physiologic, hematologic, and imaging data show not only the presence of a hypercoagulable phenotype in severe COVID-19 pneumonia but also markedly impaired pulmonary perfusion likely caused by pulmonary angiopathy and thrombosis.","Patel, Brijesh V; Arachchillage, Deepa J; Ridge, Carole A; Bianchi, Paolo; Doyle, James F; Garfield, Benjamin; Ledot, Stephane; Morgan, Cliff; Passariello, Maurizio; Price, Susanna; Singh, Suveer; Thakuria, Louit; Trenfield, Sarah; Trimlett, Richard; Weaver, Christine; Wort, S John; Xu, Tina; Padley, Simon P G; Devaraj, Anand; Desai, Sujal R",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,262

Indeed, Pathology Departments are involved in reorganizing samples' management, from their delivery until their processing, according to National and WHO guidelines. Since Lombardy has been declared COVID-19 hot spot, due to decreasing number of surgical procedures, our Department adopted a policy to reduce personnel, allowing pathologists to work remotely during the outbreak. Lacking clear information about viral load on tissue samples, all human specimens must be considered potentially infectious, as well as patients during post-mortem examinations, and clinical information on COVID-19 status is mandatory. It is also important that Pathology staff receive an adequate training, and adherence to rules should be always accompanied by common sense.","Cieri, Miriam; De Carlo, Camilla; Valeri, Marina; Belsito, Vincenzo; Lancellotti, Cesare; Roncalli, Massimo; Colombo, Piergiuseppe",Front.

351057,Advanced packaging for distribution and storage of COVID-19 vaccines: a review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials are currently ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of active surveillance (AS) versus usual care (surgical and radiation treatment) for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This study aimed to determine upgrade rates of DCIS at needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma at surgery among women who meet the eligibility criteria for AS trials. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of consecutive women at an academic medical center with a diagnosis of DCIS at needle biopsy from 2007 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed for mode of presentation, imaging findings, biopsy pathology results, and surgical outcomes. Each patient with DCIS was evaluated for AS trial eligibility based on published criteria for the COMET, LORD, and LORIS trials. RESULTS: During a 10-year period, DCIS was diagnosed in 858 women (mean age 58 years; range 28-89 years). Of the 858 women, 498 (58%) were eligible for the COMET trial, 101 (11.8%) for the LORD trial, and 343 (40%) for the LORIS trial. The rates of upgrade to invasive carcinoma were 12% (60/498) for the COMET trial, 5% (5/101) for the LORD trial, and 11.1% (38/343) for the LORIS trial. The invasive carcinomas ranged from 0.2 to 20 mm, and all were node-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Women who meet the eligibility criteria for DCIS AS trials remain at risk for occult invasive carcinoma at presentation, with upgrade rates ranging from 5 to 12%. These findings suggest that more precise criteria are needed to ensure that women with invasive carcinoma are excluded from AS trials.","Oseni, Tawakalitu O; Smith, Barbara L; Lehman, Constance D; Vijapura, Charmi A; Pinnamaneni, Niveditha; Bahl, Manisha",Ann. surg. oncol,,262

In order to better control the spread of the pandemic, there's an urgent need to extensively study the virus' origin and the mechanisms for its infectivity and pathogenicity. Spike protein is a special structural protein on the surface of coronavirus. It contains important information about the evolution of the virus and plays critical roles in the processes of cellular recognition and entry. In the past decades, spike protein has always been one of the most important objects in research works on coronaviruses closely related to human life. In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Chen, Yongzhu; Qiu, Feng",Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi,,262

360190,How I advocate the importance of vaccines to my Black family,2021,"Nucleic acid biomarkers have been widely used to detect various viral-associated diseases, including the recent pandemic COVID-19. The CRISPR-Cas-based trans-activating phenomenon has shown excellent potential for developing sensitive and selective detection of nucleic acids. However, the nucleic acid amplification steps are typically required when sensitive and selective monitoring of the target nucleic acid is needed. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid amplification-free biosensor by a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-assisted ultrasensitive detection system. We integrated the activated CRISPR-Cas12a by viral DNA with a Raman-sensitive system composed of ssDNA-immobilized Raman probe-functionalized Au nanoparticles (RAuNPs) on the graphene oxide (GO)/triangle Au nanoflower array. Using this CRISPR-based Raman-sensitive system improved the detection sensitivity of the multiviral DNAs such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16), and HPV-18 with an extremely low detection limit and vast detection range from 1 aM to 100 pM without the amplification steps. We suggest that this ultrasensitive amplification-free detection system for nucleic acids can be widely applied to the precise and early diagnosis of viral infections, cancers, and several genetic diseases.","Choi, Jin-Ha; Shin, Minkyu; Yang, Letao; Conley, Brian; Yoon, Jinho; Lee, Sang-Nam; Lee, Ki-Bum; Choi, Jeong-Woo",ACS nano,,262
360492,Making waves: Wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 - approaches and challenges for surveillance and prediction,2020,"Most African countries have recorded relatively lower COVID-19 burdens than Western countries. This has been attributed to early and strong political commitment and robust implementation of public health measures, such as nationwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, face mask wearing, testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with community education and engagement. Other factors include the younger population age strata and hypothesized but yet-to-be confirmed partially protective cross-immunity from parasitic diseases and/or other circulating coronaviruses. However, the true burden may also be underestimated due to operational and resource issues for COVID-19 case identification and reporting. In this perspective article, we discuss selected best practices and challenges with COVID-19 contact tracing in Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. Best practices from these country case studies include sustained, multi-platform public communications; leveraging of technology innovations; applied public health expertise; deployment of community health workers; and robust community engagement. Challenges include an overwhelming workload of contact tracing and case detection for healthcare workers, misinformation and stigma, and poorly sustained adherence to isolation and quarantine. Important lessons learned include the need for decentralization of contact tracing to the lowest geographic levels of surveillance, rigorous use of data and technology to improve decision-making, and sustainment of both community sensitization and political commitment. Further research is needed to understand the role and importance of contact tracing in controlling community transmission dynamics in African countries, including among children. Also, implementation science will be critically needed to evaluate innovative, accessible, and cost-effective digital solutions to accommodate the contact tracing workload.","Nachega, Jean B; Atteh, Rhoda; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Adejumo, Prisca; Nsanzimana, Sabin; Rwagasore, Edson; Condo, Jeanine; Paleker, Masudah; Mahomed, Hassan; Suleman, Fatima; Ario, Alex Riolexus; Kiguli-Malwadde, Elsie; Omaswa, Francis G; Sewankambo, Nelson K; Viboud, Cecile; Reid, Michael J A; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kilmarx, Peter H",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,262

365741,Reply,2020,"Due to their strong biomimetic potential, silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels are impressive candidates for tissue engineering, due to their tunable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, low immunotoxicity, controllable biodegradability, and a remarkable capacity for biomaterial modification and the realization of a specific molecular structure. The fundamental chemical and physical structure of SF allows its structure to be altered using various crosslinking strategies. The established crosslinking methods enable the formation of three-dimensional (3D) networks under physiological conditions. There are different chemical and physical crosslinking mechanisms available for the generation of SF hydrogels (SFHs). These methods, either chemical or physical, change the structure of SF and improve its mechanical stability, although each method has its advantages and disadvantages. While chemical crosslinking agents guarantee the mechanical strength of SFH through the generation of covalent bonds, they could cause some toxicity, and their usage is not compatible with a cell-friendly technology. On the other hand, physical crosslinking approaches have been implemented in the absence of chemical solvents by the induction of ß-sheet conformation in the SF structure. Unfortunately, it is not easy to control the shape and properties of SFHs when using this method. The current review discusses the different crosslinking mechanisms of SFH in detail, in order to support the development of engineered SFHs for biomedical applications.","Farokhi, Maryam; Aleemardani, Mina; Solouk, Atefeh; Mirzadeh, Hamid; Teuschl, Andreas Herbert; Redl, Heinz",Biomed Mater,,262

367062,Use of convalescent plasma therapy in Eight mild COVID-19 patients,2020,"We combine infectious disease transmission and the non-pharmaceutical (NPI) intervention response to disease incidence into one closed model consisting of two coupled delay differential equations for the incidence rate and the time-dependent reproduction number. The model contains three parameters, the initial reproduction number, the intervention strength, and the response delay. The response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of about one week, and suggests that, without vaccination, effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather as a response to the present incidence rate. Vaccination increases the quiet intervals between waves, but with delayed response, future flare-ups can only be prevented by establishing a post-pandemic normal with lower basic reproduction number.","Rypdal, Kristoffer",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,262
368176,An uncommon cold,2020,"Phytohormones emitted into the atmosphere perform many functions relating to the defence, pollination and competitiveness of plants. To be effective, their atmospheric lifetimes must be sufficient that these signals can be delivered to their numerous recipients. We investigate the atmospheric loss processes for methyl salicylate (MeSA), a widely emitted plant volatile. Simulation chambers were used to determine gas-phase reaction rates with OH, NO3, Cl and O3; photolysis rates; and deposition rates of gas-phase MeSA onto organic aerosols. Room temperature rate coefficients are determined (in units of cm3 molecule-1 s-1) to be (3.20 ± 0.46) × 10-12, (4.19 ± 0.92) × 10-15, (1.65 ± 0.44) × 10-12 and (3.33 ± 2.01) × 10-19 for the reactions with OH, NO3, Cl and O3 respectively. Photolysis is negligible in the actinic range, despite having a large reported near-UV chromophore. Conversely, aerosol uptake can be competitive with oxidation under humid conditions, suggesting that this compound has a high affinity for hydrated surfaces. A total lifetime of gas-phase MeSA of 1-4 days was estimated based on all these loss processes. The competing sinks of MeSA demonstrate the need to assess lifetimes of semiochemicals holistically, and we gain understanding of how atmospheric sinks influence natural communication channels within complex multitrophic interactions. This approach can be extended to other compounds that play vital roles in ecosystems, such as insect pheromones, which may be similarly affected during atmospheric transport.","Ren, Yangang; McGillen, Max R; Daële, Véronique; Casas, Jérôme; Mellouki, Abdelwahid",Sci Total Environ,,262

Delays in routine healthcare and immunization have led to a rise in concerns about resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. With the release and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, plans to improve immunization rates need to be explored and implemented across disciplines. One approach would be the consideration of perioperative vaccinations; however, the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response and complications associated with vaccination during the perioperative period are still poorly understood, and opinions are divided. To ascertain the value of a perioperative vaccination program, it is important to understand the basics of immunization and common vaccinations; the potential vaccine complications in the pediatric cohort; the implications of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response; and current recommendations. In addition, we believe it is important to discuss the logistics and feasibility of coordinating perioperative immunization should this become a regular opportunity.","Lin, Connie; Vazquez-Colon, Caroll; Geng-Ramos, Giuliana; Challa, Chaitanya",Paediatr. anaesth,,262

382199,Challenges and accurate estimates of the Mortality and Case Fatality Rates by COVID-19,2020,"This paper deals with modeling and simulation of the novel coronavirus in which the infectious individuals are divided into three subgroups representing three forms of infection. The rigorous analysis of the mathematical model is provided. We provide also a rigorous derivation of the basic reproduction number R 0 . For R 0 < 1 , we prove that the Disease Free Equilibium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS), thus COVID-19 extincts; whereas for R 0 > 1 , we found the co-existing phenomena under some assumptions and parametric values. Elasticity indices for R 0 with respect to different parameters are calculated with baseline parameter values estimated. We also prove that a transcritical bifurcation occurs at R 0 = 1 . Taking into account the control strategies like screening, treatment and isolation (social distancing measures), we present the optimal control problem of minimizing the cost due to the application of these measures. By reducing the values of some parameters, such as death rates (representing a management effort for all categories of people) and recovered rates (representing the action of reduction in transmission, improved screening, treatment for individuals diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and the implementation of barrier measures limiting contamination for undiagnosed individuals), it appears that after 140 - 170 days, the peak of the pandemic is reached and shows that by continuing with this strategy, COVID-19 could be eliminated in the population.","Ndondo, A M; Kasereka, S K; Bisuta, S F; Kyamakya, K; Doungmo, E F G; Ngoie, R-B M",Results Phys,,262

However, the relationship between serum netrin-1 level and the risk of ischemic stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between netrin-1 level and risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control study including 591 ischemic stroke patients and 591 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals was conducted, and serum netrin-1 concentrations were quantitatively determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for all participants. The serum netrin-1 levels were significantly lower in the ischemic stroke patients than those in matched controls (median, 496.4 vs 652.1 pg/mL; P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke associated with the highest quartile of netrin-1 was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01-0.65; Ptrend = 0.018) compared with the lowest quartile of netrin-1. Each 1-standard deviation increase of log-transformed netrin-1 was associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke (odds ratio: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.94; P = 0.032), and a dose-response relationship between serum netrin-1 and ischemic stroke was observed (Plinearity = 0.003). Incorporating netrin-1 to conventional risk factors improved the discriminatory power for ischemic stroke (net reclassification index = 98.0%, P < 0.001; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.28%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Serum netrin-1 was decreased in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy controls, suggesting that there was a potential role of netrin-1 in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.","Guo, Daoxia; Qiao, Ying; Li, Zaihan; Zhu, Zhengbao; Peng, Hao; Zhang, Qiu; Zhong, Chongke; Wang, Aili; Xu, Tan; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Yonghong; He, Jiang",,,262

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: The NHSPI does not appear to be a valid predictor of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the pandemic.","Keim, Mark E; Lovallo, Alex P",Prehosp Disaster Med,,262
405485,Response,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the pandemic, increased numbers of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission required an increase in ICU capacity, including ICU staffing with competence to care for critically ill patients. Consequently, nurses from acute care areas were called in to staff the ICU along with experienced intensive care nurses. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe Swedish registered nurses' experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19 in ICUs during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed method survey design. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed through social media to registered nurses who had been working in the ICU during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected for 1 week (May 2020) and analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 282 nurses who participated, the majority were ICU nurses (n = 151; 54%). Half of the nurses specialized in ICU reported that they were responsible for the ICU care of three or more patients during the pandemic (n = 75; 50%). Among non-intensive care nurses, only 19% received introduction to the COVID-19 ICU (n = 26). The analysis of data regarding nurses' experiences resulted in three categories: tumbling into chaos, diminished nursing care, and transition into pandemic ICU care. Participants described how patient safety and care quality were compromised, and that nursing care was severely deprioritized during the pandemic. The situation of not being able to provide nursing care resulted in ethical stress. Furthermore, an increased workload and worsened work environment affected nurses' health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present study indicate that nurses perceived that patient safety and quality of care were compromised during the pandemic. This resulted in ethical stress among nurses, which may have affected their physical and psychosocial well-being. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on nurses' work environment, which could result in burnout and staff turnover.","Bergman, Lina; Falk, Ann-Charlotte; Wolf, Axel; Larsson, Ing-Marie",Nurs. crit. care,,262

This study examines the effects of two positive psychological resources on the mental health of Indian citizens during the early days of the lockdown. The effects of psychological capital (PsyCap) and internal locus of control on psychological distress of people via affect balance were tested. Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control.

So far, data on cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is limited. Here, we compared four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Vircell SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 207 patients with COVID-19, 178 patients with serological evidence of different bacterial infections, 107 patients with confirmed viral respiratory disease, and 80 controls from the pre-COVID-19 era. In COVID-19 patients, the assays showed highest sensitivity in week 3 (Vircell-IgM/A and Euroimmun-IgA: 78.9% each) and after week 7 (Vircell-IgG: 97.9%; Euroimmun-IgG: 92.1%). The antibody indices were higher in patients with fatal disease. In general, IgM/IgA assays had only limited or no benefit over IgG assays. In patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections, IgG assays were more specific than IgM/IgA assays, and bacterial infections were associated with more false-positive results than viral infections. The specificities in bacterial and viral infections were 68.0 and 81.3% (Vircell-IgM/IgA), 84.8 and 96.3% (Euroimmun-IgA), 97.8 and 86.0% (Vircell-IgG), and 97.8 and 99.1% (Euroimmun-IgG), respectively. Sera from patients positive for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila yielded particularly high rates of unspecific false-positive results in the IgM/IgA assays, which was revealed by applying a highly specific flow-cytometric assay using HEK 293 T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positive results obtained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA ELISAs require careful interpretation, especially if there is evidence for prior bacterial respiratory infections.","Huber, Timo; Steininger, Philipp; Irrgang, Pascal; Korn, Klaus; Tenbusch, Matthias; Diesch, Katharina; Achenbach, Susanne; Kremer, Andreas E; Werblow, Marissa; Vetter, Marcel; Bogdan, Christian; Held, Jürgen",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,262

MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (Bærum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS: In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital. Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3). Only one of the most severely ill patients scored &#8805; 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission. INTERPRETATION: Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms. A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness. A NEWS2 score of &#8805; 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score &#8805; 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.","Ihle-Hansen, Håkon; Berge, Trygve; Tveita, Anders; Rønning, Else Johanne; Ernø, Per Erik; Andersen, Elizabeth Lyster; Wang, Christian Hjorth; Tveit, Arnljot; Myrstad, Marius",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,262
413871,Response,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a public health emergency and a pandemic of international concern. As of April 31st, the reported cases of COVID-19 are three million in 186 countries. Reported case fatality has crossed 200 thousand among which more than fifty thousand has been in the USA. Most patients present with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath following exposure to other COVID-19 patients. Respiratory manifestations predominate in patients with mild, moderate, severe illness. Imaging of patients with COVID-19 consistently reports various pulmonary parenchymal involvement. In this article we wanted to reinforce and review the various reported imaging patterns of cardiac and mediastinal involvement in COVID-19 patients. Among patients with COVID 19 who underwent various imaging of chest various cardiac findings including pericardial effusion, myocarditis, cardiomegaly has been reported. Most of these findings have been consistently reported in patients with significant acute myocardial injury, and fulminant myocarditis. Acute biventricular dysfunction has also been reported with subsequent improvement of the same following clinical improvement. Details of cardiac MRI is rather limited. In a patient with clinical presentation of acute myocarditis, biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, diffuse biventricular hypokinesia, increased ventricular wall thickness, and severe LV dysfunction has been reported. Among patients with significant clinical improvement in LV structure and function has also been documented. With increasing number of clinical cases, future imaging studies will be instrumental in identifying the various cardiac manifestations, and their relation to clinical outcome.","Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos; Sahu, Kamal Kant; Kranis, Mark; Sargent, Jennifer",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,262

416828,Reply,2021,"Many biological processes discriminate correct and incorrect substrates through the kinetic proofreading mechanism which enables lower error at the cost of higher energy dissipation. Although it is apparently beneficial for the organisms to reduce both error and energy cost of the discrimination process, it remains unclear to what extent these two quantities can be minimized simultaneously. Here, with a chemical kinetic formalism, we identify a fundamental error-cost bound which tightly constrains the system's performance under any parameter variations preserving the rate discrimination between substrates. The analytic form of bound is obtained in a large class of proofreading networks and supported by numeric sampling. Furthermore, this bound is kinetically controlled, i.e. completely determined by the difference between the transition state energies of corresponding enzymatic reactions on the free energy landscape. The importance of the bound is analyzed for three biological processes. DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase is shown to be nearly optimized, i.e. its kinetic parameters place it in the immediate proximity of the error-cost bound. The isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) of E. coli also operates close to the bound, but further optimization is prevented by the need for reaction speed. On the contrary, speed requirement forces E. coli ribosome to operate in a high-dissipation regime. Together, these findings establish a fundamental relation between error and energy cost in biological proofreading networks and provide a theoretical framework for studying error-dissipation trade-off in other systems with biological discrimination.","Yu, Qiwei; Kolomeisky, Anatoly B.; Igoshin, Oleg A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01418v1.pdf,262

421942,Antibodies periodically wax and wane in survivors of Ebola,2021,"Systemic drug administration has conventionally been prescribed to alleviate persistent local inflammation which is prevalent in chronic diseases. However, this approach is associated with drug-induced toxicity, particularly when the dosage exceeds that necessitated by pathological conditions of diseased tissues. Herein, we developed a modular hybrid hydrogel which could be triggered to release an anti-inflammatory drug upon exposure to elevated protease activity associated with inflammatory diseases. Modular design of the hybrid hydrogel enabled independent optimization of its protease-cleavable and drug-loaded subdomains to facilitate hydrogel formation, cleavability by matrix-metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), and tuning drug release rate. In vitro study demonstrated the protease-triggered enhancement of drug release from the hybrid hydrogel system for effective inhibition of TNF-&#945; production by pro-inflammatory macrophages and suggested its potential to mitigate drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using non-invasive imaging to monitor the activity of reactive oxygen species in biomaterial-induced host response, we confirmed that the hybrid hydrogel and its constituent materials did not induce adverse immune response after 5 days following their subcutaneous injection in immuno-competent mice. We subsequently incorporated this hybrid hydrogel onto a commercial wound dressing which could release the drug upon exposure to MMP-9. Together, our findings suggested that this hybrid hydrogel might be a versatile platform for on-demand drug delivery via either injectable or topical application to modulate inflammation in chronic diseases.","Nguyen, Dang T; Soeranaya, Bob Hartadhi Tji; Truong, Thi Hong Anh; Dang, Tram T",Acta biomater,,262

Objective: To compare intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone as initial therapy in MIS-C. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment. Treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with lower risk of treatment failure (absolute risk difference, -0.28 [95% CI, -0.48 to -0.08]; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.70]; P = .008). IVIG and methylprednisolone therapy vs IVIG alone was also significantly associated with lower risk of use of second-line therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.22 [95% CI, -0.40 to -0.04]; OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.61]; P = .004), hemodynamic support (absolute risk difference, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.004]; OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.76]), acute left ventricular dysfunction occurring after initial therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01]; OR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.66]), and duration of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (median, 4 vs 6 days; difference in days, -2.4 [95% CI, -4.0 to -0.7]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with MIS-C, treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with a more favorable fever course.

The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.","Azlan, Arina Anis; Hamzah, Mohammad Rezal; Sern, Tham Jen; Ayub, Suffian Hadi; Mohamad, Emma",PLoS One,,262

431045,Emergency restructuring and impact of the pandemic in an Image-Guided Minimally Invasive Surgery Section,2020,"The link between viral respiratory infection and non-pulmonary organ-specific injury, including cardiac injury, has become increasingly appreciated during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic, however, the association between acute infection with influenza and elevated cardiovascular risk was evident. The recently published results of the NHLBI-funded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop CardioThoracic Events and Decompensated (INVESTED) trial, a 5200 patient comparative effectiveness study of high-dose vs. standard-dose influenza vaccine to reduce cardiopulmonary events and mortality in a high-risk cardiovascular population, found no difference between strategies. However, the broader implications of influenza vaccine as a strategy to reduce morbidity in high-risk patients remain extremely important, with randomized controlled trial and observational data supporting vaccination in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Given a favourable risk-benefit profile and widespread availability at generally low cost, we contend that influenza vaccination should remain a centrepiece of cardiovascular risk mitigation and describe the broader context of underutilization of this strategy. Few therapeutics in medicine offer seasonal efficacy from a single administration with generally mild, transient side effects, and exceedingly low rates of serious adverse effects. Infection control measures such as physical distancing, hand washing, and the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic have already been associated with substantially curtailed incidence of influenza outbreaks across the globe. Appending annual influenza vaccination to these measures represents an important public health and moral imperative.","Bhatt, Ankeet S; Vardeny, Orly; Udell, Jacob A; Joseph, Jacob; Kim, KyungMann; Solomon, Scott D",Eur Heart J,,262

433178,Erratum,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide and is becoming a major public health crisis. Increasing evidence demonstrates a strong correlation between obesity and the COVID-19 disease. We have summarized recent studies and addressed the impact of obesity on COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, severity, mortality, and patient outcome. We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response. Finally, anti-inflammatory cytokines like anti-interleukin 6 and administration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells may serve as potential immune modulatory therapies for supportively combating COVID-19. Obesity is conversely related to the development of COVID-19 through numerous molecular mechanisms and individuals with obesity belong to the COVID-19-susceptible population requiring more protective measures.","Ritter, Andreas; Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",,,262

436008,Flying Blind on the Origin of the Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To study whether a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can be of assistance to radiologists in differentiating Coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive from COVID-negative patients using chest X-ray (CXR) through an ambispective clinical study. To identify subgroups of patients where artificial intelligence (AI) can be of particular value and analyse what imaging features may have contributed to the performance of AI by means of visualisation techniques. METHODS: CXR of 487 patients were classified into [4] categories-normal, classical COVID, indeterminate, and non-COVID by consensus opinion of 2 radiologists. CXR which were classified as ""normal"" and ""indeterminate"" were then subjected to analysis by AI, and final categorisation provided as guided by prediction of the network. Precision and recall of the radiologist alone and radiologist assisted by AI were calculated in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. Attention maps of the CNN were analysed to understand regions in the CXR important to the AI algorithm in making a prediction. RESULTS: The precision of radiologists improved from 65.9 to 81.9% and recall improved from 17.5 to 71.75 when assistance with AI was provided. AI showed 92% accuracy in classifying ""normal"" CXR into COVID or non-COVID. Analysis of attention maps revealed attention on the cardiac shadow in these ""normal"" radiographs. CONCLUSION: This study shows how deployment of an AI algorithm can complement a human expert in the determination of COVID status. Analysis of the detected features suggests possible subtle cardiac changes, laying ground for further investigative studies into possible cardiac changes. KEY POINTS: â¢ Through an ambispective clinical study, we show how assistance with an AI algorithm can improve recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) of radiologists in assessing CXR for possible COVID in comparison to RT-PCR. â¢ We show that AI achieves the best results in images classified as ""normal"" by radiologists. We conjecture that possible subtle cardiac in the CXR, imperceptible to the human eye, may have contributed to this prediction. â¢ The reported results may pave the way for a human computer collaboration whereby the expert with some help from the AI algorithm achieves higher accuracy in predicting COVID status on CXR than previously thought possible when considering either alone.","Rangarajan, Krithika; Muku, Sumanyu; Garg, Amit Kumar; Gabra, Pavan; Shankar, Sujay Halkur; Nischal, Neeraj; Soni, Kapil Dev; Bhalla, Ashu Seith; Mohan, Anant; Tiwari, Pawan; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Bansal, Raghav; Kumar, Atin; Gamanagati, Shivanand; Aggarwal, Richa; Baitha, Upendra; Biswas, Ashutosh; Kumar, Arvind; Jorwal, Pankaj; Shariff, A; Wig, Naveet; Subramanium, Rajeshwari; Trikha, Anjan; Malhotra, Rajesh; Guleria, Randeep; Namboodiri, Vinay; Banerjee, Subhashis; Arora, Chetan",Eur. radiol,,262

Here, we present in vitro evidence for significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by oleandrin and a defined extract of N. oleander (designated as PBI-06150). Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic (pre-infection) oleandrin (as either the pure compound or as the active principal ingredient in PBI-06150) administration at concentrations as low as 0.05 µg/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 µg/ml concentration resulted in a greater than 3000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values were 11.98 ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 h post-infection, and 7.07 ng/ml measured at 48 h post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with 0.1 µg/ml and 0.05 µg/ml concentrations causing greater than 100-fold reduction as measured at 48 h, and the 0.05 µg/ml concentration resulting in a 78-fold reduction. Concentrations of oleandrin up to 10 µg/ml were well tolerated in Vero cells. We also present in vivo evidence of the safety and efficacy of defined N. oleander extract (PBI-06150), which was administered to golden Syrian hamsters in a preparation containing as high as 130 µg/ml of oleandrin. In comparison to administration of control vehicle, PBI-06150 provided a statistically significant reduction of the viral titer in the nasal turbinates (nasal conchae).

Participants judged whether two simultaneously presented face photographs showed the same person or two different people. We superimposed images of surgical masks over the faces, creating three different mask conditions: control (no masks), mixed (one face wearing a mask), and masked (both faces wearing masks). We found that surgical face masks have a large detrimental effect on human face matching performance, and that the degree of impairment is the same regardless of whether one or both faces in each pair are masked. Surprisingly, this impairment is similar in size for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. When matching masked faces, human observers are biased to reject unfamiliar faces as ""mismatches"" and to accept familiar faces as ""matches"". Finally, the face recognition system showed very high classification accuracy for control and masked stimuli, even though it had not been trained to recognise masked faces. However, accuracy fell markedly when one face was masked and the other was not. Our findings demonstrate that surgical face masks impair the ability of humans, and naïve face recognition systems, to perform perceptual face matching tasks. Identification decisions for masked faces should be treated with caution.","Carragher, Daniel J; Hancock, Peter J B",Cogn Res Princ Implic,,262

METHODS: Sixty severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Changsha Public Health Treatment Center (North Hospital of the First Hospital of Changsha City) from January to March in 2020 were randomly divided into routine treatment group, Xuebijing 50 mL group and Xuebijing 100 mL group, with 20 cases in each group. The routine treatment group was treated according to the National Health Commission's guide for COVID-19. On the basis of conventional treatment, Xuebijing injection was injected by 50 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 50 mL group, while by 100 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 100 mL group. The blood routine test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test and disease classification of three groups before and 8 days after treatment were observed. RESULTS: (1) After treatment, the white blood cell count (WBC) and lymphocyte count (LYM) of three groups increased, meanwhile CRP and ESR decreased. Compared with routine treatment group, the WBC count of Xuebijing 100 mL group after treatment significantly increased (×109/L: 7.12±0.55 vs. 5.67±0.51, P < 0.05), and the levels of CRP and ESR in Xuebijing 50 mL and 100 mL groups significantly decreased [CRP (mg/L): 32.3±4.6, 28.0±6.2 vs. 37.3±5.9; ESR (mm/1 h): 45.9±5.7, 40.5±7.4 vs. 55.3±6.6, all P < 0.05]. Compared with Xuebijing 50 mL group, the increase of WBC, and the decrease of CRP and ESR were more significant in Xuebijing 100 mL group [WBC (×109/L): 7.12±0.55 vs. 5.82±0.49, CRP (mg/L): 28.0±6.2 vs. 32.3±4.6, ESR (mm/1 h): 40.5±7.4 vs. 45.9±5.7, all P < 0.05]. (2) After treatment, the APACHE II score of three groups decreased. In Xuebijing 100 mL group, the APACHE II score after treatment was significantly lower than those in routine treatment and Xuebijing 50 mL groups (12.3±1.5 vs. 16.5±1.6, 15.9±1.4, both P < 0.05). After treatment, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in three groups partly turned negative, with 9 cases in routine treatment group, 8 cases in Xuebijing 50 mL group and 9 cases in Xuebijing 100 mL group, without significant difference (P > 0.05). The conditions of patients in the three groups were improved after treatment, among them, 8 cases in the routine treatment group were transformed into common type, 1 case into critical type; 9 cases and 12 cases of Xuebijing 50 mL group and 100 mL group were transformed into common type respectively. Xuebijing 100 mL group was improved more obviously than Xuebijing 50 mL group and routine treatment group (both P < 0.05).

443469,A short review on antibody therapy for COVID-19,2020,"Microbial infections are still among the major public health concerns since several yeasts and fungi, and other pathogenic microorganisms, are responsible for continuous growth of infections and drug resistance against bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance rate is fostering the need to develop new strategies against drug-resistant superbugs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptide-based molecules of 5-100 amino acids in length, with potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are part of the innate immune system, which can represent a minimal risk of resistance development. These characteristics contribute to the description of these molecules as promising new molecules in the development of new antimicrobial drugs. However, efforts in developing new medicines have not resulted in any decrease of drug resistance yet. Thus, a technological approach on improving existing drugs is gaining special interest. Nanomedicine provides easy access to innovative carriers, which ultimately enable the design and development of targeted delivery systems of the most efficient drugs with increased efficacy and reduced toxicity. Based on performance, successful experiments, and considerable market prospects, nanotechnology will undoubtedly lead a breakthrough in biomedical field also for infectious diseases, as there are several nanotechnological approaches that exhibit important roles in restoring antibiotic activity against resistant bacteria.","Teixeira, Maria C; Carbone, Claudia; Sousa, Maria C; Espina, Marta; Garcia, Maria L; Sanchez-Lopez, Elena; Souto, Eliana B",,,262

While previous methods often treat the detection of each putative connection as a separate hypothesis test, here we develop a modeling approach that infers synaptic connections while incorporating circuit properties learned from the whole network. We use an extension of the Generalized Linear Model framework to describe the cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons and separate correlograms into two parts: a slowly varying effect due to background fluctuations and a fast, transient effect due to the synapse. We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neuron's type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections. We also apply our model to in vitro multielectrode array recordings from mouse somatosensory cortex. Here our model automatically recovers plausible connections from hundreds of neurons, and the properties of the putative connections are largely consistent with previous research.","Ren, Naixin; Ito, Shinya; Hafizi, Hadi; Beggs, John M; Stevenson, Ian H",J. neurophysiol,,262

To our knowledge, detailed EEG findings in COVID-19 have not yet been reported. This report adds to the scarce body of evidence. METHODS: We identified eight COVID-19 positive patients who underwent EEG monitoring in our hospital system. RESULTS: EEGs were most commonly ordered for an altered level of consciousness, a nonspecific neurologic manifestation. We observed generalized background slowing in all patients and generalized epileptiform discharges with triphasic morphology in three patients. Focal electrographic seizures were observed in one patient with a history of focal epilepsy and in another patient with no such history. Five of eight patients had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy, suggesting that pre-existing epilepsy can be a potential risk factor for COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. Five of eight patients who underwent EEG experienced a fatal outcome of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore previous observations that neurologic manifestations are common in severe cases. COVID-19 patients with epilepsy may have an increased risk of neurological manifestations and abnormal EEG.","Pilato, Madison S; Urban, Alexandra; Alkawadri, Rafeed; Barot, Niravkumar V; Castellano, James F; Rajasekaran, Vijayalakshmi; Bagic, Anto I; Fong-Isariyawongse, Joanna S",J. clin. neurophysiol,,262
471474,Why is it so hard to investigate the rare side effects of COVID vaccines?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: To combat COVID-19, scientists all over the world have expedited the process of vaccine development. Although interim analyses of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, a serious but rare adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), has been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. AREAS COVERED: This review, using data from both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies, aimed to provide updated information about the critical issue of COVID-19 vaccine-related TTS. EXPERT OPINION: : The exact epidemiological characteristics and possible pathogenesis of this adverse event remain unclear. Most cases of TTS developed in women within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccine on the receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. In countries with mass vaccination against COVID-19, clinicians should be aware of the relevant clinical features of this rare adverse event and perform related laboratory and imaging studies for early diagnosis. Non-heparin anticoagulants, such as fondaparinux, argatroban, or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. apixaban or rivaroxaban) and intravenous immunoglobulins are recommended for the treatment of TTS. However, further studies are required to explore the underlying mechanisms of this rare clinical entity. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: What is the context?Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) usually develops within 2 weeks of the first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines.TTS mainly occurs in patients aged < 55 years and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.What is new?TTS mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and can be mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4. Non-heparin anticoagulants, such as fondaparinux, argatroban, or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. apixaban or rivaroxaban) should be considered as the treatment of choice if the platelet count is > 50 × 109/L and there is no serious bleeding. Intravenous immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids may help increase the platelet count within days and reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation when anticoagulation is initiated.What is the impact?TTS should be a serious concern during the implementation of mass COVID-19 vaccination, and patients should be educated about this complication along with its symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, seizure, severe and persistent abdominal pain, painful swelling of the lower leg, and chest pain or dyspnea. The incidence of TTS is low; therefore, maintenance of high vaccination coverage against COVID-19 should be continued.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Ko, Wen-Chien; Chen, Chih-Jung; Chen, Po-Yen; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Expert Rev Vaccines,,262

The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is 2 of the mandatory major criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder), 1 of the other major criteria (Castleman's disease, sclerotic bone lesions, or vascular endothelial growth factor elevation), and at least 1 of the minor criteria (organomegaly, extravascular volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis, or polycythemia). However, some cases do not fully meet the diagnostic criteria, such cases are referred to as incomplete or atypical POEMS syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our department of neurology with weakness of both arms and legs. In addition,it's found that she had skin manifestations, lymphadenopathies, pedal edema, immunoglobin - A-&#955; restricted paraproteinemia, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor and other features, but without polyneuropathy. DIAGNOSES:: we made a diagnosis of atypical POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy. INTERVENTIONS: Two drug regimens were recommended: VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, Dexamethasone) and bortezomib. Finally, the VAD strategy was performed. OUTCOMES: The patient's limb strength and pain improved and enzyme parameters decreased gradually after 4 weeks. However, the treatment was still not perfect. CONCLUSION: We reported a rare case of POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy. We hope similar cases will be reported in the future.","Li, Qiang; Xu, Fang; Duan, Jing-Feng; Tang, Yu-Feng",Medicine (Baltimore),,262
477933,Ten simple rules for starting (and sustaining) an academic data science initiative,2021,"PURPOSE: As an important measure to alleviate long-term care (LTC) costs for the disabled due to the aging of the population, long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been paid more attention in China. In addition to the government-led public LTCI system that has been piloted in cities such as Qingdao, Chongqing and Shanghai, health insurers such as the China Life Insurance Company are also experimenting with various types of commercial LTCI in the private market. However, the commercial LTCI market is developing very slowly due to public awareness and other reasons. On the other hand, COVID-2019 has had an impact on the cognition of the importance of long-term care for the elderly due to the fact that the death cases of COVID-2019 have been mainly concentrated in the elderly population with chronic diseases such as hypertension. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the differences in the purchase intention of commercial LTCI among the elderly in two different periods: before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019. METHODS: By using the Andersen behavioral model and two investigations in two different periods before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019, this study explores the impacts of COVID-2019 on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI. RESULTS: Some significant discoveries were found. For example, 25.8% of interviewees showed purchase intention in LTCI in the time before the COVID-2019 outbreak, while this proportion increased to 37.6% after the COVID-2019 outbreak. People who were younger (OR = 2.128, before COVID-2019; OR = 1.875, after COVID-2019) or who had more education (OR = 1.502, before COVID-2019; OR = 2.218, after COVID-2019) were more interested in commercial LTCI. CONCLUSION: This study shows that COVID-2019 has had an obvious impact on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI, which provides some enlightenment for China to improve the LTCI system in the future, especially to accelerate the development of commercial LTCI. For example, it is essential to promote the importance of long-term care among the elderly in a focused and targeted way. In terms of the key target audience, it can be developed gradually from the groups with higher education levels and the middle elderly aged 45-64 years old.","Xu, Xiaocang; Zhang, Lu; Chen, Linhong; Wei, Feng",,,262
478977,Oral Abstracts,2020,"Nationwide lockdown for COVID-19 created an urgent demand for public transportation among migrant workers stranded at different parts of India to return to their native places. Arranging transportation could spike the number of COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this paper investigates the potential surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011 census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants (i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence, travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day to Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was recommended.","Maji, Avijit; Choudhari, Tushar; Sushma, M.

481382,"Dogs caught coronavirus from their owners, genetic analysis suggests",2020,"Data were collected from 896 participants in three Chinese cities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to varying degrees through an online survey platform. A conditional process model was then proposed for the impact of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of social norms. Statistical analysis demonstrates that optimistic bias has a negative impact on self-protection behaviors through message acceptance. Perceived social norms moderate this relationship in the following ways: (1) The higher the perceptions of social norms, the smaller the negative impact of optimistic bias on message acceptance, and the smaller the positive impact of message acceptance on self-protection behaviors. (2) Within a certain range, the higher the perceptions of social norms, the smaller the negative impact, both direct and indirect, of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors. (3) The direct and indirect effects of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors become insignificant when perceptions of social norms are very strong. Comparing the data of the three cities shows that higher risk is associated with a stronger role of social norms in moderating the relationship between optimistic bias and self-protection behaviors. The above results suggest that there may be both internal (optimistic bias) and external (social norms) reference points in individual decision-making regarding health behaviors. The theoretical and practical significance of the dual reference points are discussed.","Chen, S.; Liu, J.; Hu, H.",Frontiers in Psychology,,262

495705,How COVID unlocked the power of RNA vaccines,2021,"As the current worldwide outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2, it is urgently needed to develop effective therapeutic agents for inhibiting the pathogens or treating the related diseases. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) with functional activity against coronavirus could be a considerable solution, yet there is no research for identifying anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) peptides with the computational approach. In this study, we first investigated the physiochemical and compositional properties of the collected anti-CoV peptides by comparing against three other negative sets: antivirus peptides without anti-CoV function (antivirus), regular AMP without antivirus functions (non-AVP) and peptides without antimicrobial functions (non-AMP). Then, we established classifiers for identifying anti-CoV peptides between different negative sets based on random forest. Imbalanced learning strategies were adopted due to the severe class-imbalance within the datasets. The geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity (GMean) under the identification from antivirus, non-AVP and non-AMP reaches 83.07%, 85.51% and 98.82%, respectively. Then, to pursue identifying anti-CoV peptides from broad-spectrum peptides, we designed a double-stages classifier based on the collected datasets. In the first stage, the classifier characterizes AMPs from regular peptides. It achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUCROC) value of 97.31%. The second stage is to identify the anti-CoV peptides between the combined negatives of other AMPs. Here, the GMean of evaluation on the independent test set is 79.42%. The proposed approach is considered as an applicable scheme for assisting the development of novel anti-CoV peptides.

500416,Year 2020: Science and Engineering Research Continues,2021,"BACKGROUND: We sought to clarify the benefit of cytokine adsorption in patients with COVID-19 supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: We did a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial to investigate cytokine adsorption in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ECMO. Patients with COVID-19 selected for ECMO at the Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, Germany) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device or not. Randomisation was computer-generated, allocation was concealed by opaque, sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The CytoSorb device was incorporated into the ECMO circuit before connection to the patient circuit, replaced every 24 h, and removed after 72 h. The primary endpoint was serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration 72 h after initiation of ECMO analysed by intention to treat. Secondary endpoints included 30-day survival. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04324528) and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021300) and is closed. FINDINGS: From March 29, 2020, to Dec 29, 2020, of 34 patients assessed for eligibility, 17 (50%) were treated with cytokine adsorption and 17 (50%) without. Median IL-6 decreased from 357·0 pg/mL to 98·6 pg/mL in patients randomly assigned to cytokine adsorption and from 289·0 pg/mL to 112·0 pg/mL in the control group after 72 h. One patient in each group died before 72 h. Adjusted mean log IL-6 concentrations after 72 h were 0·30 higher in the cytokine adsorption group (95% CI -0·70 to 1·30, p=0·54). Survival after 30 days was three (18%) of 17 with cytokine adsorption and 13 (76%) of 17 without cytokine adsorption (p=0·0016). INTERPRETATION: Early initiation of cytokine adsorption in patients with severe COVID-19 and venovenous ECMO did not reduce serum IL-6 and had a negative effect on survival. Cytokine adsorption should not be used during the first days of ECMO support in COVID-19.

Design/method/approach: The data were analyzed descriptively to see the development patterns in four periods: before implementation, during the implementation before the pandemic, during the pandemic and during the enforcement of new normal, in general, and by the length of stay (LOS). Findings: The inventory purchase in the pharmaceutical unit dramatically decreased after implementation even during the pandemic and new normal wherein the pre-pandemic it decreased by 27%, during the pandemic 29% and in the new normal 37% compared to pre-LSS. The hospital deficit decreased after implementation before the pandemic by 26% and during the pandemic by 10% from the pre-LSS time. However, during the new normal, the deficit increased by 29%, indicating a diminished effect of LSS on the hospital profits. Research limitations/implications: This research raised the possible implication that the implementation of LSS needed to be carried out in the entire hospital to have a large effect, especially on the inpatient care and long-term care installations. Originality/value: This research provided empirical evidence regarding the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the ability of LSS at the unit level to provide efficiency at the unit level and the entire hospital at various levels of LOS. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Iswanto, A.

Serological cardiac biomarkers have been used to define acute myocardial injury, with significant elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, 20-25% patients with acute myocardial injury (as defined by an elevated hs-cTn greater than the 99th percentile) have clinical signs of heart failure and increased mortality. An important outstanding clinical question is how best to determine the extent and nature of cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Non-invasive cardiac imaging has a well-established role in assessing cardiac structure and function in a wide range of cardiac diseases. It offers the potential to differentiate between direct and indirect COVID-19 effects upon the heart, providing incremental diagnostic and prognostic utility beyond the information yielded by elevated cardiac biomarkers in isolation. This review will focus on the non-invasive imaging assessment of cardiac involvement in COVID-19.","Hothi, S. S.; Jiang, J.; Steeds, R. P.; Moody, W. E.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,262

A centre-based format is a known barrier, suggesting that home-based programmes might improve accessibility. The aim of SCOT: Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is to assess the implementation of the REACH-HF home-based CR intervention in the context of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.This paper presents the design and protocol for this observational implementation study. Specific objectives of SCOT:REACH-HF are to: (1) assess service-level facilitators and barriers to the implementation of REACH-HF; (2) compare real-world patient and caregiver outcomes to those seen in a prior clinical trial; and (3) estimate the economic (health and social) impact of implementing REACH-HF in Scotland. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The REACH-HF intervention will be delivered in partnership with four 'Beacon sites' across six NHS Scotland Health Boards, covering rural and urban areas. Health professionals from each site will be trained to facilitate delivery of the 12-week programme to 140 people with heart failure and their caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Assessments include the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), five-dimension EuroQol 5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20 health professionals involved in programme delivery (eg, cardiac nurses, physiotherapists). 65 facilitator-patient consultations will be audio recorded and assessed for fidelity. Integrative analysis will address key research questions on fidelity, context and CR participant-related outcomes. The SCOT:REACH-HF findings will inform the future potential roll-out of REACH-HF in Scotland. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been given ethical approval by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (reference 20/WS/0038, approved 25 March 2020). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN53784122. The research team will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with both General Data Protection Regulations and the University of Glasgow's Research Governance Framework. Findings will be reported to the funder and shared with Beacon Sites, to facilitate service evaluation, planning and good practice. To broaden interest in, and understanding of REACH-HF, we will seek to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present at stakeholder events, national and international conferences.","Purcell, Carrie; Daw, Paulina; Kerr, Claire; Cleland, J; Cowie, Aynsley; Dalal, Hasnain M; Ibbotson, Tracy; Murphy, Clare; Taylor, Rod",BMJ Open,,262

AIM: To determine the psychological status and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD) among general population (except confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts) and their association with the coping strategy types during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community through snowball sampling with anonymous online questionnaires, using 28-item General Health Questionnaire, 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised and 28-item Brief Coping Inventory to measure their psychiatric disorders, PTSD level and coping strategies. RESULTS: Of the total 1109 participants, 42.65% and 67.09% self-reported psychiatric disorders and high PTSD level, respectively. Age, occupation and education level were significantly association with psychological status. The status of psychiatric disorders was also significantly related to high PTSD level. Using both emotion and problem coping was better for psychiatric status [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54-0.98], and problem-focused coping was significantly associated with high PTSD level (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.25-3.51).

The effect of driven-data selection over time and space was also within the deep concern. Methods: A mathematical definition of the test strategy were given. With the real COVID-19 test data from March to July collected in Lahore, a significance analysis of the possible features was conducted. A machine learning method based on logistic regression and priority ranking were proposed for the data-driven test strategy. With performance assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), time series analysis and spatial cross-test were conducted. Results: The transition of risk factors accounted for the failure of the current test strategy. The proposed data-driven strategy could enhance the positive detection rate from 2.54% to 28.18%, and the recall rate from 8.05% to 89.35% under strictly limited test capacity. Much more optimal utilization of test resources could be realized where 89.35% of total positive cases could be detected with merely 48.17% of the original test amount. The strategy showed self-adaptability with the development of pandemic, while the strategy driven by local data was proved to be optimal. Conclusions: We recommended a generalization of such a data-driven test strategy for a better response to the global developing pandemic. Besides, the construction of the COVID-19 data system should be more refined on space for local applications.","Huang, Chuanli; Wang, Min; Rafaqat, Warda; Shabbir, Salman; Lian, Liping; Zhang, Jun; Lo, Siuming; Song, Weiguo",Socioecon Plann Sci,,262

523039,Ten simple rules for supporting a temporary online pivot in higher education,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can cause alterations in the coagulation mechanism conditioning thrombotic phenomena such as acute limb ischemia (ALI) as the only manifestation of the infection. The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru. METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six general hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution, and discharge conditions. RESULTS: Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60 ± 15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93.2% of patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients, and amputation (primary and secondary) was performed in 30% of the patients. The mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation. We report a younger cohort than those described in other studies and with a high frequency of amputations despite adequate surgical treatment.","Sánchez, Juan Bautista; Cuipal Alcalde, Juan Diego; Ramos Isidro, Rossi; Luna, Carlos Zúñiga; Cubas, W Samir; Coaguila Charres, André; Gutiérrez, José Egoávil; Ochoa, Juan David; Arias, Patricia Fernández",Ann. vasc. surg,,262
593093,Response,2015-12-16,"Background Depression is one of the major causes for sick leave and loss of productivity at work. Many studies have investigated return to work (RTW) interventions for people with common mental disorders. However, a paucity of studies has targeted depressive symptoms in the workplace, as well as work productivity. Objectives This study presents preliminary results on a novel group intervention based on cognitive behavioral principles in order to optimize sustainable RTW, by reducing clinical symptoms (anxiety and depression) and improving work productivity. Method This pilot study followed a quasi-experimental design, with participants randomly receiving the group intervention (N = 19) or only receiving usual services (N = 11, control group). The group intervention called Healthy Minds for Sustainable RTW consists of eight sessions based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles and techniques. Outcome measures on depressive and anxiety symptoms and work productivity were administered at baseline (i.e. the start of return-to-work or gradual RTW), as well 2 months later (post-intervention), and at 6-month follow-up. Results The results did not show a time × group interaction for symptoms of depression or anxiety (p = 0.07). Those who received the group intervention however did see a within-group reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms over time, clinically significant for the group intervention only. A significant time × group interaction for work productivity was found, with those in the intervention group improving over time compared to the control condition.

Nevertheless, in Germany, mitigation policies and incidence values vary widely across the federal states (Länder). Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate regional differences in PA during the coronavirus pandemic. This study is based on the SPOVID project (Examining physical activity and sports behavior in the face of COVID-19 pandemic: a social inequality perspective) that incorporates a large-scale, representative cross-sectional survey representing the German population (≥14 years). Based on the survey that took place in October 2020 (N = 1477), we investigated the relationships between the COVID-19 incidence values as well as the mitigation policies across the federal states in Germany and changes in PA. Pearson correlations indicated a strong negative relationship between PA change and 7-day incidence values (r = −0.688 **, p = 0.009) and a moderate negative relationship between PA changes and an index of mitigation policies (r = −0.444, p = 0.112). Higher 7-day incidence values and stricter mitigation policies were associated with a stronger decline in PA levels. Therefore, it is important to support people to stay active even if there are restrictions. In particular, in federal states and regions with high incidences and stricter mitigation policies, measures to promote health-enhancing PA are necessary.","Beck, Franziska; Mutz, Michael; Engels, Eliane Stephanie; Reimers, Anne Kerstin",Sports (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/sports9070102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357936/,262

In addition, training courses, examinations, conferences, and training rotations were postponed or cancelled. Inadvertently, infection control and prevention measures, both within and outside hospitals, have caused a significant negative impact on training. At the same time, they have given space to new technologies, like telemedicine and platforms for webinars, to blossom. While the recovery phase is well underway in some parts of the world, most surgical services are not operating at full capacity. Unfortunately, some countries are still battling a second or third wave of the pandemic with severely negative consequences on surgical services.

611867,Microbial Agents as Putative Inducers of B Cell Lymphoma in Sjögren's Syndrome through an Impaired Epigenetic Control: The State-of-The-Art,2019-01-06,"Abstract Antiviral immunity is initiated upon host recognition of viral products via non-self molecular patterns known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Such recognition initiates signaling cascades that induce intracellular innate immune defenses and an inflammatory response that facilitates development of the acquired immune response. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein family are key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors that are implicated in the recognition of viruses across genera and virus families, including functioning as major sensors of RNA viruses, and promoting recognition of some DNA viruses. RIG-I, the charter member of the RLR family, is activated upon binding to PAMP RNA. Activated RIG-I signals by interacting with the adapter protein MAVS leading to a signaling cascade that activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB. These actions induce the expression of antiviral gene products and the production of type I and III interferons that lead to an antiviral state in the infected cell and surrounding tissue. RIG-I signaling is essential for the control of infection by many RNA viruses. Recently, RIG-I crosstalk with other pathogen recognition receptors and components of the inflammasome has been described. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the role of RIG-I in recognition of a variety of virus families and its role in programming the adaptive immune response through cross-talk with parallel arms of the innate immune system, including how RIG-I can be leveraged for antiviral therapy.","Kell, Alison M.; Gale, Michael",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221500063X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221500063X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25749629/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.017,262

613280,How much worse can variants get?,2021-04-03,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) and Newcastle disease (ND) are two important diseases of poultry and have remained a threat to the development of the poultry industry in many parts of the world. The immunology of avian has been well studied and numerous vaccines have been developed against the two viruses. Most of these vaccines are either inactivated vaccines or live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines induce weak cellular immune responses and require priming with live or other types of vaccines. Advanced technology has been used to produce several types of vaccines that can initiate prime immune responses. However, as a result of rapid genetic variations, the control of these two viral infections through vaccination has remained a challenge. Using various strategies such as combination of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, development of IB/ND vaccines, use of DNA vaccines and transgenic plant vaccines, the problem is being surmounted. It is hoped that with increasing understanding of the immunological mechanisms in birds that are used in fighting these viruses, a more successful control of the diseases will be achieved. This will go a long way in contributing to global food security and the economic development of many developing countries, given the role of poultry in the attainment of these goals.","Ike, Anthony C.; Ononugbo, Chukwuebuka M.; Obi, Okechukwu J.; Onu, Chisom J.; Olovo, Chinasa V.; Muo, Sophia O.; Chukwu, Okoro S.; Reward, Eleazar E.; Omeke, Odinakachukwu P.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406695/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010020,262
613930,Ten simple rules for writing scientific op-ed articles,2020-09-17,"The mechanism underlying sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI), which is an independent risk factor for sepsis-associated death, is unclear. A previous study indicates that during sepsis miR-21a-3p accumulates in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) as the mediator of inflammation and mediates TEC malfunction by manipulating its metabolism. However, the specific mechanism responsible for the accumulation of miR-21a-3p in TECs during sepsis is unrevealed. In this study, a cecal ligation and puncture- (CLP-) induced sepsis rat model and rat TEC line were used to elucidate the mechanism. Firstly, miR-21a-3p and Ago2 levels were found out to increase in both plasma and TECs during sepsis, and the increase of intracellular Ago2 and miR-21a-3p could be mitigated when Ago2 was either inactivated or downregulated in septic plasma. Moreover, membrane Nrp-1 expression of TECs was increased significantly during sepsis and Nrp-1 knockdown also mitigated the rise of both the intracellular Ago2 and miR-21a-3p levels in TECs incubated with septic plasma. Furthermore, it was revealed that Ago2 can be internalized by TECs mediated with Nrp-1 and this process had no effect on the intracellular content of miR-21a-3p. Both Ago2 and miR-21a-3p could bind to TECs derived Nrp-1 directly. Finally, it was determined that miR-21a-3p was internalized by TECs via Nrp-1 and Ago2 facilitated this process. Taken together, it can be concluded from our results that Ago2 binding miR-21a-3p from septic plasma can be actively internalized by TECs via Nrp-1 mediated cell internalization, and this mechanism is crucial for the rise of intracellular miR-21a-3p content of TECs during sepsis. These findings will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying SAKI and aid in developing novel therapeutic strategies.","Zou, Zhiqiang; Lin, Qin; Yang, Huobao; Liu, Zhongwei; Zheng, Shixiang",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923478/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2370253,262

In those studies, RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory tract infections than RV species A and B. In this study we determined the frequency and diversity of RV strains associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI) in Mexico, and describe the clinical characteristics of the illness associated with different RV species. METHODS: A prospective surveillance of 526 and 250 children with URTI and LRTI was carried out. Respiratory samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for viruses. The 5′ untranslated region of the RV genome was amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In the case of URTI, 17.5% were positive for RV, while this virus was found in 24.8% of LRTI. The RV species was determined in 73 children with URTI: 61.6% were RV-A, 37% RV-C and, 1.4% RV-B; and in 43 children with LRTI: 51.2% were RV-A, 41.8% RV-C, and 7% RV-B. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found in patients with RV-A or RV-C infections. A high genetic diversity of RV strains was found in both URTI and LRTI. CONCLUSIONS: Both RV-A and RV-C species were frequently found in hospitalized as well as in outpatient children. This study underlines the high prevalence and genetic diversity of RV strains in Mexico and the potential severity of disease associated with RV-A and RV-C infections.","Aponte, Fernando E; Taboada, Blanca; Espinoza, Marco A; Arias-Ortiz, María A; Monge-Martínez, Jesús; Rodríguez-Vázquez, Rubén; Díaz-Hernández, Fidel; Zárate-Vidal, Fernando; Wong-Chew, Rosa María; Firo-Reyes, Verónica; del Río-Almendárez, Carlos N; Gaitán-Meza, Jesús; Villaseñor-Sierra, Alberto; Martínez-Aguilar, Gerardo; García-Borjas, Maricela; Noyola, Daniel E; Pérez-Gónzalez, Luis F; López, Susana; Santos-Preciado, José I; Arias, Carlos F",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0262-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889995/,262

Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a biomarker of myocardial stress, associated with various respiratory and cardiac outcomes. We hypothesized that pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level would be associated with mortality and clinical outcomes in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using adjusted logistic and linear regression to assess the association of admission pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (analyzed by both cutoff > 125 pg/mL and log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) with clinical outcomes. We additionally treated body mass index, a confounder of both pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes, as an ordinal variable. SETTING: We reviewed hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had a pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level measured within 48 hours of admission between March 1, and August 31, 2020, from a multihospital U.S. health system. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr old; n = 1232) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the health system. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and troponin I level, higher pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was significantly associated with death and secondary outcomes of new heart failure, length of stay, ICU duration, and need for ventilation among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This significance persisted after adjustment for body mass index as an ordinal variable. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for log transformed pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.23–1.97; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is warranted on the utility of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide for clinical prognostication in coronavirus disease 2019 as well as implications of abnormal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in the underlying pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019–related myocardial injury.","Aslam, M.

Differing from other coronavirus (CoV) genera, which mainly infect birds or mammals, deltacoronaviruses (δ‐CoVs) reportedly infect both animal types.

Here, we explored the deep phylogenetic history and cross‐species transmission of δ‐CoVs. Virus–host co‐phylogenetic analyses showed that δ‐CoVs have undergone frequent host switches in birds, and sparrows may serve as the unappreciated hubs for avian to mammal transmission. Our molecular clock analyses show that PDCoV possibly originated in Southeast Asia in the 1990s, and that the PDCoV cluster shares a common ancestor with Sparrow‐CoV of around 1810.

The global diarrhea burden is primarily due to infections secondary to rotavirus, cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella species. Known interventions to effectively treat and prevent diarrhea include vaccines against rotavirus and cholera, zinc supplementation, and therapy with oral rehydration solution. The achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goal requires reductions in mortality from diarrhea, and can only be accomplished by implementing evidence-based strategies.","Bhutta, Z.; Syed, S.",Encyclopedia of Food and Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123849472002233; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123849472002233,262

644323,Ten simple rules for starting (and sustaining) an academic data science initiative,2021-02-18,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures necessary to address it may have major effects on mental health, including on self-harm. We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic. Method Data collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019. Results During the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury. Conclusions A substantial decline in hospital presentations for self-harm occurred during the three months following the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Reasons could include a reduction in self-harm at the community level and individuals avoiding presenting to hospital following self-harm. Longer-term monitoring of self-harm behaviour during the pandemic is essential, together with efforts to encourage help-seeking and the modification of care provision.","Hawton, K.; Casey, D.; Bale, E.; Brand, F.; Ness, J.; Waters, K.; Kelly, S.; Guelayov, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.25.20238030v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238030,262
646377,Response,2021-03-04,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 causes lung parenchymal and endothelial damage that lead to hypoxic acute respiratory failure (hARF). The influence of hARF severity on patients’ outcomes is still poorly understood. DESIGN: Observational, prospective, multicentre study. SETTING: Three academic hospitals in Milan (Italy) involving three respiratory high dependency units and three general wards. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adult hospitalised patients with a virologically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients aged <18 years or unable to provide informed consent were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Anthropometrical, clinical characteristics and blood biomarkers were assessed within the first 24 hours from admission. hARF was graded as follows: severe (partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) <100 mm Hg); moderate (PaO2/FiO2 101–200 mm Hg); mild (PaO2/FiO2 201–300 mm Hg) and normal (PaO2/FiO2 >300 mm Hg). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the assessment of clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality based on the severity of respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were intubation rate and application of continuous positive airway pressure during hospital stay. RESULTS: 412 patients were enrolled (280 males, 68%). Median (IQR) age was 66 (55–76) years with a PaO2/FiO2 at admission of 262 (140–343) mm Hg. 50.2% had a cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of mild, moderate and severe hARF was 24.4%, 21.9% and 15.5%, respectively. In-hospital mortality proportionally increased with increasing impairment of gas exchange (p<0.001). The only independent risk factors for mortality were age ≥65 years (HR 3.41; 95% CI 2.00 to 5.78, p<0.0001), PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤200 mm Hg (HR 3.57; 95% CI 2.20 to 5.77, p<0.0001) and respiratory failure at admission (HR 3.58; 95% CI 1.05 to 12.18, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate-to-severe impairment in PaO2/FiO2 was independently associated with a threefold increase in risk of in-hospital mortality. Severity of respiratory failure is useful to identify patients at higher risk of mortality.

It is especially suited for overcoming viral infections outbreaks, since their effective control relies on an efficient treatment, but also on a fast diagnosis to prevent disease dissemination. The CRISPR toolbox offers DNA‐ and RNA‐targeting nucleases that constitute dual weapons against viruses. They allow both the manipulation of viral and host genomes for therapeutic purposes and the detection of viral nucleic acids in “Point of Care” sensor devices. Here, we thoroughly review recent advances in the use of the CRISPR/Cas system for the treatment and diagnosis of viral deleterious infections such as HIV or SARS‐CoV‐2, examining their strengths and limitations. We describe the main points to consider when designing CRISPR antiviral strategies and the scientific efforts to develop more sensitive CRISPR‐based viral detectors.

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae. We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.","Chan, Andrew T.; Drew, David A.; Nguyen, Long H.; Joshi, Amit D.; Ma, Wenjie; Guo, Chuan-Guo; Lo, Chun-Han; Mehta, Raaj S.; Kwon, Sohee; Sikavi, Daniel R.; Magicheva-Gupta, Marina V.; Fatehi, Zahra S.; Flynn, Jacqueline J.; Leonardo, Brianna M.; Albert, Christine M.; Andreotti, Gabriella; Beane-Freeman, Laura E.; Balasubramanian, Bijal A.; Brownstein, John S.; Bruinsma, Fiona; Cowan, Annie N.; Deka, Anusila; Ernst, Michael E.; Figueiredo, Jane C.; Franks, Paul W.; Gardner, Christopher D.; Ghobrial, Irene M.; Haiman, Christopher A.; Hall, Janet E.; Deming-Halverson, Sandra L.; Kirpach, Brenda; Lacey, James V.; Marchand, Loïc Le; Marinac, Catherine R.; Martinez, Maria Elena; Milne, Roger L.; Murray, Anne M.; Nash, Denis; Palmer, Julie R.; Patel, Alpa V.; Rosenberg, Lynn; Sandler, Dale P.; Sharma, Shreela V.; Schurman, Shepherd H.; Wilkens, Lynne R.; Chavarro, Jorge E.; Eliassen, A.

651917,Ten simple rules for women principal investigators during a pandemic,2020-10-29,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing viral pandemic marked by increased risk of thrombotic events. However, the role of platelets in the elevated observed thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and utility of anti-platelet agents in attenuating thrombosis is unknown. We aimed to determine if human platelets express the known SARS-CoV-2 receptor-protease axis on their cell surface and assess whether the anti-platelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on human platelets were detected by immunoblotting and confirmed by confocal microscopy. We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19. Propensity-matched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID-19. Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID-19. However, both aspirin and NSAID therapies were associated with increased risk of the combined thrombotic endpoint of (MI), (CVA), and (VTE). Thus, while platelets clearly express ACE2-TMPRSS2 receptor-protease axis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, aspirin does not prevent thrombosis and death in COVID-19. The mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19, therefore, appears distinct and the role of platelets as direct mediators of SARS-CoV-2-mediated thrombosis warrants further investigation.","Sahai, Aditya; Bhandari, Rohan; Koupenova, Milka; Freedman, Jane; Godwin, Mathew; McIntyre, Thomas; Chung, Mina; Iskandar, Jean-Pierre; Kamran, Hayaan; Aggarwal, Anu; Kalra, Ankur; Bartholomew, John; McCrae, Keith; Elbadawi, Ayman; Svensson, Lars; Kapadia, Samir; Hariri, Essa; Cameron, Scott",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398263/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-119031/v1,262

Zidovudine (AZT), which is one of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug families of the first line antiretroviral therapy regimen for HIV/AIDS patients, causes anemia due to early long-term of higher-dose therapy. This study was aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of anemia among AZT containing HAART experienced adult HIV/ADIS patients at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital, northwest, Ethiopia, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among a total of 320 adult AZT based HAART experienced HIV/AIDS patients from January 2016 to December 2018. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the patients' charts. All required data for this study were extracted from patients' medical charts. Data were coded, cleared and entered into Epi Info version 3.5.3, and transformed to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of anemia and P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significance. RESULTS: A total of 320 adult AZT based HAART experienced HIV/AIDS patients' charts were assessed. Of the total patients, 198 (61.9%) were females and 133 (41.6%) were within the age range of 35-45 years. More than half, 237(76.9%) of the patients were from the urban area and 186 (58.1%) were on WHO clinical stage III at the baseline. The prevalence of anemia was 50% (95% CI 44.7-55.0%), 44.1% (95% CI 38.4-50.0%), 35.6% (95% CI 30.3-40.6%), 40% (95% CI 34.4-45.6%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.0-46.3) and 39.1% (95% CI 33.4-44.1%) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 30 months of follow-up period, respectively. The overall prevalence of anemia was 41.6%. Anemia had significant association with WHO clinical stage and base line Hgb values. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of participants were anemic in this study. WHO clinical stage and baseline Hgb value were the contributing factors for anemia among these patients. Therefore, anemia needs an immediate intervention on associated factor to improve the anemic status and living condition of HIV patient.","Getaneh, Zegeye; Wale, Worku; Chanie, Belete; Temesgen, Etetetu; Abebe, Metadele; Walie, Melesse; Lemma, Mulualem",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06712-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583644/,262

Spillover events are rare and several factors must align to create the “perfect storm” that would ultimately lead to a spillover. One of these factors is the increased shedding of virus by bats. Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses. Factors leading to an increase in the viral load of persistently infected bats would facilitate shedding of virus.

However, despite its diverse role in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological functions, knowledge about the KKS in vivo remains limited. The short half-lives of kinins, their low abundance and structural similarities and the artificial generation of the kinin bradykinin greatly hinder reliable and accurate determination of kinin levels in plasma. To address these issues, a sensitive LC-MS/MS platform for the comprehensive and simultaneous determination of the four active kinins bradykinin, kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and des-Arg(10)-kallidin and their major metabolites bradykinin 2-9, bradykinin 1-7 and bradykinin 1-5 was developed. This platform was validated according to the bioanalytical guideline of the US Food and Drug Administration regarding linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, carry-over, recovery, parallelism, matrix effects and stability in plasma of healthy volunteers. The validated platform encompassed a broad calibration curve range from 2.0–15.3 pg/mL (depending on the kinin) up to 1000 pg/mL, covering the expected concentrations in disease states. No source-dependent matrix effects were identified, and suitable stability of the analytes in plasma was observed. The applicability of the developed platform was proven by the determination of endogenous levels in healthy volunteers, whose plasma kinin levels were successfully detected in the low pg/mL range. The established platform facilitates the investigation of kinin-mediated diseases (e.g. angioedema, COVID-19) and enables the assessment of the impact of altered enzyme activities on the formation or degradation of kinins.

Early detection of affected patients within the huge population of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort but often hindered by limited testing resources. We aimed to identify predictive risk profiles for a positive PCR result in primary care. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive characteristics over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. We evaluated age, sex, reason for testing, risk factors, symptoms, and expected PCR result for their impact on the test result. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing and were included in this analysis. A fraction of 10.7% (n=40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusion: The reported contact to an infected person is the most important factor for a positive PCR result, independent of any symptoms of illness in the tested patient. Those persons with contact to an infected person should always get a PCR test. If no contact is reported and testing material is scarce, anosmia should increase the likelihood of performing a test, while a sore throat should decrease it.","Just, J.; Puth, M.-T.; Regenold, F.; Weckbecker, K.; Bleckwenn, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081877v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081877,262

Résultats Les résultats préliminaires montrent un taux de séroconversion de 48 % après la 1ère injection (271/567) et de 93,5 % 1 mois après la 2ème injection (485/519) avec des taux médians d’anticorps chez les patients répondeurs de respectivement 226 et 1183 BAU/mL. Les facteurs indépendamment associés à la non-réponse vaccinale après deux injections étaient : cancer actif (OR=3,33 IC95 1,4-7,9), maladie auto-immune (OR=4,4 IC95 1,6-11,9) ou hypogammaglobulinémie (gammaglobulines<7g/L, OR=3,33 IC95 1,52 -7,27). Les facteurs indépendamment associés à une réponse faible (quartile inférieure du taux d’anticorps (<349 BAU/mL)) étaient : âge>70 ans (OR 1,69 IC95 1,03-2,79), lymphopénie (lymphocytes<1G/L, OR 3 IC95 1,83-4,85), hypogammaglobulinémie (OR 4,95 IC95 2,82-8,66), CRP>5mg/L (OR 1,87 IC95 1,16-3,01) ou vaccination par BNT162b2 (OR 5,78 IC95 3,34-10). Conclusion Cette étude multicentrique confirme un taux important de séroconversion au sein d’une population de patients hémodialysés après une vaccination anti-COVID-19. La cinétique de décroissance du taux d’anticorps sera étudiée dans le suivi des patients ainsi que la réponse humorale en cas de 3e injection.","Loheac, C.; Rifaat, M.; Lavainne, F.; Potier, J.; Boulay, H.; Deltombe, C.; Francois, M.; Monge, M.; Querard, A.

675712,In this Issue: Graphical Abstracts,2021,"The synergic combination of D-dimer (as proxy of thrombotic/vascular injury) and static compliance (as proxy of parenchymal injury) in predicting mortality in COVID-19-ARDS has not been systematically evaluated. The objective is to determine whether the combination of elevated D-dimer and low static compliance can predict mortality in patients with COVID-19-ARDS. A “training sample” (March–June 2020) and a “testing sample” (September 2020–January 2021) of adult patients invasively ventilated for COVID-19-ARDS were collected in nine hospitals. D-dimer and compliance in the first 24 h were recorded. Study outcome was all-cause mortality at 28-days. Cut-offs for D-dimer and compliance were identified by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Mutually exclusive groups were selected using classification tree analysis with chi-square automatic interaction detection. Time to death in the resulting groups was estimated with Cox regression adjusted for SOFA, sex, age, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and sample (training/testing). “Training” and “testing” samples amounted to 347 and 296 patients, respectively. Three groups were identified: D-dimer ≤ 1880 ng/mL (LD); D-dimer > 1880 ng/mL and compliance > 41 mL/cmH(2)O (LD-HC); D-dimer > 1880 ng/mL and compliance ≤ 41 mL/cmH(2)O (HD-LC). 28-days mortality progressively increased in the three groups (from 24% to 35% and 57% (training) and from 27% to 39% and 60% (testing), respectively; p < 0.01). Adjusted mortality was significantly higher in HD-LC group compared with LD (HR = 0.479, p < 0.001) and HD-HC (HR = 0.542, p < 0.01); no difference was found between LD and HD-HC. In conclusion, combination of high D-dimer and low static compliance identifies a clinical phenotype with high mortality in COVID-19-ARDS.","Tonetti, Tommaso; Grasselli, Giacomo; Rucci, Paola; Alessandri, Francesco; Dell’Olio, Alessio; Boscolo, Annalisa; Pasin, Laura; Sella, Nicolò; Mega, Chiara; Melotti, Rita Maria; Girardis, Massimo; Busani, Stefano; Bellani, Giacomo; Foti, Giuseppe; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Protti, Alessandro; Langer, Thomas; Mascia, Luciana; Pugliese, Francesco; Cecconi, Maurizio; Fumagalli, Roberto; Nava, Stefano; Antonelli, Massimo; Slutsky, Arthur S.; Navalesi, Paolo; Pesenti, Antonio; Ranieri, Vito Marco",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9091228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572414/,262

684904,First report of isolation of Aeromonas taiwanensis from India,2020-06-23,"The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted both transportation and health systems. While about 40% of Americans have delayed seeking medical care during the pandemic, it remains unclear to what extent transportation is contributing to missed care. To understand the relationship between transportation and unmet health care needs during the pandemic, this paper synthesizes existing knowledge on transportation patterns and barriers across five types of health care needs. While the literature is limited by the absence of detailed data for trips to health care, key themes emerged across populations and settings. We find that some patients, many of whom already experience transportation disadvantage, likely need extra support during the pandemic to overcome new travel barriers related to changes in public transit or the inability to rely on others for rides. Telemedicine is working as a partial substitute for some visits but cannot fulfill all health care needs, especially for vulnerable groups. Structural inequality during the pandemic has likely compounded health care access barriers for low-income individuals and people of color, who face not only disproportionate health risks, but also greater difficulty in transportation access and heightened economic hardship due to COVID-19. Partnerships between health and transportation systems hold promise for jointly addressing disparities in health- and transportation-related challenges but are largely limited to Medicaid-enrolled patients. Our findings suggest that transportation and health care providers should look for additional strategies to ensure that transportation access is not a reason for delayed medical care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Katherine L.; Brozen, Madeline; Rollman, Jeffrey E.; Ward, Tayler; Norris, Keith C.; Gregory, Kimberly D.; Zimmerman, Frederick J.",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100338; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221000452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514368/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221000452,262
688112,"A Miniaturised, Fully Integrated NDIR CO(2) Sensor On-Chip",2021-08-08,"The present study is the first to extract the bioactive metabolites from Olea europaea fruit using the Soxhlet-maceration extraction method. The preliminary phytochemical; Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, and their potential against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through molecular docking were studied. The preliminary qualitative phytochemical analyses showed coumarin glycosides, tannins, terpenoids, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and proteins. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed C-H, C = O, O-H, C-N, C-O-C, C-O, CO-O-CO, C = C, and C-Br functional groups in the extract. GC-MS analysis was done and the compounds detected were docked against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using AutoDock Vina.The squalene (ΔG = -6.2 kcal/mol) posed the best inhibition potential and was comparable with the control drug remdesivir. The compounds possessed excellent pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties and are safe and reliable. Thus, the present research unveiled the valuable metabolites from O. europaea and their antiviral potential against the SARS-CoV-2.","Ragunathan, Venkataraghavan; Chithra, K",Nat Prod Res,https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2021.1983813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581234/,262
