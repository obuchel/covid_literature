23636,Neonatologie,2009-07-29,"We use mathematical models to assess the impact of behavioral changes in response to an emerging epidemic. Evaluating the quantitative and qualitative impact of public health interventions on the spread of infectious diseases is a crucial public health objective. The recent avian influenza (H5N1) outbreaks and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have raised significant global concerns about the emergence of a deadly influenza virus causing a pandemic of catastrophic proportions. Mitigation strategies based on behavior changes are some of the only options available in the early stages of an emerging epidemic when vaccines are unlikely to be available and there are only limited stockpiles of antiviral medications. Mathematical models that capture these behavior changes can quantify the relative impact of different mitigation strategies, such as closing schools, in slowing the spread of an infectious disease. Including behavior changes in mathematical models increases complexity and is often left out of the analysis. We present a simple differential equation model which allows for people changing their behavior to decrease their probability of infection. We also describe a large-scale agent-based model that can be used to analyze the impact of isolation scenarios such as school closures and fear-based home isolation during a pandemic. The agent-based model captures realistic individual-level mixing patterns and coordinated reactive changes in human behavior in order to better predict the transmission dynamics of an epidemic. Both models confirm that changes in behavior can be effective in reducing the spread of disease. For example, our model predicts that if school closures are implemented for the duration of the pandemic, the clinical attack rate could be reduced by more than 50%. We also verify that when interventions are stopped too soon, a second wave of infection can occur.","Valle, Sara Y.

25331,Infektiöse Pneumonien,2007,"Eosinophilic pneumonia may manifest as chronic or transient infiltrates with mild symptoms, chronic idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia, or the frequently severe acute eosinophilic pneumonia that may be secondary to a variety of causes (drug intake, new onset of tobacco smoking, infection) and that may necessitate mechanical ventilation. When present, blood eosinophilia greater than 1 × 10(9) eosinophils/L (and preferably greater than 1.5 × 10(9)/L) is of considerable help for suggesting the diagnosis, however it may be absent, as in the early phase of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia or when patients are already taking corticosteroids. On bronchoalveolar lavage, high eosinophilia (>25 %, and preferably >40 % of differential cell count) is considered diagnostic of eosinophilic pneumonia in a compatible setting, obviating the need of video-assisted thoracic surgical lung biopsy, which is now performed only on very rare occasions with inconsistency between clinical, biological, and imaging features. Inquiry as to drug intake must be meticulous (www.pneumotox.com) and any suspected drug should be withdrawn. Laboratory investigations for parasitic causes must take into account the travel history or residence and the epidemiology of parasites. In patients with associated extrathoracic manifestations, the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or of the hypereosinophilic syndromes should be raised. Presence of airflow obstruction can be found in hypereosinophilic asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or in the recently identified syndrome of hyperosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of symptomatic treatment for eosinophilic pneumonias, with a generally dramatic response. Relapses are common when tapering the doses or after stopping treatment especially in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Cyclophosphamide is necessary only in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and poor-prognostic factors. Imatinib is very effective in the treatment of the myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilic syndromes. Anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies are promising in the spectrum of eosinophilic disorders.","Cottin, Vincent; Cordier, Jean-François",Orphan Lung Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121898/,730

This chapter first explores how science educators have conceptualized macroevolution and how their perspectives align with the views from HPS. Second, it illustrates how science educators’ limited engagement with HPS scholarship on macroevolution has influenced construct delineation, measurement instrument development, and educational arguments about which aspects of macroevolution are most important for students to learn. Third, it discusses how scientific debates about the causal factors responsible for macroevolutionary patterns have been exploited by creationists and have impacted the teaching of evolution. Finally, it emphasizes that the rich perspectives that HPS has to offer on the important topic of macroevolution have yet to be integrated into science education scholarship.","Nehm, Ross H.; Kampourakis, Kostas","International Handbook of Research in History, Philosophy and Science Teaching",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122890/,730

The benchmark code is one of the multi-zone NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB-MZ) called SP-MZ. This “mini-app” mimics the computation and data movement that is found in popular legacy and modern implicit computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Our objective was to examine how efficiently legacy Fortran codes can be ported to accelerators by leveraging OpenMP directives. We describe the development and optimization process and demonstrate the performance impact of various code modifications. We show select profiling results from the NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvpp) to help others diagnose and overcome performance issues in their own applications.

37792,Seite eins,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND: The oropharyngeal colostrum administration protocol to treat premature newborns is a possible and plausible strategy in neonatal health services, since the immunoprotective components of colostrum can be absorbed by the lymphoid tissues of the oropharynx. In this context, this study aims to describe the implementation of oropharyngeal colostrum immunotherapy in very low birth weight preterm newborns in a neonatal unit, as well as to test an algorithm in a public hospital. METHODS: The protocol is applied in a non-randomized, superiority clinical trial with historical control. In the treatment group, 0.2 mL of raw colostrum is dripped into the right and left oropharyngeal mucosa, totaling 8 administrations every 24 h until the 7th complete day of life interruptedly. The control group consists of very low birth weight preterm newborns born in the same hospital in previous years (historical control). The clinical progression of 60 newborns until hospital discharge is recorded on standardized forms. A total of 350 participants are estimated to complete the survey in 4 years. The occurrence of continuous outcomes between the groups are compared through the paired t-test or Wilcoxon’s two-sample test. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and survival analysis are used for binary outcomes. The nutritional status is assessed through Intergrowth-21st growth curves for preterm newborns. DISCUSSION: The flows of the protocol’s actions is sorted by an algorithm, compatible with the Brazilian reality of a public hospital. This measure facilitates and systematizes clinical care, organizes the team’s work process, speeds up the intervention steps, standardizes decision-making and unifies the quality of care, besides showing the feasibility of oropharyngeal colostrum immunotherapy.

39273,Das fiebernde Kind,2019,"BACKGROUND: Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is the prevalent weaning method. Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) is an assisted ventilation mode, which is recently being applied to wean the patients from mechanical ventilation. Whether PAV or PSV is superior for weaning remains unclear. METHODS: Eligible randomized controlled trials published before April 2020 were retrieved from databases. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Seven articles, involving 634 patients, met the selection criteria. Compared to PSV, PAV was associated with a significantly higher rate of weaning success (fixed-effect RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.07–1.26; I(2) = 0.0%; trial sequential analysis-adjusted CI 1.03–1.30), and the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit was crossed. Compared to PSV, PAV was associated with a lower proportion of patients requiring reintubation (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28–0.87; I(2) = 0%), a shorter ICU length of stay (MD − 1.58 (days), 95% CI − 2.68 to − 0.47; I(2) = 0%), and a shorter mechanical ventilation duration (MD − 40.26 (hours); 95% CI − 66.67 to − 13.84; I(2) = 0%). There was no significant difference between PAV and PSV with regard to mortality (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42–1.06; I(2) = 0%) or weaning duration (MD − 0.01 (hours); 95% CI − 1.30–1.28; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSION: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that PAV is superior to PSV in terms of weaning success, and the statistical power is confirmed using trial sequential analysis.

39278,Epilepsie,2019,"Abstract: True thrombocytopenia is uncommon in cats; however, low platelet counts frequently are found using automated cell counters. Although this discrepancy is a well known problem, the prevalence of low automated platelet counts in feline blood samples has not been documented. We retrospectively compared the prevalence of low automated platelet counts with low blood smear‐estimated platelet counts in feline blood samples. Results of blood sample analysis from 359 cats during a 1‐year period at the University of Glasgow Veterinary Haematology Laboratory were examined. Smear estimates of platelet number were done in those cases in which records did not indicate adequate platelet numbers. Platelet counts obtained with an impedance counter (Minos Vet, Abx Hematologie) were <200×10(9) cells/L in 256 samples (71%) and <50×10(9) cells/L in 43 samples (12%). However, based on estimation of platelet numbers from blood smears, only 11 samples (3.1%) had platelet counts of <200×10(9) cells/L and 9 samples (2.5%) had counts of <50×10(9) cells/L. Four cats with thrombocytopenia estimated by blood smear evaluation had clinical signs of a bleeding disorder. Disorders associated with thrombocytopenia included neoplasia, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and infectious diseases. There was no evidence that delay due to mailing of samples was associated with lower automated platelet counts than would have been obtained on the day of sampling. The high prevalence of apparent thrombocytopenia in automated platelet counts was attributed to a combination of platelet aggregation and the impedance method of cell differentiation by size. Vigilance and careful examination of blood smears is required to identify the few cats with true thrombocytopenia.","Norman, Elizabeth J.; Barron, Ronnie C.

39279,Hypertonie,2019,"Foamy viruses (FV) are unusual retroviruses that differ in many aspects of their life cycle from the orthoretroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus. Similar to Mason–Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), FV assemble into capsids intracellularly. The capsids are then transported to a cellular membrane for acquisition of envelope (Env) glycoproteins and budding. However, unlike MPMV, budding of FV is dependent upon the presence of Env. Previous work suggested that FV Env proteins are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where budding takes place. However, very little was known about the details of FV assembly. We have used immunofluorescence and electron microscopy to visualize the intracellular location of FV assembly and budding. We have found that, as in the case of MPMV, FV capsids assemble at a pericentriolar site in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, FV Env is mostly absent from this site and, contrary to expectations, FV capsid structural protein (Gag) is absent from the ER. Gag and Env only co‐localize at the trans‐Golgi network, suggesting that Env–Gag interactions that are required for viral egress from the cell, occurs at this site. Finally, inhibitor studies suggest an important role of microtubule networks for foamy viral assembly and budding.","Yu, Shuyuarn F.; Eastman, Scott W.; Linial, Maxine L.",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7488586/,730
39280,Impfungen,2019,"Unlike nuclear localization signals, there is no obvious consensus sequence for the targeting of proteins to the nucleolus. The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure which is crucial to the normal operation of the eukaryotic cell. Studying nucleolar trafficking signals is problematic as many nucleolar retention signals (NoRSs) are part of classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs). In addition, there is no known consensus signal with which to inform a study. The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Mutagenesis was used to delineate a novel eight amino acid motif that was necessary and sufficient for nucleolar retention of N protein and colocalize with nucleolin and fibrillarin. Additionally, a classical nuclear export signal (NES) functioned to direct N protein to the cytoplasm. Comparison of the coronavirus NoRSs with known cellular and other viral NoRSs revealed that these motifs have conserved arginine residues. Molecular modelling, using the solution structure of severe acute respiratory (SARS) coronavirus N‐protein, revealed that this motif is available for interaction with cellular factors which may mediate nucleolar localization. We hypothesise that the N‐protein uses these signals to traffic to and from the nucleolus and the cytoplasm.","Reed, Mark L.; Dove, Brian K.; Jackson, Richard M.; Collins, Rebecca; Brooks, Gavin; Hiscox, Julian A.",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7488588/,730
39282,"Entwicklung, Entwicklungsstörungen und Risikofaktoren",2019,"Small island states receive unprecedented amounts of the world’s plastic waste. In March 2019, we removed as much plastic litter as possible from Aldabra Atoll, a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site, and estimated the money and effort required to remove the remaining debris. We removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter. We estimate that 513 tonnes (95% CI 212–814) remains on Aldabra, the largest accumulation reported for any single island. We calculate that removing it will cost approximately $4.68 million and require 18,000 person-hours of labour. By weight, the composition is dominated by litter from the regional fishing industry (83%) and flip-flops from further afield (7%). Given the serious detrimental effects of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, we conclude that clean-up efforts are a vital management action for islands like Aldabra, despite the high financial cost and should be integrated alongside policies directed at ‘turning off the tap’. We recommend that international funding be made available for such efforts, especially considering the transboundary nature of both the marine plastic litter problem and the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity-rich islands.","Burt, April J.; Raguain, Jeremy; Sanchez, Cheryl; Brice, Jude; Fleischer-Dogley, Frauke; Goldberg, Rebecca; Talma, Sheena; Syposz, Martyna; Mahony, Josephine; Letori, Jake; Quanz, Christina; Ramkalawan, Sam; Francourt, Craig; Capricieuse, Ivan; Antao, Ash; Belle, Kalsey; Zillhardt, Thomas; Moumou, Jessica; Roseline, Marvin; Bonne, Joel; Marie, Ronny; Constance, Edward; Suleman, Jilani; Turnbull, Lindsay A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7483532/,730

METHODS: Community dwelling adults ages 60 and older completed qualitative individual interviews via Zoom and a 24 item online survey, the Questionnaire for Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 23 participants completed interviews and 25 completed online surveys. Participants were mainly female (72%), white (96%), with a mean age of 71.96 years. Nineteen (76%) participants were very concerned by the pandemic, and only one participant was not at all concerned. Participants frequently reported more interactions with their immediate family. Only five (20%) reported communicating with close friends and family less often than before the pandemic began. Seven (28%) reported communicating with friends and family more often than before and about half (52%) reported that their frequency of communication was “about the same” as pre-pandemic. Twenty-one (84%) participants communicated with others daily or at least several times per week. However, participants reported less face-to-face interaction and increased use of technology, such as virtual happy hours. All participants stayed in touch with others by phone calls (100%). Other often used means of communication were texting (92%), video calls (68%), email (68%), social media (52%), and postal mail (48%). Participants also reported some social gatherings with individuals bringing their own food and social distancing maintained. Despite this, 16 participants (64%) reported feeling isolated from others sometimes or often. CONCLUSIONS: Although many older adults have adjusted their usual behaviors to stay in contact with others during the pandemic, this study found that most still felt isolated. Long-term feelings of isolation and lack of social support may compromise nutrition for this population.

A national health pandemic coupled with public order and restraint imperatives has compounded the levels of stress in policing. In the UK, new working patterns have been negotiated to manage the constraints of a different working environment during COVID-19. Using a self-administered survey, this article explores the experiences of 473 female police officers working during the first lockdown in 2020. The article shows that the COVID-19 preventative measures forced police services to navigate new and varied working patterns for their employees. Previous resistance to flexible working practices in policing was put aside as police services sought to manage the virus in its own ranks as well as policing the public. Preliminary findings suggest that officers working from home were more likely to feel satisfied with management responses compared with those working on the front line, although negative attitudes from colleagues and management towards those working from home were present. Those not working from home reported higher levels of stress related to their Force’s lack of communication with them about their welfare.","Fleming, Jenny; Brown, Jennifer",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195139/,730

In addition to the common macroeconomic factors, we focus on the impact of Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) on the dynamic connectedness patterns between bond yields. To this end, we first examine the full-sample connectedness among the seven bond yields and examine various features of connectedness using a measure recently proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1):57-66, 2012). To examine the determinants of the dynamic connectedness, we use the panel data model to consider the dynamic net connectedness between the considered bond yields as the endogenous variable. Overall, being the transmitter or recipient of spillovers appears to have independent and different influences depending on each of the two types of sovereign bond yields. Also, the findings support the idea that EPU can create an environment likely to exacerbate the transmission of spillover shocks between two-year sovereign bond yields. Conversely, on the whole, EPU does not appear to affect the connectedness of thirty-year sovereign bond yields in various bond markets. The findings also reveal the significant impacts of real output on how shocks across countries manifest in different ways.","Benlagha, Noureddine; Hemrit, Wael",J Econ Finan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195552/,730

METHODS Out of 146 patients who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for treatment of recurrent HCC after percutaneous ultrasound-guided RFA, we selected 23 patients with early diffuse recurrence. Early diffuse recurrence was defined as three or more new recurrent HCCs within 1 year of initial RFA. As a control group, we selected 23 patients, matched exactly for age and sex, in which there was no local tumour progression or new recurrence after RFA. To analyse the risk factors, we examined patient factors and tumour factors. RESULTS Recurrent tumours occurred from 30 to 365 days after RFA (median time, 203 days). Univariate analysis indicated that larger tumour size and poorly defined margin were significant risk factors (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that poorly defined margin was a significant risk factor (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Larger tumour size and poorly defined margin may be risk factors for early diffuse recurrence of HCC within 1 year of RFA. Tumours with such risk factors should be treated with a combination of TACE to minimise the potential for therapeutic failure.","Lee, Hee Young; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Min Woo; Kim, Young-Sun; Choi, Dongil; Park, Min Jung; Kim, Young Kon; Kim, Seong Hyun; Lim, Hyo Keun",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-012-2561-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23085860/,730

In the context of rapidly changing conditions and incomplete data, this article outlines 3 important strategies to improve healthcare workers' respiratory protection. At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields. Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators. Finally, homemade facial coverings do not protect healthcare workers and should be avoided. These strategies, coupled with longer-term strategies of investments in protective equipment research, infrastructure, and data systems, provide a framework to protect healthcare workers immediately and enhance preparedness efforts for future pandemics.","Friese, Christopher R; Veenema, Tener Goodwin; Johnson, James S; Jayaraman, Sundaresan; Chang, James C; Clever, Linda Hawes",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320327/,730

92931,Routine tonsillar bed oversew after diathermy tonsillectomy: does it reduce secondary tonsillar haemorrhage?,2014,"This study investigated whether hospital-adopted health information technology (HIT) is associated with a reduction in the frequency of preventable emergency department (ED) visits for patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). We used data from the 2015 State Emergency Department Databases, Area Health Resources File, and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement. We employed multivariable logistic regression models to examine the variation of the likelihood of having preventable ED visits by hospitals' adoption of HIT functions and adjusted for patient, hospital, and county-level factors. We focused on hospital-HIT functions related to patient engagement, routine integration and availability of electronic clinical information, frequency of hospital reported use of electronic patient information, and the provision of electronic notification to the patient's primary care provider. Approximately 23% of ADRD patients went to a hospital that often used electronic records from outside providers, and 75% of ADRD patients went to a hospital that provided electronic notification to the patient's primary care provider. Regression results showed that hospital reported use of electronic patient health information from outside providers (OR = 0.88; p < 0.001), provision of electronic notification to the patient's primary care physician inside and outside of the system (OR = 0.91; p = 0.013), and hospital-HIT patient engagement functionalities (OR = 0.90; p < 0.001) were associated with significantly lower preventable ED visit rates. The results of our study suggest that certain types of HIT functionalities may be useful for reducing preventable ED visits for ADRD patients.","Wang, Nianyang; Albaroudi, Asmaa; Benjenk, Ivy; Chen, Jie",Preventive medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258173/,730

101524,Airway issues in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.,2013,"Radiation therapy is a standard and effective non-surgical treatment for primary brain tumors and metastases. However, this strategy inevitably results in damage of normal brain tissue, causing severe complications, especially the late-delayed cognitive impairment. Due to the multifactorial and complex pathological effects of radiation, there is a lack of effective preventative and restorative treatments for the irradiated brain. Stem-cell therapy has held considerable promise for decades in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders because of its unique capacity for tissue repair and functional integrity. Currently, there is growing interest in using stem cells as a novel option to attenuate the adverse effects of irradiation. In the present review, we discuss recent studies evaluating stem-cell therapies for the irradiated brain and their therapeutic effects on ameliorating radiation-related brain injury as well as their potential challenges in clinical applications. We discuss these works in context of the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to CNS tissue in an attempt to elucidate the potential mechanisms of engrafted stem cells to reverse radiation-induced degenerative processes.","Chu, Chengyan; Gao, Yue; Lan, Xiaoyan; Lin, Jianwen; Thomas, Aline M; Li, Shen",Stem cell reviews and reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-09984-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418118/,730

METHODS Immunohistochemical study was performed in the kidneys of 37 patients with IgAN and 10 patients with HSPN. Serum and urinary AIM levels in the patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results were compared with clinical features. RESULTS In patients with IgAN and HSPN, AIM expression was observed in various areas, including the glomerular mesangial and capillary areas, the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells, and on infiltrating macrophages in the glomeruli and interstitial areas. Serum and urinary AIM levels were significantly elevated in these patients compared with the HCs. Urinary AIM levels were positively correlated with the histological severity and degree of proteinuria and hematuria as well as urinary β2 microglobulin and urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase levels. CONCLUSIONS AIM plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN. Urinary AIM levels can potentially reflect active renal inflammation in these diseases and may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity. IMPACT Urinary AIM levels may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity of IgAN and HSPN.AIM expression was observed in the glomeruli, tubular epithelial cells, and infiltrating macrophages in glomeruli and interstitial area.U-AIM/Cr were significantly correlated not only with proteinuria, hematuria, and u-β2MG and u-NAG levels but also with the activity index of histological findings in kidney biopsy specimens.Our results can emphasize the important role of AIM in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN.","Irabu, Hitoshi; Shimizu, Masaki; Kaneko, Shuya; Inoue, Natsumi; Mizuta, Mao; Tasaki, Yuko; Ohta, Kazuhide; Yachie, Akihiro; Wada, Taizo",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0951-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408340/,730

In this study we analyzed quantitative host protein alterations in nuclei-enriched fractions from multiple primary human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cells infected by an H1N1 influenza A virus (A/PR/8/34). We first developed an effective detergent-free nuclear lysis method that was coupled with in-solution digestion and LC-MS/MS. Using SILAC, we identified 837 HBAE nuclear proteins in three different donors and compared their responses to infection at 24 h. Some proteins were altered in all three donors, of which 94 were up-regulated and 13 were down-regulated by at least 1.5-fold. Many of these up-regulated proteins clustered into purine biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein modification. Down-regulated proteins were not associated with any specific pathways or processes. These findings further our understanding of cellular processes that are altered in response to influenza in primary epithelial cells and may be beneficial in the search for host proteins that may be targeted for antiviral therapy.","Kroeker, Andrea L; Ezzati, Peyman; Coombs, Kevin M; Halayko, Andrew J",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/pr400464p; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23750822/,730
144248,Tracheostomal stenosis clinical risk factors in patients who have undergone total laryngectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.,2013,"Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and can occur de novo following a surgical procedure. It is associated with increased inpatient and long-term mortality. There is limited evidence concerning new-onset atrial fibrillation following abdominal surgery. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation in the general surgical population. A systematic search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases was conducted. Studies were included in the review if they reported cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation within 30 days of the index operation. Results were evaluated qualitatively due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Incidence rates were pooled using a weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. A total of 835 records were initially identified, from which 32 full texts were retrieved. Following review, 13 studies were included that involved 52,959 patients, of whom 10.94% (95%CI 7.22-15.33) developed atrial fibrillation. Five studies of patients undergoing oesophagectomy (n = 376/1923) had a weighted average rate of 17.66% (95%CI 12.16-21.47), compared with 7.63% (95%CI 4.39-11.98) from eight studies of non-oesophageal surgery (n = 2927/51,036). Identified risk factors included: increasing age; history of cardiac disease; postoperative complications, particularly, sepsis, pneumonia and pleural effusions. New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation is common, and is more frequent after surgery involving the thorax. Future work should focus on stratifying risk to allow targeted prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and other peri-operative complications.","Chebbout, R; Heywood, E G; Drake, T M; Wild, J R L; Lee, J; Wilson, M; Lee, M J",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105078/,730
