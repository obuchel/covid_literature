3260,CEACAM1 promotes CD8(+) T cell responses and improves control of a chronic viral infection,2018-07-02,"Dysfunction of CD8(+) T cells can lead to the development of chronic viral infection. Identifying mechanisms responsible for such T cell dysfunction is therefore of great importance to understand how to prevent persistent viral infection. Here we show using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is fundamental for recruiting lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) into the T cell receptor complex to form an efficient immunological synapse. CEACAM1 is essential for activation of CD8(+) T cells, and the absence of CEACAM1 on virus-specific CD8(+) T cells limits the antiviral CD8(+) T cell response. Treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody stabilizes Lck in the immunological synapse, prevents CD8(+) T cell exhaustion, and improves control of virus infection in vivo. Treatment of human virus-specific CD8(+) T cells with anti-CEACAM1 antibody similarly enhances their proliferation. We conclude that CEACAM1 is an important regulator of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell functions in mice and humans and represents a promising therapeutic target for modulating CD8(+) T cells.","Khairnar, Vishal; Duhan, Vikas; Patil, Ashwini M.; Zhou, Fan; Bhat, Hilal; Thoens, Christine; Sharma, Piyush; Adomati, Tom; Friendrich, Sarah-Kim; Bezgovsek, Judith; Dreesen, Janine D.; Wennemuth, Gunther; Westendorf, Astrid M.; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy; Dittmer, Ulf; Hardt, Cornelia; Timm, Jörg; Göthert, Joachim R.; Lang, Philipp A.; Singer, Bernhard B.; Lang, Karl S.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028648/,538
3976,Techniques to Study Antigen-Specific B Cell Responses,2019-07-24,"Antibodies against foreign antigens are a critical component of the overall immune response and can facilitate pathogen clearance during a primary infection and also protect against subsequent infections. Dysregulation of the antibody response can lead to an autoimmune disease, malignancy, or enhanced infection. Since the experimental delineation of a distinct B cell lineage in 1965, various methods have been developed to understand antigen-specific B cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, infection, and vaccination. In this review, we summarize the established techniques and discuss new and emerging technologies for probing the B cell response in vitro and in vivo by taking advantage of the specificity of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated and secreted antibodies. These include ELISPOT, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy to identify and/or isolate primary antigen-specific B cells. We also present our approach to identify rare antigen-specific B cells using magnetic enrichment followed by flow cytometry. Once these cells are isolated, in vitro proliferation assays and adoptive transfer experiments in mice can be used to further characterize antigen-specific B cell activation, function, and fate. Transgenic mouse models of B cells targeting model antigens and of B cell signaling have also significantly advanced our understanding of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.","Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Taylor, Justin J.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6667631/,538

Treatments were isocaloric milk replacers (12.5% solids) fed at 12% of BW that contained 16.1, 18.5, 22.9, or 25.8% CP (DM basis) from whey protein sources. After a 6-wk feeding period, all calves were slaughtered and the weights and chemical composition of the viscera-free carcasses (VFC; including head, hide, feet, and tail) were determined. Gain of BW (0.38, 0.45, 0.56, and 0.62 kg/d) and gain:feed ratio (0.51, 0.59, 0.71, and 0.78) increased linearly (P < 0.001) as dietary CP increased; rate of change in body length, wither height, and heart girth also increased linearly (P ≤ 0.05). Balance measurements conducted during wk 3 and 4 of the experimental period showed that both absorbed N (16.9, 20.0, 25.8, and 30.6 g/d) and retained N (7.6, 9.0, 13.2, and 15.6 g/d) increased linearly (P < 0.001) as dietary CP increased. Retained N as a percentage of absorbed N increased linearly (P < 0.01) as dietary CP increased (44.3, 44.7, 50.7, and 50.9%), whereas biological value was unaffected (71.1, 68.7, 69.5, and 67.3%; P = 0.26). Digestible energy and ME represented 94.5 and 89.7% of intake energy, respectively, and were not affected by dietary CP content. Plasma urea N concentration increased linearly (2.9, 3.3, 4.6, and 6.0 mg/dL) as dietary CP increased. Contents of water (68.2, 69.1, 70.2, and 70.5%; P < 0.001) and protein (19.6, 20.0, 20.0, and 20.2%; P < 0.10) in VFC increased linearly, whereas contents of fat (7.2, 6.2, 5.5, and 5.2%; P < 0.001) and ash (5.1, 5.2, 4.8, and 4.7%; P < 0.02) decreased linearly as dietary CP increased. Trends in visceral tissue composition were similar to those for VFC. The content of water in VFC tissue gain increased, whereas contents of fat and energy decreased, as dietary CP increased. Final VFC energy and gain of energy in VFC were not affected by dietary CP. At similar initial ME intakes, increasing dietary CP (i.e., increasing protein:energy) linearly increased ADG, gain:feed, N retention, and deposition of lean tissue in VFC, demonstrating that diet composition can markedly affect components of body growth in preruminant dairy calves.","Blome, R.

23844,Genotype-Specific Detection of Ferret Coronavirus by Conventional and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction,2015-09-10,"There are many news articles about events reported on the Web daily, and people are getting more and more used to reading news articles online to know and understand what events happened. For an event, (which may consist of several component events, i.e., episodes), people are often interested in the whole picture of its evolution and development along a time line. This calls for modeling the dependent relationships between component events. Further, people may also be interested in component events which play important roles in the event evolution or development. To satisfy the user needs in finding and understanding the whole picture of an event effectively and efficiently, we formalize in this paper the problem of temporal event search and propose a framework of event relationship analysis for search events based on user queries. We define three kinds of event relationships which are temporal relationship, content dependence relationship, and event reference relationship for identifying to what an extent a component event is dependent on another component event in the evolution of a target event (i.e., query event). Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms a number of baseline methods.","Cai, Yi; Li, Qing; Xie, Haoran; Wang, Tao; Min, Huaqing",Database Systems for Advanced Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119959/,538

35348,Developing approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 in a public hospital,2020-06-01,"Cell cycle transitions are generally triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during Plasmodium male gametogony, this divergent cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of other eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication.","Balestra, Aurélia C; Zeeshan, Mohammad; Rea, Edward; Pasquarello, Carla; Brusini, Lorenzo; Mourier, Tobias; Subudhi, Amit Kumar; Klages, Natacha; Arboit, Patrizia; Pandey, Rajan; Brady, Declan; Vaughan, Sue; Holder, Anthony A; Pain, Arnab; Ferguson, David JP; Hainard, Alexandre; Tewari, Rita; Brochet, Mathieu",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308089/,538

However, there exist lower-dimensional representations that retain the useful information. We present a novel algorithm for such dimensionality reduction called Pathway Activity Score Learning (PASL). The major novelty of PASL is that the constructed features directly correspond to known molecular pathways and can be interpreted as pathway activity scores. Hence, unlike PCA and similar methods, PASL’s latent space has a relatively straight-forward biological interpretation. As a use-case, PASL is applied on two collections of breast cancer and leukemia gene expression datasets. We show that PASL does retain the predictive information for disease classification on new, unseen datasets, as well as outperforming PLIER, a recently proposed competitive method. We also show that differential activation pathway analysis provides complementary information to standard gene set enrichment analysis.

42196,Detection of respiratory viruses in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection(),2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI), which is induced by numerous pathogenic factors, especially sepsis, can generate alveolar damage, pulmonary edema and vascular hyper-permeability ultimately leading to severe hypoxemia. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is an important member of the FGF family associated with endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and injury repairment. Here, we conducted this study aiming to evaluate the therapeutic effect of FGF2 in sepsis-induced ALI. METHODS: Recombinant FGF2 was abdominally injected into septic mice induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and then the inflammatory factors of lung tissue, vascular permeability and lung injury-related indicators based on protein levels and gene expression were detected. In vitro, human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs) were challenged by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with or without FGF2 administration in different groups, and then changes in inflammation indicators and cell permeability ability were tested. RESULTS: The results revealed that FGF2 treatment reduced inflammation response, attenuated pulmonary capillary leakage, alleviated lung injury and improved survival in septic mice. The endothelial injury and macrophages inflammation induced by LPS were inhibited by FGF2 administration via AKT/P38/NF-κB signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated a therapeutic role of FGF2 in ALI through ameliorating capillary leakage and inflammation.","Pan, Xiaojun; Xu, Shunyao; Zhou, Zhen; Wang, Fen; Mao, Lingjie; Li, Hao; Wu, Caixia; Wang, Junfeng; Huang, Yueyue; Li, Dequan; Wang, Cong; Pan, Jingye",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662026/,538

52407,A Case of Possible SARS-COV-2 Induced Beta-Cell Failure,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: In the United Kingdom (UK), 63% of adults are overweight,(1) costing the NHS £6.1 billion/year. With the public using digital technology over healthcare professionals (HCPs) for health advice, this warrants an investigation of technology use in community pharmacy, given its previous successful use.(2) AIM: To determine the feasibility and perceptions of a community pharmacist (CP)-led weight management programme (WMP), enhanced by a Facebook support group (FSG). METHODS: A proof of concept study was conducted between January-March 2020. Recruitment was via a pharmacy, the university and a community Facebook group. Inclusion criteria: over 18 years; overweight; no medical conditions. Participants attended face-to-face meetings (ftf) with a CP and final year pharmacy student (PS) on two occasions (0 (baseline) and 4 weeks). At baseline, participants were given the NHS weight loss programme and set weight loss goals. During ftf, participants had height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) measurements by a CP/PS and discussed eating habits, exercise and alcohol. In between ftf, participants accessed the FSG (created (December 2019) and moderated by a CP). Here, they received posts about diet, exercise and motivation. Participants were to have their measurements taken ftf at 8-weeks, however, COVID-19 meant participants had to self-declare these via video call. Following the 8-week programme, participants completed a 4-section survey about their experience (signing up to the service; comparison to previous weight loss attempts; the FSG and overall perceptions). Question types included multiple choice, Likert scale and free text comments. Data were analysed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation 2016) with changes in height, weight, waist circumference, alcohol and exercise being calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-five participants were recruited. 18 were lost to follow-up, most (n=12/18) citing COVID-19. Of the 37 participants remaining (70.3% female, mean age=37 years), 22 were obese, the rest overweight. Mean weight loss, mean percentage weight loss and mean WC reduction at 4-weeks was 1.6 kg (SD+/- 1.7 kg), 1.8% (SD+/- 1.9%) and 2 cm (SD+/- 1.96 cm) respectively. At week 8 measurements were self-declared. Mean weight loss at 8-weeks from baseline was 2.7 kg (SD +/- 2.6 kg) and mean percentage weight loss was 3% (SD+/- 3%). Only five participants’ self-declared WC measurements at 8-weeks with mean reduction being 3.6 cm. Five participants moved to healthier BMI classifications by week 8. All participants accessed the FSG at least weekly with 13 accessing it daily. Diet posts were the most popular (n=20/37). Participants learned about portion control and increasing fruits/vegetables intake. All participants would recommend the programme to their friends/family. CONCLUSION: An 8-week CPWMP, enhanced with FSG, supported participants to lose a mean of 3% body weight. Participants accessed the page regularly and were positive about its usefulness. One limitation was that the COVID-19 lockdown prevented the 8-week ftf, therefore, self-declared measurements were used. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of pharmacy embracing technology for service delivery, particularly when in-person contact is limited. The implication of this study is that it provides proof that the concept of digital service delivery could work in practice. REFERENCES: 1. GOV.UK.

These oral presentations by experts serve both to describe the current spread of the virus and to justify the measures that need to be taken. This article examines a number of situation reports from both countries with regard to similarities and differences at the linguistic level. In addition to the communicative acts of describing and interpreting the situation, arguing for measures, and giving recommendations and orders, the newly emerging lexis for naming the virus and the masks will be examined. The comparison of German and French text excerpts shows that the two events, which take place in parallel but independently from each other, have numerous similarities. Differences that can be shown concern, in the field of measures and appeals, the diverging political function of the two health institutes, with a rather advisory role of the Robert Koch-Institut compared to the Direction générale de la santé as part of the Ministry of Health and thus as the stronger political decision-maker.","Koch, Christian; Thörle, Britta",Z Literaturwiss Linguistik,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479720/,538

After activation, DCs differentiate into subtypes with different functions, at which point they upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and produce various cytokines and chemokines. Activated DCs also process antigens for presentation to T cells and regulate the differentiation and function of T cells to modulate the immune state of the body. Non-coding RNAs, RNA transcripts that are unable to encode proteins, not only participate in the pathological mechanisms of autoimmune-related diseases but also regulate the function of immune cells in these diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of non-coding RNAs contributes to DC differentiation, functions, and so on, consequently producing effects in various autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarize the main non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs) that regulate DCs in pathological mechanisms and have tremendous potential to give rise to novel therapeutic targets and strategies for multiple autoimmune diseases and immune tolerance-related diseases.","Liu, Yifeng; Wang, Xiaoze; Yang, Fan; Zheng, Yanyi; Ye, Tinghong; Yang, Li",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.678918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394079/,538

Open RPLND is associated with considerable morbidity, but technical difficulty of postchemotherapy laparoscopic RPLND (L-RPLND) can be significant; therefore, literature concerning pc L-RPLND is sparse. OBJECTIVE To evaluate feasibility and long-term oncologic outcome of postchemotherapy L-RPLND for clinical stage II disease at a single institution. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Records of patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor who underwent postchemotherapy L-RPLND between 1993 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Unilateral template resection was used until a bilateral nerve-sparing approach was introduced in 2004. Follow-up investigations were performed at 3-mo intervals for the first 3 yr, every 6 mo for the next 2 yr, and annually thereafter. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS This was a descriptive analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The study cohort comprised 100 patients with stage II retroperitoneal disease (stage IIC: n=16; IIB: n=68; IIA with persisting tumor marker: n=16). Mean diameter of retroperitoneal masses before and after chemotherapy was 3.5 cm and 1.4 cm, respectively. Unilateral and bilateral templates were resected in 71 and 29 patients, respectively. Surgery was successfully completed in all but one patient, whose procedure was converted to open surgery due to bleeding. Mean operation time for unilateral and bilateral resection was 241 and 343 min, respectively. Mean blood loss was 84 ml. Postoperative complications were a large lymphocele in one patient and chylous ascites in another. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.9 d. L-RPLND specimens showed teratoma in 38 patients and active tumor in 2 patients. During a mean follow-up of 74 mo, one patient recurred. No recurrence was observed inside the applied surgical field. No patient died of tumor progression. After bilateral nerve-sparing postchemotherapy L-RPLND, 95.2% of patients reported antegrade ejaculation. CONCLUSIONS Postchemotherapy L-RPLND performed by experienced hands is feasible and associated with low morbidity and high oncologic efficacy.","Steiner, Hannes; Leonhartsberger, Nicolai; Stoehr, Brigitte; Peschel, Reinhard; Pichler, Renate",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.09.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021090/,538

64408,The Expert Next Door: A Commentary on Interactions with Friends and Family During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,2021-10-07,"Acne Vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic disorders affects people of all races and ethnicities and has many adverse effects on the quality of life. The increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics has reduced the effectiveness of treatment with these agents. There is an increasing focus on the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of acne. This study investigates the effect of N-acetylcysteine as an antioxidant in the treatment of acne vulgaris. This systematic review was conducted through a search in databases such as Science Direct, PubMed, Scielo and Medline using keywords including acne vulgaris, anti and N-acetylcysteine, and all the keywords associated with each of the subtitles. The factors affecting the occurrence and expansion of acne include increased sebum synthesis, hyperkeratinization of pilosebaceous units, colonization with Propionibacterium acnes, and increased release of inflammatory mediators and ROS. Studies have shown that glutathione stimulation following the administration of NAC increases glutathione levels for the detoxification of oxygen free radicals. Moreover, NAC prevents the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, MP9, and IL-1β and has shown antibacterial activities against important bacteria including E.coli, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. This medication has anti-proliferative effects and is also used for excoriation and PCOD. The results of the present study showed the beneficial effects of using N-acetylcysteine in patients with acne vulgaris in terms of the disease complications and comorbidities. Given its diverse functional mechanisms, this medication can be used to treat acne and its consequences. This article is protected by copyright.

(Shull's colpopexy) in 2000, is one of the most frequently performed non-mesh pelvic floor reconstructive surgical procedures. Despite its excellent anatomical outcomes, ureteral injury and difficulty in uterosacral ligament detection (especially in patients with severe POP) are typical issues with this procedure. METHOD This video demonstrates the procedure in a 58-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, with POP-Q stage II uterine prolapse and stage I cystocele. At the beginning of the operation, the bilateral uterosacral ligaments were confirmed and separated from the ureters after entering the retroperitoneal space. The inferior hypogastric nerve and pelvic nerve plexus were also separated from the uterosacral ligament. After total laparoscopic hysterectomy, three ipsilateral delayed absorbable monofilament sutures were placed between the uterosacral ligament and the vaginal cuff. Retroperitonealization was then performed using a continuous suture with closure of the Douglas pouch. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic Shull's colpopexy for POP is a secure procedure with the advantages of laparoscopy (magnification and sharing the operative field). This may become one of the most useful operations for apical support as native tissue repair.","Nishimura, Kazuaki; Yoshimura, Kazuaki; Hoshino, Kaori; Hachisuga, Toru",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-016-3137-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27614758/,538

RECENT FINDINGS Cortical volume, white matter volume and integrity, and structural connectivity across many grey and white matter regions have been shown to vary with level of awareness in brain-injured patients. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) within and between canonical cortical networks also correlate with DoC patients' level of awareness. Stimulus-based and motor-imagery fMRI paradigms have identified some behaviorally unresponsive DoC patients with cortical processing and activation patterns that mirror healthy controls. Emerging techniques like dynamic rs-FC have begun to identify temporal trends in brain-wide connectivity that may represent novel neural correlates of consciousness. SUMMARY Structural and functional MRI will continue to advance our understanding of brain regions supporting human consciousness. Measures of regional and global white matter integrity and rs-FC in particular networks have shown significant improvement over clinical features in identifying acute and chronic DoC patients likely to recover awareness. As they are refined, functional MRI paradigms may additionally provide opportunities for interacting with behaviorally unresponsive patients.","Snider, Samuel B; Edlow, Brian L",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044234/,538

In this review, we describe the most recent published innovations in neonatal telehealth, spanning the neonatal ICU (NICU), community/rural hospitals and the patient's home. RECENT FINDINGS Telemedicine for neonatal subspecialty care has continued to expand, from well established uses in retinopathy of prematurity screening and tele-echocardiography, to applications in genetics and neurology. Within the NICU itself, neonatologist-led remote rounding has been shown to be a feasible method of increasing access to expert care for neonates in rural hospitals. Telehealth has improved parental and caregiver education, eased the NICU-to-home transition experience and expanded access to lactation services for rural mothers. Telemedicine-assisted neonatal resuscitation has improved the quality of resuscitation and reduced unnecessary neonatal transports to higher levels of care. Finally, the global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the expansion of neonatal telehealth. SUMMARY Telehealth provides increased access to expert neonatal care and improves patient outcomes, while reducing the cost of care for neonates in diverse settings.

It aims also to examine the various factors that have led to the unequal distribution of the confirmed cases among the different MENA countries. METHODOLOGY Data was retrieved from the World Health Organization situation reports issued between January 29 and June 5, 2020. It included the numbers of cumulative cases, new cases, and cumulative deaths reported by MENA countries. Similarly, we searched for relevant articles in PubMed and Medline. RESULTS A total of 481,347 cases and 11,851 deaths occurred in the MENA region, accounting for 7.37% and 3.06% of the global cases and deaths respectively. Iran had the highest number of cases and deaths accounting for 34.1% and 68.1% of the MENA cases and deaths respectively. Together the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries accounted for 52.2% and 10.6% of MENA cases and deaths respectively. Egypt had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths among the African countries of the region. Syria, Libya and Yemen (countries at war) had the lowest numbers of reported cases. The MENA region overall case fatality rate (CFR) was estimated at 2.46%. The highest CFR (22.75%) occurred in Yemen, and the lowest (0.07%) in Qatar. CONCLUSIONS The unequal distribution of wealth among the MENA countries, the lack of sociopolitical stability, and the high number of undetected and underreported cases in some of them have resulted in varied incidences of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.","Younis, Nour K; Rahm, Mira; Bitar, Fadi; Arabi, Mariam",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839707/,538
77440,Comparing two sample pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for efficient screening of COVID-19.,2020-10-27,"Immune cells play essential roles in metabolic homeostasis and thus, undergo analogous changes in normal physiology (e.g., puberty and pregnancy) and in various metabolic and immune diseases. An essential component of this close relationship between the two is sex differences. Many autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous and multiple sclerosis, feature strikingly increased prevalence in females, whereas in contrast, infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, affect more men than women. Therefore, there are fundamental aspects of metabolic homeostasis and immune functions that are regulated differently in males and females. This can be observed in sex hormone-immune interaction where androgens, such as testosterone, have shown immunosuppressive effects whilst estrogen is on the opposite side of the spectrum with immunoenhancing facilitation of mechanisms. In addition, the two sexes exhibit significant differences in metabolic regulation, with estrous cycles in females known to induce variability in traits and more pronounced metabolic disease phenotype exhibited by males. It is likely that these differences underlie both the development of metabolic and autoimmune diseases and the response to current treatment options. Sexual dimorphism in immunometabolism has emerged to become an area of intense research, aiming to uncover sex-biased effector molecules in the various metabolic tissues and immune cell types, identify sex-biased cell-type-specific functions of common effector molecules, and understand whether the sex differences in metabolic and immune functions influence each other during autoimmune pathogenesis. In this review, we will summarize recent findings that address these critical questions of sexual dimorphism in immunometabolism as well as their translational implications for the clinical management of autoimmune diseases.","Manuel, Robbie S J; Liang, Yun",Autoimmunity reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2021.102775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609790/,538

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.","Sheikh, Aziz; Anderson, Michael; Albala, Sarah; Casadei, Barbara; Franklin, Bryony Dean; Richards, Mike; Taylor, David; Tibble, Holly; Mossialos, Elias",The Lancet.

The median follow-up period was 40.6 months. Of 490 patients, 8 (1.63%) developed DH at a mean interval after TLTG of 7.3 (range, 3.4 to 12.8) months. All 8 patients were from the functional group, and presented with abdominal pain or vomiting. They were managed with emergency surgery (5 laparoscopic hernia reduction, 3 open hernia reduction). The grade of complication according to Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) was CDC-III in 7 cases and CDC-IV in 1 case. There was no death associated with DH complications. None of the patients in the overlap group developed DH. The incidence of DH after TLTG is negligible in the overlap method.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with right sided liver malignancies scheduled for extensive surgery and receiving induction of liver hypertrophy via right portal vein embolization/ligature between 2010-2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Treatments included were ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx®, EVOH-PVE), ethiodized oil (Lipiodol®, Lipiodol/PVA-PVE), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-PVE) or surgical ligature (PVL). Liver segments S2/3 were used to assess hypertrophy. Primary outcome was future liver remnant growth in ml/day. RESULTS Forty-one patients were included (EVOH-PVE n = 11; Lipiodol/PVA-PVE n = 10; PVA-PVE n = 8; PVL n = 12), the majority presenting with cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal metastases (n = 11; n = 27). Pre-interventional liver volumes were comparable (p = .095). Liver hypertrophy was successfully induced in all but one patient receiving Lipiodol/PVA-PVE. Liver segment S2/3 growth was largest for EVOH-PVE (5.38 ml/d) followed by PVA-PVE (2.5 ml/d), with significantly higher growth rates than PVL (1.24 ml/d; p < .001; p = .007). No significant difference was evident for Lipiodol/PVA-PVE (1.43 ml/d, p = .809). CONCLUSIONS Portal vein embolization using EVOH demonstrates fastest S2/3 growth rates compared to other embolic agents and PVL, potentially due to its permanent portal vein embolization and induction of hepatic inflammation.","Biggemann, Lorenz; Uhlig, Johannes; Streit, Ulrike; Sack, Henrik; Guo, Xiao Chao; Jung, Carlo; Ahmed, Saheeb; Lotz, Joachim; Müller-Wille, Rene; Seif Amir Hosseini, Ali",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2019.1582067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821547/,538

The secondary objective is to investigate factors that affect QTc prolongation. METHODS SLE patients who had electrocardiograms between 2015 and 2020 were recruited and assigned to two groups based on whether they were treated with HCQ (HCQ group) or not (control group). Change of QTc before and after HCQ administration in the HCQ group was measured and compared with the control group. Patients treated with HCQ were further divided into two groups based on presence or absence of QTc prolongation and the characteristics were compared. RESULTS In total, 126 patients were recruited, of whom 42 were treated with HCQ. In the HCQ group, the mean QTc significantly increased (P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference of mean QTc in the control group. Moreover, those in the HCQ group with QTc prolongation showed a significantly higher proportion of hypertension and longer SLE duration compared to those without QTc prolongation. However, the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that there were no significant differences among them. CONCLUSION HCQ could induce QTc prolongation in SLE patients. It might be better that the possibility of QTc prolongation was taken into consideration when HCQ was administered in the patients with longer disease duration of SLE and coincidence of hypertension.","Nishiyama, Taihei; Kondo, Yuya; Tsuboi, Hiroto; Noma, Hisashi; Tabuchi, Daiki; Sugita, Toshiki; Okamoto, Shota; Terasaki, Toshihiko; Shimizu, Masaru; Honda, Fumika; Ohyama, Ayako; Kurata, Izumi; Yagishita, Mizuki; Abe, Saori; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Osada, Atsumu; Hagiwara, Shinya; Matsumoto, Isao; Sumida, Takayuki",Modern rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14397595.2021.1879368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496215/,538
86677,Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2/COVID19.,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Older adults have worse outcomes after sepsis than young adults. Additionally, alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated to contribute to sepsis-related mortality. We sought to determine if there were alterations in the gut microbiota with a novel sepsis model in old adult mice, which enter a state of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism (PICS), as compared to young adult mice, which recover with the sepsis model. METHODS Mixed sex old (∼20 mo) and young (∼4 mo) C57Bl/6J mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture with daily chronic stress (CLP+DCS) and were compared to naive age-matched controls. Mice were sacrificed at CLP+DCS day 7 and feces collected for bacterial DNA isolation. The V3-V4 hypervariable region was amplified, 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed, and cohorts compared. α-Diversity was assessed using Chao1 and Shannon indices using rarefied counts, and β-diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. RESULTS Naïve old adult mice had significantly different α and β-diversity compared to naïve adult young adult mice. After CLP+DCS, there was a significant shift in the α and β-diversity (FDR = 0.03 for both) of old adult mice (naïve vs. CLP+DCS). However, no significant shift was displayed in the microbiota of young mice that underwent CLP+DCS in regards to α-diversity (FDR = 0.052) and β-diversity (FDR = 0.12), demonstrating a greater overall stability of their microbiota at 7 days despite the septic insult. The taxonomic changes in old mice undergoing CLP+DCS were dominated by decreased abundance of the order Clostridiales and genera Oscillospira. CONCLUSION Young adult mice maintain an overall microbiome stability 7 days after CLP+DCS after compared to old adult mice. The lack of microbiome stability could contribute to PICS and worse long-term outcomes in older adult sepsis survivors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanistic pathways and potential therapeutics.","Mankowski, Robert T; Thomas, Ryan M; Darden, Dijoia B; Gharaibeh, Raad Z; Hawkins, Russell B; Cox, Michael C; Apple, Camille; Nacionales, Dina C; Ungaro, Ricardo F; Dirain, Marvin L; Moore, Fredrick A; Leeuwenburgh, Christiaan; Brakenridge, Scott C; Clanton, Thomas L; Laitano, Orlando; Moldawer, Lyle L; Mohr, Alicia M; Efron, Philip A",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826817/,538

This study investigated the initial and midterm clinical and angiographic results of LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Eighty patients with 80 wide-neck intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Eleven patients (13.8%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were treated with LEO Baby stent-assisted coiling. Technical success and immediate postprocedural clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated. Seventy-three patients attended angiographic and clinical follow-up for a mean duration of 7.2 ± 3.8 months. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. Preprocedural and follow-up clinical statuses were assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS The technical success rate of the procedure was 97.5%. The immediate postprocedural angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the aneurysm in 75% of the 80 patients. The last follow-up angiograms showed complete occlusion in 85.7% of the 77 patients with an angiographic follow-up. Of the 77 patients with a follow-up angiography, 6.5% showed an increase in the filling status of the aneurysm and 5.2% required retreatment.

It is unclear how widely this practice has been adopted amongst pediatric gastroenterology providers. This study determines the frequency of repeat endoscopy in pediatric IBD and evaluates for predictive baseline characteristics of providers. METHODS We developed a cross-sectional survey which was distributed via three national email listservs to pediatric gastroenterology providers. We obtained baseline characteristics of respondents and assessed motivations and barriers for the practice of repeat endoscopy compared to none. RESULTS 238 unique respondents completed the online survey. Response rate was 11% (238 of 2300 possible participants). The majority practice in an academic setting (77%) and reported participation in ImproveCareNow (63%). Overall, 65% of respondents perform repeat endoscopy to assess for endoscopic remission in pediatric IBD as part of routine clinical practice. 56% reported repeat endoscopy as individuals in the absence of a departmental protocol. ""Symptoms are not sufficient to follow IBD patients"" was reported by 82% of those who repeat endoscopy; conversely, ""I perform endoscopy based on clinical, biomarker, and/or imaging trends"" was reported by 81% of those who do not repeat endoscopy. The establishment of a pediatric-specific guideline was most commonly reported to change current practice, based on rank-order scoring. CONCLUSION A majority of representative providers repeat endoscopy to assess for endoscopic remission in pediatric IBD. Fewer years in practice favored repeating endoscopy. The need for North American pediatric guidelines with pediatric-specific evidence to support the long term benefits of endoscopic remission are highlighted in this study.","Moses, Jonathan; Sandberg, Kelly; Winberry, Gabriel; Riera, Diana; DeLozier, Sarah; Gupta, Sandeep K; Reilly, Norelle; Park, K T; Picoraro, Joseph",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000003100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633082/,538
89171,SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis.,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases are essential to facilitate disease diagnosis. Application of proteomics has greatly hastened the search for novel biomarkers. In this study, new potential biomarkers were discovered, and a diagnostic pattern was established for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) by using proteomic technology. METHODS Serum proteins from PD patients and controls were captured by magnetic bead-based weak cation exchange. The molecular weight of the proteins in bead-binding fraction was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Biomarker Wizard 3.1 and Biomarker Patterns Software were used for data analysis and constructing a model of biomarkers. A blinded testing set was used to validate the model. RESULTS A total of 17 discriminating m/z peaks related to PD were identified. The model based on the 5 biomarkers generated an excellent separation between PD and healthy controls with 98.36% for the sensitivity and 83.05% for the specificity. Blind test data demonstrated the model could recognize patients with PD with a sensitivity of 85.0% and a specificity of 70.0%. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary data suggested a potential application of MALDI-TOF-MS combined with magnetic beads. The model comprising 5 promising biomarkers can differentiate individuals with PD and the healthy subjects precisely.","Li, Yao-Hua; Wang, Jian; Zheng, Xiao-Li; Zhang, Yan-Li; Li, Xin; Yu, Shun; He, Xin; Chan, Piu",European neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000323427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21273779/,538

We evaluated the effect of Solitaire Platinum 4×40 mm stent retriever in Solumbra technique thrombectomy, and compared it with shorter Solitaire stent retrievers. Methods A total of 70 patients who underwent Solumbra technique thrombectomy with equal diameter (4 mm) and different length (40 vs. 20 mm) Solitaire stent retrievers were divided into two groups : the Solitaire Platinum 4×40 mm stent (4×40) group and the Solitaire FR 4×20 mm stent or Solitaire Platinum 4×20 mm stent (4×20) group. The clinical outcomes, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score, the first pass reperfusion status, and complications were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive factors for reperfusion and complete reperfusion from the first pass. Results Higher first-pass reperfusion and complete reperfusion were achieved in the 4×40 group (68.0% and 48.0%) than in the 4×20 group (46.7% and 33.3%; p=0.004 and 0.007, respectively). In multivariate analysis, radiopaque device and longer stent retriever were correlated with first-pass reperfusion (p=0.014 and 0.008, respectively) and first-pass complete reperfusion (p=0.022 and 0.012, respectively). Conclusion Our study demonstrated the usefulness of the Solitaire Platinum 4×40 mm stent retriever, which led to higher firstpass reperfusion and complete reperfusion rates than the Solitaire FR 4×20 mm stent or the Solitaire Platinum 4×20 mm stent, especially in Solumbra technique thrombectomy.","Yi, Ho Jun; Sung, Jae Hoon; Lee, Dong Hoon; Song, Seung Yoon",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2020.0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759627/,538
91088,Acute Onset of Bilateral Follicular Conjunctivitis in two Patients with Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infections.,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND Cirrhosis is a rapidly increasing cause of global mortality. To improve cirrhosis care, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed the Hepatic Innovation Team (HIT) Collaborative to support VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) to deliver evidence-based cirrhosis care. This randomized HIT program evaluation aims to develop and assess a novel approach for choosing and applying implementation strategies to improve the quality of cirrhosis care. METHODS Evaluation aims are to (1) empirically determine which combinations of implementation strategies are associated with successful implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for Veterans with cirrhosis, (2) manualize these ""data-driven"" implementation strategies, and (3) assess the effectiveness of data-driven implementation strategies in increasing cirrhosis EBP uptake. Aim 1 will include an online survey of all VAMCs' use of 73 implementations strategies to improve cirrhosis care, as defined by the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change taxonomy. Traditional statistical as well as configurational comparative methods will both be employed to determine which combinations of implementation strategies are associated with site-level adherence to EBPs for cirrhosis. In aim 2, semi-structured interviews with high-performing VAMCs will be conducted to operationalize successful implementation strategies for cirrhosis care. These data will be used to inform the creation of a step-by-step guide to tailoring and applying the implementation strategies identified in aim 1. In aim 3, this manualized implementation intervention will be assessed using a hybrid type III stepped-wedge cluster randomized design. This evaluation will be conducted in 12 VAMCs, with four VAMCs crossing from control to intervention every 6 months, in order to assess the effectiveness of using data-driven implementation strategies to improve guideline-concordant cirrhosis care. DISCUSSION Successful completion of this innovative evaluation will establish the feasibility of using early evaluation data to inform a manualized, user-friendly implementation intervention for VAMCs with opportunities to improve care. This evaluation will provide implementation support tools that can be applied to enhance the implementation of other evidence-based practices.

This systematic literature review aims to answer the following question: what evidence of effect is available in the literature about models for teaching narrative medicine? METHODS We conducted a narrative review of 36 articles and used the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) Global Scale and Kirkpatrick Scale for strength and importance of evidence to categorize reported assessment strategies and to evaluate the effectiveness of their narrative medicine programs. RESULTS We found evidence that narrative medicine is an effective pedagogic tool with a clear and replicable structure and methodology. We also determined that a positive impact could be measured when pertaining to participation and modification of attitudes, knowledge, and skills. However, unequivocal evidence of the effect of narrative medicine on students' behavior or ongoing interaction with colleagues and patients is still lacking. CONCLUSION While many recent publications describe the goals and virtues of a narrative-based approach, more research is needed to determine whether or not there is an ideological consensus undergirding this approach. In addition, it is still unclear whether the long-term impact of narrative medicine classroom interventions are felt by patients, or whether such interventions positively impact patient care.","Milota, M M; van Thiel, G J M W; van Delden, J J M",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2019.1584274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983460/,538
93168,The Missing Piece - SARS-CoV-2 Testing and School Reopening.,2020-10-21,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW With the aging population of kidney transplant candidates, a history of malignancy is an increasingly prevalent finding. Tumors can constitute a contraindication for transplantation or can lead to a delay of acceptance to the waiting-list. Current waiting time guidelines mainly refer to early data collected nearly 30 years ago, when the knowledge on tumors was, by current standards, still limited. RECENT FINDINGS Today, cancers can usually be divided into many different biological subtypes, according to histological and molecular subclassification and the availability of genetic testing. A more precise stratification and targeted antitumor therapies have led to better therapy outcomes or even cures from certain malignancies and to a better appreciation of tumor risks for the patient. SUMMARY Even though transplant patients do have an increased risk for malignancies, it is often overlooked that patients, while on dialysis, are equally prone to develop a tumor. Competing risks (e.g. cardiovascular, mortality risks) through prolonged time on dialysis have to be equally considered, when the decision for acceptance of a patient to the waiting-list is made. Current waiting time suggestions should be critically reconsidered for every patient after a thorough discussion with an oncologist, including new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, as well as novel risk stratifications.","Bojic, Marija; Watschinger, Clara; Reiter, Thomas; Watschinger, Bruno",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnh.0000000000000652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941190/,538

Medication adherence among seniors with chronic diseases has been suboptimal with the estimation that only half of those taking antihypertensives are adherent. Therefore, the purpose of The Managing Your Medications (MY Rx) program was to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence-based practices used to improve rates of medication adherence through information dissemination among diabetic and hypertensive African American, Asian American, and Hispanic residents housed in senior public housing facilities in the Greater Houston Area. The program comprised an 8-week intervention with individual and group components with small incentives provided throughout the program. Individual components included one home visit and telephone consultations conducted by pharmacists. Health educators provided two group education sessions on lifestyle modifications. Result Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions revealed participant satisfaction with the MY Rx program and willingness to change after participation in the program. Conclusion The Rx program showed the potential effectiveness of an innovative strategy in medication counseling using interdisciplinary pharmacists and health educators to promote health. It demonstrated the importance of using the patient-centered care framework in designing a community intervention program.","Pounds, Kimberly; Guinn, Dominique; Poon, Ivy O; Moultry, Aisha Morris",Archives of community medicine and public health,https://doi.org/10.17352/2455-5479.000115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829117/,538

METHODS To analyze initial and long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS Our analysis included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71%) were male and 28 (34%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74 patients (89%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81%) with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25%) of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of 14 (21%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97% of antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster decay of IgG antispike antibodies. CONCLUSIONS This study characterizes evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients on hemodialysis and identifies factors that are associated with lack of seroconversion and with IgG titer decay.","Sakhi, Hamza; Dahmane, Djamal; Attias, Philippe; Kofman, Thomas; Bouvier, Magali; Lapidus, Nathanael; Fourati, Slim; El Karoui, Khalil",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020111618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637518/,538
97188,Sampling Methods and Risk Stratification Regarding Environmental Contamination by SARS-CoV-2.,2021-05-20,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are the focus of increasing interest for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) prevention and treatment. Although several bNAbs are already under clinical evaluation, the development of antibodies with even greater potency and breadth remains a priority. Recently, we reported a novel strategy for improving bNAbs against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 by engraftment of the elongated framework region 3 (FR3) from VRC03, which confers the ability to establish quaternary interactions with a second gp120 protomer. Here, we applied this strategy to a new series of anti-CD4bs bNAbs (N49 lineage) that already possess high potency and breadth. The resultant chimeric antibodies bind the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer with a higher affinity than their parental forms. Likewise, their neutralizing capacity against a global panel of HIV-1 Envs is also increased. The introduction of additional modifications further improved the neutralization potency. We also tried engrafting the elongated CDR1 of the heavy chain (CDRH1) from bNAb 1-18, another highly potent quaternary-binding antibody, onto several VRC01-class bNAbs, but none of them was improved. These findings point to the highly selective requirements for the establishment of quaternary contact with the HIV-1 Env trimer. The improved anti-CD4bs antibodies reported herein may provide a helpful complement to current antibody-based protocols for the therapy and prevention of HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCEMonoclonal antibodies represent one of the most important recent innovations in the fight against infectious diseases. Although potent antibodies can be cloned from infected individuals, various strategies can be employed to improve their activity or pharmacological features. Here, we improved a lineage of very potent antibodies that target the receptor-binding site of HIV-1 by engineering chimeric molecules containing a fragment from a different monoclonal antibody. These engineered antibodies are promising candidates for development of therapeutic or preventive approaches against HIV/AIDS.","Liu, Qingbo; Zhang, Peng; Miao, Huiyi; Lin, Yin; Kwon, Young Do; Kwong, Peter D; Rikhtegaran-Tehrani, Zahra; Seaman, Michael S; DeVico, Anthony L; Sajadi, Mohammad Mohseni; Lusso, Paolo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00159-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827946/,538
97259,The Role of Scientific Publishing in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,2020-05-04,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has proven to be the ultimate tool for bacterial isolate characterization and relatedness determination. However, standardized and harmonized workflows, e.g. for DNA extraction, are required to ensure robust and exchangeable WGS data. Data sharing between (inter)national laboratories is essential to support foodborne pathogen control, including outbreak investigation. This study evaluated eight commercial DNA preparation kits for their potential influence on: (i) DNA quality for Nextera XT library preparation; (ii) MiSeq sequencing (data quality, read mapping against plasmid and chromosome references); and (iii) WGS data analysis, i.e. isolate characterization (serotyping, virulence and antimicrobial resistance genotyping) and phylogenetic relatedness (core genome multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis). Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was selected as a case study. Overall, data quality and inferred phylogenetic relationships between isolates were not affected by the DNA extraction kit choice, irrespective of the presence of confounding factors such as EDTA in DNA solution buffers. Nevertheless, completeness of STEC characterization was, although not substantially, influenced by the plasmid extraction performance of the kits, especially when using Nextera XT library preparation. This study contributes to addressing the WGS challenges of standardizing protocols to support data portability and to enable full exploitation of its potential.","Nouws, Stéphanie; Bogaerts, Bert; Verhaegen, Bavo; Denayer, Sarah; Piérard, Denis; Marchal, Kathleen; Roosens, Nancy H C; Vanneste, Kevin; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71207-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887913/,538

99060,Comparison of Feeding Jejunostomy via Gastric Tube Versus Jejunum After Esophageal Cancer Surgery.,2018,"BACKGROUND In 2020, primary care practices adopted telemedicine as an alternative to in-person visits. Little is known about whether access to telemedicine was equitable, especially among older patients. Our objectives were to (1) examine older adults' use of telemedicine versus in-person primary care visits; and (2) compare hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) between the groups. METHODS In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 17,103 patients aged ≥65 years seen at 32 clinics in the Mid-Atlantic, primary care patients were classified into two groups - telemedicine vs. in-person - based on the first visit between March-May, 2020 and followed for 14 days. Using multivariable logistic regression, we measured the odds of being seen via telemedicine vs. in-person as a function of patient demographics, comorbidities, and week of study period. We then measured the odds of ACSC hospitalization by visit modality. RESULTS Mean age was 75.1 years (SD, 7.5), 60.6% of patients were female, 64.6% White, 28.1% Black, and 2.0% Hispanic. Overall, 60.3% of patients accessed primary care via telemedicine. Black (vs. White) patients had higher odds of using telemedicine (aOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.47) and Hispanic (vs. not Hispanic) patients had lower odds (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.92). Compared to the in-person group, patients in the telemedicine group had lower odds of ACSC hospitalization (aOR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-1.00). Among patients who used telemedicine, Black patients had 1.43 higher odds of ACSC hospitalization (95% CI, 1.02- 2.01), compared to White patients. Patients aged 85 or older seen via telemedicine had higher odds of an ACSC hospitalization (aOR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.03-2.47) compared to patients ages 65 to 74. CONCLUSIONS These findings support the use of telemedicine for primary care access for older adults. However, the observed disparities highlight the need to improve care quality and equity regardless of visit modality.","Ryskina, Kira L; Shultz, Kaitlyn; Zhou, Yi; Lautenbach, Gillian; Brown, Rebecca T",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224577/,538

Among patients admitted with respiratory failure (49%, n = 2,859, including 391 and 583 patients requiring invasive and noninvasive ventilation, respectively), anticoagulation started during hospitalization was associated with lower mortality rates (32% vs 42%; p < 0.01) and nonsignificant higher risk of bleeding (3.4% vs 2.7%; p = 0.3). Anticoagulation therapy was associated with lower mortality rates in patients treated with invasive ventilation (53% vs 64%; p = 0.05) without increased rates of bleeding (9% vs 8%; p = 0.88) but not in those with noninvasive ventilation (35% vs 38%; p = 0.40). At multivariate Cox' analysis mortality relative risk with anticoagulation was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in patients admitted with respiratory failure, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in those requiring invasive ventilation, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.51-1.01) in noninvasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Anticoagulation therapy in general population with coronavirus disease 2019 was not associated with better survival rates but with higher bleeding risk. Better results were observed in patients admitted with respiratory failure and requiring invasive ventilation.","Santoro, Francesco; Núñez-Gil, Ivan J; Viana-Llamas, María C; Maroun Eid, Charbel; Romero, Rodolfo; Fernández Rozas, Inmaculada; Parisi, Alvaro; Becerra-Muñoz, Victor Manuel; García Aguado, Marcos; Huang, Jia; Maltese, Ludovica; Cerrato, Enrico; Alfonso-Rodriguez, Emilio; Castro Mejía, Alex Fernando; Marin, Francisco; Raposeiras Roubin, Sergio; Pepe, Martino; Moreno Munguia, Victor H; Feltes, Gisela; Navas, Jesus Varas; Cortese, Bernardo; Buzón, Luis; Liebetrau, Cristoph; Ramos-Martinez, Miguel Raquel; Fernandez-Ortiz, Antonio; Estrada, Vicente; Brunetti, Natale Daniele",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861553/,538

This study intends to determine the relationship between chronic otitis media and dynamic ciliary beat frequency in children undergoing adenoidectomy. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, controlled study. SETTING Pediatric tertiary care hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Children undergoing adenoidectomy were enrolled. Patients were stratified according to their indication for surgery, including adenotonsillar hypertrophy with obstructive sleep apnea, chronic otitis media with effusion, or recurrent episodes of acute otitis media. Adenoids were harvested using the curette. Tissue was sectioned and allowed to equilibrate in basal media for 24 hours. Cilia-bearing tissue was then stimulated using isoproterenol or methacholine. Ciliary beat frequency was serially reordered and analyzed using the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis software program. RESULTS Baseline ciliary beat frequency was similar in all groups (N = 47, total). Using isoproterenol, children with chronic otitis media with effusion demonstrated a blunted dynamic ciliary response at 2 and 3 hours relative to control (P = .0176 and P = .0282). Methacholine-stimulated ciliary beat frequency was not different between each group. CONCLUSION At 2 and 3 hours following isoproterenol stimulation, there was a significant blunting of dynamic ciliary beat frequency in children with chronic otitis media with effusion. This ciliary dysfunction may provide a physiological explanation related to chronic adenoiditis in children with chronic otitis media.","Andreoli, Steven M; Schlosser, Rodney J; Wang, Ling-Feng; Mulligan, Ryan M; Discolo, Christopher M; White, David R",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599812462664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23032917/,538

113063,Fecal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing elective lower gastrointestinal endoscopy.,2020-05-05,"Avian Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a newly emerging avian pathogenic flavivirus in China and Southeast Asia with features of rapid spread, an expanding host range and cross-species transmission. The mechanisms of its infection and pathogenesis remain largely unclear. Here we investigated the tropism of this arbovirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of specific pathogen-free (SPF) ducks and SPF chickens and identified monocytes/macrophages as the key targets of TMUV infection. In vivo studies in SPF ducks and SPF chickens with monocyte/macrophage clearance demonstrated that the infection of monocytes/macrophages was crucial for viral replication, transmission and pathogenesis. Further genome-wide transcriptome analyses of TMUV-infected chicken macrophages revealed host antiviral innate immune barriers were the major targets of TMUV in macrophages. Despite the activation of major pattern-recognition receptor signalling, the inductions of IFN-α and IFN-β were blocked by TMUV infection on transcription and translation levels respectively. Meanwhile, TMUV inhibited host redox responses through repressing the transcription of genes encoding NADPH oxidase subunits and promoting Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses. The recovery of either abovementioned innate immune barrier was sufficient to suppress TMUV infection. Collectively, we identify an essential step of TMUV infection and reveal extensive subversion of host antiviral innate immune responses.ImportanceMosquito-borne flaviviruses include a group of pathogenic viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and animals, including dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis. These flaviviruses are zoonotic and use animals, including birds, as amplifying and reservoir hosts. Avian Tembusu virus (TMUV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogenic for many avian species and can infect cells derived from mammals and humans in vitro Although not currently pathogenic to primates, the infection of duck industry workers and the potential risk of TMUV infection in immunocompromised individuals have been highlighted. Thus, the prevention of TMUV in flocks is important for both avian and mammalian health. Our study reveals the escape of TMUV from the first line of the host defence system in the arthropod-borne transmission route of arboviruses, possibly helping to extend our understanding of flaviviruses infection in birds and refine the design of anti-TMUV therapeutics.","Ma, Yong; Liang, Yumeng; Wang, Nana; Cui, Lu; Chen, Zhijie; Wu, Hanguang; Zhu, Chenyang; Wang, Zhitao; Liu, Shengwang; Li, Hai",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00978-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462573/,538

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n=7) with Cushing's syndrome caused by unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma. METHODS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy with the dog in lateral recumbency on the unaffected side. Three 5-mm portals (1 laparoscopic portal, 2 instrument portals) were placed in the paralumbar fossa. A fourth instrumental portal (5-12 mm) was placed above the kidney. After dissection and hemostatic control of the phrenicoabdominal vein, the adrenal gland was carefully dissected or when there was capsule fragility, necrotic content was partially aspirated. The remaining glandular tissue was removed through the 12-mm trocar site. RESULTS Dogs with unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma (3 right-sided, 4 left-sided) without invasion of the caudal vena cava were successfully operated by laparoscopic approach. There were no significant intraoperative complications; 2 dogs died within 48 hours of surgery because of respiratory complications. Five dogs were discharged 72 hours after surgery, and signs of hyperadrenocorticism disappeared thereafter (survival time ranged from 7 to 25 months). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is feasible in dogs with either right- or left-sided adrenocortical carcinoma not involving the caudal vena cava. CLINICAL RELEVANCE When performed by experienced surgeons, laparoscopic adrenalectomy offers a minimally invasive alternative to open laparotomy or retroperitoneal surgery for the treatment of unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma in dogs.","Jiménez Peláez, Manuel; Bouvy, Bernard M; Dupré, Gilles P",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2008.00410.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986311/,538

Their management is technically demanding and remains controversial. Hernia complications can be lethal after bariatric surgery (BS). We herein report our experience with concomitant BS and ventral hernia repair (VHR). METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database queried for combined procedures. Hernias were repaired after complete reduction (when the defect was not empty) using a dual mesh fixed to the abdominal wall with absorbable tackers. Data collected included demographics, anthropometrics, co-morbidities, peri-operative course, and intermediate weight loss and co-morbidity status. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 54 patients (34 females, mean body mass index 44.2 kg/m(2)) underwent concomitant BS and VHR. The vast majority of procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies (N = 48; 89 %). Others included laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), open RYGB, and laparoscopic gastric banding (two each). Six patients had complications (11 %): three leaks, two abdominal wall hematomas, and one pulmonary embolism. Hernia recurrence was noted in one patient (1.8 %). Average excess weight loss post-surgery was 49.9 ± 10.3 and 57.7 ± 9.2 % at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The total number of pre-operative co-morbidities was 110. At 12-month follow-up, 50 % (N = 56) were completely resolved and 38 % (N = 42) were improved. CONCLUSION Concomitant BS and VHR is feasible and safe, obviating the need for two separate procedures while not hampering the outcome of either. Complication rates for the combined surgery do not seem to be adversely affected.","Raziel, Asnat; Sakran, Nasser; Szold, Amir; Goitein, David",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3310-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253564/,538

In particular, in the context of a pre-existing ""hub-and-spoke"" network, we describe how procedure types and volumes have changed in the last 3 months. RESULTS Since our institution was selected as a COVID-19 referral center, the entire in-hospital activity was reorganized to assist more than 1000 COVID-positive cases. Only urgent EP procedures, including ventricular tachycardia ablation and extraction of infected devices, were both maintained and optimized to meet the needs of external hospitals. In addition, most of the non-urgent EP procedures were postponed. Finally, following prompt internal reorganization, both outpatient clinics and on-call services underwent significant modification, by integrating telemedicine support whenever applicable.

In this work, a humidity sensor based on naturally available nanomaterials sepiolite nanofibers (SNFs) was facilely fabricated without any expensive raw materials or complex processes. Characterization results show that the SNFs have natural slender nanofiber structure (diameter: 20-50 nm) and abundant hydrophilic functional group (-OH). Humidity sensing test results show that the SNFs humidity sensor has outstanding humidity sensing properties (i.e., large response, good linearity and repeatability) within the relative humidity range from 10.9% to 91.5% at room temperature (25 C).

120601,Mouse Models for the Study of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,2021-10-05,"Total knee replacement (TKR) is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed, and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been developed and incorporated into inpatient surgical pathways to improve patient outcomes. Under ERAS recommendations, multimodal prophylaxis has been used to help manage postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) following TKR. Dexamethasone is one of the commonly used for this and the anti-inflammatory properties could depress vagal activity, reducing postural hypotension (PH). The hypothesis of this study is that postoperative dexamethasone use is associated with lower rates of early postoperative PH following TKR surgery. In our institution, patients who undergo elective primary TKR are admitted on the day of surgery and follow a standardized ERAS protocol. Data on patients who underwent elective primary TKR under a single adult reconstruction team from September 2017 to March 2020 were reviewed and analyzed. A review of demographic characteristics, surgical data, postoperative medications, and postoperative notes was performed. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the effect of the use of dexamethasone on PH, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) calculated after accounting for potential confounders. Of the 149 patients were included in the study, 78 had dexamethasone postoperatively, and 71 did not. Patients who had received dexamethasone were statistically less likely to suffer from PH (OR = 0.31, p = 0.03) and less likely to develop PONV (OR = 0.21, p = 0.006). Patients who had received dexamethasone were more likely able to participate in early physiotherapy (OR = 2.42, p = 0.14), and this result was statistically insignificant. The use of postoperative intravenous dexamethasone is significantly associated with lower rates of postoperative PH after TKR. However, more studies are required to assess the optimal dosing amount and frequency, as well as to assess other factors which can enhance early postoperative patient mobilization as part of our goals for ERAS. This therapeutic study reflects level of evidence III.","Cheng, Gloria H M; Tan, Gabriel K Y; Kamarudin, Muhammad F B; Lee, Bryan W W; Mei, Yap Yan; Tan, Kelvin G",The journal of knee surgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1731722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237779/,538

When the influent TS concentration increased from 7.04 to 15.5 g/L, the methane gas production rate increased from 0.45 to 0.92 L-CH4/L/day. However, with the influent TS concentration of food waste (FW) further increased to 23.5 g/L, a large amount of scum formed and accumulated in the SDSAR. According to the result of chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery, the proportion of COD remained in the effluent at different TS concentrations was only around 2%. On the other hand, with an increase in TS concentration, the proportion of COD remained in the reactors increased significantly. Our results demonstrated that effluent from the integrated system can meet the water quality requirements recommended by Japan Sewage Works Association (JSWA) for wastewater from FWD.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out to analyze the clinical data of selective endoscopy performed at the Endoscopic Center, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University from February 20 to March 6, 2020. Clinical data included epidemiological questionnaire, chief complaints, endoscopic findings and biopsy pathology results, etc. All medical staff had blood test for IgM/IgG antibodies of COVID-19. Patients and their families were followed up by phone to determine whether they were infected with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the clinical data of selective endoscopy during the same period from February 20 to March 6, 2019 were collected as the control group to compare the overall results of endoscopy examinations during the epidemic and the detection rate of GI malignancy. Results: A total of 911 patients underwent endoscopy in the epidemic period group, and a total of 5746 cases in the control group, which was 6.3 times over the epidemic period group. In the epidemic period group, 544 cases received gastroscopy and 367 cases received colonoscopy, while 3433 cases received gastroscopy and 2313 cases received colonoscopy in the control group, which were both 6.3 times of epidemic period group. Gastroscopy revealed that 39 patients (7.2%) were diagnosed with upper GI malignancies in the epidemic period group and 77 patients (2.2%) in the control group with significant difference (χ(2)=40.243, P<0.001). The detection rate of gastric cancer in these two groups was 3.3% (n=18) and 1.7% (n=59) respectively with significant difference (χ(2)=6.254,P=0.012).

Conclusion: Compared with the same period in 2019, the number of selective endoscopy decreases sharply during the epidemic period, while the detection rate of various GI malignant tumors increases significantly, which indicates that patients with high-risk symptoms of GI malignancies should still receive endoscopy as soon as possible. Provided strict adherence to the epidemic prevention standards formulated by the state and professional societies, it is necessary to carry out clinical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.","Zhu, L; Cai, M Y; Shi, Q; Wang, P; Li, Q L; Zhong, Y S; Yao, L Q; Zhou, P H",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020-0316-00147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306597/,538

Methods This scoping review was undertaken by an ILCOR Newborn Life Support scoping review team and guided by the ILCOR methodological framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were peer-reviewed, compared briefing/debriefing of healthcare professionals who had completed a neonatal resuscitation or simulated resuscitation and reported outcomes for infants, families or staff. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched. Results This review included four studies that reported on three briefing/debriefing interventions: video debriefing, the use of checklists with a briefing/debriefing component and rapid cycle deliberate practice. Video debriefing was associated with improvements in the process of care and adherence to resuscitation guidelines. Use of checklists was associated with improvements in short term clinical outcomes and a reduction in communication problems. Rapid cycle deliberate practice may lead to short but not sustained improvements in algorithm compliance and timely completion of resuscitation steps. Conclusion This scoping review did not identify sufficient new evidence to justify conducting new systematic reviews or review of current resuscitation guidelines. Improvements in the process of care, short term clinical outcomes and reduction in communication problems were associated with briefing/debriefing supported by video, checklists or rapid, cycle deliberate practice. It highlights knowledge gaps, including the need to consider briefing/debriefing separately from other interventions, the effect of briefing/debriefing on short- and long-term clinical outcomes and the effect of rapid cycle deliberate practice on resuscitation training.","Fawke, Joe; Stave, Christopher; Yamada, Nicole",Resuscitation plus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resplu.2020.100059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34223331/,538

The present study undertakes a scoping review of research focused on telehealth in otolaryngology (teleotolaryngology) to identify key themes and commonly utilized outcome measures that will assist future development in this growing field. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and reference review. REVIEW METHODS Per guidelines of the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, we performed database queries using a comprehensive search strategy developed in collaboration with research librarians at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We identified 596 unique references to undergo title and abstract review by 2 independent reviewers, leaving 439 studies for full-text review. RESULTS We included 285 studies for extraction of notable findings, leaving 262 unique studies after accounting for content overlap. We identified core outcome measures, including patient and provider satisfaction, costs and benefits, quality of care, feasibility, and access to care. Publication volume increased markedly over time, though only 4% of studies incorporated randomized study group assignment. Using an iterative approach to thematic development, we organized article content across 5 main themes: (1) exploration of teleotolaryngology evolution, (2) role in virtual clinical encounters, (3) applications in interdisciplinary care and educational initiatives, (4) emerging and innovative technologies, and (5) barriers to implementation. CONCLUSION This scoping review of teleotolaryngology documents its evolution and identifies current use cases, limitations, and emerging applications, providing a foundation from which to build future studies, inform policy decision making, and facilitate implementation where appropriate.","Gonzalez, Joseph N; Axiotakis, Lucas G; Yu, Victoria X; Gudis, David A; Overdevest, Jonathan B",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/01945998211013751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003046/,538

However, there has not been a review on how to effectively recruit and retain women living with HIV in research. The purpose of this review is to describe recruitment and retention methods and factors associated with research participation among women living with HIV in the U.S. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Google and synthesized studies using thematic analysis. The most common method of recruiting women with HIV into research was through community-based HIV clinics, and the greatest yield was from word of mouth and a university HIV research center. Attrition may occur early and can be addressed by focusing on retention as early as study planning. Barriers to research participation for women can be addressed through retention methods discussed. We conclude that building relationships with community members and women living with HIV, being flexible, and implementing many methods is important for recruitment and retention.","Mendez, Kyra Jennifer Waligora; Cudjoe, Joycelyn; Strohmayer, Sarah; Han, Hae-Ra",AIDS and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03273-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990902/,538

However, the effectiveness of ET in elderly patients is uncertain. METHODS Using our stroke database, we compared the rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤2), excellent outcome (mRS 0-1), poor outcome (mRS 5-6) at discharge, in-hospital death, infarct size, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in patients aged ≥80 years with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions during two time periods. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2012, 217 patients were treated with IVT and, from November 2012 to October 2017, 209 patients received ET with stent retrievers (with or without IVT). Significantly more patients in the ET group than in the IVT group had a good outcome (25% vs 16%, P<0.05), as well as an excellent outcome (12% vs 4%, P<0.01). Significantly fewer patients in the ET group than in the IVT group died (14% vs 22%, P<0.05) or had a poor outcome (35% vs 52%, P<001). The SICH rates were lower after ET than after IVT (1% vs 6%, P<0.01), and the infarct sizes were smaller after ET than after IVT. CONCLUSIONS Compared with IVT, the routine use of ET significantly improved the early clinical and radiological outcome in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions aged ≥80 years. Nevertheless, poor outcome rates were high so the role of ET needs to be defined further in this population.","Kastrup, Andreas; Brunner, Freimuth; Hildebrandt, Helmut; Roth, Christian; Winterhalter, Michael; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549121/,538
149663,Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 - a systemic review.,2020-07-15,"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to quantify interfractional esophageal tumor position variation using markers and investigate the use of markers for setup verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-five markers placed in the tumor volumes of 24 esophageal cancer patients were identified in computed tomography (CT) and follow-up cone-beam CT. For each patient we calculated pairwise distances between markers over time to evaluate geometric tumor volume variation. We then quantified marker displacements relative to bony anatomy and estimated the variation of systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ). During bony anatomy-based setup verification, we visually inspected whether the markers were inside the planning target volume (PTV) and attempted marker-based registration. RESULTS Minor time trends with substantial fluctuations in pairwise distances implied tissue deformation. Overall, Σ(σ) in the left-right/cranial-caudal/anterior-posterior direction was 2.9(2.4)/4.1(2.4)/2.2(1.8) mm; for the proximal stomach, it was 5.4(4.3)/4.9(3.2)/1.9(2.4) mm. After bony anatomy-based setup correction, all markers were inside the PTV. However, due to large tissue deformation, marker-based registration was not feasible. CONCLUSIONS Generally, the interfractional position variation of esophageal tumors is more pronounced in the cranial-caudal direction and in the proximal stomach. Currently, marker-based setup verification is not feasible for clinical routine use, but markers can facilitate the setup verification by inspecting whether the PTV covers the tumor volume adequately.","Jin, Peng; van der Horst, Astrid; de Jong, Rianne; van Hooft, Jeanin E; Kamphuis, Martijn; van Wieringen, Niek; Machiels, Melanie; Bel, Arjan; Hulshof, Maarten C C M; Alderliesten, Tanja",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2015.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475250/,538

Decisions on decommissioning alternatives will benefit from quantifying and understanding the marine communities associated with these structures. As a case study, fish assemblages associated with an inshore network of subsea pipelines located on the North West shelf of Western Australia were compared to those in surrounding natural reef and soft sediment habitats using remotely operated vehicles fitted with a stereo-video system (stereo-ROVs). The number of species, the abundance, biomass, feeding guild composition and the economic value of fishes were compared among habitats. The community composition of fish associated with pipelines was distinct from those associated with natural habitats, and was characterised by a greater abundance and/or biomass of fish from higher trophic levels (e.g. piscivores, generalist carnivores and invertivores), including many species considered to be of value to commercial and recreational fishers. Biomass of fish on pipelines was, on average, 20 times greater than soft sediments, and was similar to natural reefs. However, the biomass of species considered important to fisheries recorded on the pipelines was, on average 3.5 times greater than reef and 44.5 times greater than soft sediment habitats. This study demonstrates that fish assemblages on the pipeline infrastructure exhibit high ecological and socioeconomic values.","Schramm, Karl D; Marnane, Michael J; Elsdon, Travis S; Jones, Christopher M; Saunders, Benjamin J; Newman, Stephen J; Harvey, Euan S",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85396-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737598/,538

The current review synthesizes extant methods for tracing physical behavior in VR, such as gaze tracking and interpersonal distance measurement, and describes how researchers have applied these methods to understand important phenomena within the context of social psychology. To date, primary areas of application have included the assessment of social approach and avoidance, social evaluation and bias, and engagement. The limitations of behavioral tracing methods in VR, as well as future directions for their continued application and extension, are discussed.

Technique, short-term (infection, seroma, wound dehiscence), and long-term (mesh infection, recurrence) complications, and hernia recurrences were evaluated by physician examination ≥5 years postoperatively. RESULTS 56 patients at high risk for infection had elective operation; nine had non-elective operation for complications of prior incisional hernia/hernia repair. Operations were clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, or grossly infected in 49, 32, 12, and 6%, respectively. Techniques of repair included 10 onlay (six reinforced primary closures, four bridging patches), 47 sublay (20 reinforced primary closures, 27 bridging patches), six inlay, and two sandwich (sublay and onlay). Early complications (≤30 days postoperatively) occurred in 19 of the 65 patients (29%), including two prosthetic dehiscences from fascial attachment, 13 wound infections, and 4 seromas. After a mean follow-up of ≥5 years in 59 of 65 patients, physician-reported incidences of infection requiring removal of mesh or hernia recurrence were 25 and 66%, respectively. Hernia recurrence occurred in 12 of 26 (46%) patients with a reinforced repair and 27 of 33 (82%) with patched repairs. Mesh infection occurred in 7 of 24 patients with sublay patch and in 4 of 19 sublay reinforcement. The greatest recurrence rate was in contaminated (71%) and grossly infected wounds (100%), while recurrence rate was 63% in clean and 63% in clean-contaminated wounds. CONCLUSIONS At ≥5 years of follow-up, use of PADM as a bioprosthesis in ventral hernia in high-risk patients is unreliable as a definitive repair in the majority of patients, but may provide satisfactory outcomes in some patients.","Abdelfatah, M M; Rostambeigi, N; Podgaetz, E; Sarr, M G",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1165-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24129420/,538

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a mixture of cellular components including cancer cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and dendritic cells (DCs), which might drive to tumor progression and resistance to therapies. In this work, we study the effects of 4-methylumbelliferone (4Mu) on TME and how this change could be exploited to promote a potent immune response against HCC. First, we observed that 4Mu therapy induced a switch of hepatic macrophages (Mϕ) towards an M1 type profile, and HCC cells (Hepa129 cells) exposed to conditioned medium (CM) derived from Mϕ treated with 4Mu showed reduced expression of several CSCs markers and aggressiveness. HCC cells incubated with CM derived from Mϕ treated with 4Mu grew in immunosuppressed mice while presented delayed tumor progression in immunocompetent mice. HCC cells treated with 4Mu were more susceptible to phagocytosis by DCs, and when DCs were pulsed with HCC cells previously treated with 4Mu displayed a potent antitumoral effect in therapeutic vaccination protocols. In conclusion, 4Mu has the ability to modulate TME into a less hostile milieu and to potentiate immunotherapeutic strategies against HCC.","Rodríguez, Marcelo M; Onorato, Agostina; Cantero, María José; Domínguez, Luciana; Bayo, Juan; Fiore, Esteban; García, Mariana; Atorrasagasti, Catalina; Canbay, Ali; Malvicini, Mariana; Mazzolini, Guillermo D",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85491-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737571/,538
158170,Stability of volatile organic compounds in sorbent tubes following SARS-CoV-2 inactivation procedures.,2021-03-22,"OBJECTIVES The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), termed COVID-19, is asymptomatic or mild in most cases. These patients do not need treatment in hospital and can be isolated at home. To date, most studies have been conducted among inpatients with severe COVID-19. In this study, the authors surveyed patients with mild COVID-19 who remained in home isolation, and analyzed the sources and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out on April 17-18, 2020, among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who remained in home isolation in Poland. Data were acquired through a structured interview that included questions about the isolation course, symptoms, comorbidities, infection source, household characteristics, occupation, and workplace. Data were presented with descriptive statistics. RESULTS Of the 4878 patients in home isolation, the authors were able to contact 3313. Of them, 1191 patients declined their invitation, and 2122 agreed to take part. The median age of the patients included in the study was 50 years; 59% were female. Most patients (92%) had not been abroad before the infection. More than half (55%) knew how they became infected; of them, 75% became infected at work. Of all patients, 70% were occupationally active. Nearly half of the occupationally active patients (48%) worked in healthcare, 3% worked in public administration or defense, 3% worked in transportation, and 2% worked in education. Sixty-five percent of the occupationally active patients worked in companies with >100 employees. CONCLUSIONS Most of the patients with COVID-19 in home isolation in Poland were occupationally active, wherein the majority of people who were aware of the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection worked in healthcare. As most of the infected patients worked in companies with >100 employees, which is not a Polish employment pattern, the authors expect that smaller companies may have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Sierpiński, Radosław; Pinkas, Jaroslaw; Jankowski, Mateusz; Juszczyk, Grzegorz; Topór-Mądry, Roman; Szumowski, Łukasz",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699423/,538

METHODS A prospective, non-randomized study of women with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial cancer and clinical stage I disease was conducted. A subset analysis of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial endometrioid cancer was performed. All patients had preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with Tc99m on the day of or day before surgery followed by an intraoperative injection of 2 cm(3) of isosulfan or methylene blue dye deep into the cervix or both cervix and fundus. All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and regional nodal dissection. Hot and/or blue nodes were labeled as SLNs and sent for histopathological analysis. RESULTS Forty-two patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial carcinoma treated from 3/06 to 8/08 were identified. Twenty-five (60%) had laparoscopic surgery; 17 (40%) were treated by laparotomy. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy visualized SLNs in 30 patients (71%); intraoperative localization of the SLN was possible in 36 patients (86%). A median of 3 SLNs (range, 1-14) and 14.5 non-SLNs (range, 4-55) were examined. In all, 4/36 (11%) had positive SLNs-3 seen on H&E and 1 as cytokeratin-positive cells on IHC. All node-positive cases were picked up by the SLN; there were no false-negative cases. The sensitivity of the SLN procedure in the 36 patients who had an SLN identified was 100%. CONCLUSION Sentinel lymph node mapping using a cervical injection with combined Tc and blue dye is feasible and accurate in patients with grade 1 endometrial cancer and may be a reasonable option for this select group of patients. Regional lymphadenectomy remains the gold standard in many practices, particularly for the approximately 15% of cases with failed SLN mapping.","Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Khoury-Collado, Fady; Pandit-Taskar, Neeta; Soslow, Robert A; Dao, Fanny; Sonoda, Yukio; Levine, Douglas A; Brown, Carol L; Chi, Dennis S; Barakat, Richard R; Gemignani, Mary L",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232699/,538
164092,SARS-CoV-2-specific Humoral Immune Responses after A Single Dose of Inactivated Whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in Kidney Transplant Recipients: An Initial Report,2021-07-22,"Objective Methods Results Conclusion Extracellular adenosine is produced from secreted adenosine triphosphate by cluster of differentiation (CD)39 and CD73. Both are critical nucleotide metabolizing enzymes of the adenosine generating pathway and are secreted by neuronal or immune cells. Adenosine plays a role in energy processes, neurotransmission and endogenous regulation of inflammatory responses. Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A2a receptor antagonist used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We have reported that adenosine primes hypersecretion of interleukin (IL)‐17A through the adenosine A2a receptor. Istradefylline, as well as an inhibitor of CD39 (ARL67156) and an inhibitor of CD73 (AMP‐CP), suppressed IL‐17A production, and the administration of istradefylline to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis led to the marked amelioration of the disease. These previous results suggest that adenosine is an endogenous modulator of neutrophilic inflammation. We investigated the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP‐CP on other mouse models of neutrophilic inflammation.We tested the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP‐CP on ovalbumin‐induced neutrophilic airway inflammation or imiquimod‐induced psoriasis in mice. The two mice models received these drugs orally or percutaneously, respectively. The production of IL‐17A in the lung and ear thickness were used as an index of the effects.We show that istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP‐CP suppressed the ovalbumin‐induced IL‐17A production in the lung and imiquimod‐induced psoriasis.These results show that adenosine‐mediated IL‐17A production plays a role in neutrophilic inflammation models, and furthermore, istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP‐CP are effective in animal models of neutrophilic inflammation.

These are either inherently unstructured and non-conducive to current computing paradigms or siloed into structured databases requiring specialized bioinformatics. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for deciphering unstructured natural languages and the availability of numerous bioinformatics resources, a holistic platform for real-time synthesis of the scientific literature and seamless triangulation with deep omic insights and real-world evidence has not been advanced. Here, we introduce the nferX platform that makes the highly unstructured biomedical knowledge computable and supports the seamless visual triangulation with statistical inference from diverse structured databases. The nferX platform will accelerate and amplify the research potential of subject-matter experts as well as non-experts across the life science ecosystem (https://academia.nferx.com/).","Wagner, Tyler; Awasthi, Samir; Wittenberg, Gayle; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Tarjan, Dan; Anyanwu-Ofili, Anuli; Badley, Andrew; Halamka, John; Flores, Christopher; Khan, Najat; Barve, Rakesh; Soundararajan, Venky",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.020602,538

166010,Vaccination and time limited immunization for SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Recently, patients co-infected by two SARS-CoV-2 lineages have been sporadically reported. Concerns are raised because previous studies have demonstrated co-infection may contribute to the recombination of RNA viruses and cause severe clinic symptoms. In this study, we have estimated the compositional lineage(s), tendentiousness, and frequency of co-infection events in population from a large-scale genomic analysis for SARS-CoV-2 patients. SARS-CoV-2 lineage(s) infected in each sample have been recognized from the assignment of within-host site variations into lineage-defined feature variations by introducing a hypergeometric distribution method. Of all the 29,993 samples, 53 (~0.18%) co-infection events have been identified. Apart from 52 co-infections with two SARS-CoV-2 lineages, one sample with co-infections of three SARS-CoV-2 lineages was firstly identified. As expected, the co-infection events mainly happened in the regions where have co-existed more than two dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineages. However, co-infection of two sub-lineages in Delta lineage were detected as well. Our results provide a useful reference framework for the high throughput detecting of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection events in the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Although low in average rate, the co-infection events showed an increasing tendency with the increased diversity of SARS-CoV-2. And considering the large base of SARS-CoV-2 infections globally, co-infected patients would be a nonnegligible population. Thus, more clinical research is urgently needed on these patients.","Zhou, Hang-Yu; Cheng, Ye-Xiao; Xu, Lin; Li, Jia-Ying; Tao, Chen-Yue; Ji, Cheng-Yang; Han, Na; Yang, Rong; Li, Yaling; Wu, Aiping",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.458951,538

Learning assistants teaching in STEM disciplines experienced difficulties during this transition unique to our student population consisting of many nontraditional and first generation students living in rural areas. We conducted a phenomenological study about these LAs experiences using a Community of Practice (CoP) theory lens. Through interviews with 10 LAs, novel conversations about moving from FTF courses to a virtual setting emerged. In response to the interruptions of the CoP, LAs discussed their new learning opportunities. In this paper, we highlight the opportunities and challenges as encountered by the LAs. Considerations and concerns for instructors with similar student populations are presented.","Fields, M.; Modir, B.; Newton, W. G.; Lock, R. M.; Stanfield, J.

167215,SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibody responses after second dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 in the UK general population,2021-09-16,"Prediction methods are important for many applications. In particular, an accurate prediction for the total number of cases for pandemics such as the Covid-19 pandemic could help medical preparedness by providing in time a sucient supply of testing kits, hospital beds and medical personnel. This paper experimentally compares the accuracy of ten prediction methods for the cumulative number of Covid- 19 pandemic cases. These ten methods include three types of neural networks and extrapola- tion methods based on best fit quadratic, best fit cubic and Lagrange interpolation, as well as an extrapolation method proposed by the second author. We also consider the Kriging and inverse distance weighting spatial interpolation methods. We also develop a novel spatiotemporal prediction method by combining temporal and spatial prediction methods. The experiments show that among these ten prediction methods, the spatiotemporal method has the smallest root mean square error and mean absolute error on Covid-19 cumulative data for counties in New York State between May and July, 2020. © This article is published under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US","Cai, J.; Revesz, P.

167698,Saliva as a Potential SARS-CoV-2 Reservoir: What is Already Known? A Systematic Review,2021,"Background: The Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant burden on global healthcare systems. Nurses, midwives and health visitors remain critical to the rapid responses and innovative solutions required. Their views, however, on priorities for research is mainly muted, necessitating greater clarity to inform research that benefits patients and families across the life course. Aims: To identify priorities for research in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and 'beyond', as recommended by nurses, midwives and health visitors across the four countries of the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey design was conducted (5th May-4th June 2020). In addition to the completion of demographic information, respondents identified up to three research areas important to their clinical care/practice in the context of COVID-19 and beyond. Data were imported for analysis into NVivo 12 (QSR International). Descriptive analysis was used to summarise the demographic variables. Free text responses were analysed using a semantic, inductive thematic analysis approach. Results: In total 1,296 responses were received from a self-selected sample of predominantly of female, registered nurses of white British ethnicity, located in England and working for acute care providers, providing 3,444 research priority recommendations. Four higher-order themes emerged, (1) New and unknown frontiers;(2) Care and treatment solutions;(3) Healthcare leadership and inclusive workforce;and (4) Emotional and mental health impact. Conclusions: At a time of significant global uncertainty, the collective voice of nursing, midwifery and health visiting is never more important to inform clinical research. Whilst generalisability is limited by the homogeneity of the sample, this is the first survey to elicit the priorities for research in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond from nurses, midwives and health visitors in the UK. Novel findings developed through a rigorous analytical approach illuminate areas that require both urgent and long-term attention and provide a platform to direct priority refinement, future research and the basis for evidence translation.","Manning, Joseph C.; Bramley, Louise Coad Jane Evans Catrin Evans Kerry Tinkler Linda Cooper Joanne",Journal of Research in Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1177/17449871211018737,538

Hong Kong, as a well-known international tourist destination, has also been hit hard by the crisis. Recovery forecasts for hotel room demand are critical to managing this ongoing crisis. This study employs the autoregressive distributed lag error correction model to generate baseline forecasts of hotel room demand for Hong Kong followed by compound scenario analysis to optimize forecasts considering the pandemic?s impacts. The COVID-19 Travelable Index is designed to group source markets by their pandemic situations, vaccinations, policy responses, and health resilience. To capture pandemic-related uncertainty, this study presents three scenarios describing recovery patterns based on trough duration, the quarter for lifting travel restrictions, and the quarter for returning to baseline forecasts. Hotel demand forecasts geared toward each source market are analyzed, revealing strategies to help hotel businesses manage this crisis.","Zhang, Hanyuan Lu Jiangping",Tourism Economics,https://doi.org/10.1177/13548166211035569,538
168792,Reprogramming of the intestinal epithelial-immune cell interactome during SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-08-09,"A model for estimating the number of COVID-19 infected persons (infecteds) is proposed based on the exponential function law of the SIR model. This model is composed of several equations expressing the number of infecteds, considering the onset after an incubation period, infectivity, wavy infection persistence with repeated infection spread and convergence with insufficient quarantine. This model is applied to the infection in Japan, which is currently suffering from the 5th wave, and the initial number of infecteds and various related parameters are calculated by curve fitting of the cumulative number of infecteds to the total cases in the database. As a minimum boundary of the number of infecteds for the infection continuation up to the 5th wave, the initial number of infecteds at the outbreak of infection is more than an order of magnitude higher than the actual initial cases. A convergence ratio (cumulative number of infecteds / total cases) at the end of the first wave is obtained as 1.5. The quarantine rate and social distancing ratio based on the SIQR model are evaluated, and the social distancing ratio increases sharply just after the government's declaration of emergency. The quarantine rate closely equals the positive rate by PCR tests, meaning that the number of infecteds, which had been unknown, is on the order of almost the same as the number of tests.","Hashiguchi, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.11.21264869v1?rss=1,538

As no vaccine is 100% effective, breakthrough infections are expected to occur. We analyzed the virological characteristics of 161 vaccine breakthrough infections in a population of 24,706 vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs), using RT-PCR and virus culture. The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was identified in the majority of cases. Despite similar Ct-values, we demonstrate lower probability of infectious virus detection in respiratory samples of vaccinated HCWs with breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated HCWs with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, infectious virus was found in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the first 3 days of illness. We conclude that rare vaccine breakthrough infections occur, but infectious virus shedding is reduced in these cases.","Shamier, M.

172184,Ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has shown that even a serious public health crisis cannot escape the lens of partisanship. The literature shows that most Republicans have viewed the coronavirus as less serious than their Democratic counterparts. This study demonstrates that this partisan gap extends to the real behavior of the public during, and after, the coronavirus state lockdowns. Using location data from mobile phones, we find that county-level partisanship predicts compliance with state shutdown orders, even when controlling for local COVID-19 intensity. Further, the magnitude of this effect is stronger than that of other explanatory variables, such as age, education, and population density. These results show that partisan beliefs can affect behavior regarding issues that are not overtly political, even behaviors that could put one or others at risk. © The Author(s), 2021.

The cross-sectional dispersion of returns is used to measure the level of herding in the markets of Spain and Portugal, using a survivorship-bias-free dataset of daily stock returns during the period January 2000 – May 2021, in turn divided into several sub-periods classified as pre-2008 crisis, 2008 crisis, post-2008 crisis, Covid-19 and post Covid-19. Additionally, the existence is studied of differences between days of positive and negative returns, or between days of high volatility compared to the rest, and whether the cross-sectional dispersion of returns in one market is affected by the cross-sectional dispersion of returns in the other market. The results indicate that herding appears with greater intensity in periods prior to the crisis, disappearing during the financial crisis and reappearing, although with less intensity, after it, while it is not generally detected in Covid-19 times. However, herding behavior can be observed in the market during the pandemic on high volatility days.","Ferreruela, Sandra Mallor Tania",The North American Journal of Economics and Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101531,538

When the resonator spins along the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, the resonator undergoes a different Sagnac effect, which combines the phonon pump with tunable amplitude and phase results in significantly enhanced probe transmission. If the mass of external biomolecules (such as baculovirus or coronavirus) deposited on the resonator, they can be measured by tracking the resonance frequency shifts in the transmission spectrum. Therefore our study presents a means to classify different viruses, and can also be used to identify 2019-nCoV.","Chen, H. J.",Applied Physics Express,https://doi.org/10.35848/1882-0786/ac1232,538

The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of burnout and its symptoms in gastroenterologists. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors and job-related stressors that commonly contribute to burnout in gastroenterologists. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and PsycINFO by two reviewers independently for articles published to 1 September 2020. The primary outcome measure was the reported prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists. The secondary outcome measures were (i) the prevalence of burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and low personal accomplishment) and (ii) the frequency of risk factors and stressors reported in studies. Data were tabulated and meta-analyses were presented as Funnel and Forest plots. Results: Data were extracted from 11 studies. 54.5% (6/11) of these studies reported the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists; this ranged from 18.3% to 64.4%. Similar to burnout prevalence, burnout symptoms showed geographical variation and were common in gastroenterologists (up to 63.9%). Factors associated with work volume, age, and female gender were the three most frequently reported risk factors for increased levels of anxiety, stress or burnout in 72.7% (8/11), 54.5% (6/11), and 45.5% (5/11) of studies respectively. Significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity was observed. Conclusions: Burnout and its symptoms are common in gastroenterologists but the syndrome is understudied within the field.

175294,Illness characteristics of COVID-19 in children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant,2021-10-07,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has implemented a series of guidelines, rules, and restrictions to change citizens' behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus, such as the promotion of face-masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders. The success of these measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance has not been complete. Detailed data is required on the factors aiding or hindering compliance with these measures. Methods: To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020. Results: The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to one's self and one's family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved one, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family. Conclusion: The results demonstrate an array of factors contribute to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communications that emphasizes the potential risks of COVID-19 and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours.","Wright, L.; Paul, E.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259621v1?rss=1,538

176499,Steroid-induced psychosis in context a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. about a case,2021,"Introduction: The first case of COVID-19 in Chattanooga/Hamilton County, Tennessee (CHC) was identified on March 13, 2020. By early April, 51 RT-PCR confirmed cases were identified, with white, non-Hispanic males and females representing 82% (41/51) of positive cases and remaining cases representing black residents (18%;9/51). That few people from racial/ethnic minorities were being tested became a key public health concern. We hypothesized that local mapping of health-related data would identify regions where individuals at greater risk for COVID-19 live and work and have limited access to testing and healthcare services. Methods: The CDC 500 Cities data was used to generate layered maps of prevalence estimates for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and the behavioral risk factors of physical inactivity and obesity. Layers also included the CDC Social Vulnerability Index, age distribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and zip codes. Maps were shared with intersectoral collaborators representing the black and Hispanic/Latinx communities who provided specific neighborhood information to the maps. Collaborators included hospital systems, the local health department, community health centers, the private sector, and non-profit organizations. Maps were used to identify geographic sites for mobile and strategic testing within communities at higher risk for the spread of the coronavirus. Specific diverse neighborhoods along with worksites were then provided with testing beginning in early May and ongoing. Results: Strategic and mobile testing beginning in early May increased three-fold the number of identified new cases of COVID-19. Seventy percent (652/932) of these positive tests were amongethnically Hispanic/Latinx and 16% (149/932) among black residents. Positive tests continued to increase at a greater rate among Hispanic/Latinx and black residents compared with white residentsthrough the months of May-July (68/10K vs. 2.6/10K, OR = 4.85, 95% CI 2.66, 9.02). Conclusions: This example of inter-sectoral collaboration, data sharing, and data use throughstrategic mapping of vulnerable populations for COVID-19 was an effective means to enhanceCOVID-19 testing and identification of positive cases throughout CHC. This expanded partneringresulting in targeted testing may be a useful approach among similar communities and subsequentoutbreaks.","Heath, G. W.; Moreland, T.; Stephenson, S.; Houser, J.

While a variety of surveys have assessed the impacts of the pandemic in other fields, few studies have focused on understanding the short- and long-term impacts of the pandemic for archaeology. To assess these trends, we asked survey respondents (n = 570) if they experienced job loss and to rate the percentage of change in their economic situation, workload, teaching or research activities, and personal responsibilities. Results show alarming trends, with nearly half of those who experienced job loss being under the age of 35 and women and early career archaeologists suffering major economic losses. Impacts to workload, teaching activities, and research activities were also felt across these groups. Substantial increases in personal responsibilities (childcare, eldercare, caring for sick family members) were also identified, especially for women with children under 18 years of age. While structural inequalities have already been identified across different sectors of archaeology, the results of this survey suggest the most vulnerable populations are those most heavily affected. We recommend a variety of strategies for employers, professional organizations, funding agencies, and publishers to consider in mitigating the consequences of COVID-19, especially for women and early career scholars.","Hoggarth, Julie A.; Batty, Sylvia Bondura Valerie Creamer Emma Ebert Claire E.; Green-Mink, Kirsten Kieffer C.

In this work, we describe the development of an automated ELISA on-chip capable of detecting an-ti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individu-als. The colorimetric reactions were analyzed with a microplate reader. No statistically signifi-cant differences were observed when comparing the results of our automated ELISA on-chip against the ones obtained from a traditional ELISA on a microplate. Moreover, we demonstrated that it is possible to carry out the analysis of the colorimetric reaction by performing basic image analysis of photos taken with a smartphone, which constitutes a useful alternative when lacking specialized equipment or a laboratory setting.

Healthcare technology is rapidly developing and being pioneered by researchers with the help of IoT. Because of our hectic schedules and daily tasks, it may be difficult to monitor a patient's health status at all times. Patients, especially the elderly, should be monitored regularly. So, an innovative system has been proposed for easily automating this task. Hence, patient vitals such as body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and humidity can be monitored continuously. This paper summarises the implementation and working of the patient monitoring device, which consists of sensors connected to a microcontroller and designed to collect vital signs from the patient's body. © 2021 IEEE.","Reddy, D.

178861,Seroresponse to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among maintenance dialysis patients,2021-08-22,"Purpose: The purpose of this review article is to examine the well-being of faculty in higher education. Success in academia depends on productivity in research, teaching, and service to the university, and the workload model that excludes attention to the welfare of faculty members themselves contributes to stress and burnout. Importantly, student success and well-being is influenced largely by their faculty members, whose ability to inspire and lead depends on their own well-being. This review article underscores the importance of attending to the well-being of the people behind the productivity in higher education. Method: This study is a narrative review of the literature about faculty well-being in higher education. The history of well-being in the workplace and academia, concepts of stress and well-being in higher education faculty, and evidence-based strategies to promote and cultivate faculty well-being were explored in the literature using electronic sources. Conclusions: Faculty feel overburdened and pressured to work constantly to meet the demands of academia, and they strive for work--life balance. Faculty report stress and burnout related to excessively high expectations, financial pressures to obtain research funding, limited time to manage their workload, and a belief that individual progress is never sufficient. Faculty well-being is important for the individual and in support of scholarship and student outcomes. This article concludes with strategies to improve faculty well-being that incorporate an intentional focus on faculty members themselves, prioritize a community of well-being, and implement continuous high-quality professional learning.","Roos, Brianne H.; Borkoski, Carey C.",Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups,https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_persp-21-00006,538
180119,On-machine measurement-based compensation for machining of thin web parts,2020-12-31,"The experience of distance and combined learning during the pandemic COVID-19 has demonstrated the complexity of organizing experimental research in natural sciences, especially physics. In conditions of limited access to full-sized laboratory equipment, smartphones have significant potential: they contain sensitive elements (distance, lighting, magnetic field sensors, accelerometer, GPS and others). Their use in the educational process of teaching physics is effective for the formation of key and subject skills of students in terms of the digital age. The use of digital means of obtaining and processing experimental data during the educational process in natural sciences enriches pedagogical science with methods that can be described by the general concept of «instrumental digital didactics» (IDD). The authors explain a definition of IDD, identify the types and functions of IDD tools. It is shown that the use of smartphone sensors for educational research in physics demonstrates the intersection of the conceptual fields of IDD and m-learning. Foreign and Ukrainian experience of the use of information technology capabilities of smartphones at the physics study is analyzed;in this context, the classification of mobile applications, in particular, designed to process data from sensitive elements is considered. An anonymous survey in June and December 2020 concerning the distance learning experience revealed, on the one hand, the presence of earlier experience and interest of students in use of smartphone sensors for physics research, on the other hand, the need for clear instructions. The methods proposed by the authors, which are demonstrated on the resource STEM-laboratory MANLab (stemua.science), do not require an experiment in a laboratory and are based on the use of only sensitive elements of a smartphone and PC. The design features of sensors can also be studied during physics lessons.

The MinION sequencing device allows for rapid, cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing; useful features for translation to clinical laboratory settings. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) approaches provide the opportunity to examine the entire genomic material of a sample; allowing for detection of emerging and clinically relevant pathogens that may be missed in targeted assays. Here we present a pilot study on the performance of Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) to amplify RNA randomly for the detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2. We designed a classifier that corrects for barcode crosstalk between specimens. Our assay yielded 100% specificity overall and 95.2% sensitivity for specimens with a RT-qPCR cycle threshold value less than 30. We assembled 10 complete (>95% coverage at 20x depth), and one near-complete (>80% coverage at 20x depth) genomes from 20 specimens that were classified as positive by mNGS. We characterized these genomes through phylogenetic analysis and found that 10/11 specimens from British Columbia had a closest relative to another British Columbian specimen. Of five samples that we had both assembled genomes, as well as Variant of Concern (VOC) PCR results, we found 100% concordance between these results. Additionally, our assay was able to distinguish between the Alpha and Gamma variants, which was not possible with our VOC PCR technique. This study supports future work examining the broader feasibility of SISPA as a diagnostic strategy for the detection and characterization of viral pathogens.","Gauthier, N. P.

180762,Additional heterologous versus homologous booster vaccination in immunosuppressed patients without SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion after primary mRNA vaccination: a randomized controlled trial,2021-09-08,"Sixty days after the lockdown of Hubei Province, where the coronavirus was first reported, China's true recovery from the pandemic remained an outstanding question. This study investigates how human activity changed during this period using observations of surface pollutants. By combining surface data with a three-dimensional chemistry model, the impacts of meteorological variations and variations in yearly emission control are minimized, demonstrating how pollutant levels over China changed before and after the Lunar New Year from 2017 to 2020. The results show that the reduction in NO2 concentrations, an indicator of emissions in the transportation sector, was clearly greater and longer in 2020 than in normal years and started to recover after 15 February. By contrast, PM2.5 emissions had not yet recovered by the end of March, showing a reduction of around 30 % compared with normal years. SO2 emissions were not affected significantly by the pandemic. An additional model study using a top–down emission adjustment still confirms a reduction of around 25 % in unknown surface PM2.5 emissions over the same period, even after realistically updating SO2 and NOx emissions. This evidence suggests that different economic sectors in China may be recovering at different rates, with the fastest recovery in transportation and a slower recovery likely in agriculture. The apparent difference between the recovery timelines of NO2 and PM2.5 implies that monitoring a single pollutant alone (e.g., NOx emissions) is insufficient to draw conclusions on the overall recovery of the Chinese economy.","Kim, Hyun Cheol Kim Soontae Cohen Mark Bae Changhan Lee Dasom Saylor Rick Bae Minah Kim Eunhye Kim Byeong-Uk Jin-Ho Yoon Stein Ariel",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10065-2021,538

Farm to school programs increase children's access to and knowledge of fresh and local foods primarily through experiential learning (Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory) such as gardening, tasting food and field trips. Youth, grades 2-6, and their families who experienced disruption in usual learning and social activities due to COVID-19 restrictions. Experiential activities are the hallmark of farm to school education. In March 2020 all hands-on, school based activities planned by Extension faculty were cancelled due to the pandemic. Faculty responded by offering garden-cooking clubs using a web-based hybrid approach independent of schools. Faculty facilitated bi-weekly virtual meetings of 30 minutes for 6-8 weeks for youth and their families. Asynchronous activities were also offered via a website, kits, video demonstrations, farmers market vouchers and when possible, farm tours. Adult caregivers received a survey at the end of the 6-8 week club sessions to evaluate their child's and family's level of engagement including queries on how much time they spent using web-based tools and how likely they were to start a garden. One hundred and ninety youth, grades 2-6, and their families participated in 4 virtual and/or hybrid clubs delivered by Extension faculty from March 2020 to October 2020. Caregiver responses from the survey (n = 46) indicated 83% of families expanded or started a garden. On average youth and/or families spent 47 minutes per week engaged in program activities including online learning. It appears that virtual programming can actively engage youth and their families in farm to school education and may be a tool to supplement resource intensive hands-on strategies in the future. Further research is need to determine which components are best suited for web-based delivery vs in person delivery. Oregon Department of Education.

However, the absence of much facial information from the masked face will cause failures in many current face recognition and verification functions to recognize the individual's identity. To tackle this problem precisely, our group builds a modified SimCLR model with the contrastive loss that is able to extract similarity features from individuals regardless of whether a mask is worn.

We present two main findings. First, we show that stocks with higher level of margin-trading activity exhibit higher return volatility. The COVID-19 outbreak amplifies the destabilizing effects of margin-trading activity. Second, no evidence shows that short selling destabilizes the stock market in general. However, we observe that intensified short-selling activity is associated with lower return volatility when infection risk is high during the COVID-19 crisis.","Lin, Yongjia Wang Yizhi Fu Xiaoqing",Finance Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102351,538

In-meeting multitasking is closely linked to people's productivity and wellbeing. However, we currently have limited understanding of multitasking in remote meetings and its potential impact. In this paper, we present what we believe is the most comprehensive study of remote meeting multitasking behavior through an analysis of a large-scale telemetry dataset collected from February to May 2020 of U.S. Microsoft employees and a 715-person diary study. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic meeting characteristics such as size, length, time, and type, significantly correlate with the extent to which people multitask, and multitasking can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Our findings suggest important best-practice guidelines for remote meetings (e.g., avoid important meetings in the morning) and design implications for productivity tools (e.g., support positive remote multitasking).","Cao, Hancheng; Lee, Chia-Jung; Iqbal, Shamsi; Czerwinski, Mary; Wong, Priscilla; Rintel, Sean; Hecht, Brent; Teevan, Jaime; Yang, Longqi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11865v1.pdf,538

Investments appear sustained, beginning first with bird feeders, then seed and finally baths. Beyond bird survival, bird feeding can potentially enhance humans' connection to nature and improving human well-being.

When considering a selection of travel and hospitality options, travelers are influenced by perceived crowding. This research examined how the current health crisis (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) affects travelers’ preferences for crowded and non-crowded options. Specifically, we predicted that travelers would have a diminished preference for crowded (vs. non-crowded) travel and hospitality options when the ongoing pandemic is salient. We demonstrated that the primary effect of the salience of the threat was persistent across different travel categories and contexts. We also found that travelers with high levels of sensation seeking and a high need for uniqueness show the opposite pattern, suggesting a possible recovery strategy from the pandemic. This series of five experimental studies provides several theoretical and managerial implications for travel and hospitality business marketers.","Park, In-Jo Kim Jungkeun Kim Seongseop Lee Jacob C.; Giroux, Marilyn",Tourism Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104398,538

If an influenza pandemic occurs, it is expected to have dire consequences, including millions of deaths, social disruption, and enormous economic consequences. The Department of Health and Human Resources plan, released in November 2005, clearly affirms the threat of a pandemic. Anticipating a disruption in many factions of society, every segment of the healthcare industry, including nursing homes, will be affected and will need to be self-sufficient. Disruption of vaccine distribution during the seasonal influenza vaccine shortage during the 2004/05 influenza season is but one example of erratic emergency planning. Nursing homes will have to make vital decisions and provide care to older adults who will not be on the initial priority list for vaccine. At the same time, nursing homes will face an anticipated shortage of antiviral medications and be expected to provide surge capacity for overwhelmed hospitals. This article provides an overview of current recommendations for pandemic preparedness and the potential effect of a pandemic on the nursing home industry. It highlights the need for collaborative planning and dialogue between nursing homes and various stakeholders already heavily invested in pandemic preparedness.","Mody, Lona; Cinti, Sandro",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17767687/,538

METHODS Patients treated with leflunomide for >2 years in one of three phase III trials and subsequent extensions, for whom paired, evaluable radiographs at baseline and study end point were available, were included. Radiographs of hands and feet were assessed according to the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scoring method, for erosion, joint space narrowing, and total score. Changes from baseline were assessed, and a predicted yearly progression rate estimated for each patient. RESULTS 128 of the original 824 patients were included, with mean disease duration 5.1 years and mean leflunomide treatment duration 4.3 years until the final x ray examination. The mean change from baseline in total score was 8.6 with yearly adjusted rate 1.9, and the median change was 2 with yearly adjusted rate 0.5, compared with 7.9 and 4.9, respectively, before leflunomide treatment. After treatment, the rate improved in 92/128 (72%) patients and deteriorated in 21/128 (16%). In 42 (33%) patients who had a total score >0 at baseline, no radiographic progression occurred after leflunomide treatment.

In the present study, we analyzed 252 EV-related infection cases (median age of subjects, 5.1 years) diagnosed among 11,509 consecutive children visiting emergency departments within a 7-year period in the north of France. EV strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal samples by viral cell culture, identified by seroneutralization assay, and genetically compared by partial amplification and sequencing of the VP1 gene. The respiratory syndromes (79 [31%] of 252 EV infections) appeared as the second most common EV-induced pediatric pathology after meningitis (111 [44%] of 252 cases) (44 versus 31%, P < 10(-3)), contributing to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 43 (54%) of 79 EV respiratory infection cases. Bronchiolitis was the most common EV-induced LRTI (34 [43%] of 79 cases, P < 10(-3)) occurring more often in infants aged 1 to 12 months (P = 0.0002), with spring-fall seasonality. Viruses ECHO 11, 6, and 13 were the more frequently identified respiratory strains (24, 13, and 11%, respectively). The VP1 gene phylogenetic analysis showed the concomitant or successive circulation of genetically distinct EV respiratory strains (species A or B) during the same month or annual epidemic period. Our findings indicated that respiratory tract infections accounted for the 30% of EV-induced pediatric pathologies, contributing to LRTIs in 54% of these cases. Moreover, the concomitant or successive circulation of genetically distinct EV strains indicated the possibility of pediatric repeated respiratory infections within the same epidemic season.","Jacques, Jérôme; Moret, Hélène; Minette, Delphine; Lévêque, Nicolas; Jovenin, Nicolas; Deslée, Gaetan; Lebargy, François; Motte, Jacques; Andréoletti, Laurent",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18003804/,538

We performed a retrospective analysis of our laparoscopic donor nephrectomy series with an emphasis on the side of the kidney retrieved and the outcomes of donors and recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data on 94 consecutive donor-recipient pairs (188 patients) were reviewed. All donor nephrectomies were performed by pure laparoscopy. There were 74 left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies and 20 right laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. Intraoperative parameters and graft outcome were recorded and the data were analyzed to compare right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy using a computer software system. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 3.4 y). RESULTS There were no significant differences in any intraoperative or postoperative parameters, except in a slightly higher warm ischemia time in right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, but this did not translate into an adverse effect on renal recovery. Acute graft rejection was observed in 2 of 74 patients who had a left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (2.7%) and none of the patients who had a right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Chronic graft loss was observed in 2 of 74 patients who had a left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (2.7%); 1 of recurrent pyelonephritis and sepsis and 1 renal oxalosis. No graft losses were observed in any patient who had a right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Mean serum creatinine levels in recipients at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were equivalent for right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy; they were 120, 110, 110, 110, 110 µmol/L, versus 110, 110, 110, 110, 110 µmol/L.

The kidney is a richly innervated organ and has both efferent and afferent nerves. Renal denervation shows protective effects against renal failure in both animals and humans. The underlying mechanisms include a decrease in blood pressure, a decrease in renal efferent SNA, a decrease in central SNA and sympathetic outflow, and downregulation of the reninangiotensin system. It has been demonstrated that re-innervation occurs within weeks after renal denervation in animals but that no functional re-innervation occurs in humans for over two years after denervation. Renal denervation might not be renal protective in some situations including bile duct ligation-induced renal failure and ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury. Catheter-based renal denervation has been applied to patients with both early and end stage renal failure and the published results so far suggest that this procedure is safe and effective at decreasing blood pressure. The effectiveness of renal denervation in improving renal function in patients with renal failure needs to be further investigated.","Wang, Yutang; Seto, Sai-Wang; Golledge, Jonathan",Current neurovascular research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23469951/,538

What do we know about the effectiveness and the efficacy of the vaccine against / for SARS-CoV-2 / COVID?],2020,"PURPOSE The use of staplers for thoracic surgery has been regarded as a safe procedure though sometimes adverse events (AEs) of stapling are experienced. The aim of this study is to analyze AEs of lung tissue stapling. METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by 27 institutions of the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group. During the research period, lung tissue stapling was performed 10908 times. RESULTS Total number of AEs related to stapling was 81 (0.74%). Seventy events occurred intraoperatively and 11 events occurred postoperatively. Intraoperative stapling AEs were air leakage (n = 26), laceration of the adjacent lung tissue (n = 23), stapling failure (n = 14), oozing (n = 4), and others (n = 3). The postoperative AEs were prolonged air leakage (n = 9), bleeding from the chest wall (n = 1), and postoperative bleeding (n = 1). Only one case died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia which was induced after completion lobectomy to cure postoperative bleeding. No relationship was seen between the incidence of AE and cartridge colors or compression types of staplers except the length of cartridges. CONCLUSION Lung tissue stapling in thoracic surgery was safe. The most frequent cause of AEs was stapler-tissue thickness mismatch. The appropriate selection of the cartridge color may decrease the AE incidence of the lung tissue stapling.","Yano, Motoki; Iwata, Hisashi; Hashizume, Masahiro; Shigemitsu, Kikuo; Adachi, Katsutoshi; Tokui, Toshiya; Matsuyama, Takaaki",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200667/,538

It has resulted in a pandemic with increasing spread of the virus in the U.S. The county health departments around U.S. are spearheading the response to contain the spread of this virus. Methods This project was a survey of county health departments in the state of Kansas with data collection period from April 15 to April 24, 2020. This study evaluated the staffing, resources, and funding of these health departments and how it was affecting the efforts to contain COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. Results A total of 75% of the county health departments in Kansas responded to the survey. In 89% of locations, the staffing had not increased. Most health departments had an average of five people and the four largest ones had 30 to 98 staff working on COVID-19. Most locations used the Kansas Department of Health and Environment criteria for testing and used a combination of state or private laboratories. The results of the tests were available three days or longer in 62% and after five days in 14% of sites. All locations were active in contact tracing, but most had one to three people for this purpose and in 90% the contact tracing interview was via phone calls. There was no change in funding in 21% and decreased funding in 8.5% of health departments. Most locations had an average of five nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of the survey. The most common needs expressed were help to increase testing capability, more public education, more personal protective equipment, increased personnel, and assistance with contract tracing. Conclusion There is an urgent need in Kansas to increase support to county health departments for testing capability, personal protective equipment, increased number of staff, increased help with contact tracing, and especially increase support for public education.","Raghuveer, Talkad S; Zackula, Rosey E; Wittler, Robert R",Kansas journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32499864/,538
196408,Natural selection versus creation: a review on the origin of SARS-COV-2.,2020-09-01,"Previous studies on different transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains, including porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), have identified regions within the genome that are polymorphic as regards insertions and deletions. For example the 672 base deletion within the S gene and multiple deletions 5', within and 3' of the ORF-3a gene were detected in strains of PRCV. The presence of deletions may be associated with a change in the virulence, attenuation or tissue tropism of the isolate. The Nouzilly (188-SG) TGEV vaccine strain was attenuated by passage of a cell culture adapted virulent isolate D-52 188 times through swine testis cells after treatment with gastric juice. PCR amplification with oligonucleotides, corresponding to known TGEV sequences, were used to analyse D-52 and 188-SG for genetic variation. Results with several pairs of oligonucleotides within the first 1565 nucleotides of the S gene did not identify a deletion within this region of the genome from either strain. However, oligonucleotides directed against the ORF-3a/3b region detected a deletion of about 250 nucleotides within the 188-SG genome but not in the D-52 genome. Since all the attenuated TGEV strains so far sequenced, PRCV, Miller SP and 188-SG, contained deletions within the ORF-3a/3b, it would suggest that this region of the TGEV genome is involved in regulating viral virulence.","Britton, P; Kottier, S; Chen, C M; Pocock, D H; Salmon, H; Aynaud, J M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209745/,538
198131,[SARS-CoV-2 vaccines].,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND A novel lumen-apposing, self-expanding metal stent to perform EUS-guided drainage procedures has been recently developed. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety, technical and clinical effectiveness of this device for EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CD) with palliative intent. METHODS Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with unresectable malignant distal bile duct obstruction who, between March 2012 and September 2014, underwent EUS-CD using the study devices (AXIOS™ and Hot AXIOS™, Xlumena Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) after unsuccessful ERCP in seven European centers was carried out. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (M/F 31/26; median age 73) underwent EUS-CD using the AXIOS™ stent or the Hot AXIOS™ delivery system. ERCP failure was due to duodenal obstruction in 41 patients (71.9 %) and to inability to cannulate the papilla in the remaining 16 patients (28.1 %). The procedure was technically successful in 56/57 patients (98.2 %), with a mean procedural time of 22.4 min (range 11-65). Clinical success was achieved in 54 of these 56 patients (96.4 %; 94.7 % of the entire cohort). Overall major procedural complication rate was 7 % (two duodenal perforations, one bleeding and one transient cholangitis). During follow-up, 5 out of 54 (9.3 %) patients with clinica success required re-intervention for stent migration in one case and a sump syndrome with transient increase in serum bilirubin concentrations with sludge in the distal duct reservoir in the remaining four patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that EUS-CD using the AXIOS™ and the Hot AXIOS™ devices is a safe procedure, with high technical and clinical success rates.","Kunda, Rastislav; Pérez-Miranda, Manuel; Will, Uwe; Ullrich, Sebastian; Brenke, Dirk; Dollhopf, Markus; Meier, Michelle; Larghi, Alberto",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969661/,538

201568,Wearables in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: What Are They Good for?,2020,"The haemagglutinin-esterase gene (HE) of bovine coronavirus (BCV) encodes a major viral membrane glycoprotein that elicits BCV-neutralizing antibodies. The BCV HE gene was cloned into a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) transfer vector in place of early transcription region 3, and a helper-independent recombinant virus was constructed by rescue of the transcription unit by homologous in vivo recombination between the vector and Ad5 genomic DNA. The BCV HE polypeptide expressed by this recombinant Ad was characterized in vivo and in vitro. A 65K polypeptide was identified using an anti-BCV antibody in both human (293) and bovine (MDBK) cells infected with the recombinant Ad. In the absence of a reducing agent, migration of the 65K polypeptide was shifted to 130K, indicating that the recombinant HE polypeptide existed in a dimeric form. The HE polypeptide was glycosylated, as demonstrated by labelling with [3H]glucosamine, and was immunoreactive with three distinct groups of conformation-specific anti-HE monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Cells infected with recombinant Ad expressing BCV HE exhibited both haemadsorption activity and acetylesterase activity. In addition, the anti-HE group A MAbs HC10-5 and KD9-40 inhibited both the haemadsorption activity and esterase activity of the recombinant HE polypeptide, suggesting that the antigenic domain responsible for BCV neutralization may overlap (or is closely associated with) the domain(s) responsible for haemagglutination and/or acetylesterase activities. When mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with live recombinant Ad, a significant level of BCV-neutralizing HE-specific antibody was induced. These results indicate that the recombinant Ad replicates and directs the synthesis of the BCV HE polypeptide in vivo.","Yoo, D; Graham, F L; Prevec, L; Parker, M D; Benkö, M; Zamb, T; Babiuk, L A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1402802/,538

By mid-march 2020, there was closure of key business and educational institutions. To minimise the loss of learning time, emergency remote learning became the modus-operandi, a response which challenged the most socially vulnerable students. At the University of the West Indies (UWI) the 500 participants enrolled in the Early Childhood, and Primary education programmes, and the in-service post-graduate diploma in Secondary education were struggling to adjust to online teaching, the existential anxiety of coping with a dangerous disease, and programme completion. The UWI instituted a COVID-19 policy that facilitated a structured response to programme completion and assessment across all faculties.The paper analysed the decisions taken by the UWI School of Education that supported its teachers through the practicum and pedagogy courses. Using a qualitative case study methodology, data were collected through observations, documents, and informal discussions with faculty. Thematic analyses allowed the emergence of three key constructs that facilitated effective learning during the crisis period : Community as an empathetic connection to stakeholders, Creativity as the ability for agile and imaginative responses, and Connectivity through technological readiness.","Kalloo, Rowena Constance; Mitchell, Beular; Kamalodeen, Vimala Judy",J.

This study investigated the key features of BAL fluids from COVID-19 patients and assessed their clinical significance. A total of 320 BAL samples from 83 COVID-19 patients and 70 non-COVID-19 patients (27 patients with other respiratory viral infections) were evaluated, including cell count/differential, morphology, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and immunohistochemistry. The findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, BAL from COVID-19 patients was characterized by significant lymphocytosis (p < 0.001), in contrast to peripheral blood lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients and the presence of atypical lymphocytes with plasmacytoid/plasmablastic features (p < 0.001). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that BAL lymphocytes, including plasmacytoid and plasmablastic cells, were composed predominantly of T cells with a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Both populations had increased expression of T-cell activation markers, suggesting important roles of helper and cytotoxic T-cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. More importantly, BAL lymphocytosis was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.05) and longer requirement for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), whereas the median atypical (activated) lymphocyte count was associated with shorter hospital stay (p < 0.05), shorter time on mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05) and improved survival. Our results indicate that BAL cellular analysis and morphologic findings provide additional important information for diagnostic and prognostic work-up, and potential new therapeutic strategies for patients with severe COVID-19.","Gelarden, Ian; Nguyen, Jessica; Gao, Juehua; Chen, Qing; Morales-Nebreda, Luisa; Wunderink, Richard; Li, Lin; Chmiel, Joan S; Hrisinko, MaryAnn; Marszalek, Laura; Momnani, Sumaiya; Patel, Pinal; Sumugod, Ricardo; Chao, Qi; Jennings, Lawrence J; Zembower, Teresa R; Ji, Peng; Chen, Yi-Hua",Hum Pathol,,538

203248,The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on phototherapy utilization,2021,"At present, there is no vaccine or effective standard treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (or coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)), which frequently leads to lethal pulmonary inflammatory responses. COVID-19 pathology is characterized by extreme inflammation and amplified immune response with activation of a cytokine storm. A subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can take place, which is often followed by death. The causes of these strong inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown. As uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely the main cause of death in SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-inflammatory therapeutic interventions are particularly important. Fenretinide N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide is a bioactive molecule characterized by poly-pharmacological properties and a low toxicity profile. Fenretinide is endowed with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties other than efficacy in obesity/diabetic pathologies. Its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, in particular, could likely have utility in multimodal therapies for the treatment of ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, fenretinide administration by pulmonary delivery systems could further increase its therapeutic value by carrying high drug concentrations to the lungs and triggering a rapid onset of activity. This is particularly important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention.","Orienti, Isabella; Gentilomi, Giovanna Angela; Farruggia, Giovanna",,,538

Here, we aimed to characterize the early clinical features of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: All consecutive lung cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in Hubei province, China, from 3 January to 6 May 2020 were included in the study. Patients without definite clinical outcomes during the period were excluded. Data on initial clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 45 lung cancer patients (median [interquartile range] age, 66 [58-74] years; 68.9% males) included, 34 (75.6%) discharged and 11 (24.4%) died. Fever (73.3%) and cough (53.3%) were the dominant initial symptoms, and respiratory symptoms were common. Lung cancer patients also presented atypical appearances of COVID-19. In the multivariable analysis, prolonged prolongation prothrombin time (PT) (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.00-4.41, P = 0.0497) and elevated high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TNI) (OR = 7.65, 95% CI: 1.24-47.39, P = 0.0287) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients with COVID-19 have high in-hospital mortality. Prolonged PT and elevated hs-TNI are independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Lung cancer patients with COVID-19 have atypical early symptoms and imaging features.

The survey was repeated among a subsample of the participants in April 2020, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and in an extended sample in June 2020, after some measures were relaxed.ResultsThe average number of community contacts per day was reduced from 14.9 (interquartile range (IQR): 4-20) in the 2016-17 survey to 3.5 (IQR: 0-4) after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and rebounded to 8.8 (IQR: 1-10) after some measures were relaxed. All age groups restricted their community contacts to at most 5, on average, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented. In children, the number of community contacts reverted to baseline levels after measures were eased, while individuals aged 70 years and older had less than half their baseline levels.ConclusionStrict physical distancing measures greatly reduced overall contact numbers, which likely contributed to curbing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands. However, age groups reacted differently when measures were relaxed, with children reverting to normal contact numbers and elderly individuals maintaining restricted contact numbers. These findings offer guidance for age-targeted measures in future waves of the pandemic.","Backer, Jantien A; Mollema, Liesbeth; Vos, Eric Ra; Klinkenberg, Don; van der Klis, Fiona Rm; de Melker, Hester E; van den Hof, Susan; Wallinga, Jacco",Euro surveill,,538
204914,A trimeric human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in vitro,2020,"BackgroundThe current practice of COVID-19 diagnosis worldwide is the use of oro-nasopharyngeal (ONP) swabs. Our study aim was to explore mouthwash (MW) as an alternative diagnostic method, in light of the disadvantages of ONP swabs. MethodsCovid-19 outpatients molecular-confirmed by ONP-swab were repeatedly examined with ONP-swab and MW with normal-saline (0.9%). Other types of fluids were compared to normal-saline. The Cq values obtained with each method were compared. ResultsAmong 137 pairs of ONP-swabs and MW samples, 84.6% (116/137) of ONP-swabs were positive by at least one of the genes (N, E, R). However MW detected 70.8% (97/137) of samples as positive, which means 83.6% (97/116) out of positive ONP-swabs, missing mainly Cq value>30. In both methods, the N gene was the most sensitive one. Therefore MW samples targeting N-gene, which was positive in 95/137 (69.3%), is comparable to ONP-swabs targeting E and R genes which gave equal results - 95/137 (69.3%) and 90/137 (65.7%) respectively. Comparing saline MW to distilled-water gave equal results, while commercial mouth-rinsing solutions were less sensitive. ConclusionsMW with normal-saline, especially when tested by N gene, can effectively detect COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, this method was not inferior when compared to R and E genes of ONP-swabs, which are common targets in many laboratories around the world.","Biber, Asaf; Lev, Dana; Mandelboim, Michal; Lustig, Yaniv; Harmelin, Geva; Shaham, Amit; Erster, Oran; Schwartz, Eli",,,538
205176,Potential Compounds for the Inhibition of TMPRSS2,2020,"In the case of airborne diseases, pathogen copies are transmitted by droplets of respiratory tract fluid that are exhaled by the infectious that stay suspended in the air for some time and, after partial or full drying, inhaled as aerosols by the susceptible. The risk of infection in indoor environments is typically modelled using the Wells-Riley model or a Wells-Riley-like formulation, usually assuming the pathogen dose follows a Poisson distribution (mono-pathogen assumption). Aerosols that hold more than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption even if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest aerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several hundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in diseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a generalization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for poly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies per aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This results in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for mono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption significantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen concentrations in the respiratory tract fluid. The model also includes the aerosol removal due to filtering by the individuals which becomes significant for poorly ventilated environments with a high density of individuals, and systematically includes the effects of facemasks in the infectious aerosol source and sink terms and dose calculations.","Nordsiek, Freja; Bodenschatz, Eberhard; Bagheri, Gholamhossein",PLoS One,,538

Recent structural data suggest that the spikes possess orientational freedom and the ribonucleoproteins segregate into basketlike structures. How these structural features regulate the dynamic and mechanical behavior of the native virion are yet unknown. By imaging and mechanically manipulating individual, native SARS-CoV-2 virions with atomic force microscopy, here, we show that their surface displays a dynamic brush owing to the flexibility and rapid motion of the spikes. The virions are highly compliant and able to recover from drastic mechanical perturbations. Their global structure is remarkably temperature resistant, but the virion surface becomes progressively denuded of spikes upon thermal exposure. The dynamics and the mechanics of SARS-CoV-2 are likely to affect its stability and interactions.","Kiss, Bálint; Kis, Zoltán; Pályi, Bernadett; Kellermayer, Miklós S Z",Nano lett,,538

During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, the UCSF Craniofacial Center saw an average of 40 patients across 81 visits each day, compared to 58 patients across 138 visits the year prior. Of all, 88% of visits occurred over telehealth, whereas none occurred prior to COVID-19;87% of patients were satisfied with their video visits, and 93% felt comfortable using the telehealth technology. Furthermore, 87% of patients agreed that video visits saved time (median 3.0 hours, IQR 0.5-4.3), and 68% saved money. However, 47% preferred in-person appointments, with the desire for a complete physical exam cited as the most common reason. Before and after our telehealth transition, similar proportions of patients trusted their provider (P = .39), found that their provider explained things well (P = .36), and would recommend their provider to a friend (P = .13). Fewer telehealth patients agreed that their pain was fully addressed (62% vs. 82%, P = .002) and felt that they had enough input in their care (66% vs. 79%, P = .04). Conclusions: Telehealth is an effective tool in delivering interdisciplinary craniofacial care, associated with time and money savings. However, patients continue to prefer in-person visits in many cases, and the true safety and efficacy of this care methodology remains unknown. To address some of these challenges, providers should receive specific training on virtual communication to facilitate patient input into their care.","Badiee, R.; Willsher, H.; Rorison, E.; Langham, M.; Donnelly, A.; Rosenbluth, G.; Pomerantz, J.",Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal,,538

211581,Maternal-Fetal Immune Responses in Pregnant Women Infected with SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Research in forensic psychiatric care focusing on person-oriented care is ambiguous about matters of quality. The encounters between a healthcare professional (HCP) and patient could influence how connections and relations emerge between the caregiver and the patient. OBJECTIVES: To better understand caring aspects, this study explores significant encounters in forensic psychiatric care from the perspective of HCPs. METHOD: This study is based on 34 written narratives from HCPs from two forensic psychiatric hospitals in Sweden. The narratives concern significant encounters with a patient. These narratives were analysed according to methodologies developed by phenomenological and reflective lifeworld research. FINDINGS: The essence of a significant encounter is a temporal extended phenomenon that both precedes as well as is a consequence of the actual encounter as it occurs. The encounter is unforeseeable and being open to an encounter also means to be vulnerable as it is not predetermined how someone will respond. The significant encounter is an act of sharing, and HCPs may come to understand more about their patients as well as about themselves. Moreover, these encounters seem to create repercussions and hope for the future care. CONCLUSIONS: The everyday activities of forensic psychiatric care are not trivial activities. Rather, they are important aspects of health care as these everyday encounters can deepen the relationship between the HCPs and their patients and help both the HCPs and their patients develop a sense of hope for the future.","Rytterström, Patrik; Rydenlund, Kenneth; Ranheim, Albertine",Scand. j. caring sci,,538
211728,Disproportionate Case Reduction After Ban of Elective Surgeries During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic initially started in China then spread to Europe. It is not known whether COVID-19 affects patients differently across the two continents. We aimed to describe our cohort of patients admitted to a single British centre with COVID-19 in comparison to a Chinese cohort of similar size and admitted over a similar time period to Chinese centres. We present a comparison of 62 Chinese and 71 British cases hospitalised for COVID-19. Cases in both sites were confirmed by a positive RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Comparison analysis highlighted some differences between both populations. The most striking difference is the significantly older age of the British population (72% of the British &#8805; 66 years compared to only 3% of the Chinese patients, difference of 69%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 68.3% to 69.7%, respectively) and the associated significant premorbid conditions (85% of patients vs 32%, difference of 53%, 95% CI 52 to 54%, respectively). Gastrointestinal and general symptoms were more common clinical presentation in the British while respiratory symptoms were more prominent in the Chinese cohort. Mortality was significantly higher in the British cohort 14% compared to none in the Chinese cohort (difference of 14%, 95% CI 13.7 to 14.3%). We conclude that COVID-19 does present differently in these two cohorts, but the apparent differences in the clinical presentations could be explained by the inherent differences in the demographics and case mix between both countries.","Conway, J; Gould, A; Westley, R; Khan, S; Emmerton, D; Raju, S A; Oklopcic, A; Broadbent, A; Abdelhafiz, A H",SN Compr Clin Med,,538

The novel disease is a prime example of a development challenge for all countries, through the failure of public health as a global public good. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the falsity of any assumption that the global North has all the expertise and solutions to tackle global challenges, and has further highlighted the need for multi-directional learning and transformation in all countries towards a more sustainable and equitable world. We illustrate our argument for a global development paradigm by examining the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic across four themes or 'vignettes': global value chains, digitalisation, debt, and climate change. We conclude that development studies must adapt to a very different context from when the field emerged in the mid-20th century.","Oldekop, Johan A.; Horner, Rory; Hulme, David; Adhikari, Roshan; Agarwal, Bina; Alford, Matthew; Bakewell, Oliver; Banks, Nicola; Barrientos, Stephanie; Bastia, Tanja; Bebbington, Anthony J.; Das, Upasak; Dimova, Ralitza; Duncombe, Richard; Enns, Charis; Fielding, David; Foster, Christopher; Foster, Timothy; Frederiksen, Tomas; Gao, Ping; Gillespie, Tom; Heeks, Richard; Hickey, Sam; Hess, Martin; Jepson, Nicholas; Karamchedu, Ambarish; Kothari, Uma; Krishnan, Aarti; Lavers, Tom; Mamman, Aminu; Mitlin, Diana; Monazam Tabrizi, Negar; Müller, Tanja R.; Nadvi, Khalid; Pasquali, Giovanni; Pritchard, Rose; Pruce, Kate; Rees, Chris; Renken, Jaco; Savoia, Antonio; Schindler, Seth; Surmeier, Annika; Tampubolon, Gindo; Tyce, Matthew; Unnikrishnan, Vidhya; Zhang, Yin-Fang",World Dev.,,538

However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC50 of 0.6 µg/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed an unusual conformation of the spike where two RBDs are in the 'up' ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly emerging viruses.","Custódio, Tânia F; Das, Hrishikesh; Sheward, Daniel J; Hanke, Leo; Pazicky, Samuel; Pieprzyk, Joanna; Sorgenfrei, Michèle; Schroer, Martin A; Gruzinov, Andrey Yu; Jeffries, Cy M; Graewert, Melissa A; Svergun, Dmitri I; Dobrev, Nikolay; Remans, Kim; Seeger, Markus A; McInerney, Gerald M; Murrell, Ben; Hällberg, B Martin; Löw, Christian",Nat Commun,,538

Treatment strategies and vaccination for this disease are yet to be explored. Therefore, at this time, the best-proposed health measure to break the chain of transmission is social distancing or, in some instances, quarantine. In a recent systematic review published in Lancet, Brooks et al. (2) evaluated the psychological impacts of quarantine during the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Accordingly, most of the reviewed studies reported adverse psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger (2). Delays in psychological interventions in such situations can lead to psychological damage to individuals who are involved (3). However, people with a pre-existing mental health problem such as anxiety or depressive disorder would be more vulnerable to experience adverse psychological effects of quarantine and social distancing.","Ahadi, Maral Seyed; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Rezaeimanesh, Nasim; Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser",Iran.

METHODS: We conducted a survey with sections addressing hospital characteristics, changes in infrastructure and resources, code stroke clinical pathways, diagnostic testing, rehabilitation, and outpatient care. We performed a descriptive analysis of results according to the level of complexity of stroke care (availability of stroke units and mechanical thrombectomy). RESULTS: The survey was completed by 22 of the 26 hospitals in the Madrid Regional Health System that attend adult emergencies, between 16 and 27 April 2020. Ninety-five percent of hospitals had reallocated neurologists to care for patients with COVID-19. The numbers of neurology ward beds were reduced in 89.4% of hospitals; emergency department stroke care pathways were modified in 81%, with specific pathways for suspected SARS-CoV2 infection established in 50% of hospitals; and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with acute stroke were not admitted to neurology wards in 42%. Twenty-four hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy was improved in 10 hospitals, which resulted in a reduction in the number of secondary hospital transfers. The admission of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke was avoided in 45% of hospitals, and follow-up through telephone consultations was implemented in 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The organisational changes made in response to the SARS-Co2 pandemic in hospitals in the Region of Madrid have modified the allocation of neurology department staff and infrastructure, stroke units and stroke care pathways, diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, and outpatient follow-up.","Fuentes, B; Alonso de Leciñana, M; Calleja-Castaño, P; Carneado-Ruiz, J; Egido-Herrero, J; Gil-Núñez, A; Masjuán-Vallejo, J; Vivancos-Mora, J; Rodríguez-Pardo, J; Riera-López, N; Ximénez-Carrillo, Á; Cruz-Culebras, A; Gómez-Escalonilla, C; Díez-Tejedor, E",Neurologia,,538

To inform effective public health measures we conducted a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey among a Hausa Muslim society in Nigeria in March 2020. METHODS: The study is an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling following informed consent. The percentage of KAP scores were categorized as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of COVID 19 were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The questionnaire was administered among urban 32.8%, peri-urban dwellers 32.4%, and to online participants 34.8%. The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs-32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God's punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a man-made virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. &#8805; 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23.64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79-3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19.","Habib, Maryam Abdulrazaq; Dayyab, Farouq Muhammad; Iliyasu, Garba; Habib, Abdulrazaq G",PLoS One,,538

An online survey was conducted with the IRB Directors at Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) institutions as well as two focus groups. Across the CTSA institutions, 66% reviewed COVID-19 protocols across all their IRB committees, 22% assigned protocols to just one committee, and 10% created a new committee for COVID-19 protocols. Fifty-two percent reported COVID-19 protocols were reviewed much faster, 41% somewhat faster, and 7% at the same speed as other protocols. Three percent reported that the COVID-19 protocols were reviewed with much better quality, 32% reported slightly better quality, and 65% reported the reviews were of the same quality as similar protocols before the COVID-19 pandemic. IRBs were able to respond to the emergent demand for reviewing COVID-19 protocols.

220511,Network Analysis and Transcriptome Profiling Identify Autophagic and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread to nearly every country in the world. The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS: When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 µM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A meta-analysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions). CONCLUSION: It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Hufert, Frank; Siewert, Stefan; Reisinger, Emil",Dtsch.

RESULTS: Parents described Capability-based facilitators of parent involvement, including positive stress management, religious/spiritual coping, organizational/planning skills, and diabetes knowledge. Capability-based barriers included child and parent distress. Interpersonal relationships, degree of flexibility in work environments, and access to diabetes technologies were both Opportunity-based facilitators and barriers; and Opportunity-based barriers consisted of food insecurity/low financial resources. Parents' desire for their child to have a ""normal"" life was described as both a Motivation-based facilitator and barrier. CONCLUSIONS: African American and Latino families described helpful and unhelpful factors that spanned all aspects of the COM-B model. Reinforcing or targeting families' unique psychological, interpersonal, and environmental strengths and challenges in multilevel interventions has potential to maximize parental involvement in children's diabetes management.","Butler, Ashley M; Hilliard, Marisa E; Titus, Courtney; Rodriguez, Evadne; Al-Gadi, Iman; Cole-Lewis, Yasmin; Thompson, Deborah",J Pediatr Psychol,,538

To date, there has not been any broad assessment of urological surgery residency changes and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Society of Academic Urologists distributed a questionnaire to urology residency program directors on March 30, 2020 exploring residency program changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics are presented. A qualitative analysis of free response questions was undertaken. A post hoc analysis of differences related to local COVID-19 incidence is described. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 144 residency programs with 65 responses for a 45% response rate. Reserve staffing had started in 80% of programs. Patient contact time had decreased significantly from 4.7 to 2.1 days per week (p <0.001). Redeployment was reported by 26% of programs. Sixty percent of programs reported concern that residents will not meet case minimums due to COVID-19. Wellness activities centered on increased communication. All programs had begun to use videoconferencing and the majority planned to continue. Programs in states with a higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, p=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19 positive patients (70% vs 40%, p=0.03), and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, p=0.02) and personal protective equipment availability (62% vs 89%, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: As of April 1, 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in significant changes in urology residency programs. These findings inform a rapidly changing landscape and aid in the development of best practices.","Rosen, Geoffrey H; Murray, Katie S; Greene, Kirsten L; Pruthi, Raj S; Richstone, Lee; Mirza, Moben",J Urol,,538

Here, we developed a renal-accumulating DNA nanodevice with exclusive kidney retention for longitudinal protection of AKI in different stages in a renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model. Due to the prolonged kidney retention time (>12 h), the ROS-sensitive nucleic acids of the nanodevice could effectively alleviate oxidative stress by scavenging ROS in stage I, and then the anticomplement component 5a (aC5a) aptamer loaded nanodevice could sequentially suppress the inflammatory responses by blocking C5a in stage II, which is directly related to the cytokine storm. This sequential therapy provides durable and pathogenic treatment of kidney dysfunction based on successive pathophysiological events induced by I/R, which holds great promise for renal management and the suppression of the cytokine storm in more broad settings including COVID-19.","Chen, Qian; Ding, Fei; Zhang, Shuangye; Li, Qian; Liu, Xiaoguo; Song, Haiyun; Zuo, Xiaolei; Fan, Chunhai; Mou, Shan; Ge, Zhilei",Nano Lett,,538

An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among individuals older than 18 years in April 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included health behaviour and weight change data. Altogether 2447 subjects participated in the survey. Almost half of the respondents (49.4%) ate more than usual, 45.1% increased snacking, and 62.1% cooked at home more often. Intake of carbonated or sugary drinks, fast food and commercial pastries decreased, while consumption of homemade pastries and fried food increased. A decrease in physical activity was reported by 60.6% of respondents. Every third (31.5%) respondent, more often those already with overweight, gained weight. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the higher odds of weight gain were associated with females, older age, increased consumption of sugary drinks, homemade pastries and fried food, eating more than usual, increased snacking, decreased physical activity and increased alcohol consumption. Our data highlighted the need for dietary and physical activity guidelines to prevent weight gain during the period of self-isolation, especially targeting those with overweight and obesity.","Kriaucioniene, Vilma; Bagdonaviciene, Lina; Rodríguez-Pérez, Celia; Petkeviciene, Janina",Nutrients,,538

To date, empirical evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on TB outcomes has been limited. Here we summarise the evidence available at a country level, identifying broad mechanisms by which COVID-19 may modify TB burden and mitigation efforts. From the data, it is clear that there have been substantial disruptions to TB health services and an increase in vulnerability to TB. Evidence for changes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission is limited, and it remains unclear how the resources required and available for the TB response have changed. To advocate for additional funding to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the global TB burden, and to efficiently allocate resources for the TB response, requires a significant improvement in the TB data available.","McQuaid, C F; Vassall, A; Cohen, T; Fiekert, K; White, R G",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,,538

229311,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the western world: the lessons learned,2020,"We consider the task of Medical Concept Normalization (MCN) which aims to map informal medical phrases such as ""loosing weight"" to formal medical concepts, such as ""Weight loss"". Deep learning models have shown high performance across various MCN datasets containing small number of target concepts along with adequate number of training examples per concept. However, scaling these models to millions of medical concepts entails the creation of much larger datasets which is cost and effort intensive. Recent works have shown that training MCN models using automatically labeled examples extracted from medical knowledge bases partially alleviates this problem. We extend this idea by computationally creating a distant dataset from patient discussion forums. We extract informal medical phrases and medical concepts from these forums using a synthetically trained classifier and an off-the-shelf medical entity linker respectively. We use pretrained sentence encoding models to find the k-nearest phrases corresponding to each medical concept. These mappings are used in combination with the examples obtained from medical knowledge bases to train an MCN model. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 15.9% and 17.1% classification accuracy across two datasets while avoiding manual labeling.","Pattisapu, Nikhil; Anand, Vivek; Patil, Sangameshwar; Palshikar, Girish; Varma, Vasudeva",J Biomed Inform,,538
229338,Comparison of Two Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) and Two Antigen Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Upper Respiratory Specimens,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid production of vaccines aimed at the production of neutralizing antibodies against the COVID-19 spike protein required for the corona virus binding to target cells. The best well-known vaccines have utilized either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to direct human cells to produce the spike protein against which the body produces mostly neutralizing antibodies. However, recent reports have raised some skepticism as to the biologic actions of the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a response to oxidative stress is required by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes. In this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural anti-oxidants with multiple health effects. Hence, there are even more reasons to intervene with the use of anti-oxidant compounds, such as luteolin, in addition to available vaccines and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the harmful actions of the spike protein.","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,538

Initially, a mediation model verified a partially mediated population role in the relationship between landscape pattern and infection number. Adjusted incidence rate (AIR) and community safety index (CSI), two indicators for infection risk in sub-districts, were 25.82â¼63.56 &#8241; and 3.00â¼15.87 respectively, and central urban sub-districts were at higher infection risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) performed better than OLS regression with AICc differences of 7.951â¼181.261. The adjusted R2 in GWR models of class-level index and infection risk were 0.697 to 0.817, while for the landscape-level index they were 0.668 to 0.835. Secondly, 16 key landscape metrics were identified based on GWR, and then a prediction model for infection risk in sub-districts and communities was developed. Using principal component analysis (PCA), development intensity, landscape level, and urban blue-green space were considered to be principal components affecting disease infection risk, explaining 73.1% of the total variance. Cropland (PLAND and LSI), urban land (NP, LPI, and LSI) and unused land (NP) represent development intensity, greatly affecting infection risk in urban areas. Landscape level CONTAG, DIVISION, SHDI, and SHEI represent mobility and connectivity, having a profound impact on infection risk in both urban and suburban areas. Water (PLAND, NP, LPI, and LSI) and woodland (NP, and LSI) represent urban blue-green spaces, and were particularly important for infection risk in suburban areas. Based on urban landscape pattern, we proposed a framework to understand and evaluate infection risk. These findings provide a basis for risk evaluation and policy-making of urban infectious disease, which is significant for community management and urban planning for infectious disease worldwide.","Ye, Yang; Qiu, Hongfei",Urban For Urban Green,,538

We carry out a randomized field experiment in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, in which we provide an information brief about COVID-19 by phone to a random subsample of participants to address stigma and misconceptions. We find that the information brief decreases stigmatization of COVID-19 patients and certain groups such as religious minorities, lower-caste groups, and frontline workers (healthcare, police), and reduces the belief that infection cases are more prevalent among certain marginalized social and economic groups (Muslims, low caste, rural-poor population). We provide suggestive evidence that improved knowledge about the prevention and transmission of COVID-19 and reduced stress about the disease are important channels for the reduction in stigmatization.","Islam, Asad; Pakrashi, Debayan; Vlassopoulos, Michael; Wang, Liang Choon",Soc Sci Med,,538

The research study will focus on permanence in ranking, global valuation, and training. To do this, control variables were added: business management gender, geo-cultural areas, regional areas, economic activity, size and stock market membership. This is a quantitative work, where statistics such as partial correlations, Pearson coefficients and independent sample means were used with the Levene test;in modeling, multiple regressions of ordinary least squares (OLS) and panel data were used. It is concluded that the permanence in the ranking significantly increases the total value and training, which leads companies to excellence, along with the fact that they are in the capital of the country and that they focus on the commerce, professional, scientific and technical, and finance and insurance sectors. On the other hand, assessment of training is explained by employee valuation, the work environment and talent management. On the contrary, factors such as the gender variable in the business direction, nationality, size and stock market membership do not significantly influence the overall valuation.","Ferreiro-Seoane, Francisco J.; Miguéns-Refojo, Vanessa Atrio-Lema Yago",Sustainability,,538

Despite the strong efforts taken to control the epidemic, hundreds of thousands of people were infected worldwide by 11 March, and the situation was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infection due to immune and anatomic alteration, though hospital visits may increase the chance of infection, the lack of medical care during pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, a well-managed system that allows pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is desired during the outbreak. Here, we present the managing processes of three pregnant women who had fever during hospitalization in the gynecology or obstetrics department, and then, we further summarize and demonstrate our maternal health care management strategies including antenatal care planning, patient triage based on the risk level, admission control, and measures counteracting emergencies and newly discovered high-risk cases at in-patient department. In the meantime, we will explain the alterations we have done throughout different stages of the epidemic and also review relative articles in both Chinese and English to compare our strategies with those of other areas. Although tens of COVID-19 cases were confirmed in our hospital, no nosocomial infection has occurred and none of the pregnant women registered in our hospital was reported to be infected.","Chen, Yu; Li, Zhe; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Zhao, Wei-Hua; Yu, Zhi-Ying",J Med Virol,,538

235958,Pooled Testing Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: A comprehensive review,2021,"In many longitudinal studies, the covariate and response are often intermittently observed at irregular, mismatched and subject-specific times. How to deal with such data when covariate and response are observed asynchronously is an often raised problem. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees(BART) is a Bayesian non-Parametric approach which has been shown to be competitive with the best modern predictive methods such as random forest and boosted decision trees. The sum of trees structure combined with a Bayesian inferential framework provide a accurate and robust statistic method. BART variant soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees(SBART) constructed using randomized decision trees was developed and substantial theoretical and practical benefits were shown. In this paper, we propose a weighted SBART model solution for asynchronous longitudinal data. In comparison to other methods, the current methods are valid under with little assumptions on the covariate process. Extensive simulation studies provide numerical support for this solution. And data from an HIV study is used to illustrate our methodology","Ran, Hao; Bai, Yang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11603v1.pdf,538

Demonstration electric toothbrushes are used intra-orally for education. The aim of this investigation was to measure the size of droplets emitted by the brush head of two demonstration oscillating-rotating electric toothbrushes. Measurement of droplet production and size was recorded in vitro using three methods: (1) Malvern Spraytec (LASER particle size measurement device with detectable particle size of 0.1-2500 µm) and brushes mounted on a 3D-printed, two-shell form-fit fixture with a supply of tap water; (2) a DustTrak aerosol measurement device and toothpaste slurry, with brushing simulated in the oral cavity of a phantom head; (3) high-speed visualization in a simulated-use situation in the oral cavity of a phantom head, with individual evaluation of tap water, water with detergent, 70% ethanol, glycerin and toothpaste slurry. Both brushes showed the size of emitted droplets was consistently between 200 and 1200 µm, categorized as splatter (dental aerosols are <50 µm diameter). No significant incremental aerosol-sized matter was detected during toothbrush operation. The high-speed video visualization confirmed only splatter-sized droplets during operation. These findings indicate that oscillating-rotating toothbrushes do not produce aerosol-sized particles during simulated use.","Mark, Erwin P; Lewis, Michael A O; Graziani, Filippo; Atlas, Boris; Utsch, Joern",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,538

In March 2020, all elective surgery and elective outpatient clinics were cancelled in our institution, a regional hospital in Northern New South Wales, Australia. With regard to orthopaedic fracture clinics, a telehealth system was implemented on an emergency basis for patient and staff safety to prevent disease transmission. The aim of our study was to investigate whether rapid implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinics resulted in an increase in complications. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all patients with orthopaedic fracture clinic appointments at a regional New South Wales hospital between 17 March and 8 May 2020 was undertaken. There were 191 patients, including 390 appointments of which 23.1% were conducted via telehealth, namely by phone call. Complications requiring phone calls to the orthopaedic team, presentations to the emergency department, admission to hospital or return to theatre, were recorded. RESULTS: There was no increase in complications following emergent implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinic follow-up in our institution. Patients in the telehealth group were significantly older than those in the clinic group. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that application of telehealth fracture clinics in a regional Australian setting can be achieved without increasing complication rates and can be used to formulate a rapid telehealth implementation plan if a similar scenario occurs in the future.","Smith, Ariella J; Pfister, Benjamin F; Woo, Elise W Y; Walters, Benjamin J; Blacket, Benedict; Page, Nicholas; Drobetz, Herwig",ANZ J Surg,,538

BACKGROUND: In Italy, COVID outbreak has mostly occurred in the metropolitan area of Milan, and in the surrounding region of Lombardy, and previously ""conventional"" hospitals were converted into COVID spokes to increase ICU beds availability, and to allow only urgent CS procedures. METHODS: Among urgent CS patients (left main stenosis with unstable angina, acute endocarditis, valvular regurgitation with impending heart failure), 10 patients (mean age = 57 ± 9 years), despite a negative admission triage, developed COVID-pneumonia postoperatively, at a median of 7 days after CS. RESULTS: Patients showed typical lymphopenia, higher prothrombotic profile, and higher markers of inflammation (ferritin and interleukin-6 values). At the zenith of pulmonary distress, patients presented with severe hypoxia (median PaO2/FIO2 ratio = 116), requiring advanced noninvasive ventilation (Venturi mask and continuous positive airway pressure) in the majority of cases. All patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and low-molecular-weight heparin at anticoagulant dose. Overall in-hospital mortality was 10% (1/10), peaking 25% in patients who developed COVID pneumonia immediately after CS. The remaining patients, with late infection, were all discharged home without oxygen support, at a median of 25 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: As postoperative mortality in case of COVID pneumonia is not negligible, meticulous rules (precise triage, safe hospital path, high level of protection for health-care teams, prompt diagnosis of suspicious symptoms) should be strictly followed in patients undergoing CS during COVID pandemic. The role of therapies alternative to CS should be further assessed.","Garatti, Andrea; Castelvecchio, Serenella; Daprati, Andrea; Molfetta, Raffaella; Volpe, Marianna; De Vincentiis, Carlo; Parolari, Alessandro; Menicanti, Lorenzo",Ann Surg,,538

Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey. The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28% completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (n = (25%), n = (16%) and n = (39%), respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84% said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020. Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supporting delivery of tailored messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.","Feldman, M.; Krylova, V.

However, how the S1 subunit undergoes conformational changes for receptor recognition has not been elucidated in Alphacoronavirus. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HCoV-229E S trimer in prefusion state with two conformations. The activated conformation may pose the potential exposure of the S1-RBDs by decreasing of the interaction area between the S1-RBDs and the surrounding S1-NTDs and S1-RBDs compared to the closed conformation. Furthermore, structural comparison of our structures with the previously reported HCoV-229E S structure showed that the S trimers trended to open the S2 subunit from the closed conformation to open conformation, which could promote the transition from pre- to postfusion. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in S glycoprotein-mediated Alphacoronavirus entry and have implications for vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.","Song, Xiyong; Shi, Yuejun; Ding, Wei; Niu, Tongxin; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Chen, Yong; Shi, Jiale; Xiong, Qiqi; Huang, Xiaojun; Xiao, Shaobo; Zhu, Yanping; Cheng, Chongyun; Fu, Zhen F; Liu, Zhi-Jie; Peng, Guiqing",Nat Commun,,538

Gradual deterioration of the patient's fitness is resistant to nutritional intervention. The biochemical foundation of observed catabolism, detrimental protein, and energy balance is complex. However, the generalized inflammatory response plays a vital role. It is a kind of cytokine storm, which involves increased activity of TNF-&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, and INF-Î³. Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to a form of intracellular starvation in both cytokine-releasing cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ and HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction showed significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities. Therefore, we hypothesize that low doses of CQ/HCQ may prove efficient in cancer cachexia.","Kiedrowski, Miroslaw; Kapala, Przemyslaw; Kiedrowska, Marlena; Skoczynska, Anna; Czerw, Aleksandra; Deptala, Andrzej",Med Hypotheses,,538

The post-hospitalization needs of COVID-19 patients were not understood and no outpatient rehabilitation programs had been described. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a virtual rehabilitation program would lead to improvements in strength and cardiopulmonary endurance when compared with no intervention in patients discharged home with persistent COVID-19 symptoms. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Between April and July 2020, 106 patients discharged home with persistent COVID-19 symptoms were treated. Forty-four patients performed virtual physical therapy (VPT); 25 patients performed home physical therapy (HPT); 17 patients performed independent exercise program (IE); and 20 patients did not perform therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were assessed by physiatry. VPT sessions were delivered via secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant telehealth platform 1-2 times/week. Patients were asked to follow up 2 weeks after initial evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary study outcome measures were the change in lower body strength, measured by the 30-second sit-to-stand test; and the change in cardiopulmonary endurance, measured by the 2-minute step test. RESULTS: At the time of follow-up, 65% of patients in the VPT group and 88% of patients in the HPT group met the clinically meaningful difference for improvement in sit-to-stand scores, compared with 50% and 17% of those in the IE group and no-exercise group (P = .056). The clinically meaningful difference for improvement in the step test was met by 74% of patients in the VPT group and 50% of patients in the HPT, IE, and no-exercise groups (P = .12). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual outpatient rehabilitation for patients recovering from COVID-19 improved lower limb strength and cardiopulmonary endurance, and an HPT program improved lower limb strength. Virtual rehabilitation seems to be an efficacious method of treatment delivery for recovering COVID-19 patients.","Hameed, Farah; Palatulan, Eugene; Jaywant, Abhishek; Said, Rami; Lau, Corinna; Sood, Vandana; Layton, Aimee; Gellhorn, Alfred",PM &amp; R (Online),,538

While the US government will not measure food insecurity until December of 2020, previous research has developed a methodology whereby internet surveys that can be rapidly deployed using opt-in panels can approximate government numbers. We employ this methodology to measure food insecurity in May of 2020. Results suggest that while there is little to no detectable rise in food insecurity for all households, the percent of households with children classified as food insecure is about three percentage points higher than it was in 2016 and 2017.","Ahn, Sunjin; Norwood, F.

One factor that may contribute to more rapid viral growth in the upper airways is the exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2 stability that occurs with reductions in temperature, as measured in vitro. Because SARS-CoV-2 frequently initiates infection in the upper airways before spreading through the body, increased upper airway viral growth early in the disease course may result in more rapid progression of disease and potentially contribute to more severe outcomes. Similarly, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in the upper airways likely supports more efficient transmission. Conversely, the possible significance of air temperature to upper airway viral growth suggests that prolonged delivery of heated air might represent a preventative measure and prophylactic treatment for coronavirus disease 2019.","Kang, Dominique; Ellgen, Clifford; Kulstad, Erik",J. med. virol,,538

We can predict that the COVID-19 pandemic would leave the mind lonely and vulnerable to diseases, for, on the one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic and related problems, in particular social isolation, are itself stressor. On the other hand, studies confirm the potential of COVID-19 to involve the central nervous system by affecting the immune system, either directly or indirectly. The COVID-19 condition, thus, calls for a necessary compensation of loneliness to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic. Not only art can fulfill this purpose by meeting social affiliation needs, but also its related creativity is a definite achievement of the performer while acting as a motivation facilitator of creation for the observer. Besides, artworks that illustrate effective hygiene behaviors and physical distancing in an easy-to-understand manner could help health information systems to control the spread of COVID-19. The integration of art with biomedical science applied for simulation of the infected population, lung imaging data, and the viral surface has been useful for prediction of the spread of disease and earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 by imaging techniques and might be a contributor to drug discovery for COVID-19. Also, arts admirably influence the immunoemotional regulatory system so that not only would it enable humanity to tolerate quarantine but also enhance antiviral immunity. More interestingly, the effects of dance have been observed in children, elderly, healthcare workers, and pregnant women, which have been of special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, arts provide us powerful tools for tolerating the quarantine time and enhancing the immune system, educating behavioral tips for hygiene practices and physical distancing and in psychosocial care of vulnerable populations during the pandemic.","Rezaei, Nima; Vahed, Aida; Ziaei, Heliya; Bashari, Negin; Afkham, Saina Adiban; Bahrami, Fatemeh; Bakhshi, Sara; Ghanadan, Alireza; Ghanadan, Atlasi; Hosseini, Nastaran; Kafi, Pariya; Khalilianfard, Reihaneh; Mohammed, Kawthar; Sargoli, Sepideh; Tavasoli, Kosar; Zare, Mahya; Saghazadeh, Amene",Adv Exp Med Biol,,538

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine Chinese netizens' concerns related to COVID-19 and the relationship between their concerns and information on the internet. We also aimed to elucidate the association between individuals' levels of concern, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. METHODS: The questionnaire, which consisted of 15 closed-ended questions, was designed to investigate Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants through Dingxiangyisheng WeChat (a public, medical, and health service platform in China) accounts. Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: In total, 10,304 respondents were surveyed on the internet (response rate=1.75%; 10,304/590,000). Nearly all (n=9803, 95.30%) participants were concerned about ""confirmed cases"" of COVID-19, and 87.70% (n=9036) received information about the outbreak through social media websites. There were significant differences in participants' concerns by sex (P=.02), age (P<.001), educational attainment (P=.001), and occupation (P<.001). All knowledge questions and preventive practices were associated with concerns about COVID-19. The results of the multivariate logistic regression indicated that participants' sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and concern level were significantly associated with the practice of proper preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated Chinese netizens' concerns, information sources, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and level of concern were key factors associated with proper preventive behaviors. This offers a theoretical basis for the government to provide targeted disease prevention and control information to the public.","Zhao, Yusui; Xu, Shuiyang; Wang, Lei; Huang, Yu; Xu, Yue; Xu, Yan; Lv, Qiaohong; Wang, Zhen; Wu, Qingqing",J Med Internet Res,,538

259249,Editorial debate: Challenges an oncologist has to face during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic within a universal healthcare system,2020,"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is a dangerous disease rapidly spreading all over the world today. Currently there are no treatment options for it. Drug repurposing studies explored the potency of antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2 virus. These drugs can inhibit the viral protease, called chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also known as Main protease (3CLpro); hence, we studied the binding efficiencies of 4-aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline analogs of chloroquine. Six compounds furnished better binding energies than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The interactions with the active site residues especially with Cys145 and His41, which are involved in catalytic diad for proteolysis, make these compounds potent main protease inhibitors. A regression model correlating binding energy and the molecular descriptors for chloroquine analogs was generated with R2 = 0.9039 and Q2 = 0.8848. This model was used to screen new analogs of primaquine and molecules from the Asinex compound library. The docking and regression analysis showed these analogs to be more potent inhibitors of 3CLpro than hydroxychloroquine and primaquine. The molecular dynamic simulations of the hits were carried out to determine the binding stabilities. Finally, we propose four compounds that show drug likeness toward SARS-CoV-2 that can be further validated through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Achutha, A S; Pushpa, V L; Suchitra, Surendran",J Proteome Res,,538

To maintain social distancing and avoiding exposure, works and lives have gradually moved online. Under this trend, social media usage to obtain COVID-19 news has increased. Also, misinformation on COVID-19 is frequently spread on social media. In this work, we develop CHECKED, the first Chinese dataset on COVID-19 misinformation. CHECKED provides a total 2,104 verified microblogs related to COVID-19 from December 2019 to August 2020, identified by using a specific list of keywords. Correspondingly, CHECKED includes 1,868,175 reposts, 1,185,702 comments, and 56,852,736 likes that reveal how these verified microblogs are spread and reacted on Weibo. The dataset contains a rich set of multimedia information for each microblog including ground-truth label, textual, visual, temporal, and network information. Extensive experiments have been conducted to analyze CHECKED data and to provide benchmark results for well-established methods when predicting fake news using CHECKED. We hope that CHECKED can facilitate studies that target misinformation on coronavirus.

This study assessed the association between baseline microscopic and submicroscopic asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and anti-malarial antibody levels and whether these parasitaemia modify protective associations between antibody levels and malaria in Ghanaian children. Healthy children (N=973, aged 0.5-12 years) were recruited into a 50-week longitudinal malaria cohort study from January 2016 to January 2017. Baseline asymptomatic parasitaemia were determined by microscopy (microscopic parasitaemia) and polymerase chain reaction (submicroscopic parasitaemia) and antibody levels against crude schizont antigens measured by ELISA. Antibody levels, parasite diversity and risk of malaria in the ensuing transmission season were compared among children who had baseline asymptomatic microscopic or submicroscopic or no P. falciparum infections. Of the 99 asymptomatic baseline infections, 46 (46.5%) were microscopic and 53 (53.5%), submicroscopic. Cox regression analysis adjusting for age group, sex and community found a strong association between both baseline microscopic [Hazard ratio (HR)=0.36, 95%CI=(0.21, 0.63), p<0.001] and submicroscopic [HR=0.22, 95%CI=(0.11, 0.44), p<0.001] asymptomatic parasitaemia and a reduced risk of febrile malaria compared to those who were uninfected at baseline. Baseline asymptomatic submicroscopic parasitaemia had a significant effect on associations between anti-schizont antibodies and protection against febrile malaria (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). The study found both baseline P. falciparum asymptomatic microscopic and more strongly submicroscopic infections to be associated with protection against febrile malaria in the ensuing transmission season. This could have important implications for malaria sero-epidemiological studies and vaccine trials.","Adu, Bright; Issahaque, Quratul-Ain; Sarkodie-Addo, Tracy; Kumordjie, Selassie; Kyei-Baafour, Eric; Sinclear, Caleb K; Eyia-Ampah, Sophia; Owusu-Yeboa, Eunice; Theisen, Michael; Dodoo, Daniel",Infect. immun,,538

Among 1,236 patients with COVID-19, 45 (3.6%) were evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT examination. VTE events occurred in 10 patients (22.2%), and the incidence of VTE in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 was 0%, 11.8%, and 40.0%, respectively. COVID-19 patients with VTE showed a higher body weight (81.6 vs. 64.0 kg, P=0.005) and body mass index (26.9 vs. 23.2 kg/m2, P=0.04), and a higher proportion had a severe status for COVID-19 compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients alive at discharge between patients with and without VTE (80.0% vs. 88.6%, P=0.48). Among 8 pulmonary embolism (PE) patients, all were low-risk PE. CONCLUSIONS: Among a relatively small number of patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT examination in Japanese real-world clinical practice, there were no VTE patients among those with mild COVID-19, but the incidence of VTE seemed to be relatively high among severe COVID-19 patients, although all PE events were low-risk without significant effect on mortality risk.","Yamashita, Yugo; Maruyama, Yuuki; Satokawa, Hirono; Nishimoto, Yuji; Tsujino, Ichizo; Sakashita, Hideki; Nakata, Hiroko; Okuno, Yoshinori; Ogihara, Yoshito; Yachi, Sen; Toya, Naoki; Shingaki, Masami; Ikeda, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Naoto; Aikawa, Shizu; Ikeda, Nobutaka; Hayashi, Hiroya; Ishiguro, Shingo; Iwata, Eriko; Umetsu, Michihisa; Kondo, Akane; Iwai, Takehisa; Kobayashi, Takao; Mo, Makoto; Yamada, Norikazu",Cir. j,,538

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) required intensive care unit care, 1,480 (5.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85. DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.","Sottile, Peter D; Albers, David; DeWitt, Peter E; Russell, Seth; Stroh, J N; Kao, David P; Adrian, Bonnie; Levine, Matthew E; Mooney, Ryan; Larchick, Lenny; Kutner, Jean S; Wynia, Matthew K; Glasheen, Jeffrey J; Bennett, Tellen D",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,538

265018,"P115: SARS‐CoV‐2 and male reproduction: Relationship, explanations and clinical remedies",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome is a rare condition that affects multiple organs following SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was first observed in children, however few cases of adults with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A) were published in the US and the UK. We present two cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in adults which occurred in Germany. HISTORY: #1: A 27-year-old male presented with fever (40â°C), right lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and peritonism. #2: A 21-year-old female presented with fever (40â°C) occipital headaches, neck stiffness, and somnolence. FINDINGS: #1: Increased inflammation parameters and elevated Nt-proBNP were found. Abdominal CT showed signs of ileitis terminalis and colitis. Crohn's disease was excluded endoscopically. Echocardiography showed minor pericardial effusion. A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. #2: Increased inflammation parameters and an increased Nt-proBNP were found. Cranial CT showed pathology. Meningitis was excluded via lumbar puncture. Thoracic CT and abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of infection. Echocardiography showed reduced LVEF (50â%). A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. THERAPY AND COURSE: #1: Antibiotic therapy as well as oral prednisolone didn't improve the clinical course. High-dose vasopressor therapy was necessary. The clinical condition improved only after adding hydrocortisone therapy. #2 Despite antibiotic therapy the clinical condition deteriorated. Because of insufficient effect of hydrocortisone, high-dose immunoglobulins were administered. Consequently, symptoms improved and LVEF normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome presents as a chameleon of symptoms. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rising numbers of cases in adults can be expected. In patients with fever, increased inflammation parameters and lack of other explanations, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome must be considered. Due to the potential severity of clinical courses and possible cardiac involvement, a therapy with hydrocortisone, ASS and immunoglobulins should be considered early.","Rieper, Karl; Sturm, Andreas",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,538

In this framework, the aim of the present review was to summarize the results on the application of functional compounds from olive pomace in food products. Phenolics-rich extracts from olive pomace were added to vegetable oils, fish burgers, fermented milk and in the edible coating of fruit, in order to take advantage of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, olive pomace was directly used in the formulation of pasta and baked goods, by exploiting polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber to obtain high-value added healthy foods and/or to extend their shelf-life. With the same scope, olive pomace was also added to animal feeds obtaining healthy-improved animal products. Furthermore, different authors used olive pomace to produce biodegradable materials and/or active packaging able to increase the content of bioactive compounds and the oxidative stability of foods. Overall, the results highlighted in most cases the effectiveness of the addition of olive pomace-derived functional compounds in improving the nutritional value, the quality and/or the shelf-life of foods. However, more challenging was found to be the direct addition of olive pomace, especially due to alterations of sensory and textural features of food. This article is protected by copyright.

Those first confronted by the enormous challenge of fighting this infodemic to save their lives were the people of Hubei Province in China. To understand how they defined and processed rumors, we conducted an interview study with Hubei residents when they were under lockdown. We found that they typically defined rumors in terms of one or two of three features: non-factual information, information unsanctioned by the government, and information causing panic. They reported low motivation in verifying the information and often either rejected any information they perceived as suspicious or waited for the government to debunk rumors. Even among those who tried to verify information, most relied exclusively on heuristic processing cues such as source credibility, linguistic and visual cues, and intuition. Systematic processing strategies such as fact-checking and discussing with family and friends were seldom used.","Zou, Wenxue; Tang, Lu",Public Underst Sci,,538

The pandemic has disrupted life as we know it, so is its impact on lifestyle, health and consequently the consumer behaviour as well. Disruption is seen in the economic, social processes and systems as well. The newer needs, behaviours and orientations are contributing to shaping of a new cohort for businesses. However, this development is not recognised to be a temporary or a permanent phenomenon. While still the fear of pandemic is lingering around, it is crucial for the businesses to assess the altered or changing attitudes and behaviours of the urban consumers. Convenient sampling technique has been adopted as far as data collection is considered. The study reveals that the pandemic has created a shift in buying behaviour of consumers while at the same time creating disruptions in the existing supply chain. The purchasing behaviour is more driven towards essentials, health products and locally available products while the brand consciousness has taken a step back. A new normal is inevitable where everyone has to learn to live with the existing reality ultimately leading to lasting structural changes in businesses.","Samal, A.; Rajeshwari, G. V.; Sunitha, Y.

Methods In this cohort study, COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan between January 15 and April 1, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were categorized into PLWH and HIV-naive group. All patients were followed up regularly (every fifteen days) until November 30, 2020, and the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 was observed. Results Totally, 18 PLWH and 185 HIV-naive individuals with COVID-19 were enrolled. The positive conversion rates of IgG were 56% in PLWH and 88% in HIV-naive patients respectively, and the peak was on the 45th day after COVID-19 onset. However, the positive rate of IgG dropped to 12% in PLWH and 33% among HIV-naive individuals by the end of the study. The positive conversion rate of IgG among asymptomatic carriers is significantly lower than that among moderate patients (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05-0.65) and PLWH had a lower IgG seroconversion rate compared to the HIV-naive group (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.90). Patients with lower lymphocyte counts at onset had a higher positive conversion rate (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.90) and longer duration for IgG (AHR = 4.01, 95% CI: 1.78-9.02). Conclusions The positive conversion rate of IgG for SARS-CoV-2 was relatively lower and quickly lost in PLWH, which meant PLWH was in a disadvantaged situation when affected with COVID-19.","Liu, Y.; Xiao, Y.; Wu, S.; Marly, G.; Ming, F.; Wang, X.; Wu, M.; Feng, L.; Tang, W.; Liang, K.",Research Square,,538

Methods: From January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020, a total of 33 patients with 2019-nCoV infection diagnosed and treated by Suzhou Fifth People's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively, including 20 males and 13 females, with an average age of (50±12) years, ranging from 20 to 70 years old. There were 3 cases of mild type, 27 cases of common type and 3 cases of severe type.There were 2 cases with hypertension, 1 case with postoperative lung,1 case with diabetes, 1 case with chronic bronchitis, and 1 case with bronchiectasis.SPSS25.0 Chi-square test was used to analyze the distribution of lesions in each lung lobe; SPSS25.0 Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the image score and clinical classification. Results: There were 3 cases (9.1%) with normal lung and 30 cases (90.9%) with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(COVID-19) of the 2019-nCoV infected patients. In the distribution of COVID-19, 29 cases (87.9%) were involved in bilateral lung and 1 case (3.0%) in unilateral lung. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of lesions in each lobe. The correlation coefficient between the degree of lesion distribution and clinical classification was 0.819, and the two were highly correlated.There were 30 cases (90.9%) with subpleural lesions, 17 cases (51.5%) with central lesions. There were many kinds of lesions, 25 cases (75.8%) had ground glass density shadow, 16 cases (48.5%) had consolidation, 12 cases (36.4%) had interstitial change, and 18 cases (54.5%) had interlobular septal thickening. Among the 22 cases, 10 cases had more lesions, 6 cases had no changes and 6 cases had less lesions. Conclusion: Most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection have pulmonary inflammation.CT manifestations include multiple parts, subpleural area or middle and lateral field of lung, ground glass shadow and consolidation, or coexistence. Some cases have pleural thickening or interlobular septal thickening. CT images can indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide important basis for early detection and disease monitoring.","Liu, R R; Zhu, Y; Wu, M Y; Liu, J; Ren, R; Cao, Q L; Shen, X H; Chen, G Q; Li, M",Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,,538

This study investigates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Zhejiang Province who did or did not have a history of Wuhan exposure. METHODS: We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan. RESULTS: Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19±16.13) years vs. (43.47±13.12) years, P<0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs. 5.60% exposure, P<0.001). The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001). The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group. There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.","Lian, Jiang-Shan; Cai, Huan; Hao, Shao-Rui; Jin, Xi; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Zheng, Lin; Jia, Hong-Yu; Hu, Jian-Hua; Zhang, Shan-Yan; Yu, Guo-Dong; Gu, Jue-Qing; Ye, Chan-Yuan; Jin, Ci-Liang; Lu, Ying-Feng; Sheng, Ji-Fang; Yang, Yi-da",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,538

271363,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Smoking: What is the association? A brief review,2021,"Ocular pain is a common complaint which forces the patient to seek immediate medical attention. It is the primeval first response of the body to any severe condition of the eye such as trauma, infections and inflammation. The pain can be due to conditions directly affecting the eye and ocular adnexa; or indirect which would manifest as referred pain from other organ structures such as the central nervous system. Paradoxically, there are several minor and non-sight threatening conditions, which also leads to ocular pain and does not merit urgent hospital visits. In this perspective, we intend to provide guidelines to the practising ophthalmologist for teleconsultation when a patient complains of pain with focus on how to differentiate the various diagnoses that can be managed over teleconsultation and those requiring emergency care in the clinic. These guidelines can decrease unnecessary hospital visits, which is the need of the hour in the pandemic era and also beyond. Patients who are under quarantine and those who are unable to travel would be benefitted, and at the same time, the burden of increased patient load in busy hospital systems can be reduced.","Murthy, Somasheila I; Das, Sujata; Deshpande, Parul; Kaushik, Sushmita; Dave, Tarjani Vivek; Agashe, Prachi; Goel, Nupur; Soni, Anuj",Indian J Ophthalmol,,538

This study identifies organizational factors that promoted successful implementation of telehealth and adoption of ""no test"" medication abortion protocols. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with health care providers and clinic administrators implementing clinician-supported telehealth abortion during the COVID pandemic. We selected 15 clinical sites to represent 4 different practice settings: independent primary care practices, online medical services, specialty family planning clinics, and primary care clinics within multispecialty health systems. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided our thematic analysis. RESULTS: Successful implementation of telehealth abortion included access to formal and informal inter-organizational networks, including professional organizations and informal mentorship relationships with innovators in the field; organizational readiness for implementation, such as having clinic resources available for telehealth services like functional electronic health records and options for easy-to-use virtual patient-provider interactions; and motivated and effective clinic champions. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the need to offer remote clinical services, 4 different practice settings types leveraged key operational factors to facilitate successful implementation of telehealth abortion. Information from this study can inform implementation strategies to support the dissemination and adoption of this model. IMPLICATIONS: Examples of successfully implemented telehealth medication abortion services provide a framework that can be used to inform and implement similar patient-centered telehealth models in diverse practice settings.","Godfrey, Emily M; Fiastro, Anna E; Jacob-Files, Elizabeth A; Coeytaux, Francine M; Wells, Elisa S; Ruben, Molly R; Sanan, Sajal S; Bennett, Ian M",Contraception,,538

Currently, many research groups have slowed down their respective projects to concentrate efforts in the study of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. In this bibliometric analysis and mini-review, we aimed to describe how computational methods or omics approaches were used during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed bibliometric data from Scopus, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv (dated June 19th, 2020) using quantitative and knowledge mapping approaches. We complemented our analysis with a manual process of carefully reading the selected articles to identify either the omics or bioinformatic tools used and their purpose. RESULTS: From a total of 184 articles, we found that metagenomics and transcriptomics were the main sources of data to perform phylogenetic analysis aimed at corroborating zoonotic transmission, identifying the animal origin and taxonomic allocation of SARS-CoV-2. Protein sequence analysis, immunoinformatics and molecular docking were used to give insights about SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug and vaccine development. Most of the publications were from China and USA. However, China, Italy and India covered the top 10 most cited papers on this topic. CONCLUSION: We found an abundance of publications using omics and bioinformatics approaches to establish the taxonomy and animal origin of SARS-CoV-2. We encourage the growing community of researchers to explore other lesser-known aspects of COVID-19 such as virus-host interactions and host response.","Murillo, Julieth; Villegas, Lina María; Ulloa-Murillo, Leidy Marcela; Rodríguez, Alejandra Rocío",Comput Biol Med,,538
274895,Importance of the One Health approach to study the SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that the experiences of frontline primary health care professionals during COVID-19 are important to understand how they respond and act under situations of pandemic as the gatekeepers in primary health care system. School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of schoolchildren and school personnel. There are rising mental health concerns of frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic symptoms, and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to document community frontline school nursing professionals' experiences and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses' experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited to participate in individual semistructured interviews and shared their roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the school nurses' expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 emerged from the data analysis. These were ""Managing Stress,"" ""Navigating the School Through the Pandemic,"" and ""Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional,"" DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in minimizing the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the primary health care system. This essential role in schools is necessary to assess, implement, monitor, prevent, and reduce the spread of virus in school communities and to minimize the burden to and extra health care resources utilized in the acute care setting during COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Regina L T; West, Sancia; Tang, Anson C Y; Cheng, Ho Yu; Chong, Connie Y Y; Chien, Wai Tong; Chan, Sally W C",Nurs. outlook,,538

281645,CNS Penetration Ability: A Critical Factor for Drugs in the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Infection,2020,"Cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the chemotherapeutic drugs being used to treat various cancers. Although effective in many cases, as high doses of CDDP cause cytotoxic effects that may worsen patients' condition, therefore, a marker of sensitivity to CDDP is necessary to enhance the safety and efficiency of CDDP administration. This study focused on adipose most abundant 2 (APM2) to examine its potential as a marker of CDDP sensitivity. The relationship of APM2 expression with the mechanisms of CDDP resistance was examined in vitro and in vivo using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, tissues and serum of HCC patients (n = 71) treated initially with intrahepatic arterial infusion of CDDP followed by surgical resection. The predictability of serum APM2 for CDDP sensitivity was assessed in additional 54 HCC patients and 14 gastric cancer (GC) patients. APM2 expression in CDDP-resistant HCC was significantly higher both in serum and the tissue. Bioinformatic analyses and histological analyses demonstrated upregulation of ERCC6L (DNA excision repair protein ERCC6-like) by APM2, which accounts for the degree of APM2 expression. The serum APM2 level and chemosensitivity for CDDP were assessed and cut-off value of serum APM2 for predicting the sensitivity to CDDP was determined to be 18.7 µg/mL. The value was assessed in HCC (n = 54) and GC (n = 14) patients for its predictability of CDDP sensitivity, resulted in predictive value of 77.3% and 100%, respectively. Our study demonstrated that APM2 expression is related to CDDP sensitivity and serum APM2 can be an effective biomarker of HCC and GC for determining the sensitivity to CDDP.Trial registration: This study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000028487).","Kamimura, Kenya; Suda, Takeshi; Fukuhara, Yasuo; Okuda, Shujiro; Watanabe, Yu; Yokoo, Takeshi; Osaki, Akihiko; Waguri, Nobuo; Ishikawa, Toru; Sato, Toshihiro; Aoyagi, Yutaka; Takamura, Masaaki; Wakai, Toshifumi; Terai, Shuji",Sci Rep,,538

283038,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines breakthrough infection hospitalizations after one dose in Libya: cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated the crucial effect of the public's compliance with the government's health instructions on the population's health. However, evidence shows that some communities are less likely to comply with such instructions than others. This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS: Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS: The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION: Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them. Policy-makers and health authorities should consider providing information about the risks and negative outcomes of the crisis as well as the expected effectiveness of the recommended behaviors. Future research should examine other minority groups and other types of instructions in different stages of a crisis.","Goren, Talia; Vashdi, Dana R; Beeri, Itai",Int. j. health policy manag,,538

However, these two prominent research fields seem to have no intersections. Since joining national central university in 2012, our research philosophy aims to narrow, or rather to bridge the gap between synthetic methodologies and &#960;-functional organic materials. In contrast to using multistep synthetic approaches based on Suzuki- or Stille coupling reactions, this personal account describes various step-saving and viable synthesis-shortcuts developed by our group, to access thiophene-based small molecules for optoelectronic applications. We expect these succinct and user-friendly alternative pathways designed by synthetic chemists would help material scientists to reach their target molecules in a more step-economical manner.","Liu, Ching-Yuan; Lin, Po-Han; Lee, Kun-Mu","Chem. rec.

283830,A machine learning model to identify early stage symptoms of SARS-Cov-2 infected patients,2020,"Dual graphs have been applied to model RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, or intertwined base pairs. In previous works, a linear-time algorithm was introduced to partition dual graphs into maximally connected components called blocks and determine whether each block contains a pseudoknot or not. As pseudoknots can not be contained into two different blocks, this characterization allow us to efficiently isolate smaller RNA fragments and classify them as pseudoknotted or pseudoknot-free regions, while keeping these sub-structures intact. Moreover we have extended the partitioning algorithm by classifying a pseudoknot as either recursive or non-recursive in order to continue with our research in the development of a library of building blocks for RNA design by fragment assembly. In this paper we present a methodology that uses our previous results and classify pseudoknots into the classical H,K,L, and M types, based upon a novel representation of RNA secondary structures as dual directed graphs (i.e., digraphs). This classification would help the systematic analysis of RNA structure and prediction as for example the implementation of more accurate folding algorithms.","Petingi, Louis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03236v1.pdf,538

Failure to address the mental health issues stemming from the pandemic is likely to prolong its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant global challenge and, in lower-income countries, even a disruption of mental health services. Given our experience with previous pandemics, the present COVID-19 crisis can be expected to cause psychological trauma, and steps are needed to address this issue proactively. A focus on the long-term mental health consequences may be at least as important as the measures currently seeking to mitigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 and to save lives. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health call for a greater focus on the needs of those with mental disorders and on mental health issues affecting health care workers and the general public. Timely preventive and therapeutic mental health care is essential in addressing the psychosocial needs of populations exposed to the pandemic. In addition to specialist care, ""task-shifting"" and digital technologies may provide cost-effective means of providing mental health care in lower-income countries worldwide as well as in higher-income countries with mental health services overwhelmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the ever-increasing pressure on global health systems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting and adapting ""task-shifting"", i.e. the delegation of psychotherapeutic interventions to trained non-specialists, as an element of the provision of mental health services, is overdue. Digital technologies can be used to enhance social support and facilitate resilience to the detrimental mental health effects of the pandemic; they may also offer an efficient and cost-effective way to provide easy access to mental health care.","Lange, Klaus W",,,538

This systematic review investigated the impacts of various interventions on IYCF in Ethiopia. SOURCE OF INFORMATION: A systematic search was conducted on seven computerised bibliographic databases (Embase, ProQuest Central, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE/PubMed and CINAHL) to locate experimental or quasi-experimental studies published between the year 2000 and May 2021. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Interventional studies that measured IYCF indicators (early initiation of breast feeding (EIBF), exclusive breast feeding (EBF), the introduction of complementary foods, minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF) and minimum acceptable diet) as outcome variables were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: All included studies were examined for biases related to interventional studies (ie, selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias and reporting bias). Author reports of effect size measures were used to narratively report the findings of each study. RESULTS: Of the 23 eligible studies, 14 studies were quasi-experimental and 9 studies were cluster randomised trials (CRTs). Eight quasi-experimental studies had a serious risk of bias, while two CRTs had a high risk of bias. Four studies for EBF and six studies for EIBF showed significant impacts of policy advocacy, health service strengthening, interpersonal communication, community mobilisation and mass media campaigns. Six studies for MDD and three studies for MMF indicated significant effects of community-level and health facility complementary feeding promotions on infants and young children. Interventions that delivered in combination increased the impacts in improving EIBF, MDD and MMF compared with a single intervention. CONCLUSION: Our review showed that 12 out of 21 eligible studies that implemented in the form of community-level and health facility interventions improved EIBF, EBF, and/or MDD in Ethiopia.

The participants filled out a questionnaire that included scales for measuring perceived discrimination, anxiety, depression, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and suicide risk. One hundred and fifty healthcare workers between the ages of 18 and 68 participated in the research. Of these, 72% were women, 39.3% nursing assistants, 18.0% nurses, and 42.7% physicians. The perceived discrimination scores showed positive correlations with the scores on depressive symptoms among nursing assistants and physicians (rs = 0.34) and suicide risk in nursing assistants (rs = 0.35) and physicians (rs = 0.31). Among nurses, all measurements were independent of perceived discrimination. Nursing assistants scored higher in perceived discrimination than nurses and physicians. Physicians scored higher for COVID-19 perceived stress than nursing assistants, and nurses showed similar scores to the physicians' scores.

PPI networks from sPE and Triple-I were intersected with the PPI network from coronavirus infection. Common proteins included the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and ENDOU, a placental endoribonuclease homologous to Nsp15, a protein produced by the virus to escape host immunity. Remarkably, placental ENDOU mRNA expression far exceeded that of ACE2. Immunohistochemistry confirmed ENDOU localization at the hemochorial maternal-fetal interface. Investigation of ENDOU's relevance to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is further warranted.","Jing, Hongwu; Ackerman, William E; Zhao, Guomao; El Helou, Yara; Buhimschi, Catalin S; Buhimschi, Irina A",Placenta,,538

294520,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces in a clinical microbiology laboratory,2020,"Objectives: This study aims to describe the molecular variability in the SFTPC gene in a childhood chronic respiratory disease, asthma, in the Tunisian population and to identify the implications based on a case-control study of p.Thr138Asn (T138N) and p.Ser186Asn (S186N) variants. Methods: We used direct sequencing for the genotyping of the SFTPC gene within 101 asthmatic children. The study of T138N and S186N variants in 110 controls is conducted by the PCR-RFLP technique. Results: The molecular study revealed 26 variants including 24 intronic variations and 2 exonic variations (T138N and S186N) with respective frequencies of 16.8% and 18.3%. We conducted a case-control study of the two identified exonic variations. A different genotypic and allelic distribution between the two groups was noted. Only the T138N polymorphism showed a significant association with asthma disease (p < 10-3). Statistical analysis elaborated four haplotypes with the following frequencies in patients vs controls: 138Thr-186Ser (79.5% vs 57.6%), 138Thr-186Asn (3.7% vs 7.8%), 138Asn-186Thr (2.2% vs 20.2%) and 138Asn-186Asn (14.6% vs 14.4%). A significant difference (p < 10-3) was highlighted in haplotype distribution. The 138Asn-186Ser (OR [95%CI] = 0.14[0.04-0.54], p = 0.004, R2=0.93) and 138Thr-186Asn (OR [95%CI] = 0.35[0.12-0.54], p = 0.047, R2=0.88) haplotypes showed a negative association with asthma which may constitute a protective factor against the disease. Conclusion: In Tunisia, this work constitutes the first report interested in the SFTPC gene and highlights the genetic variability of the SFTPC gene in asthma. Therefore, the case-controls analysis may be useful in the study of surfactant proteins dysfunction in chronic respiratory disease at an early age.","Nefzi, Malek; Wahabi, Imen; Hadj Fredj, Sondess; Othmani, Rym; Dabboubi, Rym; Boussetta, Khedija; Fanen, Pascale; Messaoud, Taieb",J Asthma,,538

However, development of COS may be a time consuming and expensive process. Publicly available repositories, such as ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG), provide access to a vast collection of clinical trial characteristics including primary and secondary outcomes, which can be analyzed using a comprehensive set of tools. With growing number of COVID-19 clinical trials, COS development may provide crucial means to standardize, aggregate, share, and analyze diverse research results in a harmonized way. This study was aimed at initial assessment of utility of CTG analytics for identifying COVID-19 COS. At the time of this study, January, 2021, we analyzed 120 ongoing NIH-funded COVID-19 clinical trials initiated in 2020 to inform COVID-19 COS development by evaluating and ranking clinical trial outcomes based on their structured representation in CTG. Using this approach, COS comprised of 25 major clinical outcomes has been identified with mortality, mental health status, and COVID-19 antibodies at the top of the list. We concluded that CTG analytics can be instrumental for COVID-19 COS development and that further analysis is warranted including broader number of international trials combined with more granular approach and ontology-driven pipelines for outcome extraction and curation.","Parvanova, Irena; Finkelstein, Joseph",Stud Health Technol Inform,,538

The natural history of choroidal neurofibromas in NF1 is unknown. This study evaluates a predominantly pediatric patient cohort for ocular features in NF1, including presence and progression of choroidal abnormalities, to determine their natural history, relationship to other NF1 features, and additive value in NF1 diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 106 patients referred for Ophthalmic monitoring or diagnosis of NF1 between January 2012 and December 2018. Clinical records and Near-Infrared Reflectance (NIR) Optical Coherence Tomography imaging were analyzed for prevalence and progression of choroidal neurofibromas on NIR, and relation to other NF1 diagnostic criteria. Results: 54.7% of patients referred had a confirmed NF1 diagnosis, and 45.4% were NF1 suspects. First ophthalmic review resulted in an additional 6.6% patients meeting the diagnostic criteria, and 14.2% later developed sufficient features (total n = 80). Choroidal neurofibromas were present in 75.7% of patients that had NIR imaging and met diagnostic criteria, and detected in the absence of, or prior to Lisch nodules in 13.5%. Progression in the size and number of choroidal neurofibromas occurred in 26 eyes (32.5%) of 14 patients (35.0%), all under 16 years old. Patients without choroidal neurofibromas at first examination never developed them over the study period. Conclusion: Choroidal neurofibromas, detected by NIR imaging, are common in NF1, present early with frequent progression, and represent an additional tool to aid NF1 diagnosis in young children.","Chilibeck, Corina M; Shah, Shaheen; Russell, Heather C; Vincent, Andrea L",Ophthalmic Genet,,538

297439,Pathophysiology of multi-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that acute kidney injury (AKI) has a noticeable incidence in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with prior renal insufficiency are particularly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to their immune dysfunction. However, most patients with COVID-19 do not have a history of kidney dysfunction, and few studies have focused on the incidence of AKI among COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of AKI in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on those without a CKD history. METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of 96 patients with COVID-19 in China between February 7 and March 3, 2020 was conducted. All patients were diagnosed by nucleic acid test (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled patients were divided into the severely or critically ill group according to the defined criteria. Patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, along with their treatment information, were collected from the medical history system. The occurrence of AKI was compared between the severe and critical patients, and between patients with or without a history of CKD. The diagnostic criteria for AKI included an increase in the serum creatinine level to &#8805;1.5-fold the level at baseline within 7 days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Renal outcomes were defined as AKI or non-AKI. RESULTS: Four patients (4.2%) developed AKI, all of whom were in the critically ill group, and 3 (75%) of whom died. Out of the 90 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD, 3 (3.3%) patients developed AKI; out of the 6 patients with CKD, 1 (16.7%) patient developed AKI. Age, disease severity, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were correlated with AKI onset in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while lymphocyte count and estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission were inversely related to the development of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Only 3.3% of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD in our research cohort developed AKI. Critically ill patients may be more susceptible to AKI than severely ill patients.","Yu, Yue; Ge, Huipeng; Wang, Xiufen; Huang, Zhonghua; Chen, Lei; Han, Yun; Jiang, Dayang; Tao, Lijian; Zhou, Qiaoling; Peng, Zhangzhe; Xiao, Xiangcheng",Ann Palliat Med,,538

In her view, a central problem is that the definition of pandemics is based solely on disease transmission across several countries, and not on spread and severity together, which conflates two very different situations: emergency and nonemergency disease outbreaks. A greater emphasis on severity, such that pandemics are defined as severe and rapidly spreading infectious disease outbreaks, would make them ""true global health emergencies,"" allowing for priority resource allocation and effective collective actions in emergency response efforts. Sympathetic to the position taken by de Campos, here I highlight some of the challenges in the definition of severity during an infectious disease outbreak.","Undurraga, Eduardo A",Camb Q Healthc Ethics,,538

300573,Double-Edged Spike-Are SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Tests Safe Right Now?,2020,"Cellulose binding modules (CBMs) are found widely in different proteins that act on cellulose. Because they allow a very easy way of binding recombinant proteins to cellulose, they have become widespread in many biotechnological applications involving cellulose. One commonly used variant is the CBMCipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Here we studied the oligomerization behavior of CBMCipA, as such solution association may have an impact on its use. As the principal approach, we used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. To enhance our understanding of the possible interactions, we used molecular dynamics simulations. By analysis of the sedimentation velocity data by a discrete model genetic algorithm and by building a binding isotherm based on weight average sedimentation coefficient and by global fitting of sedimentation equilibrium data we found that the CBMCipA shows a weak dimerization interaction with a dissociation constant KD of 90â¯±â¯30â¯µM. As the KD of CBMCipA binding to cellulose is below 1â¯µM, we conclude that the dimerization is unlikely to affect cellulose binding. However, at high concentrations used in some applications of the CBMCipA, its dimerization is likely to have a marked effect on its solution behavior.","Fedorov, Dmitrii; Batys, Piotr; Hayes, David B; Sammalkorpi, Maria; Linder, Markus B",Int. j. biol. macromol,,538

As intravenous administration burdens patients, orally administered treatments are needed. This phase 1, open-label, single-dose crossover study in 42 healthy adults evaluated bioequivalence of a 105-mg edaravone oral suspension and intravenous edaravone (60 mg/60 min). The evaluation was whether the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point and to infinity of unchanged edaravone were between the bioequivalence limit of 0.80 and 1.25. Metabolic profiles and elimination pathways were also compared between the 2 routes. Geometric mean ratios and 90%CIs of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point and to infinity for unchanged edaravone satisfied bioequivalence limits. The geometric mean ratio and its lower limit of 90%CI of Cmax of the 105-mg oral suspension compared with 60-mg intravenous formulations for unchanged edaravone fell within bioequivalence limits. Both formulations showed triphasic plasma concentration-time profiles of unchanged edaravone after reaching Cmax . Plasma concentrations of edaravone inactive metabolites after oral administration were higher than with intravenous administration. Edaravone in both routes underwent urinary excretion, mainly as the glucuronide conjugate and, to a lesser extent, as the sulfate conjugate. Urinary excretion of unchanged edaravone was low, and urinary relative composition ratios of unchanged edaravone and metabolites were similar for both formulations. These findings showed equivalent exposure of the 105-mg oral suspension of edaravone to the 60-mg intravenous formulation, supporting further investigation of the oral suspension for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Shimizu, Hidetoshi; Nishimura, Yukiko; Shiide, Youichi; Yoshida, Kaori; Hirai, Manabu; Matsuda, Munetomo; Nakamaru, Yoshinobu; Kato, Yuichiro; Kondo, Kazuoki",Clinical pharmacology in drug development,,538

A cluster of these cases had appeared in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. These infections were found to be caused by a new coronavirus which was given the name “2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV). It was later renamed “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,” or SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on February 11, 2020. It was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its close genetic similarity to the coronavirus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2002 (SARS-CoV-1). The aim of this review is to provide information, primarily to the food industry, regarding a range of biocides effective in eliminating or reducing the presence of coronaviruses from fomites, skin, oral/nasal mucosa, air, and food contact surfaces. As several EPA approved sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2 are commonly used by food processors, these compounds are primarily discussed as much of the industry already has them on site and is familiar with their application and use. Specifically, we focused on the effects of alcohols, povidone iodine, quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), peroxyacetic acid (PAA), chlorine dioxide, ozone, ultraviolet light, metals, and plant-based antimicrobials. This review highlights the differences in the resistance or susceptibility of different strains of coronaviruses, or similar viruses, to these antimicrobial agents.","Dev Kumar, Govindaraj; Mishra, Abhinav; Dunn, Laurel; Townsend, Anna; Oguadinma, Ikechukwu Chukwuma; Bright, Kelly R.; Gerba, Charles P.",Front.

309800,Effectiveness of Face Masks in Preventing Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting high-dimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.","Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,538

Furthermore, this curve is either a hyperelliptic curve or a plane quartic. Given a sextic CM field K, we show that if there exists a hyperelliptic Jacobian with CM by K, then all principally polarized abelian varieties that are Galois conjugated to it are hyperelliptic. Using Shimura's reciprocity law, we give an algorithm for computing approximations of the invariants of the initial curve, as well as their Galois conjugates. This allows us ton define and compute class polynomials for genus 3 hyperelliptic curves with CM.","Dina, B.; Ionica, S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06386v1.pdf,538

An online survey was conducted from 26 to 29 April 2020, and 1650 teachers (47.54% male; M = 40.28 years, SD = 8.3 years) enrolled in Wuhan universities and colleges participated. The results showed that the overall incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among college teachers was as high as 24.55%, but the average level of PTSD score was low (M = 1.06, SD = 0.72). Logistic regression analysis showed that for those with confirmed COVID-19, the ratio was much higher, up to 2.814 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.542, 5.136], p < 0.001); that is, compared with those without symptoms, the ratio of PTSD increased by 181%. For those who had family members or relatives who died of COVID-19, the ratio was 5.592 (95% CI: [2.271, 13.766], p < 0.001), 459% higher than those who had no one who died. But the living places during the pandemic had no significant effect on PTSD. The findings suggest that mental health services reducing PTSD should be provided.

311665,Retrospective Analysis of Interventions Performed by Emergency Medical Teams in Poland before and during the Sars Cov-2 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous environmental consequences, including impacts on municipal waste management systems. Changes in consumption and waste disposal patterns and behaviours during the lockdown period have produced new challenges for solid waste management and waste diversion activities. This paper develops a conceptual model that reflects short-term changes in waste flows from households that are due to COVID-19 disruptions, focusing on the case of multi-residential buildings in Toronto, Canada. Multi-residential buildings are of interest because they differ from single family homes in several key ways that can produce some slightly different impacts of COVID19 on waste flows and practices. Primary research for the study included interviews with 19 staff, residents and property managers of ten multi-residential buildings. All of the research took place while Toronto was still in partial-lockdown. Analysis of the interviews revealed five themes around the impact of COVID-19: (1) changes in garbage, recycling and organics flows, (2) new health and safety concerns, (3) changes in reuse and reduction practices, (4) changes in special waste and deposit-return bottle collections, and (5) changes in waste diversion and reduction education. Given the time frame of our study, we recognize these as short-term impacts and call for future research to determine how many of the changes are likely to perpetuate over the medium and longer term.","Ikiz, Ece; Maclaren, Virginia W; Alfred, Emily; Sivanesan, Sayan",Resour Conserv Recycl,,538
312038,Estimating the global reduction in transmission and rise in detection capacity of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020,2021,"In battling the COVID-19 pandemic, testing is essential. The detection of viral RNA allows the identification of infected persons, whereas the detection of antibodies may reveal a response to a previous infection. Tests for coronavirus should be rigorously evaluated in terms of their analytical and clinical performance. This poses not only logistic challenges, but also methodological ones. Some of these are generic for the diagnostic accuracy paradigm, whereas others are more specific for tests for viruses. Problematic for evaluations of the clinical performance of tests for viral RNA is the absence of an independent reference standard. Many studies lack rigor in terms of the recruitment of study participants. Study reports are often insufficiently informative, which makes it difficult to assess the applicability of study findings. Attempts to summarize the performance of these tests in terms of a single estimate of the clinical sensitivity fail to do justice to the identifiable sources of the large heterogeneity in mechanisms for generating false negative results.","Bossuyt, Patrick M",J Clin Epidemiol,,538

312737,A semi-continuous model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in enclosed spaces via multiple pathways to assess risk of infection and mitigation strategies,2021-09-02,"AIMS: In three days at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services developed a digital diagnostic device. The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","Haase, Christoffer Bjerre; Bearman, Margaret; Brodersen, John; Hoeyer, Klaus; Risor, Torsten",Scand J Public Health,,538
313116,128 days of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in a haemodialysis patient,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adoption and evaluation of contact tracing tools based on information and communications technology may expand the reach and efficacy of traditional contact tracing methods in fighting COVID-19. The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive? METHODS: Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior. RESULTS: Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public. Public health workers should be trained to effectively and empathetically instruct users on how to use the CoronaMelder app.","Bente, Britt Elise; 039, van; t Klooster, Jan Willem Jaap Roderick; Schreijer, Maud Annemarie; Berkemeier, Lea; van Gend, Joris Elmar; Slijkhuis, Peter Jan Hendrik; Kelders, Saskia Marion; van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia Elisabeth Wilhelmina Cornelia",JMIR Form Res,,538

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.),2020,"We reviewed the literature concerning the innate response from nasal and oral epithelial cells and their reaction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide is produced physiologically by oral bacteria and plays a significant role in the balance of oral microecology since it is an important antimicrobial agent. In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide. The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-&#954;B. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections and help protect against the current coronavirus pandemic. We strongly encourage the rapid development of randomized controlled trials in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects to test the preliminary findings from the in-vitro and in-vivo observational studies that we identified.","Caruso, Arturo Armone; Del Prete, Antonio; Lazzarino, Antonio Ivan",Med Hypotheses,,538

To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide insights into the nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and diagnostic performance of antibody tests.","Wakui, Masatoshi; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Noguchi, Masayo; Ohno, Akemi; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Kikuchi, Haruhito; Hasegawa, Naoki; Saya, Hideyuki; Murata, Mitsuru",Ann Clin Biochem,,538

Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the United Kingdom in response to the pandemic. Methods UK-based parents and carers (n = 2673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child's mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among preadolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems, respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of the first national lockdown on children and young people's adjustment. Developing an understanding of who has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and in what ways, is crucial in order to target effective support where it is most needed.","Waite, Polly Pearcey Samantha Shum Adrienne Raw Jasmine A.

316999,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens,2020,"COVID-19 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic, which spread largely among people who have had close contact with the infected person. The immunopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the production of an excess amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines ""a cytokine-storm"". The respiratory system (main), cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tract are the most affected body systems during viral infection. It has been found that most of the patients who require admission to hospital are elderly or have chronic underlying diseases. Higher cases of malnutrition and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are reported in elderly patients due to which, the immune system weakens and hence, the response to the virus is diminished in magnitude. A deficiency of micronutrients results in impaired immune responses leading to improper secretion of cytokines, alterations in secretory antibody response and antibody affinity which increases susceptibility to viral infection. The deficiency of various micronutrients in COVID-19 patient can be treated by appropriate nutritional supplements, prescribed after evaluating the patients' nutritional status. Here we aim to highlight the role of a few particular nutrients namely Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc and Magnesium along with the synergistic roles they play in enhancing immunity and thus, maintaining homeostasis.","Muthuvattur Pallath, Meghana; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Chandra Tripathi, Satyendra; Asia, Priyanka; Sakarde, Apurva; Gopal, Niranjan",Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,,538

317314,Respiratory failure alone does not suggest central nervous system invasion by SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The autophagic pathway involves the encapsulation of substrates in double-membraned vesicles, which are subsequently delivered to the lysosome for enzymatic degradation and recycling of metabolic precursors. Autophagy is a major cellular defense against oxidative stress, or related conditions that cause accumulation of damaged proteins or organelles. Selective forms of autophagy can maintain organelle populations or remove aggregated proteins. Dysregulation of redox homeostasis under pathological conditions results in excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and the associated oxidative damage of cellular components. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is necessary to maintain redox homeostasis. ROS activates autophagy, which facilitates cellular adaptation and diminishes oxidative damage by degrading and recycling intracellular damaged macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles. The cellular responses triggered by oxidative stress include the altered regulation of signaling pathways that culminate in the regulation of autophagy. Current research suggests a central role for autophagy as a mammalian oxidative stress response and its interrelationship to other stress defense systems. Altered autophagy phenotypes have been observed in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease, acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and asthma. Understanding the mechanisms by which ROS regulate autophagy will provide novel therapeutic targets for lung diseases. This review highlights our current understanding on the interplay between ROS and autophagy in the development of pulmonary disease.","Ornatowski, Wojciech; Lu, Qing; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Garcia, Alejandro E; Zemskov, Evgeny A; Maltepe, Emin; Fineman, Jeffrey R; Wang, Ting; Black, Stephen M",Redox Biol,,538

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic course in oldest,2020,"Despite their potentially transformative impact, few studies have investigated how commercially-driven digital platforms such as mobile money facilitate ecosystem value co-creation in the global South. Consequently, using a boundary resources model and platform governance approaches, this paper aims to examine how a payment platform facilitates ecosystem value co-creation with third party actors. An in-depth qualitative inquiry was adopted for the study using an embedded single-case design. The results show that although ecosystem value co-creation was enabled by the introduction of boundary resources tools, some platform governance practices hindered some complementors from harnessing the affordances of the platforms. These constraints include lack of visibility of the boundary resources and transparency challenges in the acceptance criteria. We thus argue that platform generativity on its own is not sufficient to support ecosystem value co-creation, but requires appropriate platform governance to deal with behavioural complexity of ecosystem actors by using optimal control mechanisms.","Chirwa, Elijah; Abbot, Pamela; Foster, Jonathan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09775v1.pdf,538

320339,Immunogenicity and Safety of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CoV) in patients with malignancy,2021,"The global pandemic caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is threatening the health and economic systems worldwide. Despite the enormous efforts of scientists and clinicians around the world, there is still no drug or vaccine available worldwide for the treatment and prevention of the infection. A rapid strategy for the identification of new treatments is based on repurposing existing clinically approved drugs that show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, after developing a quantitative structure activity relationship analysis based on molecular topology, several macrolide antibiotics are identified as promising SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibitors. To confirm the in silico results, the best candidates were tested against two human coronaviruses (i.e., 229E-GFP and SARS-CoV-2) in cell culture. Time-of-addition experiments and a surrogate model of viral cell entry were used to identify the steps in the virus life cycle inhibited by the compounds. Infection experiments demonstrated that azithromycin, clarithromycin, and lexithromycin reduce the intracellular accumulation of viral RNA and virus spread as well as prevent virus-induced cell death, by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Even though the three macrolide antibiotics display a narrow antiviral activity window against SARS-CoV-2, it may be of interest to further investigate their effect on the viral spike protein and their potential in combination therapies for the coronavirus disease 19 early stage of infection.","Galvez, Jorge; Zanni, Riccardo; Galvez-Llompart, Maria; Benlloch, Jose Maria",J Chem Inf Model,,538

It seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age, and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population. What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?Answer The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages. Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation. Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild. Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting. Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described. Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness. No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used. Children with immunocompromised states should be isolated and avoid contact with others.","Goldman, Ran D",Can Fam Physician,,538
321322,Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin from convalescent plasma,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","Amanpour, S",Arch Razi Inst,,538

The vulnerability index was developed in five steps as follows: (1) determining the principles and components of employees' susceptibility and resilience, (2) weighting the principles and components, (3) converting the levels of components to the sub-index values, (4) introducing the aggregation functions, and (5) characterizing the vulnerability index values in five categories as very high (80-100), high (65-79), medium (50-64), low (30-49), and very low (0-29). The average values of susceptibility, resilience, and vulnerability index of the employees were determined to be 35.2 ± 15.0, 73.9 ± 17.0, and 32.9 ± 12.7, respectively. The average resilience of the employees was more desirable than their average susceptibility. The distribution of the employees into the vulnerability index categories was 46.3% for very low, 41.9% for low, 3.6% for medium, and 8.2% for high. The worst cases of susceptibility and resilience principles were exposure to contaminated surfaces (59.1 ± 22.8) and top management commitment (66.6 ± 23.1). The elderly staff (especially over 50 years old), employees with low education levels, and employees in private and self-employment sectors were significantly more vulnerable (p value < 0.01) from the COVID-19 pandemic. The principles with significant incremental effects on the vulnerability index (p value < 0.05) were respectively top management commitment (+1.78), exposure to COVID-19 patients at work (+1.36), exposure to contaminated surfaces (+0.82), installing clear shields and wearing PPE (+0.59), observance of social distancing (+0.48), and just culture (+0.22). An especial plan to support the more vulnerable employees with an emphasis on the principles with the most incremental effects on the vulnerability index can efficiently control the inequality between the employees as well as occupational transmission of the COVID-19 in Iran.","Abtahi, Mehrnoosh; Gholamnia, Reza; Bagheri, Amin; Jabbari, Mousa; Koolivand, Ali; Dobaradaran, Sina; Jorfi, Sahand; Vaziri, Mohammad Hossein; Khoshkerdar, Masoomeh; Rastegari, Pedram; Saeedi, Reza",Environ Res,,538

The burden of such measures is also likely to be disproportionately felt by the worse-off members of society and will weigh heavily on future generations. This is both unfair and runs the risk of politically destabilizing the recovery process. To avoid these outcomes unconventional policy measure such as taxes on private wealth and digital economic activities, but also public debt monetization, should be considered. From a political perspective, governments should realize that policy coordination is the only successful exit strategy following a systemic economic shock. While the EU is moving faster than we are accustomed to, it still seems unable to respond quickly enough given the nature of the circumstances. In this picture, the G-20, provided it acts quickly over the coming months, could emerge as the sole global policy forum left on the playing field that can avoid that national interests will prevail eventually producing collectively sub-optimal results in the long-run.","Maffettone, Pietro; Oldani, Chiara",,,538

The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFN-ß) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-IFN-ß also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFN-ß against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Martinez, Miguel Angel",,,538

Typical symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, and sudden loss of taste and smell. Persistent, post-infection sequelae have been noted in a minority of cases. Severe complications and deaths occur mostly in older adults. Laboratory confirmation can be performed by viral RNA and antigen detection in nasal swabs or by detecting specific neutralizing antibodies. There is no effective and approved antiviral treatment, but several vaccines with favourable safety and efficacy profiles are being used in mass vaccination programmes. Vaccine-based COVID control should be seen as an addition to existing hygiene measures such as physical distancing, increased hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and barrier protection with personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers and other high-risk professions.","Inglis, Timothy J J; Mathee, Kalai",J. medical microbiol,,538
335059,"An investigation into the rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the first 6 weeks of the 2020-2021 academic year in primary and post-primary schools in Cork and Kerry, Ireland",2021,"When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wreaked an unprecedented havoc of an escalating number of deaths and hospitalization in the United States, clinicians were faced with a myriad of unanswered questions, one of the them being the implication of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with COVID-19. Animal data and human studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is an enzyme found in the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and is a coreceptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. Therefore, one can speculate that discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy may lead to decreased ACE2 expression, thereby attenuating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigating the disease progression of COVID-19. However, several studies have also shown that ACE2 exhibits reno- and cardioprotection and preserves lung function in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would favor ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This article is to examine and summarize the 2 opposing viewpoints and provide guideline recommendations to support the use or discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","Shyh, Grace I; Nawarskas, James J; Cheng-Lai, Angela",Cardiol Rev,,538

Epidemiological and clinical information was obtained for all confirmed COVID-19 cases, whose symptom onset was from March 9 to April 5, 2020. The basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, and serial interval (SI) were calculated. Time-varying R was estimated to assess the effectiveness of control measures. Of the 135 cases detected, 53 (39.3%) were imported. The median age was 36 (range = 0.5-72) years. Forty-one (30.4%) and 13 (9.6%) were presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, respectively. The median incubation period was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 5, range = 1-11), and the mean SI was 5.4 days (SD = 4.5; 95% CI: 4.3, 6.5). The reproduction number was between 3.9 and 6.0, and the doubling time was 1.3 days. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) was below one (Rt = 0.91; 95% credible interval: 0.62, 1.32) by the 13th day of the epidemic. Epidemic control was achieved through a combination of public health measures, with emphasis on a test-isolate-trace approach supplemented by travel restrictions and moderate physical distancing measures but no actual lockdown. Regular and ongoing testing of high-risk groups to supplement the existing surveillance program and a phased easing of physical distancing measures has helped maintain suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brunei, as evidenced by the identification of only six additional cases from April 5 to August 5, 2020.","Wong, Justin; Chaw, Liling; Koh, Wee Chian; Alikhan, Mohammad Fathi; Jamaludin, Sirajul Adli; Poh, Wan Wen Patricia; Naing, Lin",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,538

The study's purpose is to draw new insights into workplace stressors and employee withdrawal behavior. The study also considers the mediating role of aggression and the moderating role of COVID-19 worry and cyberloafing. Design/methodology/approach: The study's statistical population consists of 384 frontline hotel employees from Pakistan's hospitality industry. Statistical analysis SPSS and AMOS were utilized to conduct Pearson's correlation and multilevel regression analysis. A Hayes process technique has been used for moderation and mediation analysis. Findings: The results demonstrated that COVID-19 has a psychological effect on the employee's mental health and higher turnover intention during the current pandemic. Workplace stressor is significantly related to aggression and employee withdrawal behavior. Aggression mediates the relationship between workplace stressors and withdrawal behavior. The study results show that COVID-19 worry moderates between workplace stressors and aggression – notably, cyberloafing moderate aggression and withdrawal behavior. Practical implications: The government and hospitality organizations need to implement crisis management strategies in response to COVID-19. This research can help management in coping with employees' mental and psychological challenges. Employees' mental health has been affected during the current global health crises. Firms should encourage their employees psychologically while going for downsizing. Originality/value: This study enhances the existing literature on the COVID-19 crisis in Pakistan's hospitality industry. This study contributes to new understandings of employees' withdrawal behavior in the hospitality industry. The research shows how COVID-19 affects employees' turnover, mental health and job performance in the hospitality industry. Employees are facing mental and physiological challenges during COVID-19.

339566,Air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room,2020,"BACKGROUND: Optimal timing of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 is uncertain. We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index ([SpO2/FIO2]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multi-centered retrospective observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (&#8804;48 hours of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (>48 hours). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary endpoints including time specific mortality, need for ECMO, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS: 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. 164 (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. 108 subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs. 53.2%; P=0.18) or any of the secondary endpoints between early and late HFNC failure groups. This remained true even when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review, HFNC was a viable strategy and mechanical ventilation was avoided in the majority of subjects. In the minority that progressed to mechanical ventilation, duration of HFNC did not differentiate subjects with worse clinical outcomes. The ROX index was sensitive for the identification of subjects successfully weaned from HFNC. Prospective studies in COVID-19 are warranted to confirm these findings and to optimize patient selection for use of HFNC in this disease.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Brown, A Whitney; Collins, A Claire; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Cameron, Paula C; Desai, Mehul; Kasarabada, Aditya; Kilcullen, Jack K; Nathan, Steven D; King, Christopher S",Respir. care,,538

An online survey was performed to assess the prevalence of pandemic-related emotional burden, mental health disorders and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers of children and adolescents with diabetes under the age of 18 and caregivers of youth without diabetes for the non-diabetes group were invited to participate. For the primary outcome, mental health disorders were evaluated using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), while pandemic-related emotional burden and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care were evaluated in different domains with specific questions. For analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy was performed. A total of 764 participants were included in the study. Regarding the pandemic period, caregivers of youth with type 1 diabetes endorsed significantly more pandemic-related emotional burden for both themselves (OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.53) and for their child (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.38) when compared to the non-diabetes group. The emotional burden evaluation on different age ranges showed that the two groups were similar when the dependent youth was younger than 6 years. Moreover, a positive screening for mental health disorders during social distancing was higher in the diabetes group compared to the non-diabetes group (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.70 to 3.47), particularly in those aged under 12 years old. There was no difference between groups in mental health disorders among caregivers of adolescents older than 12 years.

339963,First Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay in Pleural Fluid,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has presented challenges to healthcare systems and healthcare professionals internationally. After one year of the pandemic, the initial evidence on health system responses begins to consolidate, and there is a need to identify and synthesise experiences of responding to COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and other health system stakeholders. This systematic review of primary qualitative studies depicts the experiences and perceptions of organisations and actors at multiple levels of health systems internationally in responding to COVID-19. METHODS: Six main databases of biomedical information, public health and health administration research were searched over the period October 1, 2019, to October 21, 2020. Information extracted from included studies was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were eligible for data extraction. Nine of those studies, of lower methodological quality, were removed from the thematic analysis of study results. Considering the professional level experiences, predominant themes of the studies consisted of the new roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers, burnout and distress, recognition of ´unseen´ healthcare workers, and positive changes and emergent solutions amid the crisis. Organisational level findings of the studies included provision of psychological support, COVID-19 as ""catalyst"" for change, and exercise of more ""open"" leadership by managers and health authorities. Continuous training, regulation of working conditions, providing supportive resources, coordinating a diversity of actors, and reviewing and updating regulations were roles identified at the local health system level. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of frontline healthcare workers have been the focus of attention of the majority of primary qualitative studies as of October 2020. However, organisational and wider system level studies indicate that some responses to COVID-19 have been characterised by increased emphasis on coordination activities by local health system actors, making service adaptations at pace, and reliance on expanded roles of front-line workers. The need for theory-informed qualitative studies was identified at the organisational level.

New Orleans, Louisiana was one of the places most heavily affected by the coronavirus during its early outbreak. The study that follows explores the attitudes of African Americans in New Orleans toward the virus, social and normative conditions which affected individual behaviors, as well as access to healthcare services and COVID-19 testing. In part one of the study, qualitative responses were collected from a sample of African Americans in the New Orleans area to garner perspective about their attitudes and behaviors related to the coronavirus outbreak. Part two of the study builds on findings from Study 1 with parameter estimates from a Logit regression to examine how social, economic and physical conditions determine vulnerability to COVID-19 infection among African Americans.

340443,Do children need a longer time to shed SARS-CoV-2 in stool than adults?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The endgame literature recommends that, for a tobacco sales ban to be successful, several demand-side preconditions (eg, low prevalence and effective cessation support) should be in place. The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVES: To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning. METHODS: Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban. RESULTS: About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels. CONCLUSIONS: The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.","Filby, Samantha; van der Zee, Kirsten; van Walbeek, Corné",Tob. control,,538
340582,The role of the exposome in promoting resilience or susceptibility after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is little data in the literature on acute kidney injury (AKI) in Covid-19 cases, although relevant in clinical practice in the ICU, especially in Brazil. Our goal was to identify the incidence of AKI, predictive factors and impact on hospital mortality. METHOD: Retrospective cohort of patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ICU. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Data was collected from electronic medical records between March 17 and April 26. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 55.9% progressed with AKI, and the majority (66.7%) was classified as stage 3. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. Twenty-three patients died. In the group without kidney injury, there were 8.9% deaths, while in the group with AKI, 33.3% of patients died (RR 5.125; 95% CI 1.598 - 16.431; p = 0.0060). The average survival, in days, was higher in the group without AKI. Cox multivariate analysis showed age (RR 1.054; 95% CI 1.014 - 1.095; p = 0.0080) and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR 8.953; 95% CI 1.128 - 71.048; p = 0.0380) as predictors of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of AKI; and as predictive factors for its occurrence: age, eGFR and hypertension. AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality.","Costa, Rafael Lessa da; Sória, Taíza Corrêa; Salles, Eliene Ferreira; Gerecht, Ana Venâncio; Corvisier, Maurício Faria; Menezes, Márcia Adélia de Magalhães; Ávila, Carla da Silveira; Silva, Eduardo Costa de Freitas; Pereira, Sara Regina Neto; Simvoulidis, Luiz Fernando Nogueira",J. bras. nefrol,,538

This multinational study of LATAM youth examined the distinguishing features of acute or late multisystem SARS COV2 with versus without cardiac involvement. A consecutive sample of youth 0-18 years old (N = 98;50% male) presenting with multisystem SARS COV2 to 32 centers in 10 Latin American countries participating in a pediatric cardiac multi-imaging society were grouped as with versus without cardiac involvement, defined as abnormal echocardiographic findings or arrhythmia. Collected clinical data were analyzed by Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test. Cardiac (N = 48, 50% male) versus no cardiac (N = 50, 50% male) were similar in age; weight; nonrespiratory symptoms; and medical history. The cardiac group had 1 death and symptoms including coronary artery dilation, ejection fraction <50%, pericardial effusion, peripheral edema, arrhythmia, and pulmonary artery thrombus. The cardiac group had higher risk of ICU admission (77% vs 54%, p = 0.02); invasive ventilation (23% vs 4%,p = 0.007); vasoactive infusions (27% vs 4%, p = 0.002); prominent respiratory symptoms (60% vs 36%, p < 0.03); abnormal chest imaging (69% vs 34%, p = 0.001); troponin (33% vs 12%, p = 0.01); alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 12%, p = 0.02); and thrombocytopenia (46% vs 22%, p = 0.02). Receiver operating curve analysis showed that abnormal laboratories had 94% sensitivity and 98% negative predictive value on the need for ICU interventions.Conclusion: In LATAM children with multisystem SARS COV2, cardiac involvement was prevalent. Cardiac involvement was more likely to require ICU interventions, certain abnormal labs, and respiratory involvement. What is Known: â¢ SARS COV2 can be asymptomatic in children but in some cases can have serious multisystemic involvement. â¢ Hispanic ethnicity is purportedly at high risk of SARS COV2 in nations where they are often disadvantaged minority populations. What is New: â¢ Latin American children presenting with multisystem SARS COV2 frequently have cardiac involvement which was associated with ICU interventions; prominent respiratory symptoms; abnormal chest X-ray; elevated troponin, ALT, and thrombocytopenia. â¢ Elevated troponin, ALT or thrombocytopenia had high sensitivity and negative predictive value on the need for intensive care interventions.","Pignatelli, Ricardo; Antona, Clara Vazquez; Rivera, Ivan Romero; Zenteno, Patricia Alvarez; Acosta, Yanet Toribio; Huertas-Quiñones, Manuel; Murillo, Carlos Alvarez; Torres, Franklin Mendoza; Cabalin, Carlos Fernandez; Camacho, Ana Galván; Pérez, Alex Alcántara; Lombardi, Ana Braga; Soares, Andressa Mussi; Garcia, Carolina Torres; Borges, Cibelle Teixeira; Villalba, Claudia Natalia; Lechado, Cristhian Ramírez; Dias, Deborah Trevisan; Morales, Diana Aravena; Copete, Elizabeth Mora; Goldenberg, Guillermo Larios; Salazar, Jahaira Sussety; Moreira, Jessica Alchundia; Asakura, Junko; Sabando, Karla Solórzano; Branco, Klebia Castello; Rosas, Lida Toro; Duarte, Magna Pereira; Carbajal, María Jiménez; Hernandez, Martha Rubio; Martínez, Moisés Mier; Echeverría, Nancy Garay; Caneva, Olga Maza; Sepulveda, Patricia Romero; Díaz, Paulina Agurto; Plúas, Ruth Rugel; Alvarado, Theo Contreras; Faundes, Lorena Tapia; Diaz, Yeny Briones; Zachariah, Justin P",Eur. j. pediatr,,538

For single people, their opportunities to meet a partner were completely lost. For couples who lived apart, this meant that they were not able to see their partner for many months. However, by contrast, for cohabiting couples, lockdown meant that they were forced to spend 24 h a day with each other, and perhaps their children or housemates, for months at a time. As lockdowns have loosened around the world, the possibility of a second wave arises, and lockdowns are being reinstated in many regions. The prospect of potential long-term lockdowns means that adjusting to this new normal in relationships is an important consideration.

342040,The immunopathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"It is of vital importance to understand and track the dynamics of rapidly unfolding epidemics. The health and economic consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic provide a poignant case. Here we point out that since they are based on differential equations, the most widely used models of epidemic spread are plagued by an approximation that is not justified in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the example of data from New York City, we show that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic reproduction number ($R_0$). The correct description, based on integral equations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more accurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in $R_0$ due to restrictive public congregation measures. It also provides a novel way to determine the incubation period, and most importantly, as we demonstrate for several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of $R_0$ and thus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures. Integral equation based models do not only provide the conceptually correct description, they also have more predictive power than differential equation based models, therefore we do not see any reason for using the latter.","Fodor, Z.; Katz, S.

Nigella sativa, commonly known as black seed or black cumin, has been a historical and traditional plant since thousands of years. Based on their therapeutic efficacy, the chief components of terpenoids and flavonoids were selected from N. sativa seeds and seed oil. This study was designed to check the antiviral efficacy of N. sativa main phytoconstituents against five potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico structure-based virtual screening approach. Out of twenty five phytocomponents, ten components showed best binding affinity against two viral proteins viz. N-terminal RNA binding domain (NRBD; PDB ID: 6M3M) of nucleocapsid protein and papain-like protease (PL-PRO; PDB ID: 6W9C) of SARS-CoV-2 using AutoDock 4.2.6, AutoDock Vina and iGEMDOCK. PASS analyses of all ten phytocomponents using Lipinski's Rule of five showed promising results. Further, druglikeness and toxicity assessment using OSIRIS Data Warrior v5.2.1 software exhibited the feasibility of phytocomponents as drug candidates with no predicted toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulation study of NRBD of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-alpha-spinasterol complex and PL-PRO-cycloeucalenol complex displayed strong stability at 300 K. Both these complexes exhibited constant root mean square deviation (RMSDs) of protein side chains and C&#945; atoms throughout the simulation run time. Interestingly, PL-PRO and NRBD are key proteins in viral replication, host cell immune evasion and viral assembly. Thus, NRBD and PL-PRO have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets for N. sativa phytoconstituents in drug discovery process against COVID-19.","Siddiqui, Sahabjada; Upadhyay, Shivbrat; Ahmad, Rumana; Gupta, Anamika; Srivastava, Aditi; Trivedi, Anchal; Husain, Ishrat; Ahmad, Bilal; Ahamed, Maqusood; Khan, Mohsin Ali",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,538

The quality of care management is a factor that needs to be explored, more specifically optimal organisation of first-line treatment. METHODS: A retrospective study, dealing with all patients diagnosed within the Rhone-Alpes region with initial diagnosis EOC in 2012, was performed. The aim was to describe the impact of multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTB) in the organisation of care and the consequence on the patient's outcomes. RESULTS: 271 EOC were analysed. 206 patients had an advanced EOC. Median progression-free survival (PFS) is 17.8 months (CI95%, 14.6-21.2) for AOC. 157 patients (57.9%) had a front-line surgery versus 114 patients (42.1%) interval debulking surgery. PFS for AOC patients with no residual disease is 24.3 months compared with 15.3 months for patients with residual disease (p = .01). No macroscopic residual disease is more frequent in the patients discussed before surgery in MTB compared with patients not submitted before surgery (73% vs. 56.2%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the heterogeneity of medical practices in terms of front-line surgery versus interval surgery, in the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in the setting of MTB discussion.","Ferraioli, Domenico; Bally, Olivia; Meeus, Pierre; Benayoun, David; Bakrin, Naoual; De Saint Hilaire, Pierre; Beal Ardisson, Dominique; Provençal, Jocelyne; Barletta, Hugues; Mousseau, Mireille; Chauleur, Céline; Verbaere, Sylvain; Knibiehly, Alain; Fuso, Luca; Charreton, Amandine; Devouassoux-Shisheboran, Mojgan; Chopin, Nicolas; Glehen, Olivier; Labrosse-Canat, Hélène; Farsi, Fadila; Ray-Coquard, Isabelle",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),,538

It is a life-threatening infectious disease affecting breathing organ like thorax and one or both lungs in human body commonly caused by bacteria. Physicians and radiologists are quiet using physical and visual graphical manners in order to diagnose the chest X-rays. Patient's diagnoses are entirely dependent on the consultant given by that chest expert. However, there might be emergency circumstances where radiology experts are too busy or may not be accessible. The timely and early diagnosis of thoracic diseases is very important. To resolve this situation, an algorithm that accept poster anterior (PA) chest X-rays images which classify whether the thorax is infected or not. If a thorax is infected, the proposed model will figure out which type of thoracic disorder is available on that PA view X-ray image. The proposed model can significantly improve the efficiency of doctors by early detection of the diseases using Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) wielding deep learning. Thus, an intelligent and automatic system is required to diagnose the chest radiograph to detect the various thorax related diseases. This research employ a web oriented identification system using deep learning based convolutional neural network algorithms for the detection, classification and early stage diagnosis of chest radiograph into healthy and thoracic disorders patients including COVID-19. The deep learning model is trained and tested on different radiographs which contain normal and numerous thorax disorders patient. Moreover, after developing the neural network model for the early diagnosis of the numerous thoracic disorders, a graphical user interface (web) based disease screening system also described for visualized the accurate diagnosis X-ray images in respective target disease classes. © 2021 IEEE.","Pant, H.; Lohani, M.

DESIGN: We conducted a biosafety risk assessment for autopsy workers using the process developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health and applied these findings as the basis of laboratory design and construction. RESULTS: Autopsy workers are unpredictably exposed to a variety of infectious organisms including hepatitis C virus, HIV and M. tuberculosis. Hazardous autopsy procedures include using and encountering sharp objects, and the generation of aerosols from dissection, fluid aspiration, rinsing tissues, and dividing bone with an oscillating saw. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to bloodborne and airborne pathogens from procedures that can cause cutaneous inoculation and inhalation of aerosols indicates that human autopsies should be performed at Biosafety Level 3. We designed a large entirely Biosafety Level 3 medical examiner autopsy laboratory using design principles and characteristics that can be scaled to accommodate smaller academic or other hospital-based autopsy spaces. Containment was achieved through a concentric ring design, with access control at interface zones. As new autopsy laboratories are planned, we strongly recommend that they be designed to function uniformly at Biosafety Level 3.","Nolte, Kurt B; Muller, Timothy B; Denmark, Adam M; Burstein, Ron; Villalobos, Yvonne A",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,538
350057,SARS-CoV-2 associated rhabdomyolysis in 32 patients,2021,"Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population with unique health and safety challenges related to the entire spectrum of the social determinants of health. These challenges place migrant and seasonal farmworkers at a disproportionate risk of infection and illness because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report presents a case study of an early COVID-19 outbreak among migrant farmworkers in Iowa and describes the role that a nimble and responsive mobile federally qualified health center played in the successful mitigation and response to this outbreak. Early during the pandemic, the clinic adopted a new model of service delivery utilizing telemedicine primary care visits, followed by in-person visits when necessary. As the pandemic progressed, clinic staff strategized to provide increased pandemic-related support to agricultural employers and migrant farmworkers across the state. Emphasis was placed on on-site testing and education regarding social distancing, mask utilization, and hand washing. Eventually, as migrant workers were infected and became symptomatic, more complex mitigation strategies such as isolation, quarantine, and clinical follow-up were also implemented. This report describes how a mobile primary care clinic developed a pandemic responsive model to provide successful mitigation of an early COVID-19 outbreak among essential and highly vulnerable migrant farmworkers.","Corwin, Claudia; Sinnwell, Emily; Culp, Kennith",J Agromedicine,,538

351535,Dynamics of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent plasma donors,2021,"In the context of covid-19, aerosol generating procedures have been highlighted as requiring a higher grade of personal protective equipment. We investigated how official guidance documents and academic publications have classified procedures in terms of whether or not they are aerosol-generating. We performed a rapid systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses standards. Guidelines, policy documents and academic papers published in english or french offering guidance on aerosol-generating procedures were eligible. We systematically searched two medical databases (medline, cochrane central) and one public search engine (google) in march and april 2020. Data on how each procedure was classified by each source were extracted. We determined the level of agreement across different guidelines for each procedure group, in terms of its classification as aerosol generating, possibly aerosol-generating, or nonaerosol-generating. 128 documents met our inclusion criteria; they contained 1248 mentions of procedures that we categorised into 39 procedure groups. Procedures classified as aerosol-generating or possibly aerosol-generating by &#8805;90% of documents included autopsy, surgery/postmortem procedures with high-speed devices, intubation and extubation procedures, bronchoscopy, sputum induction, manual ventilation, airway suctioning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tracheostomy and tracheostomy procedures, non-invasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy, breaking closed ventilation systems, nebulised or aerosol therapy, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation. Disagreements existed between sources on some procedure groups, including oral and dental procedures, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, thoracic surgery and procedures, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. There is sufficient evidence of agreement across different international guidelines to classify certain procedure groups as aerosol generating. However, some clinically relevant procedures received surprisingly little mention in our source documents. To reduce dissent on the remainder, we recommend that (a) clinicians define procedures more clearly and specifically, breaking them down into their constituent components where possible; (b) researchers undertake further studies of aerosolisation during these procedures; and (c) guideline-making and policy-making bodies address a wider range of procedures.","Jackson, Tanya; Deibert, Danika; Wyatt, Graeme; Durand-Moreau, Quentin; Adisesh, Anil; Khunti, Kamlesh; Khunti, Sachin; Smith, Simon; Chan, Xin Hui S; Ross, Lawrence; Roberts, Nia; Toomey, Elaine; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Arora, Isheeta; Black, Susannah M; Drake, Jonathan; Syam, Nandana; Temple, Robert; Straube, Sebastian",,,538
351537,Dynamics of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent plasma donors,2021,"The COVID-19 public health crisis has quickly led to an economic crisis, impacting many people and businesses in the world. This study examines how the pandemic affects workforces and workers' income. We quantify the impact of staggered resumption of work, after the coronavirus lockdowns, on the migrant workers' income. Using data on population movements of 366 Chinese cities at the daily level from the Baidu Maps-Migration Big Data Platform and historical data on the average monthly income of migrant workers, we find that the average work resumption rate (WRR) during the period of the Chinese Lantern Festival was 25.25%, which was only 30.67% of that in the same matched lunar calendar period in 2019. We then apply Gray Model First Order One Variable [GM (1, 1)] to predict the monthly income of migrant workers during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that, if without the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average monthly income of migrant workers in 2020 will be expected to increase by 12% compared with 2019. We further conduct scenario analysis and show that the average monthly income of migrant workers in 2020 under the conservative scenario (COS), medium scenario (MES), and worse scenario (WOS) will be predicted to decrease by 2, 21, and 44%, respectively. Through testing, our prediction error is <5%.

352140,Pattern of genomic variation in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) suggests restricted nonrandom changes: Analysis using Shewhart control charts,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been over 2 million deaths globally. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be the main cause of death. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical features, outcomes, and ARDS characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Chongqing, China. METHODS: The epidemiology of COVID-19 from January 21, 2020, to March 15, 2020, in Chongqing, China, was analyzed retrospectively, and 75 ICU patients from two hospitals were included in this study. On day 1, 56 patients with ARDS were selected for subgroup analysis, and a modified Poisson regression was performed to identify predictors for the early improvement of ARDS (eiARDS). RESULTS: Chongqing reported a 5.3% case fatality rate for the 75 ICU patients. The median age of these patients was 57 (IQR 25-75) years, and no bias was present in the sex ratio. A total of 93% (n=70) of patients developed ARDS during ICU stay, and more than half had moderate ARDS. However, most patients (n=41, 55%) underwent high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one-third of patients with ARDS improved (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration >300 mm Hg) in 1 week, which was defined as eiARDS. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and a shorter length of ICU stay than those without eiARDS. Age (<55 years) was the only variable independently associated with eiARDS, with a risk ratio of 2.67 (95% CI 1.17-6.08). CONCLUSIONS: A new subphenotype of ARDS-eiARDS-in patients with COVID-19 was identified. As clinical outcomes differ, the stratified management of patients based on eiARDS or age is highly recommended.","Zhan, Zhu; Yang, Xin; Du, Hu; Zhang, Chuanlai; Song, Yuyan; Ran, Xiaoyun; Zhang, An; Yang, Mei",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,538

353783,Safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among healthcare workers in China,2021,"Aims At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Ireland, many routine and surveillance endoscopies were deferred, with onlyurgent procedures prioritised. The PillCam ESO (Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam, Israel) is a non-invasive investigation, whichoffers an alternative method of evaluating the UGI tract for non-urgent referrals for endoscopy. A prospective study to assess if the PillCam ESO can identify important anatomical landmarks stated in the British Societyof Gastroenterology quality standards for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and pathology in the Upper GI Tract. Methods Patients who fitted our inclusion criteria were prospectively invited to participate into our trial. The three main indications were 1;patients with dyspepsia less than 40 years of age with no red flag symptoms, 2;knowncirrhosis to screen for varices, 3;UGI bleeds with a low Blatchford score (≤2). A local protocol for ingestion and series of positional guidelines was developed for the procedure. Endoscopic landmarks, and pathology detection were evaluated by two independent endoscopists. Results 32 exams have been successfully performed from June 2020 to date without complications. The two frequentindications were dyspepsia (66 %) and abdominal pain (19 %). Metoclopramide was administered in 66 % of cases. Visualisation of the following major anatomical landmarks was achieved in 100 % of cases: Oesophagus, oesophageal-gastro junction, greater curve, pylorus. A full view of the cardia, fundus, lesser curve, incisura angularis and antrum was obtained in 97 %, 87 %, 93 %, 97 % and97 % of cases, respectively. D2 intubation was achieved in 90 % of cases. A normal exam was reported in 34 % of cases.Reflux oesophagitis and gastritis were the most common pathology detected. Adenocarcinoma of the OG junction wasdetected in 1 case. Conclusions The PillCam ESO achieves excellent views of the upper GI tract. In selective cases, it is a safe alternative togastroscopy which may help reduce gastroscopy waiting times.","Nwaezeigwe, M.; Quinlivan, L.; O039,; Neill, J.; Kaar, A.; Grady, J.; Buckley, M.",Endoscopy,,538

We have found an active phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, (13aR,14R)-9,11,12,13,13a,14-hexahydro-3,6,7-trimethoxydibenzo[f,h]pyrrolo[1,2-b]isoquinolin-14-ol (HTBPI), is a promising Akt inhibitor effective in the suppression of HCC cells proliferation through stimulating apoptotic and autophagic capability in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of HTBPI combined with a classical autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor (bafilomycin A1), could enhance stimulation effects of apoptosis on HCC cell lines. In addition, we confirmed HTBPI targeting Akt, occupied the kinase binding domain (Thr 308) of Akt to inactivate its function by CETSA and DARTS assay. In contrast, ectopic Akt-induced overexpression significantly abrogated inhibitory effects of HTBPI on cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, high p-Akt (Thr 308) expression is collated with liver tumor formation and poor survival in HCC patients. In conclusions, HTBPI impeded HCC progress through regulation of apoptosis and autophagy machinery via interaction with p-Akt (Thr 308). This may provide potential molecular candidate by targeting Akt for the therapy of HCC patients.","Liu, Hongwei; Chen, Qian; Lu, Di; Pang, Xu; Yin, Shuangshuang; Wang, Kailong; Wang, Rui; Yang, Shenshen; Zhang, Yi; Qiu, Yuling; Wang, Tao; Yu, Haiyang",FASEB J,,538

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial - a secondary analysis. SETTING: University hospital setting. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred older adults with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn & Yahr 2 and 3). INTERVENTION: Training group (n = 51): 10 weeks (3 times/week) of intensive balance and gait training, incorporating dual tasks. Control group (n = 49): care as usual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spatiotemporal gait variables collected during normal and fast walking on a pressure-sensitive mat. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate training effects post intervention and at the 6 and 12 month follow-up. RESULTS: Immediate training effects in the pace domain of gait were increased step velocity (normal speed: 8.2 cm/s, P = 0.04; fast: 10.8 cm/s, P < 0.01), increased step length (normal speed: 3 cm, P = 0.05; fast: 2.3 cm, P = 0.05) and reduced swing time variability (fast speed: -2.5 ms, P = 0.02). In the rhythm domain reduced step time (fast speed: -19.3 ms, P = 0.02), stance time (normal: -24.3 ms, P = 0.01; fast: -29.6 ms, P = 0.02) and swing time (fast speed: -8.7 ms, P = 0.04) was seen. Relative to the variability domain, the training decreased step time variability (fast: -2.8 ms, P = 0.02) and stance time variability (fast: -3.9 ms, P = 0.02). No training effects were retained at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Highly challenging balance and gait training improved pace, rhythm and variability aspects of PD gait in the short-term, but effects are not retained long-term.

Each drug or drug combination was tested in patch clamp assays on seven cardiac ion channels, in in silico models of human ventricular electrophysiology (Virtual Assay) using control (healthy) or high-risk cell populations, and in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. In each assay, concentration-response curves encompassing and exceeding therapeutic free plasma levels were generated. Both CLQ and OH-CLQ showed blocking activity against some potassium, sodium, and calcium currents. CLQ and OH-CLQ inhibited IKr (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50 ]: 1 µM and 3-7 µM, respectively) and IK1 currents (IC50 : 5 and 44 µM, respectively). When combining OH-CLQ with AZI, no synergistic effects were observed. The two macrolides had no or very weak effects on the ion currents (IC50 > 300-1000 µM). Using Virtual Assay, both antimalarials affected several TdP indicators, CLQ being more potent than OH-CLQ. Effects were more pronounced in the high-risk cell population. In hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, all drugs showed early after-depolarizations, except AZI. Combining CLQ or OH-CLQ with a macrolide did not aggravate their effects. In conclusion, our integrated nonclinical CiPA dataset confirmed that, at therapeutic plasma concentrations relevant for malaria or off-label use in COVID-19, CLQ and OH-CLQ use is associated with a proarrhythmia risk, which is higher in populations carrying predisposing factors but not worsened with macrolide combination.","Delaunois, Annie; Abernathy, Matthew; Anderson, Warren D; Beattie, Kylie A; Chaudhary, Khuram W; Coulot, Julie; Gryshkova, Vitalina; Hebeisen, Simon; Holbrook, Mark; Kramer, James; Kuryshev, Yuri; Leishman, Derek; Lushbough, Isabel; Passini, Elisa; Redfern, Will S; Rodriguez, Blanca; Rossman, Eric I; Trovato, Cristian; Wu, Caiyun; Valentin, Jean-Pierre",Clinical and translational science (Online),,538
357895,SARS-CoV-2 serological assay and viral testing: a report of professional football setting,2021,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 has been compared with other strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with the flu viruses: all of them manifest themselves with respiratory symptoms and, although their genetic patterns are similar, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly reached global dimensions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus with greater spreading capacity, albeit less lethal. Compared with influenza viruses, coronaviruses have a longer incubation period and the patients with coronaviruses' syndromes develop more severe diseases requiring frequent hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The aim was to explore the relationships between seasonal influenza vaccination and coronavirus infection and to understand whether this hypothetic role by the flu vaccines modifies SARS-CoV-2 infection's outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we enrolled 952 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 448 were admitted to our two main hospitals in Ferrara territory, while the remaining 504 were isolated at home. We compared the group of patients who had been vaccinated for influenza in the previous 12 months to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for both the need for hospitalization and 30-day mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We found age to be the only independent risk factor for a worse 30-day prognosis, while gender, influenza vaccinations and age itself were independent risk factors for undergoing hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In our groups of patients, we found a relationship between seasonal influenza vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age seems to be the main risk factor for short-term mortality in COVID-19 inpatients, while the influenza vaccination is, together with gender and age itself, a determining factor in predicting the need for hospitalization.","Greco, S; Bella, A; Bonsi, B; Fabbri, N; Califano, A; Morrone, S; Chessa, P; Pistolesi, C; Zuliani, G; De Motoli, F; Manfredini, R; De Giorgi, A; Passaro, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,538

With millions of people infected around the World and already thousands of deaths, there is still a great uncertainty on the actual evolution of the crisis, as well as on the possible post-crisis scenarios, which depend on a number of key variables and factors (e.g. a treatment, a vaccine or some kind of immunity). Despite the optimism enforced by the positive results recently achieved to produce a vaccine, uncertainty is probably still somehow the predominant feeling. From a more philosophical perspective, the COVID-19 drama is also a kind of stress-test for our global system and, probably, an opportunity to reconsider some aspects underpinning it, as well as its sustainability. In this article we focus on the pre-crisis situation by combining a number of selected global indicators that are likely to represent measures of different aspects of life. How was the World actually performing? We have defined 6 macro-categories and inferred their relevance from different sources. Results show that economic-oriented priorities correspond to positive performances, while all other distributions point to a negative performance. Additionally, balanced and economy-focused distributions of weights propose an optimistic interpretation of performance regardless of the absolute score.","Pileggi, Salvatore F",Qual Quant,,538

The levels of AST, LDH-L, PCT, ferritin, and D-dimer in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the nonsevere group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Children with severe adenovirus pneumonia have severe clinical manifestations and many complications. AST, LDH-L, PCT, ferritin, and D-dimer levels have important clinical implications for assessing disease severity.","Xu, Na; Chen, Peng; Wang, Ying",Biomed Res Int,,538

363127,SARS-Cov-2 Infection versus Vaccine-Induced Immunity among Veterans,2021,"Introduction: Early evidence confirms lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake in established ethnic minority populations, yet there has been little focus on understanding vaccine hesitancy and barriers to vaccination in migrants. Growing populations of precarious migrants (including undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees) in the UK and Europe are considered to be under-immunised groups and may be excluded from health systems, yet little is known about their views on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, which are essential to identify key solutions and action points to strengthen vaccine roll-out. Methods: We did an in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview study of recently arrived migrants (foreign-born, >18 years old; <10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake. We used the 'Three Cs' model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising. The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630). Results: We approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (nâ¯=â¯3), asylum seekers (nâ¯=â¯19), undocumented migrants (nâ¯=â¯8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (nâ¯=â¯2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions). 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need. Participants reported a range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine and expressed concerns that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out. Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine. All participants (nâ¯=â¯10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this. Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Precarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake. Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities. These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations.

363382,Pediatric Ischemic Stroke: An Infrequent Complication of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals while also clearing essential staff to continue to work. At the current time, a number of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple positions in the viral genome. While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, given the large number of transmission chains, it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might compromise these assays. Here, we report the identification of a C-to-U transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E gene qRT-PCR in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant were still called SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms that might adversely affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted to avoid false negatives.","Artesi, Maria; Bontems, Sébastien; Göbbels, Paul; Franckh, Marc; Maes, Piet; Boreux, Raphaël; Meex, Cécile; Melin, Pierrette; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bours, Vincent; Durkin, Keith",J. clin. microbiol,,538

The aim was to analyze the correlation between a wide panel of urinary biomarkers and serum concentrations of anti C1q antibodies with histological items of activity and chronicity on kidney biopsy in LN patients. METHODS: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were included. LN diagnosis was based on ACR criteria. Histologic features of activity and chronicity indices were analyzed according to the Austin classification. Serum Anti C1q levels were determined by commercial ELISA. Urinary levels of transferrin, ceruloplasmin (CP), VCAM-1, TWEAK, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein were measured by commercial ELISA. RESULTS: We included 120 SLE patients (81% female, mean age 33.1 ± 9.3 years, 59.4% Mestizo, 37.8% Afro-Latin American): 64% had LN. Kidney biopsy was performed in 55 patients, but only 37 were made in our center. Anti C1q antibodies were associated with endocapillary proliferation. In patients with cellular crescents, urinary concentrations of CP were significantly higher. In patients with a chronicity index (CI) &#8805; 4, fibrous crescents, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis, urinary MCP-1 levels were higher. CONCLUSIONS: In SLE patients, serum anti C1q antibodies and urinary CP were associated with activity on kidney biopsy and MCP-1 with chronic damage. This panel of biomarkers could be validated in larger, multi-ethnic population as a complementary tool for better stratification of LN patients. Key Points â¢ Urinary biomarkers are complementary useful tools for the assessment of SLE patients. â¢ Urinary levels of CP correlated with activity findings on kidney biopsy in LN patients. â¢ Urinary levels of MCP-1 correlated with chronic damage, especially with fibrous crescents, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.","Urrego-Callejas, Tomás; Álvarez, Simón Sandoval; Arias, Luis F; Reyes, Blanca Ortiz; Vanegas-García, Adriana L; González, Luis A; Muñoz-Vahos, Carlos H; Vásquez, Gloria; Quintana, Luis F; Gómez-Puerta, José A",Clin. rheumatol,,538

365942,"A Data-Driven Simulation of the Exposure Notification Cascade for Digital Contact Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Zurich, Switzerland",2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the last months great efforts have been developed to evaluate the more efficient therapeutic agents in the management of patients with COVID-19. Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. METHODS: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, hazard ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Valero-Ubierna, María Del Carmen; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,538
365943,"A Data-Driven Simulation of the Exposure Notification Cascade for Digital Contact Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Zurich, Switzerland",2021,"Boredom in adolescence is often underestimated, although it may be the sign of a profound unease or be associated with psychological disorders. Given the complexity of the construct of boredom and its increasing prevalence among adolescents in recent years, the present study aimed to validate the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) in adolescents using a cross-validation approach. The study involved 272 students (33.8% males, 66.2% females) aged 14–19 (M = 15.9, SD = 1.38) living in northern and central Italy. In addition to the MSBS, the Symptoms Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) were administered. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated a 23-item structure of the MSBS, comprising five correlated factors. The tool showed a good internal consistency for these factors and a good convergent and factor validity. The MSBS consequently seems a valid and reliable method for assessing boredom in adolescence. The cut-off for the total score that could pinpoint cases posing a potential clinical risk was 88. A weak correlation was found between the total level of boredom and the daily Internet usage, while no relationship emerged between boredom and age, gender, and grades. Since excessive levels of boredom may conceal a general unease that could develop into structured psychological disorders, the value of the MSBS lies in enabling us to identify in advance adolescents at potential clinical risk.","Spoto, Andrea Iannattone Sara Valentini Perla Raffagnato Alessia Miscioscia Marina Gatta Michela",Children,,538

Global rules in most countries had previously limited the use of drones to military applications due to their deployment in the open air, drones are likely to be lost, destroyed, or physically hijacked. However, more recently, the presence of COVID-19 has forced the world to present new implementing measures which will also widen the use of drones in civil and commercial and social applications, especially now in the delivery of medicines for medical home care. In the period of required public isolation as a consequence of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, this knowledge has become one of the principal partners in the fight against the coronavirus. This paper offers a summary of the medical drone manufacturing, with a specific emphasis on its approval by the pharmaceutical sector to solve logistical problems in healthcare during times of sensitive need. We also discuss the numerous challenges to be met in the integration of drones to save our lives and suggest future research directions. The question that arises for this problem, how to optimize delivery medical supplies times in-home health care made up of drones? We conducted a synthesis literature review devoted to the use of UAVs in healthcare with their different aspects. A total of different research made are given to describe the role of UAV in Home healthcare with the presence of SARS-COV-2. We conclude that the drones will be able to optimize the way of eliminating contamination with a very high percentage (through the reduction of human contact) with the increase of the flexibility of the flight (reaching the less accessible regions every hour of the day).","EUCHI, Jalel",Chin J Aeronaut,,538
368914,Breadth and function of antibody response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans,2021,"PURPOSE: Delays and disruptions in health systems because of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified by a previous systematic review from our group. For improving the knowledge about the pandemic consequences for cancer care, this article aims to identify the effects of mitigation strategies developed to reduce the impact of such delays and disruptions. METHODS: Systematic review with a comprehensive search including formal databases, cancer and COVID-19 data sources, gray literature, and manual search. We considered clinical trials, observational longitudinal studies, cross-sectional studies, before-and-after studies, case series, and case studies. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by specific tools. The mitigation strategies identified were described in detail and their effects were summarized narratively. RESULTS: Of 6,692 references reviewed, 28 were deemed eligible, and 9 studies with low to moderate methodological quality were included. Five multiple strategies and four single strategies were reported, and the possible effects of mitigating delays and disruptions in cancer care because of COVID-19 are inconsistent. The only comparative study reported a 48.7% reduction observed in the number of outpatient visits to the hospital accompanied by a small reduction in imaging and an improvement in radiation treatments after the implementation of a multiple organizational strategy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the infrequency of measuring and reporting mitigation strategies that specifically address patients' outcomes and thus a scarcity of high-quality evidence to inform program development. This review reinforces the need of adopting standardized measurement methods to monitor the impact of the mitigation strategies proposed to reduce the effects of delays and disruptions in cancer health care because of COVID-19.","Pacheco, Rafael Leite; Martimbianco, Ana Luiza Cabrera; Roitberg, Felipe; Ilbawi, Andre; Riera, Rachel",JCO Glob Oncol,,538

Although facial dermatoses due to masks increase in both healthcare workers and general population, a pathogenetic hypothesis remains still elusive. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dermatological consultations due to Koebner triggered dermatoses In this prospective, multicenter, real life study carried out in Italy from March 11th to December 11th 2020 during COVID-19 pandemics, dermatological consultations (in-person and telemedicine) to study the prevalence of Koebner (KB) phenomenon due to masks were evaluated. Boyd and Nelder classification was adopted for Koebner phenomenon and Bizzozero's for KB intensity. A total of 229/873 (26.2%) dermatological consultations were KB triggered dermatoses and lesions were located in mask-covered ear area (76 [33.2%]), malar area (73 [31.8%]), perioral area (53 [23.1%]), and nose (27 [11.8%]). The first KB category grouped 142 patients (psoriasis, vitiligo, maskne, and mask rosacea), the second one 24 (warts, molluscum contagiosum, and impetigo), the third one 46 (atopic dermatitis), and the fourth one 17 (eczema). Among previously KB negative psoriatic patients that became KB positive, 9/13 (69.2%) had discontinued or modified the prescribed antipsoriatic treatment.

369712,Recommendations for clinical action and healthcare organization during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in nephrology,2020,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The extent to which face masks mitigate the transmission is highly dependent on how well the mask fits each individual. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face, as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy, are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has, to date, not been adequately examined and quantified. Here, we propose a framework to study the efficacy of different mask designs based on a quasi-static mechanical model of the deployment of face masks onto a wide range of faces. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we explore a simple rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects generated from a 3D morphable face model. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the mask fit is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended homemade cloth mask design was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. We highlight the importance of designing masks accounting for the widely varying population of faces. Metrics based on aerodynamic principles were used to determine that thin, feminine, and young faces were shown to benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. Besides mask size, side-edge tuck-in, or pleating, of the masks as a design parameter was also studied and found to have the potential to cause a larger localized gap opening.","Solano, Tomas; Mittal, Rajat; Shoele, Kourosh",PLoS One,,538

This paper investigates the experiences of a sudden change of policy in the form of an age restriction that trumped the contemporary active aging ideal. A web-based qualitative survey was conducted in April 2020. Through manual coding of a total of 851 responses, six different ways of relating to the age-based recommendations were identified. The results show that age is not an unproblematic governing principle. Instead, in addition to protecting a vulnerable group, the age-based recommendation meant deprivation of previously assigned individual responsibility and, consequently, autonomy. It is shown how respondents handled this tension through varying degrees of compliance and resistance. Findings highlight the importance of continuously tracking the long-term consequences of age-based policy to avoid negative self-image and poorer health among older adults.","Nilsson, Gabriella; Ekstam, Lisa; Axmon, Anna; Andersson, Janicke",J Aging Soc Policy,,538

During this period, vaccination of the almost 4200 cadet population increased from 3% to 85% and prevalence of COVID-19 in the cadet population was constant at approximately 0.4% as indicated by weekly surveillance testing. In this study, vaccine effectiveness at preventing infection is estimated by comparing infection risk as a function of time since vaccination. A statistically significant four-fold reduction in infection risk was observed 14 days after the first vaccine dose and an eleven-fold reduction in infection risk was observed in fully vaccinated cadets. Overall, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 91% (95% confidence interval = 55-99%) effective at preventing infection in healthy young adults (17-26 years of age) in a university setting and military training environment.","Wickert, Douglas P; Almand, Erin; Cullenbine, Christopher A; Huckstep, Odaro J; Rohrer, Joseph; Sitko, John C; Steel, James Jordan; Hasstedt, Steven",,,538

373778,Immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients including young infants,2020,"BACKGROUND: No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons' consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK consultants' opinions on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We E-mailed a Web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland mailing list on the April 17, 2020, and we predetermined to close the survey on the April 21, 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons' opinions using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. RESULTS: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least 1 consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions: (1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, polymerase chain reaction, and computed tomography of the chest should be performed; (2) the use of full personal protective equipment should to be adopted in every case by the theater team regardless of the patient's COVID-19 status; (3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; and (4) cardiac procedures should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial. CONCLUSIONS: In this unprecedented pandemic period, this survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available.","Benedetto, Umberto; Goodwin, Andrew; Kendall, Simon; Uppal, Rakesh; Akowuah, Enoch",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,,538

374395,Impact of influenza vaccination on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a middle-aged group of people,2021,"BACKGROUND: Containment measures for COVID-19 have affected surgical training globally. We sought to assess how neurosurgical training has been affected across Africa in April 2020. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to African Neurosurgical trainees seeking to review demographics and effects of COVID on training. RESULTS: A total of 123 neurosurgery trainees responded from 23 African countries and a further 6 were abroad. A total of 91.80% were men, and 96.70% were training in public institutions. Only 41% had received training in COVID-19 with 61.79% worried that they would contract COVID-19 while performing their clinical duties. There was a marked reduction in clinical activities including a median reduction of elective surgery (-80%), clinics (-83%), and emergency surgery (-38.50%). A total of 23.58% of residents did not receive a formal salary, with 50% on less than $1000 USD gross per month. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first continental survey of neurosurgery trainees in Africa. COVID-19 has significantly affected clinical and learning opportunities. There are concerns of the long-term effects on their training activities for an uncertain period of time during this pandemic. Although there has been a global increase in e-learning, there is need to evaluate if this is accessible to all trainees.","Cheserem, Jebet Beverly; Esene, Ignatius N; Mahmud, Muhammad Raji; Kalangu, Kazadi; Sanoussi, Samuila; Musara, Aaron; El-Ghandour, Nasser M F; Fieggen, Graham; Qureshi, Mahmood",World neurosurgery (Online),,538

375902,Stability and neutralising capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma,2020,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess patient satisfaction and preference for telemedicine vs. in-person visits for outpatient shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal consultation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and in the future. METHODS: Patients who had telemedicine visits for shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal complaints at a single institution from March through June 2020 were invited to respond to a post-visit survey. The survey included a standardized questionnaire that focused on the patient's satisfaction with the telemedicine visits during the pandemic and preference for using the telemedicine platform in the future, following the pandemic. Additional details regarding their virtual visits (severity of medical condition, as well as previous virtual or emergency department visits) were also obtained. Data regarding patient demographic characteristics and visit details (primary diagnosis, type of visit, length of visit, and treating physician) were extracted from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: In total, 153 patients participated in the study. Overall, high satisfaction scores regarding the telemedicine visits were noted: 91% of patients reported that their concerns were adequately addressed, 89% would recommend telemedicine to a friend, and 94% stated that they would use the telemedicine platform again in the presence of a situation similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the majority of patients (76%) reported a preference for in-person visits for the same musculoskeletal complaint if it were not for COVID-19. A telemedicine visit duration > 10 minutes and a first-time telemedicine visit correlated with higher satisfaction rates (P = .037 and P = .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has provided a boost to the use of our telemedicine platform, with a high satisfaction rate among patients with shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal complaints, largely owing to safety reasons and limited access to in-person doctor visits. However, a considerable number of patients would have preferred in-person visits for similar health complaints if there were no pandemic. Further research on optimizing the selection of patients for telemedicine visits and addressing their expectations and concerns regarding their visits will improve patients' preference for future telemedicine visits.","Ben-Ari, Erel; Kirschenbaum, Joshua; Patel, Ruby G; Kwon, Young W; Rokito, Andrew S; Zuckerman, Joseph D; Virk, Mandeep S",J. shoulder elbow surg,,538

377561,Practical Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Testing in the Clinical Laboratory: Experience at an Academic Medical Center,2021,"The aim was to analyze the characteristics and predictors of unfavorable outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) with COVID-19. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 210 consecutive SOTRs hospitalized with COVID-19 in 12 Spanish centers from 21 February to 6 May 2020. Data pertaining to demographics, chronic underlying diseases, transplantation features, clinical, therapeutics, and complications were collected. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with these unfavorable outcomes. Males accounted for 148 (70.5%) patients, the median age was 63 years, and 189 (90.0%) patients had pneumonia. Common symptoms were fever, cough, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dyspnea. The most used antiviral or host-targeted therapies included hydroxychloroquine 193/200 (96.5%), lopinavir/ritonavir 91/200 (45.5%), and tocilizumab 49/200 (24.5%). Thirty-seven (17.6%) patients required ICU admission, 12 (5.7%) suffered graft dysfunction, and 45 (21.4%) died. A shorter interval between transplantation and COVID-19 diagnosis had a negative impact on clinical prognosis. Four baseline features were identified as independent predictors of intensive care need or death: advanced age, high respiratory rate, lymphopenia, and elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase. In summary, this study presents comprehensive information on characteristics and complications of COVID-19 in hospitalized SOTRs and provides indicators available upon hospital admission for the identification of SOTRs at risk of critical disease or death, underlining the need for stringent preventative measures in the early post-transplant period.","Salto-Alejandre, Sonsoles; Jiménez-Jorge, Silvia; Sabé, Nuria; Ramos-Martínez, Antonio; Linares, Laura; Valerio, Maricela; Martín-Dávila, Pilar; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Fariñas, María Carmen; Blanes-Juliá, Marino; Vidal, Elisa; Palacios-Baena, Zaira R; Hernández-Gallego, Román; Carratalá, Jordi; Calderón-Parra, Jorge; Ángeles Marcos, María; Muñoz, Patricia; Fortún-Abete, Jesús; Aguado, José María; Arnaiz-Revillas, Francisco; Blanes-Hernández, Rosa; de la Torre-Cisneros, Julián; López-Cortés, Luis E; García de Vinuesa-Calvo, Elena; Rosso, Clara M; Pachón, Jerónimo; Sánchez-Céspedes, Javier; Cordero, Elisa",PLoS One,,538
378019,Single-cell immunophenotyping of the fetal immune response to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in late gestation,2021,"ABSTRACT: During outbreaks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries adopted quarantine to slow the spread of the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Quarantine will cause isolation from families, friends, and the public, which consequently leads to serious psychological pressure with potentially long-lasting effects on the quarantined population. Experience of specific practices to improve the psychological status of the mandatory quarantined population was limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of mandatory quarantine, and evaluate the effect of psychological intervention on the quarantined population.We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess and manage the psychological status of a mandatory quarantined population in Beijing, China. A total of 638 individuals completed 2 questionnaires and were enrolled in this study, of which 372 participants accepted designed psychological intervention while other 266 participants refused it. The SCL-90 questionnaire was used to evaluate the psychological status and its change before and after the intervention. The differences of SCL-90 factor scores between participants and the national norm group were assessed by 2 samples t test. While the SCL-90 factor scores before and after intervention were compared with 2 paired samples t test.Compared with the Chinese norms of SCL-90, the participants had higher SCL-90 factor scores in most items of the SCL-90 inventory. The SCL-90 factor scores of participants with psychological intervention significantly decreased in somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. In contrast, most factor scores of the SCL-90 inventory changed little without statistical significance in participants without psychological intervention.Psychological problems should be emphasized in the quarantined individuals and professional psychological intervention was a feasible approach to improve the psychological status of the mandatory quarantined population in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.","Wu, Chen; Zhou, Tian; Wu, Li-Ping; Zhao, Yu-Xi; Shang, Hai-Ming; Gao, Yang-Yang; Rao, Ping; Jiao, Yang; Xi, Jia-Ning",Medicine (Baltimore),,538

379191,Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the early diagnosis of melanoma,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea has been engaged in various efforts to overcome the pandemic. One of them is to provide app-based COVID-19-related services to the public. As the pandemic continues, a need for various apps has emerged, including COVID-19 apps that can support activities aimed at overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine which apps were considered the most necessary according to users and evaluate the current status of the development of COVID-19-related apps in South Korea. We also aimed to determine users' acceptance and concerns related to using apps to support activities to combat COVID-19. METHODS: We collected data from 1148 users from a web-based survey conducted between November 11 and December 6, 2020. Basic statistical analysis, multiple response analysis, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were performed using R software. We then manually classified the current status of the development of COVID-19-related apps. RESULTS: In total, 68.4% (785/1148) of the respondents showed high willingness to protect themselves from COVID-19 by using related apps. Users considered the epidemiological investigation app to be the most necessary app (709/1148, 61.8%) overall, followed by the self-management app for self-isolation (613/1148, 53.4%), self-route management app (605/1148, 52.7%), COVID-19 symptom management app (483/1148, 42.1%), COVID-19-related information provision app (339/1148, 29.5%), and mental health management app (270/1148, 23.5%). Despite the high intention to use these apps, users were also concerned about privacy issues and media exposure. Those who had an underlying disease and had experience using COVID-19-related apps showed significantly higher intentions to use those apps (P=.05 and P=.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting users is very important in order to design and develop the most necessary apps. Furthermore, to gain the public's trust and make the apps available to as many people as possible, it is vital to develop diverse apps in which privacy protection is maximized.","Park, Jihwan; Han, Jinhyun; Kim, Yerin; Rho, Mi Jung",JMIR Med Inform,,538

A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.","Liang, Leilei; Ren, Hui; Cao, Ruilin; Hu, Yueyang; Qin, Zeying; Li, Chuanen; Mei, Songli",Psychiatr Q,,538
382433,Editorial note about SARS-CoV-2 in the pandemic era,2020,"No effective drug treatments are available for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Host-directed therapies targeting the underlying aberrant immune responses leading to pulmonary tissue damage, death, or long-term functional disability in survivors require clinical evaluation. We performed a parallel assigned controlled, non-randomized, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) infusions in the treatment of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pulmonary disease. The study enrolled 18 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 9 for each group). The treatment group received three cycles of intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs (3 × 107 cells per infusion) on days 0, 3, and 6. Both groups received standard COVID-treatment regimens. Adverse events, duration of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, length of hospitalization, serial chest computed tomography (CT) images, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, dynamics of cytokines, and IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed. No serious UC-MSCs infusion-associated adverse events were observed. Two patients receiving UC-MSCs developed transient facial flushing and fever, and one patient developed transient hypoxia at 12 h post UC-MSCs transfusion. Mechanical ventilation was required in one patient in the treatment group compared with four in the control group. All patients recovered and were discharged. Our data show that intravenous UC-MSCs infusion in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 is safe and well tolerated. Phase 2/3 randomized, controlled, double-blinded trials with long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate the therapeutic use of UC-MSCs to reduce deaths and improve long-term treatment outcomes in patients with serious COVID-19.","Meng, Fanping; Xu, Ruonan; Wang, Siyu; Xu, Zhe; Zhang, Chao; Li, Yuanyuan; Yang, Tao; Shi, Lei; Fu, Junliang; Jiang, Tianjun; Huang, Lei; Zhao, Peng; Yuan, Xin; Fan, Xing; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Song, Jinwen; Zhang, Dawei; Jiao, Yanmei; Liu, Limin; Zhou, Chunbao; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Shi, Ming; Wang, Fu-Sheng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,538
382685,Performance and Capacity Evaluation of the Spanish Health System in SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"Bone mineral density (BMD) changes were reported to be associated with excessive fluoride exposure and abnormal expression of RUNX2. However, whether the alteration of methylation status, a most commonly used marker for the alteration of gene expression in epidemiological investigation, of RUNX2 is associated with low-to-moderate fluoride exposure and BMD changes has not been reported. Our study aims to explore the role of RUNX2 promoter methylation in BMD changes induced by low-to-moderate fluoride exposure. A total of 1124 adults (413 men and 711 women) were recruited from Kaifeng City in 2017. We measured BMD using ultrasound bone densitometer. Concentrations of urinary fluoride (UF) were measured using ion-selective electrode, and the participants were grouped into control group (CG) and excessive fluoride group (EFG) according to the concentration of UF. We extracted DNA from fasting peripheral blood samples and then detected the promoter methylation levels of RUNX2 using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Relationships between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation and BMD changes were analyzed using generalized linear model and logistic regression. Results showed in EFG (UF concentration > 1.6 mg/L), BMD was negatively correlated with UF concentration (ß: -0.14; 95%CI: -0.26, -0.01) and RUNX2 promoter methylation (ß: -0.13; 95%CI: -0.22, -0.03) in women. The methylation rate of RUNX2 promoter increased by 2.16% for each 1 mg/L increment in UF concentration of women in EFG (95%CI: 0.37, 3.96). No any significant associations between UF concentration, RUNX2 promoter methylation, and BMD were observed in the individuals in CG. Mediation analysis showed that RUNX2 promoter methylation mediated 18.2% (95% CI: 4.2%, 53.2%) of the association between UF concentration and BMD of women in EFG. In conclusion, excessive fluoride exposure (>1.6 mg/L) is associated with changes of BMD in women, and this association is mediated by RUNX2 promoter methylation.","Gao, Minghui; Sun, Long; Xu, Kaihong; Zhang, Luoming; Zhang, Yanli; He, Tongkun; Sun, Renjie; Huang, Hui; Zhu, Jingyuan; Zhang, Yawei; Zhou, Guoyu; Ba, Yue",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,538
383028,SARS-CoV-2 Interstitial Pneumonia Treated With Tocilizumab in a Patient Affected by Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma,2020,"An intact lung epithelial barrier is essential for lung homeostasis. The Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA), primarily serving as an ion transporter, also regulates epithelial barrier function via modulation of tight junctions. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that overexpression of the NKA ß1 subunit upregulates the expression of tight junction proteins, leading to increased alveolar epithelial barrier function by an ion transport-independent mechanism. Using IP and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of unknown protein interactions of the ß1 subunit, including a top candidate, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related cdc42-binding kinase &#945; (MRCK&#945;), which is a protein kinase known to regulate peripheral actin formation. Using a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system, we demonstrated that MRCK&#945; and its downstream activation of myosin light chain is required for the regulation of alveolar barrier function by the NKA ß1 subunit. Importantly, MRCK&#945; is expressed in both human airways and alveoli and has reduced expression in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lung illness that can be caused by multiple direct and indirect insults, including the infection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our results have elucidated a potentially novel mechanism by which NKA regulates epithelial tight junctions and have identified potential drug targets for treating ARDS and other pulmonary diseases that are caused by barrier dysfunction.","Bai, Haiqing; Zhou, Rui; Barravecchia, Michael; Norman, Rosemary; Friedman, Alan; Yu, Deborah; Lin, Xin; Young, Jennifer L; Dean, David A",JCI insight,,538

387036,The nervous system-A new territory being explored of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: Inclusion of game mechanics, or ""gamification,"" has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. METHODS: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. CONCLUSIONS: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial.","Suppan, Mélanie; Gartner, Birgit; Golay, Eric; Stuby, Loric; White, Marion; Cottet, Philippe; Abbas, Mohamed; Iten, Anne; Harbarth, Stephan; Suppan, Laurent",JMIR Serious Games,,538

The temporal and spatial changes of AR and AC were discussed. The correlations between BDI and PC/OV were analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. Results: The trends of BDI of ""AR""/""AC"" in Beijing showed obvious seasonal variations, but not in Guangzhou. The BDI of ""AR"" and ""AC"" was consistent with the OV in both cities (r1AR-BJ=0.580, P&lt;0.001;r1AR-GZ=0.360, P=0.031;r1AC-BJ=0.885, P&lt;0.001;r1AC-GZ=0.694, P&lt;0.001). The BDI of ""AR"" and ""AC"" was highly consistent with the change of the PC in Beijing (r AR-Pollen=0.826, P&lt;0.001;r AC-Pollen=0.564, P&lt;0.001). The OV of AR in Beijing and Guangzhou decreased significantly in the first half of 2020, but there was no significant change in AC. In the first half of 2020, the OV of AC in Beijing was significantly higher than that of AR, while that of AC in Guangzhou was slightly higher than that of AR. Conclusion: The BDI could reflect the real-world situation to some extent and has the potential to predict the epidemiological characteristics of AR and AC. The BDI and OV of AR decreased significantly, but those of AC were still at a high level, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the environment where most people in Beijing and Guangzhou wore masks without eye protection.","Qiu, H.; Zheng, R.; Wang, X.; Chen, Z.; Feng, P.; Huang, X.; Zhou, Y.; Tao, J.; Dai, M.; Yuan, L.; Zhang, L.; Yang, Q.",Risk Management &amp; Healthcare Policy,,538

The Trauma Screening Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form were utilized. Factors associated with trauma, burnout, and posttraumatic growth were analysed using logistic and multiple regressions. In total, 12 596 completed the survey, and 52.3% worked in COVID-19 designated hospitals. At the survey's conclusion in April, 13.3% reported trauma (Trauma &#8805; 6), there were moderate degrees of emotional exhaustion, and 4,949 (39.3%) experienced posttraumatic growth. Traumatic response and emotional exhaustion were greater among (i) women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.97 P = 0.006; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.54, P = 0.003), (ii) critical care units (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.35, P = 0.004; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, P < 0.001) (iii) COVID-19 designated hospital (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38; P < 0.001; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36; P < 0.001) and (iv) COVID-19-related departments (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29, P = 0.006, emotional exhaustion only). To date, this is the first large-scale study to report the rates of trauma and burnout for nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates that nurses who identified as women, working in ICUs, COVID-19 designated hospitals, and departments involved with treating COVID-19 patients had higher scores in mental health outcomes. Future research can focus on the factors the study has identified that could lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies for adverse health outcomes and better use of resources to promote positive outcomes.","Chen, Ruey; Sun, Chao; Chen, Jian-Jun; Jen, Hsiu-Ju; Kang, Xiao Linda; Kao, Ching-Chiu; Chou, Kuei-Ru",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,538

A different organization of hospital units was required to take care of patients affected by acute respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of burnout in two sub-intensive care units (SICUs) of the COVID-19 hub center of the Lombardia region in Milan (Italy). All nurses and healthcare assistants working in the SICUs during June 2020 were included in the study. Burnout was assessed via the Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire. One hundred and five (84%) SICU staff participated in the study. The prevalence of high burnout for nurses and healthcare assistants was 61.9% for emotional exhaustion, 47.6% for depersonalization and 34.3% for personal accomplishment. Depersonalization was significantly more frequent in younger nurses (p = 0.009). Nurses were 4.5 times more likely to have burnout than healthcare assistants. Burnout was a common condition among healthcare workers operating in SICUs during the pandemic. Urgent actions are needed, especially for nurses, as well as preventive strategies for future pandemic scenarios.","Bisesti, Alberto; Mallardo, Andrea; Gambazza, Simone; Binda, Filippo; Galazzi, Alessandro; Pazzaglia, Silvia; Laquintana, Dario",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,538

390830,SARS-CoV-2 Not Detectable in Ocular Specimens of a Patient with a Past Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now been confirmed worldwide. Yet, COVID-19 is strangely and tragically selective. Morbidity and mortality due to COVID19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Human genetic factors may contribute to the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to the relentlessly progressive disease observed in a small but significant proportion of infected individuals, but these factors are largely unknown. MAIN BODY: In this study, we investigated genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 by examining DNA polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (two key host factors of SARS-CoV-2) from ~ 81,000 human genomes. We found unique genetic susceptibility across different populations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Specifically, ACE2 polymorphisms were found to be associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions by altering the angiotensinogen-ACE2 interactions, such as p.Arg514Gly in the African/African-American population. Unique but prevalent polymorphisms (including p.Val160Met (rs12329760), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)) in TMPRSS2, offer potential explanations for differential genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as for risk factors, including those with cancer and the high-risk group of male patients. We further discussed that polymorphisms in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 could guide effective treatments (i.e., hydroxychloroquine and camostat) for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that ACE2 or TMPRSS2 DNA polymorphisms were likely associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19, which calls for a human genetics initiative for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hou, Yuan; Zhao, Junfei; Martin, William; Kallianpur, Asha; Chung, Mina K; Jehi, Lara; Sharifi, Nima; Erzurum, Serpil; Eng, Charis; Cheng, Feixiong",BMC Med,,538

394095,Bat reservoirs related to SARS-CoV-2,2020,"In this communication, we present arguments for androgen sensitivity as a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity. The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity. We believe that the evidence presented in this communication warrants the initiation of trials using anti-androgen agents.","Wambier, Carlos Gustavo; Goren, Andy; Vaño-Galván, Sergio; Ramos, Paulo Müller; Ossimetha, Angelina; Nau, Gerard; Herrera, Sabina; McCoy, John",Drug dev. res,,538

One important abnormality present in tumors is vessel compression. Vessel decompression has been shown to increase survival rates in animal models via enhanced and more homogeneous oxygenation. However, our knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms linking tumor decompression to improved tumor oxygenation is limited. In this study, we propose a computational model to investigate the impact of vessel compression on red blood cell (RBC) dynamics in tumor vascular networks. Our results demonstrate that vessel compression can alter RBC partitioning at bifurcations in a hematocrit-dependent and flow rate-independent manner. We identify RBC focusing due to cross-streamline migration as the mechanism responsible and characterize the spatiotemporal recovery dynamics controlling downstream partitioning. Based on this knowledge, we formulate a reduced-order model that will help future research to elucidate how these effects propagate at a whole vascular network level. These findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of hemodilution in tumor vascular networks and oxygen homogenization following pharmacological solid tumor decompression.","Enjalbert, Romain; Hardman, David; Krüger, Timm; Bernabeu, Miguel O",Proc.

To maintain robust antiviral immunity and to effectively target the viral particles and virally-infected cells, immune cells capable of recognizing the viral antigens are required. While conventional vaccination can induce these cells in vivo; another option is to prime and generate antigen-specific immune cells ex vivo.

This program addresses the need for an agile testing strategy during the current pandemic. We disclose the number of patients evaluated as ""persons under investigation"" (PUI) and the proportion with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) results from these sites. We describe how the programs were applied to patient care and include considerations on how additional staffing, scalability, and flexibility of these services may be applied to future patient and healthcare crises. METHODS: This is a descriptive report of the implementation of MIH/CP test sites in our healthcare system's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Retrospective data on the number of patients and their associated demographics are reported here as raw data. No statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, our six MIH/CP test sites evaluated 4342 patients. Of these, 401 patients (9.2%) had test results positive, 62.8% of whom were women. The estimated duration of each patient under investigation encounter was 3 to 5 minutes. The paramedics were able to perform a brief history, specific physical examination, and screening for signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. There were no cases of accidental exposure or failure of PPE for the MIH/CP paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: In our healthcare system, we pivoted the traditional MIH/CP model to rapidly initiate remote drive-through testing for COVID-19 in pre-screened individuals. This model allowed us to test patients with suspected COVID-19 patients away from traditional healthcare sites and mitigate exposure to healthcare workers and other patients.","Constantine, S Tyler; Callaway, David; Driscoll, Jeremy N; Murphy, Stephanie",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,538

Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection (positivity) rates, but is expected to remain better than non-pooled testing in populations with infection rates up to 30%. For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling.

A process was successfully developed to produce 5000 face masks in a period of 3 weeks that fit almost all (95%) health care workers who did not fit in a commercially available mask. The process was able to produce quality face masks with specific attention paid to developing masks that would pass qualitative fit testing.","Mehta, Sonia; Dooley, F Cole; Gore, Stephanie; Spiess, Bruce; Gravenstein, Nik; Algarra, Nelson Nicolas",Am J Med Qual,,538

We interrogate the dynamic changes of virological and immunological parameters in 12 patients with symptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from disease onset to convalescence or death. We quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (nucleoprotein [NP], membrane [M], ORF3a, and spike) and non-structural (ORF7/8, NSP7, and NSP13) proteins. Although rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses associate with an increase in disease severity, early induction of interferon (IFN)-Î³-secreting SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is present in patients with mild disease and accelerated viral clearance. These findings provide support for the prognostic value of early functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with important implications in vaccine design and immune monitoring.","Tan, Anthony T; Linster, Martin; Tan, Chee Wah; Le Bert, Nina; Chia, Wan Ni; Kunasegaran, Kamini; Zhuang, Yan; Tham, Christine Y L; Chia, Adeline; Smith, Gavin J D; Young, Barnaby; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Low, Jenny G H; Lye, David; Wang, Lin-Fa; Bertoletti, Antonio",Cell Rep,,538
403976,A first case of Mild Encephalitis with Reversible Splenial Lesion(MERS) as a presenting feature of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The global crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a proper risk assessment of respiratory pathogens in indoor settings. This paper documents the COVID Airborne Risk Assessment (CARA) methodology, to assess the potential exposure of airborne SARS-CoV-2 viruses, with an emphasis on the effect of certain virological and immunological factors in the quantification of the risk. The proposed model is the result of a multidisciplinary approach linking physical, mechanical and biological domains, benchmarked with clinical and experimental data, enabling decision makers or facility managers to perform risk assessments against airborne transmission. The model was tested against two benchmark outbreaks, showing good agreement. The tool was also applied to several everyday-life settings, in particular for the cases of a shared office, classroom and ski cabin. We found that 20% of infected hosts can emit approximately 2 orders of magnitude more viral-containing particles, suggesting the importance of super-emitters in airborne transmission. The use of surgical-type masks provides a 5-fold reduction in viral emissions. Natural ventilation through the opening of windows at all times are effective strategies to decrease the concentration of virions and slightly opening a window in the winter has approximately the same effect as a full window opening during the summer. Although vaccination is an effective protection measure, non-pharmaceutical interventions, which significantly reduce the viral density in the air (ventilation, masks), should be actively supported and included early in the risk assessment process. We propose a critical threshold value approach which could be used to define an acceptable risk level in a given indoor setting.","Henriques, Andre; Mounet, Nicolas; Aleixo, Luis; Elson, Philip; Devine, James; Azzopardi, Gabriella; Andreini, Marco; Rognlien, Markus; Tarocco, Nicola; Tang, Julian",,,538

404574,Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although about 80% of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases are reported to be mild, the remaining 20% of cases often result in severe disease with the potential of crushing already overstrained health care services. There has been sustainable growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide since mid-May 2020. To keep tabs on community transmission of COVID-19 infection screening of the samples from a large population is needed which includes asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals along with the migrant population. This requires extra resources, man power, and time for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the current scenario, the pooled sample testing strategy advocated by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi is a new approach that is very promising in resource-limited settings. In this study, we have evaluated the pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables, and identification of borderline positive cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April and June 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow. In the first step, the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14 940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. The pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% fewer tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the resulting outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings, and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.","Garg, Jaya; Singh, Vikramjeet; Pandey, Pranshu; Verma, Ashish; Sen, Manodeep; Das, Anupam; Agarwal, Jyotsna",J. med. virol,,538

405984,"Differences among Severe Cases of Sars-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Pediatric Patients: Symptoms, Outcomes and Preexisting Comorbidities",2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory particles. Respiratory particle emission is impacted by manner of breathing and voicing, as well as intersubject variability. Assessment and treatment of voice disorders may include tasks that increase respiratory particle emission beyond typical breathing and speaking. This could increase the risk of disease transmission via respiratory particles. METHODS: Respiratory particle emission was measured during a single-subject, repeated measures clinical simulation of acoustic and aerodynamic assessment and voice therapy tasks. An optical particle sizer was used to measure particle count (1-10 µm in diameter). Assessment and therapy tasks were completed in three conditions: (1) 15 cm from the device, (2) 1 m from the device, and (3) 1 m from the device with the subject wearing a surgical mask. RESULTS: Condition 1 generated the highest particle count, with a median of 5.1 (13) additional particles above baseline, which was statistically significant (U = 381.5, P= 0.002). In condition 1, therapy and acoustic tasks combined produced more particles compared to the baseline and speech tasks, with a median difference of 6.5 additional particles per time point (U = 309.0, P= 0.002). This difference was not significant for conditions 2 and 3. Peak particle generation occurred in specific phonatory tasks, which was most pronounced in condition 1. Voice therapy tasks during condition 1 generated the highest peaks of normalized total particles with classical singing and expiratory muscle strength training. There was a significant difference in the amount of particle generation between condition 1 and 2, with a median difference of 5.2 particles (U = 461.0, P= 0.002). The particle count difference between conditions 2 and 3 was 2.1 (U = 282.0, P= 0.292), and this difference was not significant. The normalized total particles were assessed over time for each condition. For all conditions, there was no significant accumulation of particles. CONCLUSIONS: For a single subject, production of voice assessment and therapy tasks combined resulted in an increased number of respiratory particles compared to speech and baseline (1-10 µm). EMST and classical singing generated the greatest concentration of particles. Respiratory particle counts were higher at 15 cm from the particle sizer compared to 1 m from the particle sizer, suggesting that physical distancing may reduce immediate clinician exposure to respiratory particles. Particle concentration did not accumulate over time.","Timmons Sund, Lauren; Bhatt, Neel K; Ference, Elisabeth H; Kim, Wihan; Johns, Michael M",J. voice,,538

406688,Proposed resumption of surgery algorithm after the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2020,"Epidemiologists commonly use an adjusted hazard ratio or incidence density ratio, or a standardized mortality ratio, to measure a difference in all-cause mortality rates. They seldom translate it into an age- or time- or probability-based measure that would be easier to communicate and to relate to. Several articles have shown how to translate from a standardized mortality ratio or hazard ratio to a longevity difference, a difference in actuarial ages, or a probability of being outlived. This note describes the settings when these translations are and are not appropriate, and provides some heuristics behind the formulae. The tools that yield differences in 'effective age' and in longevity are applicable when both (i) the mortality rate ratio (hazard ratio) is constant over age and (ii) the rates themselves are log-linear in age. The 'probability/odds of being outlived' metric is applicable whenever (i) holds, and thus provides no direct information on the magnitude of the effective age/longevity difference.","Pang, Menglan; Hanley, James A",Am. j. epidemiol,,538

Here, we assessed the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related diagnostic workload during the onset of the pandemic in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa; characterized 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from returning travelers; and validated the Da An RT-PCR-based diagnostic kit that is widely used across Africa. We found a 15-fold increase in the monthly laboratory workload due to COVID-19, dealt with at the cost of routine activities. Genomic surveillance showed near-simultaneous introduction of distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages termed A.4 and B.1, including the D614G spike protein variant potentially associated with higher transmissibility from travelers from six different European and African countries during March-April 2020. We decoded the target regions within the ORF1ab and N genes of the Da An dual-target kit by MinION-based amplicon sequencing. Despite relatively high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) within the ORF1ab target domain, no cross-detection of high-titered cell culture supernatants of HCoVs was observed, suggesting high analytical specificity. The Da An kit was highly sensitive, detecting 3.2 to 9.0 copies of target-specific in vitro transcripts/reaction. Although discrepant test results were observed in low-titered clinical samples, clinical sensitivity of the Da An kit was at least comparable to that of commercial kits from affluent settings. In sum, virologic diagnostics are achievable in a resource-limited setting, but unprecedented pressure resulting from COVID-19-related diagnostics requires rapid and sustainable support of national and supranational stakeholders addressing limited laboratory capacity.IMPORTANCE Months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, case numbers from Africa are surprisingly low, potentially because the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Africa is lower than in other regions. Here, we show an overload of COVID-19-related diagnostics in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa, with a stagnating average number of positive samples irrespective of daily sample counts. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance confirmed a high genomic diversity in Benin introduced by travelers returning from Europe and other African countries, including early circulation of the D614G spike mutation associated with potentially higher transmissibility. We validated a widely used RT-PCR kit donated by the Chinese Jack Ma Foundation and confirmed high analytical specificity and clinical sensitivity equivalent to tests used in affluent settings. Our assessment shows that although achievable in an African setting, the burden from COVID-19-related diagnostics on national reference laboratories is very high.","Sander, Anna-Lena; Yadouleton, Anges; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Tchibozo, Carine; Hounkanrin, Gildas; Badou, Yvette; Fischer, Carlo; Krause, Nina; Akogbeto, Petas; F de Oliveira Filho, Edmilson; Dossou, Anges; Brünink, Sebastian; Drosten, Christian; Aïssi, Melchior A Joël; Harouna Djingarey, Mamoudou; Hounkpatin, Benjamin; Nagel, Michael; Drexler, Jan Felix",MSphere,,538

A policymaker promotes the abeyance of fossil-fueled vehicles through an incentive, and the representative fossil-fueled vehicle's owner decides the time at which buying an electric vehicle, while minimizing a certain expected cost. This involves a combination of various types of costs: the stochastic opportunity cost of driving one unit distance with a traditional fossil-fueled vehicle instead of an electric one, the cost associated to traffic bans, and the net purchase cost. After determining the optimal switching time and the minimal cost function for a general diffusive opportunity cost, we specialize to the case of a mean-reverting process. In such a setting, we provide a model calibration on real data from Italy, and we study the dependency of the optimal switching time with respect to the model's parameters. Moreover, we study the effect of traffic bans and incentive on the expected optimal switching time. We observe that incentive and traffic bans on fossil-fueled transport can be used as effective tools in the hand of the policymaker to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, and hence to reduce air pollution.","Falbo, Paolo; Ferrari, Giorgio; Rizzini, Giorgio; Schmeck, Maren Diane",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09493v1.pdf,538

It is not clear whether air pollution contributes to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to increase mortality. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 incidence, mortality rate, air pollution, and greenhouse gas element of 33 European countries were extracted from public available databases and analysed with Pearson correlation analysis for the overall population and normalizing for the population over 65 years. RESULTS: Air pollutant agents such as particulate matter <10µm (PM10), particulate matter <2.5µm (PM2.5), ammonia (NH3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and greenhouse gas elements recorded showed a remarkable correlation with cumulative positive number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and with cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths. PM2.5 (r = 0.68, p-value = 0.0001 for cumulative positive cases; r = 0.73, p-value <0.0001 for cumulative deaths) and nitrogen oxides (r = 0.85, p-value <0.0001 for cumulative positive cases; r = 0.70, p-value 0.0001 for cumulative deaths) were among the pollutant agents with the strongest correlation for both positive cases and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of pollution in European countries should be considered a potential risk for severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-related death.","Lembo, Rosalba; Landoni, Giovanni; Cianfanelli, Lorenzo; Frontera, Antonio",Acta Biomed,,538
412477,SARS-CoV-2 infection aggravates chronic comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in mice,2021,"From a healthcare perspective, infection due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the ensuing syndrome called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents the biggest challenge the world has faced in several decades. Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals' capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis might help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gentile, Ivan; Maraolo, Alberto Enrico; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,538

The enhancement of seed mineral content via genetic improvement is considered as the most promising and cost-effective approach compared alternative means for meeting the dietary needs. The overall objective of this study was to perform a GWAS of mineral content (Ca, K, P and S) in seeds of a core set of 137 soybean lines that are representative of the diversity of early maturing soybeans cultivated in Canada (maturity groups 000-II). RESULTS: This panel of 137 soybean lines was grown in five environments (in total) and the seed mineral content was measured using a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. The association analyses were carried out using three statistical models and a set of 2.2 million SNPs obtained from a combined dataset of genotyping-by-sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Eight QTLs significantly associated with the Ca, K, P and S content were identified by at least two of the three statistical models used (in two environments) contributing each from 17 to 31% of the phenotypic variation. A strong reproducibility of the effect of seven out these eight QTLs was observed in three other environments. In total, three candidate genes were identified involved in transport and assimilation of these mineral elements. CONCLUSIONS: There have been very few GWAS studies to identify QTLs associated with the mineral element content of soybean seeds. In addition to being new, the QTLs identified in this study and candidate genes will be useful for the genetic improvement of soybean nutritional quality through marker-assisted selection. Moreover, this study also provides details on the range of phenotypic variation encountered within the Canadian soybean germplasm.","Malle, Sidiki; Morrison, Malcolm; Belzile, François",BMC Plant Biol,,538

Investigating the presence of acoustic biomarkers in modalities such as cough, breathing and speech sounds, and using them for building POCTs can offer fast, contactless and inexpensive testing. In view of this, over the past year, we launched the ``Coswara'' project to collect cough, breathing and speech sound recordings via worldwide crowdsourcing. With this data, a call for development of diagnostic tools was announced in the Interspeech 2021 as a special session titled ``Diagnostics of COVID-19 using Acoustics (DiCOVA) Challenge''. The goal was to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in developing acoustics-based COVID-19 POCTs by enabling them to work on the same set of development and test datasets. As part of the challenge, datasets with breathing, cough, and speech sound samples from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 individuals were released to the participants. The challenge consisted of two tracks. The Track-1 focused only on cough sounds, and participants competed in a leaderboard setting. In Track-2, breathing and speech samples were provided for the participants, without a competitive leaderboard. The challenge attracted 85 plus registrations with 29 final submissions for Track-1. This paper describes the challenge (datasets, tasks, baseline system), and presents a focused summary of the various systems submitted by the participating teams. An analysis of the results from the top four teams showed that a fusion of the scores from these teams yields an area-under-the-curve of 95.1% on the blind test data.

METHODS: The clinical data of 187 patients with COVID-19 seen between January 20, 2020 and March 5, 2020 at the First Hospital of Changsha were retrospectively analyzed. The differences in the ABO blood group distribution between COVID-19 patients and the control group (1991 cases) were analyzed. The relationship between blood type and clinical characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients with COVID-19, 69 had type A (36.90%), 63 had type B (33.69%), 41 had type O (21.92%), and 14 had type AB blood (7.49%). The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group (36.90% vs. 27.47%, P = 0.006), while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.92% vs. 30.19%, P = 0.018). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for individuals with blood group A than for those with blood group O (OR = 1.849, 95% CI = 1.228-2.768, P = 0.003). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for patients with blood group A than for those with a blood group other than A (OR = 1.544, 95% CI = 1.122-2.104, P = 0.006). Patients with blood group O had a lower risk of COVID-19 than non-O blood group patients (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.457-0.927, P = 0.018). The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID-19 status. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

A plethora of microbial domains including viruses (other than SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, archaea and fungi have evolved together, and interact in complex molecular pathogenesis along with SARS-CoV-2. However, the involvement of other microbial co-pathogens and underlying molecular mechanisms leading to extortionate ailment in critically ill COVID-19 patients has yet not been extensively reviewed. Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. Simultaneously, co-infecting microbiotas may use new strategies to escape host defense mechanisms by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses to further aggravate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Better understanding of co-infections in COVID-19 is critical for the effective patient management, treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2. This review therefore necessitates the comprehensive investigation of commonly reported microbial co-pathogens amid COVID-19, their transmission pattern along with the possible mechanism of co-infections and outcomes. Thus, identifying the possible co-pathogens and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may shed light in developing diagnostics, appropriate curative and preventive interventions for suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic.","Hoque, M Nazmul; Akter, Salma; Mishu, Israt Dilruba; Islam, M Rafiul; Rahman, M Shaminur; Akhter, Masuda; Islam, Israt; Hasan, Mehedi Mahmudul; Rahaman, Md Mizanur; Sultana, Munawar; Islam, Tofazzal; Hossain, M Anwar",Microb Pathog,,538

The mean with its confident interval of the unified D90-254 nm inactivation dose (ultraviolet dose for 90% inactivation at 254nm) in several trials published on coronaviruses families, was assumed as ultraviolet susceptibility of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. The inactivation dose spectrum (sensitivity envelope) for coronaviruses as a function of the UV wavelength equivalent to UVB range (280 to 320 nm) was adopted from literature. The UVB solar measurement intensity at Baghdad's geographical location was used over a year at every fifteen minutes and converted from a lump sum to solar spectrum per wavelength in the range of 280 to 320 nm using a simplified mathematical model. A composite action spectrum was drawn that including the virus sensitivity spectrum normalized to 254 nm, UVB solar measurements spectrum, and inactivation effective dose spectrum for coronaviruses. The area under the inactivation effective dose spectrum was calculated numerically to find the equivalent solar flux. The time required to inactivation the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus is predicted for each value of UVB lump sum intensity to simulate the time required to sterility the outdoor surfaces at all months within Baghdad geographical station. the time required for sterilization ranged from 92.9 minutes at solar flux 0.56 J/m2254/min in July, to 371.4 minutes at solar flux 0.14 J/m2254/min in January for the year of data used.

These neutrophils are directly leading to thrombosis, organ damage, and complement activation via neutrophil extracellular trap release.","Maxwell, Anthony J; Ding, Jiahui; You, Yuan; Dong, Zhong; Chehade, Hussein; Alvero, Ayesha; Mor, Yechiel; Draghici, Sorin; Mor, Gil",J. leukoc. biol,,538
421714,Provisional recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis,2021,"Conspiracy theories have been proliferating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that belief in conspiracy theories undermines engagement in pro-health behaviors and support for public health policies. Moreover, previous work suggests that inoculating messages from opinion leaders that expose conspiracy theories as false before people are exposed to them can help to prevent belief in new conspiracies. Goals of this study were to: (a) explore associations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions, cooperation with public health recommendations, and support for public health policies among U.S. adults and (b) investigate trusted sources of COVID-19 information to inform strategies to address conspiracy beliefs. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted with 845 U.S. adults in April 2020. Data were analyzed using analyses of variance and multivariable regressions. One-third (33%) of participants believed one or more conspiracies about COVID-19. Participants who believed conspiracies reported that their intentions to vaccinate were 3.9 times lower and indicated less support for COVID-19 public health policies than participants who disbelieved conspiracies. There were no differences in cooperation with public health recommendations by conspiracy belief endorsement in the multivariable regression analysis. Although there were some key differences in trusted sources of COVID-19 information, doctor(s) were the most trusted source of information about COVID-19 overall with 90% of participants trusting doctor(s). Doctor(s) may play a role in addressing COVID-19 conspiracy theories before people are exposed to them to promote COVID-19 prevention efforts.","Earnshaw, Valerie A; Eaton, Lisa A; Kalichman, Seth C; Brousseau, Natalie M; Hill, E Carly; Fox, Annie B",Transl Behav Med,,538

423145,Bacillus Calmette-Guérin scar flare after an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,2021,"We estimate the weekly excess all-cause mortality in Norway and Sweden, the years of life lost (YLL) attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and the significance of mortality displacement. We computed the expected mortality by taking into account the declining trend and the seasonality in mortality in the two countries over the past 20 years. From the excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess mortality. We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic year, July 2019 to July 2020, was 517 (95%CI = (12, 1074)) in Norway and 4329 [3331, 5325] in Sweden. There were 255 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Norway, and 5741 in Sweden, that year. During the epidemic period of 11 March-11 November, there were 6247 reported COVID-19 deaths and 5517 (4701, 6330) excess deaths in Sweden. We estimated that the number of YLL attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden was 45,850 [13,915, 80,276] without adjusting for mortality displacement and 43,073 (12,160, 85,451) after adjusting for the displacement accounted for by the auto-regressive model. In conclusion, we find good agreement between officially recorded COVID-19 related deaths and all-cause excess deaths in both countries during the first epidemic wave and no significant mortality displacement that can explain those deaths.","Rypdal, Martin; Rypdal, Kristoffer; Løvsletten, Ola; Sørbye, Sigrunn Holbek; Ytterstad, Elinor; Bianchi, Filippo Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,538
424294,"What should define a SARS-CoV-2 ""breakthrough"" infection?",2021,"Objectives: To demonstrate that 1) models based on small numbers of tests can be statistically developed to identify neuropsychological impairment in a general adult neuropsychology clinic and 2) those models show strong predictive validity on replication in a slightly different sample. Method: Latent Class Analyses (LCA) were used to determine neuropsychological classification in 231 patients referred to general adult neuropsychology services. A clinical rating scale was also used to approximate clinical decision-making. Regression models were constructed in a training sample (n = 127) drawn from an adult neuropsychology clinic using test scores from seven different a priori test battery combinations to predict group membership or clinical rating. The utility of the seven models was assessed in a testing sample (n = 104) from another independent adult neuropsychology clinic. Results: The LCA yielded a two class solution characterized by impaired versus non-impaired performance on neuropsychological tests. A seven test battery provided the best balance of accuracy and length in predicting LCA group with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 90%. Sensitivity and specificity were slightly attenuated using the clinical rating scale as the criterion, but the seven test battery still provided good accuracy (AUC=.906). Conclusions: Test protocols based on only five to eight test scores can accurately identify most patients with clinical impairment in a diverse adult neuropsychology clinic. Development of short protocols with adequate sensitivity and specificity will become increasingly important to address long waiting lists in light of the COVID pandemic against the general backdrop of increasing demand for neuropsychological services.","Kubu, C S; Frazier, T; Lapin, B; Naugle, R",Clin Neuropsychol,,538

There is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date, which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for COVID-19. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project with publically available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We identified 281 FDA approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified a list of repurposable anti-SARS- CoV-2 drugs using a systems biology approach.","Guo, Kai; Wang, Zhihan; Gao, Pan; Pu, Qinqin; Wu, Min; Huang, Canhua; Hur, Junguk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07856v1.pdf,538

Although 3-tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the gold-standard modality for structural and functional imaging, most centers refrain from 3T imaging in patients with DBS devices in place because of safety concerns. 3T MRI could be used not only for structural imaging, but also for functional MRI to study the effects of DBS on neurocircuitry and optimize programming. OBJECTIVE: To use an anthropomorphic phantom design to perform temperature and voltage safety testing on an activated DBS device during 3T imaging. METHODS: An anthropomorphic 3D-printed human phantom was constructed and used to perform temperature and voltage testing on a DBS device during 3T MRI. Based on the phantom assessment, a cohort study was conducted in which 6 human patients underwent MRI with their DBS device in an activated (ON) state. RESULTS: During the phantom study, temperature rises were under 2°C during all sequences, with the DBS in both the deactivated and activated states. Radiofrequency pulses from the MRI appeared to modulate the electrical discharge from the DBS, resulting in slight fluctuations of voltage amplitude. Six human subjects underwent MRI with their DBS in an activated state without any serious adverse events. One patient experienced stimulation-related side effects during T1-MPRAGE scanning with the DBS in an ON state because of radiofrequency-induced modulation of voltage amplitude. CONCLUSION: Following careful phantom-based safety testing, 3T structural and functional MRI can be safely performed in subjects with activated deep brain stimulators.","Davidson, Benjamin; Tam, Fred; Yang, Benson; Meng, Ying; Hamani, Clement; Graham, Simon J; Lipsman, Nir",Neurosurgery,,538

Repurposing antiviral treatments might prove the fastest way to identify effective therapy. OBJECTIVES: This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF) plus daclatasvir (DCV) or ravidasvir (RDV) added to standard care (SOC) for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection. METHOD: Multicentre parallel randomized controlled open lapel trial. One-hundred-twenty eligible patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection were randomized to one of the study arms. INTERVENTION: Ten days treatment with SOF plus DCV or RDV in addition to the standard of care compared to SOC. Follow up 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sum of the counted symptoms at 7 & 10 days, mean change in oxygen saturation level, viral negativity and rate of ICU admission. RESULTS: Compared to SOC, SOF-DCV group experienced a significantly lower sum of the counted symptoms (fever, headache, generalized aches, or respiratory distress) combined with no evidence of deterioration (ICU admission and mechanical ventilation) on days 7 and 10 of treatment. Oxygen saturation also significantly improved among SOF-DCV group compared to SOC starting from day 4. The study also showed positive trends regarding the efficacy of SOF-DCV with lower incidence of mortality. On the other hand, adding SOF-RDV to SOC did not show significant improvements in endpoints. CONCLUSION: The results support the efficacy and safety of SOF-DCV as an add-on to SOC for treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 infections. This article is protected by copyright.

427215,A Lesson Not To Be Forgotten. Ophthalmologists in Northern Italy Become Internists During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"Aims During COVID-19, guidelines for performance of endoscopy meant procedure numbers were significantly curtailed.From April-June 2020, the Health Authorities in Ireland procured private hospitals for public use. The aims of this study were 1. to determine if additional private hospital capacity was utilised effectively for endoscopy, as this model is oftenemployed to deal with long waiting lists in Ireland. 2. to compare pathology and follow up rates between the two institutions. Methods We analysed all documentation relating to 242 endoscopy procedures outsourced to the private institution (MPH). For the period of June 2020 we compared indications, follow up rates and pathology for outpatient endoscopy proceduresperformed in our public institution, MMUH (n = 111) and MPH (n = 104). Results 197/242 (81.4 %) procedures in 167 patients were completed. Non-completion was due to refusal or failure toattend (32) and illness (6). 102 patients (61 %) were subsequently discharged to the GP and 39 % of patients requiredhospital follow up. There was no significant difference between indications in both institutions (p = 0.843). As shown in Table 1, rates ofsignificant pathology in MPH vs MMUH were not statistically significant, 4 % vs 7 %;p = 0.315. There was no difference infollow up rates in MPH vs MMUH, 62 % vs 51 %, p = 0.849. Conclusions The use of private capacity in MPH during the first wave of COVID19 significantly reduced the burden on thepublic system for GI procedures. However arranging the necessary follow up for the 39 % of patients from the MPHgenerated a substantial clinical and administrative workload on the public system. Although the endoscopy procedures performed in both institutions were deemed 'urgent', significant pathology was rare, between 4-7 %, suggesting more stringent criteria for endoscopy should be considered in the future.","Kerr, H.; Byrne, M.

429825,mTOR: A possible therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin produced by certain sulfate-reducing bacteria and other anaerobic microorganisms. Because microorganisms differ in their capacity to methylate mercury, the abundance and distribution of methylating populations may determine MeHg production in the environment. We compared rates of MeHg production and the distribution of hgcAB genes in epilimnetic sediments from a freshwater lake that were experimentally amended with sulfate levels from 7 to 300 mg L-1. The most abundant hgcAB sequences were associated with clades of Methanomicrobia, sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and unknown environmental sequences. The hgcAB+ communities from higher sulfate amendments were less diverse and had relatively more Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the communities from lower amendments were more diverse with a larger proportion of hgcAB sequences affiliated with other clades. Potential methylation rate constants varied 52-fold across the experiment. Both potential methylation rate constants and % MeHg were the highest in sediments from the lowest sulfate amendments, which had the most diverse hgcAB+ communities and relatively fewer hgcAB genes from clades associated with sulfate reduction. Although pore water sulfide concentration covaried with hgcAB diversity across our experimental sulfate gradient, major changes in the community of hgcAB+ organisms occurred prior to a significant buildup of sulfide in pore waters. Our results indicate that methylating communities dominated by diverse anaerobic microorganisms that do not reduce sulfate can produce MeHg as effectively as communities dominated by sulfate-reducing populations.","Jones, Daniel S; Johnson, Nathan W; Mitchell, Carl P J; Walker, Gabriel M; Bailey, Jake V; Pastor, John; Swain, Edward B",Environ Sci Technol,,538
430181,Structure-based phylogeny identifies avoralstat as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor that prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Restrictions in public life during the COVID-19 pandemic mainly addressed the safety of high-risk older multimorbid patients to protect them from infection. Nevertheless, detrimental aspects of the lockdown for older people are a reduction in physical activity and limited access to physiotherapy, which are likely to have a negative impact on the health status. This study examined the feasibility of video-based physiotherapy (VT) and the subjective rating of VT by patients and therapists. METHODS: From April to June 2020, 4 facilities with 9 patients (6 women, 64-82 years old) participated in the study and were provided with technical equipment. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in eight patients to assess physical activity, functional ability and participation before and during the restrictions. Both patients and therapists were asked about their subjective experiences with VT. RESULTS: A total of 92 VT sessions took place. Performance of the exercises and comprehension of instructions were rated as good to very good. The level of acceptance was high. Of the patients four described a perceived reduction in their physical activities due to the public restrictions; however, in the questionnaires no substantial differences in participation and physical activity were found. DISCUSSION: The use of VT is feasible in older patients. Only minor technical support is needed.

The heart is one of the most commonly affected organs in COVID-19, but the nature and extent of the cardiac pathology has remained controversial. It has been shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can sustain type 1 myocardial infarction in the absence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. However, many patients present with small elevations of troponin enzymes of unclear etiology which correlate with overall COVID-19 disease outcome. Early autopsy reports indicated variable levels of typical lymphocytic myocarditis, while radiology reports have indicated that myocarditis can be a persistent problem after recovery from acute illness, raising concern about participation in college athletics. In this communication, we review the literature to date regarding the gross and microscopic findings of COVID-19 cardiac involvement, present the findings from over 40 cases from our academic medical center, and propose mechanisms by which patients develop small elevations in troponin. .","Fox, Sharon E; Heide, Richard S Vander",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,,538

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an ERAS-based protocol on the length of hospital stay after cardiac surgery. From January 2019 to June 2020, 664 patients underwent consecutive cardiac surgery at a Latin American center. Here, 46 patients were prepared for a rapid recovery through a multidisciplinary institutional protocol based on the ERAS concept, the ""TotalCor protocol"". After the propensity score matching, 46 patients from the entire population were adjusted for 12 variables. Patients operated on the TotalCor protocol had reduced intensive care unit time (P < 0.025), postoperative stay (P &#8804; 0.001) and length of hospital stay (P &#8804; 0.001). In addition, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of complications and death between the two groups. Of the 10-central metrics of TotalCor protocol, 6 had > 70% adherences. In conclusion, the TotalCor protocol was safe and effective for a 3-day discharge after cardiac surgery.

433446,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A syndemic perspective,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Experiences of care and satisfaction are intrinsically linked, as user's experiences of care may directly impact satisfaction, or indirectly impact user's expectations and values. Both experiences of care and satisfaction are important to measure so that quality can be monitored and improved. Globally, women experience mistreatment during childbirth at facilities; however, there is limited evidence exploring the mistreatment and women's satisfaction with care during childbirth. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey within the WHO study 'How women are treated during facility-based childbirth' exploring the mistreatment of women during childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria. Women's experiences of mistreatment and satisfaction with care during childbirth was explored. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted to evaluate the association between mistreatment, women's overall satisfaction with the care they received, and whether they would recommend the facility to others. RESULTS: 2672 women were included in this analysis. Despite over one-third of women reporting experience of mistreatment (35.4%), overall satisfaction for services received and recommendation of the facility to others was high, 88.4% and 90%, respectively. Women who reported experiences of mistreatment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with care: women were more likely to be satisfied if they did not experience verbal abuse (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.52, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.85), or had short waiting times (AOR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94 to 6.65). Women who did not experience any physical or verbal abuse or discrimination were more likely to recommend the facility to others (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.98 to 5.06). CONCLUSION: Measuring both women's experiences and their satisfaction with care are critical to assess quality and provide actionable evidence for quality improvement. These measures can enable health systems to identify and respond to root causes contributing to measures of satisfaction.","Maung, Thae Maung; Mon, Nwe Oo; Mehrtash, Hedieh; Bonsaffoh, Kwame Adu; Vogel, Joshua P; Aderoba, Adeniyi Kolade; Irinyenikan, Theresa Azonima; Balde, Mamadou Dioulde; Pattanittum, Porjai; Tuncalp, Özge; Bohren, Meghan A",,,538
433562,Comprehensive characterization of N- and O- glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2,2020,"The widespread antigenic changes lead to the emergence of a new type of coronavirus (CoV) called as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 that is immunologically different from the previous circulating species. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells (HCs) which its interaction with spike protein (SP) with a furin-cleavage site results in the SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Hence, in this review, we presented an overview on the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP. As several kinds of CoVs, from various genera, have at their S1/S2 binding site a preserved site, we further surveyed the role of furin cleavage site (FCS) on the life cycle of the CoV. Furthermore, we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading CoV epidemic. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for the development of potential drugs to promote targeting specific activities of the CoV were reviewed. In conclusion, this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of CoV vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

433819,The hunt is on,2020,"BACKGROUND: There are no established effective treatments for COVID-19. While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS: Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",,,538

Four independent variables that were extracted from valid theoretical backgrounds along with four demographic variables were used in the study. The regression analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses, which revealed that job stress directly affected the employees' desires to leave their organization. It also showed that perceived supervisor support mitigates employee turnover, and there were significant correlations between turnover intention with the employees' marital status and job position. Gender and years of service did not affect the employees' thinking of quitting their job. Our findings help hotel entrepreneurs better understand how to deal with customer incivility and employee job stress, and better comprehend the factors that minimize employees' negative behaviors for the organization.","Chung, Hyunah; Quan, Wei; Koo, Bonhak; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Vega-Muñoz, Alejandro; Giorgi, Gabriele; Han, Heesup",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,538

The toxic components are not known, but it has been suggested that the diterpene acids may be both toxic and abortifacient. One hundred sixty-two samples of snakeweed were collected from 55 locations in Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah and were taxonomically classified. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS in a chemophenetic analysis and grouped into individual chemotypes based on diterpene acid content. The GC-MS profiles were found to be diverse showing at least eight different chemotypes. From each of the chemotypes the major diterpene acids were isolated and characterized by IR, MS and NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-one diterpenoids were identified and found to be a mix of furano, lactone, di-acid and esters of labdane, ent-labdane and chlerodane acids and alcohols. Only four of the 21 compounds isolated had been previously reported as occurring in G. sarathorea or G. microcephala, while another eight compounds were previously reported from other Gutierrezia or related species.

440192,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Engagement in Algeria: A Population-based Study with Systematic Review of Studies from Arab Countries of the MENA Region,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: In the beginning of 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, became a public health emergency in the U.S. and rapidly escalated into a global pandemic. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, physical distancing was enforced and indoor public spaces, including schools and educational institutions, were abruptly closed and evacuated to ensure civilian safety. Accordingly, educational institutions rapidly transitioned to remote learning. We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic U.S. college students, ages 18-24 years. METHODS: Through Pollfish®'s survey research platform, we collected data from 200 domestic U.S. college students in this age range (N = 200) regarding the physical, emotional, and social impacts of COVID-19 as well as key background information (e.g. whether or not they are first-generation or if they identify with the LGBTQIA+ community). RESULTS: Our results indicate that students closer to graduating faced increases in anxiety (60.8%), feeling of loneliness (54.1%), and depression (59.8%). Many reported worries for the health of loved ones most impacted their mental health status (20.0%), and the need to take care of family most affected current and future plans (31.8%). Almost one-half of students took to exercising and physical activity to take care of their mental health (46.7%). While a third did not have strained familial relationships (36.5%), almost one half did (45.7%). A majority found it harder to complete the semester at home (60.9%), especially among those who had strained relationships with family (34.1%). Seventy percent spent time during the pandemic watching television shows or movies. Significantly more men, first-generation, and low-income students gained beneficial opportunities in light of the pandemic, whereas their counterparts reported no impact. First-generation students were more likely to take a gap year or time off from school. CONCLUSIONS: Although students found ways to take care of themselves and spent more time at home, the clear negative mental health impacts call for schools and federal regulations to accommodate, support, and make mental health care accessible to all students.","Lee, Jenny; Solomon, Matthew; Stead, Tej; Kwon, Bryan; Ganti, Latha",BMC Psychol,,538

effective reproductive number (R eff)) One study estimated an 18% reduction in R eff with digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact-tracing Another found a reduction in R eff for digital contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in R eff for manual contact tracing compared to self-isolation alone (53 reduction) However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%) Cohort studies Two cohort studies provided very low-certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio-frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13 The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts One cohort study provided very low-certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss Two studies from lower- or middle-income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems;they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices Authors' conclusions: The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real-world outbreak settings Modelling studies provide low-certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self-isolation Cohort studies provide very low-certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing Digital solutions may have equity implications for at-risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real-world settings Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies","Anglemyer, A.; Moore, T.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on semen quality, seminal oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory factors and reproductive hormones. In this randomised, double-blind controlled clinical trial, 52 men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia attending a urology clinic, were randomly assigned to either an intervention or placebo (n = 26) group. This investigation was registered by the identification code of IRCT20141025019669N7 in the clinical trials registry of Iran. The Intervention group took 500 mg of Probiotics daily and the placebo group took a daily placebo for 10 weeks. Semen parameters, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, inflammatory factors and reproductive hormones were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. After the intervention, ejaculate volume, number, concentration and the percentage of motile sperm, total antioxidant capacity of plasma significantly increased and the concentration of plasma malondialdehyde and inflammatory markers significantly decreased in the intervention group. Probiotic supplementation in infertile men lead to a significant increase in sperm concentration and motility and a significant reduction in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Therefore, oral intake of probiotics has the potential to be one of the ways to deal with oxidative damage of sperm.","Helli, Bijan; Kavianpour, Maria; Ghaedi, Ehsan; Dadfar, Mohammadreza; Haghighian, Hossein Khadem",Hum Fertil (Camb),,538

The underlying molecular mechanism of such distinct nutrient partitioning remains poorly-investigated. Here, an optimized rapid Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) approach was used to individually collect pericarp, aleurone, embryo and endosperm from 10 Days After Fertilization (DAF) old grains. Subsequent RNA-Seq analysis in these tissues have identified 7760 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Analysis of promoter sequences of tissue specific genes identified many known and novel cis-elements important for grain filling and seed development. Using identified DEGs, comprehensive spatial gene expression pathways were built for spatial accumulation of starch, proteins, lipids and iron. The extensive transcriptomic analysis has provided many novel insights about nutrient partitioning mechanisms, for instance, it reveals a gradient in Seed Storage Protein accumulation across the analysed four tissue-types. It further reveals that partitioning of various minerals, such as iron, is most likely regulated through transcriptional control of their transporters. In addition, the extensive analysis of this study is presented as an interactive online tool (https://biogeek.shinyapps.io/DEGs/) that provides a much-needed resource for future functional genomics studies aimed to improve grain quality and seed development.","Ram, Hasthi; Singh, Anmol; Katoch, Megha; Kaur, Ravneet; Sardar, Shaswati; Palia, Shubham; Satyam, Rohit; Sonah, Humira; Deshmukh, Rupesh; Pandey, Ajay; Gupta, Ishaan; Sharma, Tilak Raj",,,538

To this purpose, we propose the application of a computational framework to a SEIR-type (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) epidemiological model describing the different stages of COVID-19 infection. The model discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and it takes into account possible intervention measures in order to reduce the probability of transmission. As case studies, we analyze not only the epidemic situation in Umbria but also in Italy, in order to capture the evolution of the pandemic at a national level. First of all, we estimate model parameters through a Bayesian calibration method, called Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC), while using the official COVID-19 data of the Italian Civil Protection. Subsequently, Conditional Robustness Analysis (CRA) on the calibrated model is carried out in order to quantify the influence of epidemiological and intervention parameters on the hospitalization rates. The proposed pipeline properly describes the COVID-19 spread during the lock-down phase. It also reveals the underestimation of new positive cases and the need of promptly isolating asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases. The results emphasize the importance of the lock-down timeliness and provide accurate predictions on the current evolution of the pandemic.","Antonini, Chiara; Calandrini, Sara; Stracci, Fabrizio; Dario, Claudio; Bianconi, Fortunato",,,538

The framework also allows for reliable projections on the impact of travel limitations and social distancing measures on global epidemic spread. We test and calibrate it on reported cases while unveiling the mechanism that governs the delay in the relative peaks of newly infected cases among different regions of the globe. We discover that social distancing measures are more effective than travel limitations across borders in delaying the epidemic peak. We further provide the link to compartmental models such as the simplistic and time-honoured SIR-like models. We also show how to generalise the framework to account for the interactions across several regions of the world, replacing or complementing large scale simulations.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Sannino, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04956v1.pdf,538
447445,Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 in the Lung. Reply,2020,"Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria play a vital role in human life, since they cause infectious diseases which can lead to epidemics. Recent coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic has shown that taking effective prevention measures such as wearing masks are important to reduce the human deaths and side effects of the epidemic. It is therefore requisite to accurately model the spread of infectious diseases whose one of the most crucial routes of transmission is airborne transmission. The transmission models in the literature are proposed independently from each other, at different scales and by the researchers from various disciplines. Thus, there is a need to merge all these research attempts. To this end, we propose a communication engineering approach that melts different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid dynamics in the same pot to model airborne pathogen transmission among humans. In this approach, we introduce the concept of mobile human ad hoc networks (MoHANETs). This concept exploits the similarity of airborne transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc networks and uses molecular communication as the enabling paradigm. The aim of this article is to present a unified framework using communication engineering, and to highlight future research directions for modeling the spread of infectious diseases among humans through airborne pathogen transmission. In this article, we first review the airborne pathogen transmission mechanisms. Then, the MoHANET is given with a layered structure. In these layers, the infectious human emitting pathogen-laden droplets through air and the exposed human to these droplets are considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Moreover, the experimental methods for the proposed approach are reviewed and discussed.","Gulec, Fatih; Atakan, Baris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00884v1.pdf,538

448928,Clinical Evaluation of Acute Pancreatitis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Religion and spirituality constitute aspects of diversity that physicians must respect to provide patient-centered care. By seeing patients as individuals and integrating their religious and spiritual needs into their medical care, providers can deliver personalized health care. Their needs become even more critical for the frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients want their physicians to address their religious and spiritual needs when it comes to their health (eg, during isolation precautions). Despite increases in educational curricula about this integration, most physicians still do not provide this aspect of patient-centered care. METHODS: In this observational study, we examined how medical students responded to a patient experiencing a religious and spiritual issue by having standardized patients (SPs) rate the students' level of engagement with them. We also asked students to reflect on their own spirituality, in terms of their current and ideal levels of spirituality, the difference of which indicates spiritual dissonance. Medical students (n=232) completed the Spiritual Health and Life-Outcome Measure (SHALOM) questionnaire, and their SPs completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction With Doctor Questionnaire (PSQ-MD). RESULTS: Results indicated a significant, positive correlation between disengagement (from PSQ-MD) and transcendent spirituality dissonance (from SHALOM). CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of disconnection from a patient case with a religious and spiritual issue (portrayed by an SP) were associated with higher levels of incongruity in medical students' responses as to their ideal relationship with the transcendent (eg, God, Allah, peace).","Schmidt, Cindy; Nauta, Loes; Dang, Andrew",Fam Med,,538

As such, we investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio (BAR) predicts mortality in the COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. METHODS: A total of 602 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department within the period from March to September 2020 were included in the study. The BUN level, albumin level, BAR, age, gender, and in-hospital mortality status of the patients were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients who were included in the study, 312(51.8%) were male, and their median age was 63 years (49-73). There was in-hospital mortality in 96(15.9%) patients. The median BUN and BAR values of the patients in the non-survivor group were significantly higher than those in the survivor group (BUN: 24.76 [17.38-38.31] and 14.43 [10.84-20.42], respectively [p < 0.001]; BAR: 6.7 [4.7-10.1] and 3.4 [2.5-5.2], respectively [p < 0.001]). The mean albumin value in the non-survivor group was significantly lower than that in the survivor group (3.60 ± 0.58 and 4.13 ± 0.51, respectively; p < 0.001). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) and odds ratio values obtained by BAR to predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality were higher than the values obtained by BUN and albumin (AUC of BAR, BUN, and albumin: 0.809, 0.771, and 0.765, respectively; odds ratio of BAR>3.9, BUN>16.05, and albumin<4.01: 10.448, 7.048, and 6.482, respectively). CONCLUSION: The BUN, albumin, and BAR levels were found to be reliable predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, but BAR was found to be a more reliable predictor than the BUN and albumin levels.","Küçükceran, Kadir; Ayranci, Mustafa Kürsat; Girisgin, Abdullah Sadik; Koçak, Sedat; Dündar, Zerrin Defne",Am J Emerg Med,,538

Most infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute to immunity. We performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 to determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks of antiviral immunity.","Rodda, Lauren B; Netland, Jason; Shehata, Laila; Pruner, Kurt B; Morawski, Peter A; Thouvenel, Christopher D; Takehara, Kennidy K; Eggenberger, Julie; Hemann, Emily A; Waterman, Hayley R; Fahning, Mitchell L; Chen, Yu; Hale, Malika; Rathe, Jennifer; Stokes, Caleb; Wrenn, Samuel; Fiala, Brooke; Carter, Lauren; Hamerman, Jessica A; King, Neil P; Gale, Michael; Campbell, Daniel J; Rawlings, David J; Pepper, Marion",Cell,,538

Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients have abnormal blood coagulation function, but their venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevalence is still rarely mentioned. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP. METHODS: In this study, 81 severe NCP patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) were enrolled. The results of conventional coagulation parameters and lower limb vein ultrasonography of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of VTE in these patients was 25% (20/81), of which 8 patients with VTE events died. The VTE group was different from the non-VTE group in age, lymphocyte counts, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, etc. If 1.5 µg/mL was used as the D-dimer cut-off value to predicting VTE, the sensitivity was 85.0%, the specificity was 88.5%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 94.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP is 25% (20/81), which may be related to poor prognosis. The significant increase of D-dimer in severe NCP patients is a good index for identifying high-risk groups of VTE.","Cui, Songping; Chen, Shuo; Li, Xiunan; Liu, Shi; Wang, Feng",J Thromb Haemost,,538

We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). METHODS: Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. FINDINGS: Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%).

Results: The mean (SD) age of the 6559 women who delivered in 2019 was 27.8 (6.4) years, and the age of the 6048 women who delivered in 2020 was 27.7 (6.5) years (P = .38). Of women delivering in 2020, 1090 (18.0%) were non-Hispanic Black compared with 1067 (16.3%) in 2019 (P = .04). In the 2020 cohort, 4067 women (67.2%) attended at least 1 and 1216 women (20.1%) attended at least 3 audio-only virtual prenatal visits. Women who delivered in 2020 attended a greater mean (SD) number of prenatal visits compared with women who delivered in 2019 (9.8 [3.4] vs 9.4 [3.8] visits; P < .001). In the 2020 cohort, 173 women (2.9%) experienced the composite outcome, which was not significantly different than the 195 women (3.0%) in 2019 (P = .71). In addition, the rate of the composite outcome did not differ substantially when examined according to the number of audio-only virtual visits attended. Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of audio-only virtual prenatal visits was not associated with changes in perinatal outcomes and increased prenatal visit attendance in a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic when used in a risk-appropriate model.","Duryea, Elaine L; Adhikari, Emily H; Ambia, Anne; Spong, Catherine; McIntire, Donald; Nelson, David B",JAMA Netw Open,,538

459098,Dried Blood Spots May Offer Route to Wider Antibody Testing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia in patients with stroke can cause serious complications, such as aspiration and pneumonia, that often lead to increase in mortality and length of hospitalization. Several screening tests for dysphagia have been developed and are used in clinical practice to prevent dysphagia complications. The Gugging Swallowing Screen is 1 such screening test. It is suggested for use in the assessment of the ability of patients to swallow fluid and non-fluid foods separately. It also promotes effective communication between healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the validity and benefit of the Gugging Swallowing Screen. DESIGN: This was a systematic review. DATA SOURCE: We sourced data from electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean studies Information Service System. REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases. We included studies published in English and Korean up to November 2018 that pertained to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. We designed strategies that included Medical Subject Headings and keywords, such as ""dysphagia,"" ""swallowing,"" ""assessment,"" ""screening,"" and ""GUSS,"" used alone or in combination. RESULTS: Of the 297 studies that appeared in the search result, 219 articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers after duplicate studies were eliminated. Finally, 8 articles were included in this study. With regard to validity, the Gugging Swallowing Screen had a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99), a pooled specificity of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.74), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9381. With regard to benefit, early systematic dysphagia screening using Gugging Swallowing Screen performed by nurses reduced both screening time and pneumonia rate compared to the control group (p = 0.004). The incidence of X-ray-verified pneumonia was significantly lower in the Gugging Swallowing Screen group than in the clinical screening group (p Ë 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of pneumonia compared to the value predicted using the 10 mL water swallowing test. CONCLUSIONS: The Gugging Swallowing Screen is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening dysphagia. Early and systematic assessment can prevent aspiration and pneumonia. However, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this tool.","Park, Ki Deok; Kim, Tae Hee; Lee, Seon Heui",Int J Nurs Stud,,538
459756,Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Human Metapneumovirus,2020,"The occurrence of the COVID-19 second-wave outbreak in Europe has pushed laboratories performing molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests to increase their throughput and decrease the result rendering time. In this evaluation, we tested for the first time a new, extraction-free, protocol with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Assay RT-qPCR kit on a Nimbus platform. Ninety-one samples, of which 71 previously tested positive with RT-qPCR with extraction were immediately analyzed without extraction, using only a dilution and thermal shock protocol. The positive and negative percentage agreements were respectively 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.99) and 95.0% (95% CI: 0.76-0.99). The two false negatives observed were very weakly positive with the comparison method. Moderate variations in Ct of the targeted genes were observed (median ± 95% CI): E gene, +2.49 ± 0.44; N gene, +0.98 ± 0.54; RdRP/S genes, +2.64 ± 0.48. On the other hand, the number of tests performed within 24 h raised from 86.4% to 97.8%, the turn-around time decreased from 19:18 to 09:03 (p < .0001), and the number of tests that can be performed per day doubled since this technique was introduced routinely in our laboratory.","Blairon, Laurent; Piteüs, Sébastien; Beukinga, Ingrid; Tré-Hardy, Marie",J Med Virol,,538

460310,Universal Screening for SARS-CoV-2 of all Human Milk Bank Samples,2020,"Throughout the world, including the United States, men have worse outcomes from COVID-19 than women. SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 pandemic, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry. ACE2 is a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays an important role in counteracting the harmful effects mediated by the angiotensin type 1 receptor. Therefore, we conducted Ovid MEDLINE and Embase database searches of basic science studies investigating the impact of the biological variable of sex on ACE2 expression and regulation from 2000, the year ACE2 was discovered, through December 31, 2020. Out of 2,131 publications, we identified 853 original research articles on ACE2 conducted in primary cells, tissues, and/or whole mammals excluding humans. The majority (68.7%) of these studies that cited the sex of the animal were conducted in males, while 11.2% were conducted solely in females; 9.26% compared ACE2 between the sexes, while 10.8% did not report the sex of the animals used. General findings are that sex differences are tissue-specific and when present, are dependent upon gonadal state. Renal, cardiac, and adipose ACE2 is increased in both sexes under experimental conditions that model co-morbidities associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes including hypertension, obesity, and renal and cardiovascular diseases; however, ACE2 protein was generally higher in the males. Studies in Ace2 knockout mice indicate ACE2 plays a greater role in protecting the female from developing hypertension than the male. Studying the biological variable of sex in ACE2 research provides an opportunity for discovery in conditions involving RAS dysfunction and will shed light on sex differences in COVID-19 severity.","Milicic Stanic, Branka; Maddox, Sydney; de Souza, Aline M A; Wu, Xie; Mehranfard, Danial; Ji, Hong; Speth, Robert C; Sandberg, Kathryn",Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,,538
460396,The Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection on the Course of Atopic Dermatitis in Patients,2021,"The mortality of COVID-19 patients is increasing in logarithmic fashion and is mostly observed in older age people and patients having history of chronic ailments like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular & cerebrovascular dysfunction, compromised immunity, renal comorbidities, hepatic, obesity problems etc., and recently investigated thrombotic complications. The molecular underpinnings linking the chronic human diseases with COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality are evolving and poorly understood. The aim of the present review is to discuss the mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 in relation to preexisting comorbidities across the globe, upcoming molecular mechanisms associated with expression profile of ACE2 and viral load, evolving pathophysiology of COVID-19 with special reference to thrombotic complication ('Storm of Blood Clots') and related predictive markers. The levels of plasminogen/plasmin in comorbid diseases of COVID-19 have been elaborated in the framework of risk and benefits of fibrinolysis in COVID-19. We have also attempted to discuss the puzzle of prescribing ARBs and ACEI drugs in COVID-19 management which are routinely prescribed for the management of hypertension in COVID-19 patients.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicentre study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medical staff of 60 hospitals were selected from 145 designated medical institutions located in the epidemic area where the patients with COVID-19 were treated in China. RESULTS: In total, 1761 respondents wore N95 respirators (use alone 20.8%; combination use 79.2%), and the prevalence of DRPI was 59.2% (95% CI 56.93 to 61.53). A daily wearing time of >4 hours (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.35), wearing a N95 respirator in combination with goggles both with the presence of sweating (OR 13.40, 95% CI 7.34 to 23.16) and without the presence of sweating (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.14) and wearing only a N95 respirator with the presence of sweating (OR 9.60, 95% CI 7.00 to 13.16) were associated with DRPI. A correspondence analysis indicated that if there was no sweating, regardless of whether the N95 respirator was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, single-site DRPI mainly occurred on the nose bridge, cheek and auricle. If there was sweating present, regardless of whether the N95 was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, multiple DRPI sites occurred more often on the face. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DRPI among medical staff caused by N95 respirators was very high, which was mainly associated with a longer daily wearing time and interaction with sweating. The nasal bridge, cheeks and auricles were the primary protection locations found.","Jiang, Qixia; Liu, Yuxiu; Song, Siping; Wei, Wei; Bai, Yuxuan",BMJ Open,,538

METHODS: This was a single-center health service evaluation. We began testing for COVID-19 on 3 March and introduced a modified ""COVID Stroke Thrombectomy Pathway"" on 18 March. We analyzed the clinical, procedural and outcome data for 61 consecutive stroke thrombectomy patients between 1 January and 30 April. We compared the data for January and February (""pre-COVID,"" n = 33) versus March and April (""during COVID,"" n = 28). RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups (mean age 71 ± 12.8 years, 39% female). During the COVID-19 pandemic, (a) total stroke admissions fell by 17% but the thrombectomy rate was maintained at 20% of ischemic strokes; (b) successful recanalization rate was maintained at 81%; (c) early neurological outcomes (neurological improvement following thrombectomy and inpatient mortality) were not significantly different; (d) use of general anesthesia fell significantly from 85 to 32% as intended; and (e) time intervals from onset to arrival, groin puncture, and recanalization were not significantly different, whereas internal delays for external referrals significantly improved for door-to-groin puncture (48 [interquartile range (IQR) 39-57] vs. 33 [IQR 27-44] minutes, p = 0.013) and door-to-recanalization (82.5 [IQR 61-110] vs. 60 [IQR 55-70] minutes, p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the stroke admission numbers but not stroke thrombectomy rate, successful recanalization rate, or early neurological outcome.

Blocking the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interaction is, therefore, a potential strategy to inhibit viral infections. Using a novel biopanning strategy, a small anti-ACE2 peptide is discovered, which shows high affinity and specificity to human ACE2. It blocks not only the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interaction but also the SARS-CoV-1-RBD/ACE2 interaction. Moreover, it inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells. The peptide shows negligible cytotoxicity in Vero-E6 cells and Huh7 cells. In vivo short-term lung toxicity study also demonstrates a good safety of the peptide after intratracheal administration. The anti-ACE2 peptide can be potentially used as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2 or other ACE2-mediated viruses.

Healthcare workers (HCW) are overexposed and infection rates are higher than in the rest of the population. Strict clinical assessment is paramount to detect suspicious cases. In this context, olfactory or taste dysfunction (OTD) appears as an early and frequent symptom. Evaluating its presence in early stages plays an important role nowadays. METHODS: We performed a descriptive observational single-center study among 256 HCW at Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada affected by COVID-19 and confirmed using RT-PCR. A telephonic interview was performed, after obtaining oral informed consent. RESULTS: OTD was present in up to 70% of the cases as an early symptom, including mild-to-severe cases. The extent of these sensory deficits lasted an average of 11 days. In 26% of the patients, these sensory alterations persisted for over a month. CONCLUSION: OTD is reported as an early symptom among HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its strong association with test positivity is useful in the management of the infection and should be enough to indicate preventive isolation. We consider that OTD needs to be included in clinical screening questionnaires in HCW.","Villarreal, Ithzel Maria; Morato, Marta; Martínez-RuizCoello, Mar; Navarro, Andrés; Garcia-Chillerón, Raimon; Ruiz, Álvaro; de Almeida, Isabella Vacallanos; Mazón, Luis; Plaza, Guillermo",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,538

464855,Inefficient Placental Virus Replication and Absence of Neonatal Cell-Specific Immunity Upon Sars-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools supports the idea of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a precious tool for COVID-19 environmental surveillance. Successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewaters has been reported in several countries. This study investigated the presence and persistence of viral RNA in treated and untreated wastewaters in Padua, Italy. An urban experimental network of sampling sites was tested for prospective surveillance activities. METHODS: Seven sampling sites (i.e. wastewater pumping stations, plant inlets and outlets) were selected from the two main municipal wastewater treatment plant systems. Eleven grab samples (9 untreated, 2 treated wastewaters) were collected on 2 dates. All samples were tested at t0 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and t1 = 24 h to investigate its persistence, at room temperature and under refrigerated conditions. Overall, 33 sub-samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration and tested for molecular detection of viral RNA with two RT-qPCR assays. RESULTS: At t0, positivity for at least one RT-qPCR assay was achieved by 4/9 untreated wastewater samples and 2/2 tertiary treated samples. A minimum SARS-CoV-2 titer of 4.8-4.9 log10 gc/L was estimated. At t1, three refrigerated subsamples were positive as well. The two RT-qPCR assays showed differential sensitivity, with the N assay detecting 90% of successful amplifications. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in untreated and treated wastewaters. Its persistence after 24 h was demonstrated in subsamples kept at 4 °C. Hospitalization data suggested an approximate WBE detection power of 1 COVID-19 case per 531 inhabitants. The possible role of WBE in COVID-19 environmental surveillance is strongly supported by our findings. WBE can also provide precious support in the decision-making process of restriction policies during the epidemic remission phase. Optimization and standardization of laboratory methods should be sought in the short term, so that results from different studies can be compared with reliability.","Baldovin, Tatjana; Amoruso, Irene; Fonzo, Marco; Buja, Alessandra; Baldo, Vincenzo; Cocchio, Silvia; Bertoncello, Chiara",Sci Total Environ,,538

Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic.

Early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment remain the most effective prevention and control measures. Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19, especially in the early screening, with a higher sensitivity than that of real-time fluorescence RT-PCR. The combination of CT and artificial intelligence has the potential to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency.","Li, Ge; Xiong, Zeng; Zhou, Hui; Xie, Jiangping; Chen, Wei; Zhou, Moling; Zhu, Zhiming; Zhou, Gaofeng; Liu, Jinkang",Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,538
467461,Caring for cardiac patients amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The scrambled pieces of the puzzle,2020,"With the spread of COVID-19, more and more attention has been paid to the self-monitoring of healthy breathing. In this paper, we propose a humidity sensor which is simple to manufacture, low cost, good flexibility and visualization. The humidity sensor based on cellulose filter paper (FP) exhibited a good moisture-dependent voltage response over a wide relative humidity (RH) range due to the capillary structure of porous cellulose films and highly hydrophilic material of cobalt chloride (CoCl2), which facilitated water molecule adsorption and diffusion. The cellulose film colour shifted from blue to red when RH changed from 11% to 98%, and this colour shift was reversible. A moisture-driven sensor, based on the diffusive flow of water in cellulose networks, can provide an output voltage of 200 mV in a highly moist environment. Due to the high flexibility of cellulose fibres, the sensor maintained a constant output voltage even after 3000 folds. Moreover, the device was successfully applied for human respiratory monitoring and movement frequency tracking. The uniqueness of this new wearable humidity sensor technology can establish a new application field for the development of intelligent textiles and personal health products in the future Internet-of-things.","Kan, Yan Meng Jianying Guo Yuanhao Li Xiaoqiang Gao Dekang",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,,538

In this article, the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the ""everyday emergencies"" in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning, a whole-of-government commitment to equal access, and implementation of universal design strategies. Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present health-damaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible. We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed ninetieth century urban epidemics. This perspective offers insights for ensuring the twenty-first century response to COVID-19 focuses on promoting more inclusive and healthy cities for all.","Pineda, Victor Santiago; Corburn, Jason",J Urban Health,,538

We designed a series of peptides mimicking the N-terminal helix of hACE2 protein which contains most of the contacting residues at the binding site, exhibiting a high helical folding propensity in aqueous solution. Our best peptide-mimics are able to block SARS-CoV-2 human pulmonary cell infection with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range upon binding to the virus spike protein with high affinity. These first-in-class blocking peptide mimics represent powerful tools that might be used in prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Karoyan, Philippe; Vieillard, Vincent; Gómez-Morales, Luis; Odile, Estelle; Guihot, Amélie; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Denis, Alexis; Grondin, Pascal; Lequin, Olivier",Commun Biol,,538

This has a significant effect on the health of the mother and offspring. There is no doubt that screening for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks is important to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is no consensus about diagnosis and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy. In this narrative review on the current evidence on screening for GDM in early pregnancy, we included 37 cohort studies and eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies have shown that a high proportion (15-70%) of women with GDM can be detected early in pregnancy depending on the setting, criteria used and screening strategy. Data from observational studies on the potential benefit of screening and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy show conflicting results. In addition, there is substantial heterogeneity in age and BMI across the different study populations. Smaller RCTs could not show benefit but several large RCTs are ongoing. RCTs are also necessary to determine the appropriate cut-off for HbA1c in pregnancy as there is limited evidence showing that an HbA1c &#8805;6.5% has a low sensitivity to detect overt diabetes in early pregnancy.","Raets, Lore; Beunen, Kaat; Benhalima, Katrien",,,538

DATA SOURCES: The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles. STUDY SELECTIONS: Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014 and 2021 were evaluated. RESULTS: Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early-life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration affect the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, whereas high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early life may be associated with increased asthma risk, whereas viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood. CONCLUSION: Although evaluating the risk of allergic disease development is complex, clinicians can apply these insights on the multifactorial nature of atopy to better understand and potentially mitigate disease development.","Hossenbaccus, Lubnaa; Linton, Sophia; Ramchandani, Rashi; Gallant, Mallory J; Ellis, Anne K",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,538

For example, a single allosteric modulator, Rp-cAMPS, of the prototypical protein kinase A (PKA) switches from antagonist to agonist depending on MgATP levels. However, the mechanism underlying such pluripotent allostery has remained elusive for decades. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ensemble models, kinase assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that allosteric pluripotency arises from surprisingly divergent responses of highly homologous tandem domains. The differential responses perturb domain-domain interactions and remodel the free-energy landscape of inhibitory excited states sampled by the regulatory subunit of PKA. The resulting activation threshold values are comparable to the effective free energy of regulatory and catalytic subunit binding, which depends on metabolites, substrates, and mutations, explaining pluripotent allostery and warranting a general redefinition of allosteric targets to include specific subcellular environments.","Byun, J A; Akimoto, M; VanSchouwen, B; Lazarou, T S; Taylor, S S; Melacini, G",Sci.

COVID-19 infection with MAS typically occurs in subjects with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and historically, non-survival in ARDS was linked to sustained IL-6 and IL-1 elevation. We provide a model for the classification of MAS to stratify the MAS-like presentation in COVID-19 pneumonia and explore the complexities of discerning ARDS from MAS. We discuss the potential impact of timing of anti-cytokine therapy on viral clearance and the impact of such therapy on intra-pulmonary macrophage activation and emergent pulmonary vascular disease.","McGonagle, Dennis; Sharif, Kassem; O039,; Regan, Anthony; Bridgewood, Charlie",Autoimmun Rev,,538

The study explores whether building artificially intelligent cities can safeguard humanity from natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophes. All of the statements in this viewpoint are based on a thorough review of the current status of AI literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. This paper generates insights and identifies prospective research questions by charting the evolution of AI and the potential impacts of the systematic adoption of AI in cities and societies.

As part of this second questionnaire, G1 parents completed a questionnaire about each of their G2 children. This covered: parental reports of children's feelings and behaviour since lockdown, school attendance, contact patterns, and health. A total of 289 G1 participants completed this questionnaire on behalf of 411 G2 children.

480739,"SARS-CoV-2: immune response, structural changes, treatment strategies",2021,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The major mutation detected to date in the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope spike protein, which is responsible for virus attachment to the host and is also the main target for host antibodies, is a mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 found frequently in Chinese strains to a glycine (G). We sought to infer health impact of this mutation. RESULT: Increased case fatality rate correlated strongly with the proportion of viruses bearing G614 on a country by country basis. The amino acid at position 614 occurs at an internal protein interface of the viral spike, and the presence of G at this position was calculated to destabilise a specific conformation of the viral spike, within which the key host receptor binding site is more accessible. CONCLUSION: These results imply that G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2, which may influence vaccine design. The prevalence of this form of the virus should also be included in epidemiologic models predicting the COVID-19 health burden and fatality over time in specific regions. Physicians should be aware of this characteristic of the virus to anticipate the clinical course of infection.","Becerra-Flores, Manuel; Cardozo, Timothy",Int J Clin Pract,,538

481644,Trained Immunity: a Tool for Reducing Susceptibility to and the Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"We consider a retail firm selling a durable product in a volatile market where the demand is price-sensitive and random but its distribution is unknown. The firm dynamically replenishes inventory and adjusts prices over time and learns about the demand distribution. Assuming that the demand model is of the multiplicative form and unmet demand is partially backlogged, we take the empirical Bayesian approach to formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. We first identify a set of regularity conditions on demand models and show that the state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. We next employ the dimensionality reduction approach to separate the scale factor that captures observed demand information from the optimal profit function, which yields a normalized dynamic program that is more tractable. We also analyze the effect of demand learning on the optimal policy using the system without Bayesian update as a benchmark. We further extend our analysis to the case with unobserved lost sales and the case with additive demand.","Liu, Jue; Pang, Zhan; Qi, Linggang",Comput Oper Res,,538

The situation is dynamic and fast-evolving, with the world facing new variants of concern which may have immune escape potential. With threatened treatment and preventative strategies at stake, and the prospect of reinfection prolonging the pandemic, it is more crucial than ever to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which intriguingly disproportionately affects adults and the elderly. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain largely asymptomatic or undergo a transient mild illness. Understanding why children have a milder phenotype and a significant survival advantage may help identify modifiable risk factors in adults. Current evidence suggests adults with COVID-19 show variability in innate and adaptive immune responses, which result in uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine production in some patients, leading to severe disease and mortality. Children with acute COVID-19 infection seldom progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and are less likely to exhibit the cytokine storm which is so prominent in adults. Even with the Kawasaki-like illness, a hyperinflammation syndrome also known as paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2, mortality is low. The key to successfully combating SARS-CoV-2 and future zoonotic pandemics may lie in understanding these critical differences and merits focused consideration and research. The impact of community transmission among asymptomatic children is unknown;sustained global decline in infection rates and control of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be achieved until vaccination of children occurs. In this review, we discuss the fundamental differences in the immune response between children and adults in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Warner, Suz Richter Alex Stamataki Zania Kelly Deirdre",BMJ Paediatrics Open,,538

We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a convenience sample of 278 healthcare professionals at one medical center. They were asked to rank their preference in respirator allocation to three COVID-19 patients, one 80 years old with no cognitive illness, one 50 years old with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and one 80 years old with AD. Most respondents (75%) chose the 80-year-old AD patient as last preference, but were evenly divided on how to rank the other two patients. Medical staff have difficulty deciding whether age or cognitive status should be the deciding factor ventilator allocation.

Objectives: To identify the distribution of patients with phthisis bulbi and determine the status of their fellow eyes at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Methods: We analysed data retrospectively retrieved from medical records of patients diagnosed with phthisis bulbi at initial clinic visit from January 2008 to December 2017. Information abstracted included biodata, laterality of phthisical eye, duration and aetiology of phthisis bulbi, visual acuity, and morbidities present in fellow eyes. Results: Seventy-nine patients presented with unilateral phthisis bulbi. The mean age was 51±21.2 years and forty (50.6%) were males. The commonest aetiologies of phthisis bulbi were trauma 37 (46.8%), infection 17 (21.5%) and uveitis/inflammation 11 (13.9%). Seventy (88.6%) patients had morbidities in their fellow eye such as glaucoma 26 (32.9%), refractive errors 23 (29.1%) and cataract 22 (27.9%). Forty (50.6%) patients were either visually impaired or blind in their fellow eye (p=0.001). Conclusion: The commonest cause of phthisis bulbi was trauma. Approximately nine out of ten patients had ocular morbidities in their fellow eye.

482559,Seroresponse to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among maintenance dialysis patients,2021,"Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e., the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.","Ung, Huy Quang; Nguyen, Cuong Tuan; Nguyen, Hung Tuan; Truong, Thanh-Nghia; Nakagawa, Masaki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05002v1.pdf,538
483488,Viral dynamics in the Upper Respiratory Tract (URT) of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"As the current COVID-19 outbreak shows, disease epidemic is a complex problem which must be tackled with the right public policy. One of the main tools of the policymakers is to control the contact rate among the population, commonly referred to as social distancing, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. We pose a mean-field game model of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of utility from contacts but also risk of infection from those contacts. We compute and compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes individuals acting selfishly to maximize their own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which is the strategy maximizing the total utility of the population. We prove that the infected always want to make more contacts than the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the need to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave). Additionally, we compute the socially optimal strategies, given the costs to incentivize people to change from their selfish strategies. We find that if we impose limited resources, curbing contacts of the infected is more important after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the price of anarchy of this system, to understand the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise, which is when public policy would be most effective.","Cho, Samuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06758v1.pdf,538

Pediatric populations are less impacted than adults, and critical respiratory diseases seem rare (1, 2). We report the case of an infant, who presented with life-threatening apneas at home requiring basic life support. SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently identified in the patient's nasopharyngeal aspirate. He did not present with bronchiolitis or hypoxic failure as described in severe forms of COVID−19. The outcome was favorable in a few hours. The occurrence of apneas is not uncommon during viral respiratory infections in early infancy; however, there are very few descriptions related to a documented SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection. In light of this clinical case, it seems necessary to quickly bring up a potential COVID-19 contamination in infants admitted for life-threatening apnea, in order to properly report and isolate these patients to avoid further nosocomial dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.","Loron, Gauthier; Tromeur, Thibault; Venot, Perrine; Beck, Jonathan; Andreoletti, Laurent; Mauran, Pierre; Bednarek, Nathalie",Front.

Today, robots could assist healthcare workers when they provide care to elderly patients, who constitute a particularly vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous work on user-centered design of assistive technologies in LTC facilities for seniors has identified positive impacts. The need to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the benefits of this approach, but also highlights some new challenges for which robots could be interesting solutions to be deployed in LTC facilities. This requires customization of telecommunication and audio/video/data processing to address specific clinical requirements and needs. This paper presents OpenTera, an open source telehealth framework, aiming to facilitate prototyping of such solutions by software and robotic designers. Designed as a microservice-oriented platform, OpenTera is an end-to-end solution that employs a series of independent modules for tasks such as data and session management, telehealth, daily assistive tasks/actions, together with smart devices and environments, all connected through the framework. After explaining the framework, we illustrate how OpenTera can be used to implement robotic solutions for different applications identified in LTC facilities and homes, and we describe how we plan to validate them through field trials.","Panchea, Adina M.; L'etourneau, Dominic; Briere, Simon; Hamel, Mathieu; Maheux, Marc-Antoine; Godin, C'edric; Tousignant, Michel; Labb'e, Mathieu; Ferland, Franccois; Grondin, Franccois; Michaud, Franccois",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06171v1.pdf,538

Heart-lung-machines may potentially be used for ECMO but contain roller pumps as compared to centrifugal pumps in ECMO-circuits. We here tested roller pumps as rescue pump for ECMO-establishment. METHODS: We set up in vitro circuits on roller pumps from C5 heart-lung-machine with 5 l/minutes flow. In two series, we placed either PVC or silicon tubing for an ECMO circuit into the roller pump. We assessed the mechanical stress on the tubing (aiming to run the pump for at least 1 week), measured the temperature increase generated by the friction and assessed flow characteristics and its measurement in simulated situations resembling tube kinking and suction. RESULTS: The roller pumps led to expected and unexpected adverse events. PVC tubing burst between 36 and 78 hours, while silicon tubing lasted for at least 7 days. At 7 days, the silicone tubing showed significant signs of roller pump wear visible on the outside. The inside, however, was free of surface irregularities. Using these tubings in a roller pump led to a remarkable increase in circuit temperature (PVC: +12.0°C, silicone +2.9°C). Kinking or suction on the device caused the expected dramatic flow reduction (as assessed by direct measurement) while the roller pump display continued to show the preset flow. The roller pump is therefore not able to reliably determine the true flow rate. CONCLUSION: Roller pumps with silicone tubing but not PVC tubing may be used for running ECMO circuits. Silicone tubing may endure the roller pump shear forces for up to 1 week. Thus, repeated tubing repositioning may be a solution. Circuit heating and substantial limitations in flow detection should increase attention if clinical use in situations of crisis is considered.","Kaluza, Mirko; May, Benjamin; Doenst, Torsten",Perfusion,,538

The study aimed to examine the unequal impacts of COVID-19 across socioeconomic groups and to suggest potential solutions to tackle these inequalities. The pathways linking social determinants and health could be entry points to tackle the unequal consequences of this public health emergency. It is crucial for infectious disease policy to consider social determinants of health including poor housing, precarious working conditions, disrupted healthcare services, and suspension of social services. Moreover, the high levels of uncertainty and complexity inherent in this public health emergency, as well as the health and socioeconomic inequalities caused by the pandemic, underscore the need for good governance other than top-down measures by the government. We emphasize that a people-centered perspective is a key approach during the pandemic era.

In this paper, we have evaluated the influence of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Our hypothesis is that obesity is associated with reduced amounts of specific IgG antibodies. Results have confirmed our hypothesis and have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known influence of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein), and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids). These results altogether could help to identify an inflammatory signature with strong predictive value for immune dysfunction. Inflammatory markers identified may subsequently be targeted to improve humoral immunity in individuals with obesity and in individuals with other chronic inflammatory conditions.","Frasca, Daniela; Reidy, Lisa; Cray, Carolyn; Diaz, Alain; Romero, Maria; Kahl, Kristin; Blomberg, Bonnie B",PLoS One,,538

Limited studies have described the impact of these inequities on rural minorities living in Appalachia. This study investigates factors affecting testing in rural communities. METHODS: PCR testing data were obtained for March through September 2020. Spatial regression analyses were fit at the census tract level. Model outcomes included testing and positivity rate. Covariates included rurality, percent Black population, food insecurity, and area deprivation index (a comprehensive indicator of socioeconomic status). RESULTS: Small clusters in coronavirus testing were detected sporadically, while test positivity clustered in mideastern and southwestern WV. In regression analyses, percent food insecurity (IRR = 3.69×109, [796, 1.92×1016]), rurality (IRR=1.28, [1.12, 1.48]), and percent population Black (IRR = 0.88, [0.84, 0.94]) had substantial effects on coronavirus testing.

491003,Implications of SARS-Cov-2 infection on eNOS and iNOS activity: Consequences for the respiratory and vascular systems,2021,"BACKGROUND: During lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has become a necessary component of clinical practice for the purpose of providing safer patient care, and it has been used to support the healthcare needs of COVID-19 patients and routine primary care patients alike. However, this change has not been fully consolidated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyse the determinants of healthcare professionals' intention to use the eConsulta digital clinical consultations tool in the post-COVID-19 context. METHODS: A literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) allowed us to construct a theoretical model and establish a set of hypotheses derived from it about the influence that a variety of different factors relating to both healthcare professionals and the institutions where they work had on those professionals' intention to use eConsulta. In order to confirm the proposed model, a mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology was used, and a questionnaire was designed to serve as the data collection instrument. The data were analysed using univariate and bivariate analysis techniques. To confirm the theoretical model, exploratory factor analysis and binary logistic regression were applied. RESULTS: The most important variables were those referring to perceived benefits (B=2.408) and the type of use that individuals habitually made of eConsulta (B=0.715). Environmental pressure (B=0.678), experience of technology (B=0.542), gender (B=0.639) and the degree of eConsulta implementation (B=0.266) were other variables influencing the intention to use the tool in the post-COVID-19 context. When replicating the previous analysis by professional group, experience of technology and gender in the physician group, and experience of the tool's use and the centre where a professional works in the nurse group, were found to be of considerable importance. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation and use of eConsulta had increased significantly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the majority of the healthcare professionals were satisfied with its use in practice and planned to incorporate it into their practices in the post-COVID-19 context.

Design Infertility patients and endometriosis patients from a university hospital and members of the national patient organizations, as well as health care providers in infertility and endometriosis care were asked to participate between May and October 2020. The distributed online questionnaires consisted of an appraisal of virtual care and an assessment of fertility related quality of life (FertiQol) and patient-centeredness of endometriosis care (ENDOCARE). Results The questionnaires were returned by 374 infertility patients, 181 endometriosis patients and 101 health care providers. 75.9% of infertility patients, 64.8% of endometriosis patients and 80% of the health care providers rated telephone consultations as good alternative for physical consultations during the COVID-19-pandemic. Only 21.3%, 14.8% and 19.2% of the three groups rated telephone consultations as good replacement of physical consultations in the future. 76.6% and 35.9% of the infertility and endometriosis patients reported increased levels of stress during the pandemic. Infertility patients scored lower on the FertiQol, while the ENDOCARE results care seem comparable to reference. Conclusions Virtual care seems to be a good alternative for fertility and endometriosis patients in circumstances where physical consultations are not possible. Self-reported stress is especially high in infertility patients during the COVID-19-pandemic. Health care providers could inform their patients in order to increase patients’ ability to cope.","Rosielle, K.; Bergwerff, J.; Schreurs, A. M. F.; Knijnenburg, J.; De Bie, B.; Maas, J. W.

However, there is little systematic data on stroke incidence and mechanisms, particularly in racially diverse populations in the United States. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study of stroke incidence and mechanisms in all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from March 15 to May 3, 2020, at 3 Philadelphia hospitals. RESULTS: We identified 844 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (mean age 59 years, 52% female, 68% Black); 20 (2.4%) had confirmed ischemic stroke; and 8 (0.9%) had intracranial hemorrhage. Of the ischemic stroke patients, mean age was 64 years, with only one patient (5%) under age 50, and 80% were Black. Conventional vascular risk factors were common, with 95% of patients having a history of hypertension and 60% a history of diabetes mellitus. Median time from onset of COVID symptoms to stroke diagnosis was 21 days. Stroke mechanism was cardioembolism in 40%, small vessel disease in 5%, other determined mechanism in 20%, and cryptogenic in 35%. Of the 11 patients with complete vascular imaging, 3 (27%) had large vessel occlusion. Newly positive antiphospholipid antibodies were present in >75% of tested patients. Of the patients with intracranial hemorrhage, 5/8 (63%) were lobar intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and 3/8 (38%) were subarachnoid hemorrhage; 4/8 (50%) were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low risk of acute cerebrovascular events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most patients with ischemic stroke had conventional vascular risk factors, and traditional stroke mechanisms were common.","Rothstein, Aaron; Oldridge, Olivia; Schwennesen, Hannah; Do, David; Cucchiara, Brett L",Stroke,,538

Israeli residents perform shifts extending up to 26 hours, a practice leading to general dissatisfaction. In early 2020, during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many Israeli hospitals transitioned from 26-hour shifts to 13-hour shifts in fixed teams (capsules) followed by a 24-hour rest period at home. The regulation changes enacted by the Israeli government during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to assess perception by residents regarding length of shifts before and after the change. OBJECTIVES: To assess perception of pediatric residency in three aspects: resident wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and acquisition of medical education following the change to the shorter shifts model. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study among pediatric residents. Residents completed an online self-assessment questionnaire before and after the COVID-19 emergency regulations changed toward shorter shifts. RESULTS: Sixty-seven residents answered the questionnaires before (37) and after (30) the shift changes. The average score was significantly better for the 13-hour shifts versus the 26-hour shifts, except for questions regarding available time for research. There was a positive perception regarding the shorter night shifts model among pediatric residents, with an increase in general satisfaction and improvement in perception of general wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and medical education acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Following the change to shorter shift length, perception of pediatric residents included improvement in wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and availability of medical education.","Damari, Eytan; Fargel, Alon; Berger, Itai; Ron, Reut; Yeshayahu, Yonatan",Isr Med Assoc J,,538

To monitor test quality and evaluate NAT kits, quality control materials that best simulate real clinical samples are needed. In this study, the performance of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant, PCDH-based pseudovirus, and MS2-based pseudovirus as quality control materials was compared. PCDH-based pseudovirus was found to be more similar in characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 particle, and more suitable for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 NAT kits than MS2-based pseudovirus. Proper detection using sensitive and precise NAT kits is essential to guarantee diagnosis. Thus, limit of detection, precision, anti-inference ability, and cross-reactivity of NAT kits from PerkinElmer, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Ltd, Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co, Ltd, Sansure Biotech Inc., Da An Gene Co, Ltd, Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co, Ltd, and Applied Biological Technologies Co, Ltd, were compared using PCDH-based pseudovirus. For the seven kits evaluated, N gene was more sensitive than ORF1ab gene in most kits, whereas E gene was most sensitive among the three genes in Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co, Ltd, and Applied Biological Technologies Co, Ltd. PerkinElmer got the lowest limit of detection for N gene at 11.61 copies/mL, and the value was 34.66 copies/mL for ORF1ab gene. All of the kits showed good precision, with CV values less than 5%, as well as acceptable anti-interference ability of 2 mg/L human genomic DNA. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory viruses.","Yan, Ying; Chang, Le; Luo, Wenxin; Liu, Junyi; Guo, Fei; Wang, Lunan",J Mol Diagn,,538

In the crisis of respiratory infection of Covid-19, screening based on symptoms is one of the key measures. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the telephone-based screening and triage services in the promoted primary healthcare system with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak, in terms of reducing unnecessary referrals to the hospital. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in two stages on 1,406,635 households during March/April 2020 in Ardabil province for screening and early detection of Covid-19 disease. In the first stage, conducted by trained healthcare providers through telephone, individuals suspected of Covid-19 were identified. In the second stage, the individuals were referred to the second level of service in comprehensive healthcare centers (16- or 24-h centers) for clinical evaluation by a physician. Results: The results showed that before establishing a screening and triage system for patients in comprehensive healthcare centers, all patients were referred directly to the hospital, while after the implementation of the program, a significant reduction in hospital visits was observed and a large number of patients undertook the care and triage services in comprehensive healthcare centers. Conclusion: The use of a grading system in referring patients with suspected cases, triage of patients according to symptoms at the comprehensive health centers, and activation of home isolation were the most important factors in reducing the burden of unnecessary referrals of patients to the hospital.","NeJhaddadgar, Nazila; Ziapour, Arash; Zakkipour, Ghader; Abbas, Jaffar; Abolfathi, Mitra; Shabani, Masoud",Z Gesundh Wiss,,538

Recently, anal swabs for key population screening have been shown to not only reduce missed diagnoses but also facilitate the traceability of infectious sources. As a specimen for the detection of viruses, the goal of this paper is to briefly review the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 and the necessity of using anal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening to minimize transmission and a threat to other people with COVID-19.","Wang, Yuliang; Chen, Xiaobo; Wang, Feng; Geng, Jie; Liu, Bingxu; Han, Feng",Int J Med Sci,,538
497328,Markers of Polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Convalescent Plasma,2021,"In silico models to predict which tumors will respond to a given drug are necessary for Precision Oncology. However, predictive models are only available for a handful of cases (each case being a given drug acting on tumors of a specific cancer type). A way to generate predictive models for the remaining cases is with suitable machine learning algorithms that are yet to be applied to existing in vitro pharmacogenomics datasets. Here, we apply XGBoost integrated with a stringent feature selection approach, which is an algorithm that is advantageous for these high-dimensional problems. Thus, we identified and validated 118 predictive models for 62 drugs across five cancer types by exploiting four molecular profiles (sequence mutations, copy-number alterations, gene expression, and DNA methylation). Predictive models were found in each cancer type and with every molecular profile. On average, no omics profile or cancer type obtained models with higher predictive accuracy than the rest. However, within a given cancer type, some molecular profiles were overrepresented among predictive models. For instance, CNA profiles were predictive in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) cell lines, but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines where gene expression (GEX) and DNA methylation profiles were the most predictive. Lastly, we identified the best XGBoost model per cancer type and analyzed their selected features. For each model, some of the genes in the selected list had already been found to be individually linked to the response to that drug, providing additional evidence of the usefulness of these models and the merits of the feature selection scheme.","Naulaerts, Stefan; Menden, Michael P; Ballester, Pedro J",Biomolecules,,538

A novel production procedure for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles (GNPs)-capped 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) modified bioelectrode was presented and its application potential for RBD biosensing was examined. The bioelectrode fabrication protocol was based on covalent ester linking formation between hydroxylated ITO electrode and GNPs-capped MUA (GNPs@MUA) with carboxyl ends. For this aim, spherical GNPs were prepared and characterized with scanning-transmission electron microscopy (S-TEM), UV-visible, and Raman spectroscopy. The synthesized GNPs were functionalized with MUA yielding Au-S bonds. Then, covalent immobilization of anti-RBD antibodies on the GNPs@MUA was performed with the help of carbodiimide coupling chemistry. The assembly processes of GNPs@MUA, anti-RBD antibodies and RBD antigens were characterized electrochemical, chemical and morphological techniques. GNPs@MUA was used as immobilization environment and provided the most effective surface design for target immunosensor. The resulting immunosensor is further applied to the impedimetric detection of RBD and it displayed a linear response to RBD antigen in the linear range of 0.002-100 pg mL-1 with a limit of detection of 0.577 fg mL-1 and sensitivity of 0.238 kohmpgmL-1 cm-2. The fabricated immunosensor had a good repeatability, long storage, stability and a reusable property after simple regeneration process.

However, its diagnostic accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in real-life clinical settings remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP compared to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) over the disease course of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 124 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients were tested by RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR. Sensitivities and specificities of RT-LAMP compared with RT-qPCR were analyzed as a function of time from onset. RESULTS: Up to the 9th day after onset, the RT-LAMP had a positivity of 92.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity compared with RT-qPCR was 100%. However, after the 10th day after onset, the positivity of RT-LAMP decreased to less than 25%, and the concordance of positivity between the two methods was below 60%. The limit of detection of RT-LAMP was 6.7 copies/reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Until the 9th day after the onset of symptoms, RT-LAMP had the same diagnostic accuracy as RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that RT-LAMP can be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 as an alternative to RT-qPCR in the acute symptomatic phase of COVID-19.","Inaba, Masato; Higashimoto, Yuki; Toyama, Yoko; Horiguchi, Tomoya; Hibino, Masaya; Iwata, Mitsunaga; Imaizumi, Kazuyoshi; Doi, Yohei",Int J Infect Dis,,538
499272,Feasibility of large-scale population testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection by self-testing at home,2021,"BACKGROUND: Massive screening campaigns for SARS-CoV-2 are currently carried out throughout the world, relying on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following nasopharyngeal swabbing performed by a healthcare professional. Yet, due to the apprehension of pain induced by nasopharyngeal probing, poor adhesion to those screening campaigns can be observed. To enhance voluntary participation and to avoid unnecessary exposition to SARS-CoV-2, self-swabbing could be proposed. To date, no data have been published concerning pain induced by conventional- or self-swabbing. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate pain induced with the conventional swabbing method and compare it to self-swabbing. Secondary objectives focused on swabbing-induced discomfort and acceptability of the two methods. METHODS: The study was conducted in Clermont-Ferrand medical school (France). Overall, 190 students were randomised into two groups and experienced either self- or conventional-swabbing. Each subject had to rate pain, discomfort and acceptability of such swabbing on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two methods. The mean pain level was 2.5 ± 1.9, 28% rating pain as &#8805;4/10. Discomfort was 4.8 ± 2.2, 66% indicating significant (&#8805;4/10) discomfort. Higher pain and discomfort were associated with female sex. Acceptability was &#8805;8/10 for 89.0% of the subjects and all would have accepted to undergo a new test with the same technique if necessary. CONCLUSION: Both conventional and self-swabbing induce low levels of pain for most young healthy volunteers whereas discomfort is very frequent. Nonetheless, both methods are indifferently well-accepted in medical students. Future studies amongst symptomatic subjects are awaited. SIGNIFICANCE: Using the thinnest available swabs, procedural pain induced by nasopharyngeal swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 screening is very low for most subjects and should not limit voluntary participation in screening campaigns. Self-swabbing does not lead to more pain or discomfort compared to conventional swabbing, is well-accepted, and could be proposed to optimize screening campaigns, at least in healthcare professionals.","Moisset, Xavier; Gautier, Nicolas; Godet, Thomas; Parabère, Solène; Pereira, Bruno; Meunier, Estelle; Gerbaud, Laurent; Lesens, Olivier; Henquell, Cécile; Beytout, Jean; Clavelou, Pierre",Eur. j. pain (Lond.),,538

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling. CONCLUSIONS: Informatics tools such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.","Obeid, Jihad S; Davis, Matthew; Turner, Matthew; Meystre, Stephane M; Heider, Paul M; O039,; Bryan, Edward C; Lenert, Leslie A",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,538

504687,Isolated generalized myoclonus immune-mediated by SARS-CoV-2: an illustrative videotaped case,2021,"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a still growing pandemic, causing many deaths and socio-economic damage. Elevated expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to the intensive care unit and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a, and miR-499) were analysed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts, RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Calculating the area under the curve using receiver operating characteristic analysis miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 showed a clear distinction between COVID-19 and Influenza-ARDS patients. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocyte-specific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Importantly, miR profiles were able to differentiate between severely ill, mechanically-ventilated Influenza-ARDS and COVID-19 patients, indicating a rather specific response and cardiac involvement of COVID-19.","Garg, Ankita; Seeliger, Benjamin; Derda, Anselm A; Xiao, Ke; Gietz, Anika; Scherf, Kristian; Sonnenschein, Kristina; Pink, Isabell; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; Bauersachs, Johann; David, Sascha; Bär, Christian; Thum, Thomas",Eur J Heart Fail,,538
504875,"SARS-CoV-2 and Obesity: ""CoVesity""-a Pandemic Within a Pandemic",2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a biosecurity threat, and many resource-rich countries are stockpiling and/or making plans to secure supplies of vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics for their citizens. We review the products that are being investigated for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19; discuss the challenges that countries in sub-Saharan Africa may face with access to COVID-19 vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics due to the limited capacity to manufacture them in Africa; and make recommendations on actions to mitigate these challenges and ensure health security in sub-Saharan Africa during this unprecedented pandemic and future public-health crises. MAIN BODY: Sub-Saharan Africa will not be self-reliant for COVID-19 vaccines when they are developed. It can, however, take advantage of existing initiatives aimed at supporting COVID-19 vaccine access to resource-limited settings such as partnership with AstraZeneca, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation, the Serum Institute of India, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. Accessing effective COVID-19 therapeutics will also be a major challenge for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as production of therapeutics is frequently geared towards profitable Western markets and is ill-adapted to sub-Saharan Africa realities. The region can benefit from pooled procurement of COVID-19 therapy by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with the African Union. If the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients who are severely ill is found to be effective, access to the product will be minimally challenging since the region has a pool of recovered patients and human resources that can man supportive laboratories. The region also needs to drive the local development of rapid-test kits and other diagnostics for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for COVID-19 will be a challenge for sub-Saharan Africans. This challenge should be confronted by collaborating with vaccine developers; pooled procurement of COVID-19 therapeutics; and local development of testing and diagnostic materials. The COVID-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call for sub-Saharan Africa to build vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics manufacturing capacity as one of the resources needed to address public-health crises.","Bright, Bisi; Babalola, Chinedum Peace; Sam-Agudu, Nadia Adjoa; Onyeaghala, Augustine Anayochukwu; Olatunji, Adebola; Aduh, Ufuoma; Sobande, Patrick O; Crowell, Trevor A; Tebeje, Yenew Kebede; Phillip, Sunny; Ndembi, Nicaise; Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin",Global Health,,538

Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach has been used in this research. Why case study? Because it is unique and provides in-depth, unique and invaluable findings. Case studies researchers have contributed to the development of case study research from diverse disciplines. Historical examples of case studies go back as far as the nineteenth century with the biography of Charles Darwin (Stewart, 2014). The dominance of positivism in science in the late 1940 and 1950s in social science sidelined qualitative approaches such as case studies. Although case study research was often criticized for its inability to support generalizations, and thus, provided limited validity and value as a research design (Merriam, 2009;Stewart, 2014), case study research provides intensive analysis of an issue. A Case study is intrinsic, instrumental and collective (Stake, 1995, 2006). Case study research encourages the detailed enquiry of a unit of analysis within its context. Findings: Findings show that current society needs to be educated on the nine aspects of digital citizenship. In the current era, changes are so rapid that every now and then, there must be collaboration and cooperation between different agencies to ensure that the tension between religiosity, cultural norms and ethics would be able to find some common ground.

Studies suggest that older people share more fake news from social media. There is scarce literature that analyse how baby boomers behave in the face of fake news. The purpose of this study is to examine how female baby boomers deal with fake news on Facebook and their available resources to learn how to identify and handle dubious information. A qualitative study and thematic analysis were conducted using information obtained from interviewing female baby boomers. Four themes emerge from the analysis, revealing that participants recognise that they can identify fake news but may not always be able to do so due to limitations in their understanding of an issue or uncertainty about its source.

In an effort to overcome some of these challenges and promote standardized data collection and reporting in clinical studies, the American Society of Hematology Research Collaborative COVID-19 Non-Malignant Hematology Task Force, in collaboration with the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis COVID-19 Task Force, developed sets of data elements in the following domains: venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial thrombosis, bleeding, laboratory investigations, and antithrombotic therapy. Data elements in each of these domains were developed with 3 levels of detail to facilitate their incorporation into studies evaluating a range of interventions and outcomes. Previously published data elements were included where possible. The use of standardized variables in a range of clinical studies can enhance the quality of data collection, create efficiency, enhance comparison of results across studies, and facilitate future pooling of data sets.","Siegal, Deborah M; Barnes, Geoffrey D; Langlois, Nicole J; Lee, Adrienne; Middeldorp, Saskia; Skeith, Leslie; Wood, William A; Le Gal, Grégoire",Blood Adv,,538

However, NIR-HSI has been poorly studied so far, limitedly to the detection of large particles (>300 µm), and its capability for direct characterization of MP in real marine matrices has not been considered yet. In the present study, a rapid near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) method, coupled with a customised normalised difference image (NDI) strategy for data processing, is presented and used to detect MP down to 50 µm in environmental matrices. The proposed method is largely automated, without the need for extensive data processing, and enabled a successful identification of different polymers, both in surface water and mussel soft tissue samples, as well as on real field samples with environmentally occurring MP. NIR-HSI is applied directly on filters, without the need for particles pre-sorting or multiple sample purifications, avoiding time consuming procedures, airborne contaminations, particle degradation and loss. Thanks to the time and cost effectiveness, a large-scale implementation of this method would enable to extensively monitor the MP presence in natural environments for assessing the ecological risk related to MP contamination.","Piarulli, Stefania; Malegori, Cristina; Grasselli, Ferrante; Airoldi, Laura; Prati, Silvia; Mazzeo, Rocco; Sciutto, Giorgia; Oliveri, Paolo",Chemosphere,,538
515710,SARS-COV-2 children transmission: the evidence is that today we do not have enough evidence,2020,"Background: The attendance of nursing students in clinical settings is an inherent element of the nursing education, and it is the same even with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Globally, more than 260 nurses have been killed by the COVID-19 disease and the number is still increasing. Objective: The study assessed nursing students' perception of clinical practice amidst coronavirus pandemic in southwest Nigeria. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that utilized a multistage sampling method to select 300 respondents from the selected nursing institution in southwest Nigeria. The questionnaire is made up of three sections namely, sociodemographic variables, knowledge of COVID-19, and students' perception of clinical practice. Data were collected with Google Form and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: The mean age of the respondents was 22.16 ± 3.11 years and the mean year exposed to clinical practice was 2.73 ± 0.91 years. Majority (71%) had good knowledge of coronavirus, with mean ± standard deviation (SD) 16.16 ± 1.84, while 57.7% had a positive perception of clinical practice during coronavirus pandemic, with a mean ± SD of 3.62 ± 1.22. There was no significant difference between knowledge and perception of clinical practice post coronavirus pandemic, P = 0.088. There is a significant relationship between nursing students' perception of clinical practice with coronavirus and nursing institution (P = 0.001) and level of study (P = 0.001). Conclusion: The study showed that nursing students were willing to continue with their clinical practice even with coronavirus patients in the wards. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

516100,Modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - Impact of lockdowns & interventions,2020,"BACKGROUND: Brazil is the third country most affected by Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), but viral evolution in municipality resolution is still poorly understood in Brazil and it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of viral spread. We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters, including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the value of correlating clinical, epidemiological and genomic information for the understanding of viral evolution and its spatial distribution over time. This is of paramount importance to better inform policy making strategies to fight COVID-19.","Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; de Menezes Mayer, Amanda; Cybis, Gabriela Bettella; Neves, Carla Andretta Moreira; Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Demoliner, Meriane; de Almeida, Paula Rodrigues; Gularte, Juliana Schons; Hansen, Alana Witt; Weber, Matheus Nunes; Fleck, Juliane Deise; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Kmetzsch, Lívia; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",BMC Genomics,,538

METHODS: The data of all patients who were admitted to outpatient clinics at Hisar Intercontinental Hospital or the hospital's online patient portal system between March 11th and May 30th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Of all patients, 545 in outpatient clinics and 25 in online portal system, (17%) were hospitalized for medical treatment, and 53 underwent surgery. There were 1032 patients admitted to Urology Clinics and 104 patients who underwent surgery in the same period of 2019. The pre-operative assessment of patients who were candidates of urological surgery included certain criteria for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of patients included in this study, the median age was 41 years (18-90). The mean hospital stay was 1 day (1-12), and the mean duration of operation was 25 min (3-250). Thirty-seven patients (69.8%) underwent general anesthesia, while only 11(20.8%) underwent combined spinal epidural anesthesia. Four patients (7.5%) required local and only one patient (1.9%) underwent sedo-analgesia. Complications were encountered in six patients (11.4%), urosepsis in two, pneumonia in one, and urinary tract infection in three patients. Compared to last year's numbers, the number of patients admitted to the hospital's outpatient clinic and that of hospitalized patients decreased by 47.2% and 49.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Emergent surgeries in urological practices can be performed safely under routine preoperative testing for COVID-19 and with the use of adequate protective equipment for both the surgical team and the patient.","Cakiroglu, Basri; Kaya, Cevdet; Kilic, Hasan Huseyin; Aksoy, Suleyman Hilmi; Gözüküçük, Ramazan",Urologia,,538

We aimed to investigate workers' dietary changes resulting from the introduction of regulations to combat COVID-19 in a Japanese factory cafeteria. Objective data on daytime dietary intake were automatically collected from electronic purchase system records. The dataset included the weekly data of 890 men from 1 July 2019 to 30 September 2020. The cafeteria regulations came into effect on 10 April 2020; in this context, the purchase of dishes and estimated dietary intake were monitored. The number of cafeteria visits decreased slightly after the introduction of the regulations. The purchase of main and side dishes also decreased, but the purchase of grain dishes was less affected. When compared with summer 2019 (pre-pandemic, no regulations: 1 July to 29 September 2019), in summer 2020 (during the pandemic and with regulations: 29 June to 30 September 2020), the estimated mean grain, meat, fish, and total energy intake was stable; however, vegetable intake decreased by 11%.

The factors that influence individual behavioral response thus warrants a close examination. Using survey data for respondents from 10 states merged with state-level data, our study represents a pioneering effort to reveal contextual and individual social capital factors that explain public mask wearing in response to COVID-19. Findings of logistic multilevel regression show that the COVID-19 death rate and political control of government at the state level along with one's social capital at the individual level altogether influence whether people decide to wear face masks. These findings contribute to the rapidly growing literature and have policy implications for mitigating the pandemic's devastating impact on the American public.","Hao, Feng; Shao, Wanyun; Huang, Weiwei",Health Place,,538

520762,Frequency of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adults after school reopening,2021,"Liver cancer remains a global health challenge, with an estimated incidence of >1 million cases by 2025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for ~90% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for HCC development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced HCC. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of HCC management at all evolutionary stages.","Llovet, Josep M; Kelley, Robin Kate; Villanueva, Augusto; Singal, Amit G; Pikarsky, Eli; Roayaie, Sasan; Lencioni, Riccardo; Koike, Kazuhiko; Zucman-Rossi, Jessica; Finn, Richard S",Nat Rev Dis Primers,,538

We evaluated CoV and pneumococcal co-detection by sex in childhood pneumonia. METHODS: In the 2011-2014 Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs and other samples were collected from 3981 children <5 years hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia in 7 countries. Severity by NP/OP detection status of CoV (NL63, 229E, OC43 or HKU1) and high-density (&#8805;6.9 log10 copies/mL) pneumococcus (HDSpn) by real-time polymerase chain reaction was assessed by sex using logistic regression adjusted for age and site. RESULTS: There were 43 (1.1%) CoV+/HDSpn+, 247 CoV+/HDSpn-, 449 CoV-/HDSpn+ and 3149 CoV-/HDSpn- cases with no significant difference in co-detection frequency by sex (range 51.2%-64.0% male, P = 0.06). More CoV+/HDSpn+ pneumonia was very severe compared with other groups for both males (13/22, 59.1% versus range 29.1%-34.7%, P = 0.04) and females (10/21, 47.6% versus 32.5%-43.5%, P = 0.009), but only male CoV+/HDSpn+ required supplemental oxygen more frequently (45.0% versus 20.6%-28.6%, P < 0.001) and had higher mortality (35.0% versus 5.3%-7.1%, P = 0.004) than other groups. For females with CoV+/HDSpn+, supplemental oxygen was 25.0% versus 24.8%-33.3% (P = 0.58) and mortality was 10.0% versus 9.2%-12.9% (P = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Co-detection of endemic CoV and HDSpn was rare in children hospitalized with pneumonia, but associated with higher severity and mortality in males.

590070,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Uptake in a Correctional Setting,2021-04-29,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease spreading rapidly and uncontrollably throughout the world. The critical challenge is the rapid detection of Coronavirus infected people. The available techniques being utilized are body-temperature measurement, along with anterior nasal swab analysis. However, taking nasal swabs and lab testing are complex, intrusive, and require many resources. Furthermore, the lack of test kits to meet the exceeding cases is also a major limitation. The current challenge is to develop some technology to non-intrusively detect the suspected Coronavirus patients through Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL). Another challenge to conduct the research on this area is the difficulty of obtaining the dataset due to a limited number of patients giving their consent to participate in the research study. Looking at the efficacy of AI in healthcare systems, it is a great challenge for the researchers to develop an AI algorithm that can help health professionals and government officials automatically identify and isolate people with Coronavirus symptoms. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method CoVIRNet (COVID Inception-ResNet model), which utilizes the chest X-rays to diagnose the COVID-19 patients automatically. The proposed algorithm has different inception residual blocks that cater to information by using different depths feature maps at different scales, with the various layers. The features are concatenated at each proposed classification block, using the average-pooling layer, and concatenated features are passed to the fully connected layer. The efficient proposed deep-learning blocks used different regularization techniques to minimize the overfitting due to the small COVID-19 dataset. The multiscale features are extracted at different levels of the proposed deep-learning model and then embedded into various machine-learning models to validate the combination of deep-learning and machine-learning models. The proposed CoVIR-Net model achieved 95.7% accuracy, and the CoVIR-Net feature extractor with random-forest classifier produced 97.29% accuracy, which is the highest, as compared to existing state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. The proposed model would be an automatic solution for the assessment and classification of COVID-19. We predict that the proposed method will demonstrate an outstanding performance as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques being used currently.","Almalki, Yassir Edrees; Qayyum, Abdul; Irfan, Muhammad; Haider, Noman; Glowacz, Adam; Alshehri, Fahad Mohammed; Alduraibi, Sharifa K.; Alshamrani, Khalaf; Alkhalik Basha, Mohammad Abd; Alduraibi, Alaa; Saeed, M.

In the first two decades of the 21st century, we have born witness to the emergence of newly recognized coronaviruses that have rapidly spread around the globe, including severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS). We have also experienced the emergence of a novel H1N1 pandemic influenza strain in 2009 that caused substantial morbidity and mortality around the world and has transitioned into a seasonal strain. Although we perhaps most frequently think of viruses when discussing emerging respiratory infections, bacteria have not been left out of the mix, as we have witnessed an increase in the number of infections from Legionella spp. since the organisms’ initial discovery in 1976. Here, we explore the basic epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, and clinical laboratory diagnosis of these four pathogens and emphasize themes in humans’ evolving relationship with our natural environment that have contributed to the infectious burden. Histology alone is rarely diagnostic for these infections, but has been crucial to bettering our understanding of these diseases.

Emergency medical service providers are expected to be in the frontlines during such emergencies. Yet, this system is badly understudied when it comes to its roles and performance during disasters and public health emergencies. This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers’ views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions. METHODS: This study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Three themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences.

Methods: Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, while the cell cycle, LC3 expression, apoptosis, change of mitochondrial potential, Bcl-2 protein expression level and the level of reactive oxygen species were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: As a result of physcion encumbrance, concentration-dependent inhibition of HeLa cell viability and the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle was observed. Activation of the lysosomal system was also revealed, which was expressed by an increased number of lysosomes, autophage vacuoles and increased expression of the LC3 protein, a marker of the autophagy process. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy showed that physcion induced clear changes in cervical cancer cells, especially in the structure of the nucleus and mitochondria, which correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species by the test compound and indicated the induction of the oxidative process. At the same time, the pro-apoptotic effect of physcion was demonstrated, and this mechanism was dependent on the activation of caspases 3/7 and the reduction in Bcl-2 protein expression. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate an antitumor mechanism of action of physcion, based on the induction of oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis.","Trybus, Wojciech; Król, Teodora; Trybus, Ewa; Stachurska, Anna",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440797/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10082029,538

Severe cases quickly progressed with unfavorable outcomes. We aim to investigate the clinical features of COVID-19 and identify the risk factors associated with its progression. Data of confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and healthy participants were collected. Thirty-seven healthy people and 79 confirmed patients, which include 48 severe patients and 31 mild patients, were recruited. COVID-19 patients presented with dysregulated immune response (decreased T, B, and NK cells and increased inflammatory cytokines). Also, they were found to have increased levels of white blood cell, neutrophil count, and D-dimer in severe cases. Moreover, lymphocyte, CD4(+) T cell, CD8(+) T cell, NK cell, and B cell counts were lower in the severe group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CD4(+) cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer were risk factors for severe cases. Both CT score and clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) were associated with disease severity. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis has shown that all these parameters and scores had quite a high predictive value. Immune dysfunction plays critical roles in disease progression.

A substantial percentage of COVID‐19‐infected individuals in specific health categories have been virtually asymptomatic, several other individuals in the same health categories have exhibited several unusual symptoms, and yet other individuals in the same health categories have fatal outcomes. It is now hypothesized that these differences in mortality rates and symptoms could be caused by a SARS‐CoV‐2 virus infection acting together with one or more latent pathogen infections in certain patients, through mutually beneficial induced immune cell dysfunctions, including T‐cell exhaustion. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which infects approximately one third of the global human population. Furthermore, certain infections and cancers that cause T‐cell exhaustion can also explain the more severe outcomes of other COVID‐19 patients having several disease and cancer comorbidities.","Roe, Kevin",J Neurosci Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288064/,538

Disparities in vaccine hesitancy between non-Hispanic Whites and minoritized groups have been observed, warranting exploration into the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Arab Americans. METHODS: Data from the Survey of Arab Health in America (SAHA) (n = 638), collected between May 2020 and September 2020, were analyzed to determine predictors for vaccine intention among Arab Americans. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models were performed to determine the relationship between sociodemographic, immigration, acculturation, and COVID-19 risk variables and vaccine intention. RESULTS: More than half (56.7%) of respondents reported an intention to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, 35.7% reported uncertainty, and 7.5% reported being unlikely to receive a vaccine. Of those unlikely to receive the vaccine, 72.9% were women and 85.4% reported moderate to high religiosity (p < 0.01).

However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used. OBJECTIVES: To develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets. STUDY DESIGN: The multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. RESULTS: The multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays. Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively. Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples. Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected.

However, there is a lack of evidence specific to the low/lower-middle-income country (L-LMIC) health systems on how IHSD is used during disease outbreaks. This scoping review aimed to synthesise the emerging evidence on IHSD approaches adopted in L-LMIC during the COVID-19 pandemic and systematically collate their operational features. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, published in English between 1 December 2019 and 12 June 2020, from seven electronic databases was conducted to explore the evidence of IHSD implemented in L-LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were systematically charted, and key features of IHSD systems were presented according to the postulated research questions of the review. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 1487 published articles from which 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and included in this review. Service delivery, health workforce, medicine and technologies were the three most frequently integrated health system building blocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. While responding to COVID-19, the L-LMICs principally implemented the IHSD system via systematic horizontal integration, led by specific policy measures. The government’s stewardship, along with the decentralised decision-making capacity of local institutions and multisectoral collaboration, was the critical facilitator for IHSD. Simultaneously, fragmented service delivery structures, fragile supply chain, inadequate diagnostic capacity and insufficient workforce were key barriers towards integration. CONCLUSION: A wide array of context-specific IHSD approaches were operationalised in L-LMICs during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging recommendations emphasise the importance of coordination and integration across building blocks and levels of the health system, supported by a responsive governance structure and stakeholder engagement strategies. Future reviews can revisit this emerging evidence base at subsequent phases of COVID-19 response and recovery in L-LMICs to understand how the approaches highlighted here evolve.","Hasan, Md Zabir; Neill, Rachel; Das, Priyanka; Venugopal, Vasuki; Arora, Dinesh; Bishai, David; Jain, Nishant; Gupta, Shivam",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135071/,538

Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital-droplet PCR was compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat-treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow.

RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. SUMMARY: Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.","Taylor, Steven",Curr Psychiatry Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660068/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01226-y,538
599036,The potential use of microRNAs as a therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-07-19,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been a severe health issue affecting the respiratory system and spreads very fast from one human to other overall countries. For controlling such disease, limited diagnostics techniques are utilized to identify COVID‐19 patients, which are not effective. The above complex circumstances need to detect suspected COVID‐19 patients based on routine techniques like chest X‐Rays or CT scan analysis immediately through computerized diagnosis systems such as mass detection, segmentation, and classification. In this paper, regional deep learning approaches are used to detect infected areas by the lungs' coronavirus. For mass segmentation of the infected region, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to identify the specific infected area and classify it into COVID‐19 or Non‐COVID‐19 patients with a full‐resolution convolutional network (FrCN). The proposed model is experimented with based on detection, segmentation, and classification using a trained and tested COVID‐19 patient dataset. The evaluation results are generated using a fourfold cross‐validation test with several technical terms such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Jaccard (Jac.), Dice (F1‐score), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), Overall accuracy, etc. The comparative performance of classification accuracy is evaluated on both with and without mass segmentation validated test dataset.","Bhuyan, Hemanta Kumar; Chakraborty, Chinmay; Shelke, Yogesh; Pani, Suvendu Kumar",Expert Syst,https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511691/,538

However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can integrate into host genome needs thorough investigation. Here, we performed both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole genome sequencing on SARS-CoV-2 infected human and monkey cells, and investigated the presence of host-virus chimeric events. Through RNA-seq, we did detect the chimeric host-virus reads in the infected cells. But further analysis using mixed libraries of infected cells and uninfected zebrafish embryos demonstrated that these reads are falsely generated during library construction. In support, whole genome sequencing also didn’t identify the existence of chimeric reads in their corresponding regions. Therefore, the evidence for SARS-CoV-2’s integration into host genome is lacking. One-Sentence Summary SARS-CoV-2 does not integrate into host genome through whole genome sequencing.","Chen, Yu-Sheng; Lu, Shuaiyao; Zhang, Bing; Du, Tingfu; Li, Wen-Jie; Lei, Meng; Zhou, Yanan; Zhang, Yong; Liu, Penghui; Sun, Yong-Qiao; Zhao, Yong-Liang; Yang, Ying; Peng, Xiaozhong; Yang, Yun-Gui",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.06.447293,538

Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV + PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-κB activation. Collectively, these results indicate that PR could exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in piglets infected with PEDV and have the potential to be an effective antiviral feed additive.","Wu, Mengjun; Zhang, Qian; Yi, Dan; Wu, Tao; Chen, Hongbo; Guo, Shuangshuang; Li, Siyuan; Ji, Changzheng; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Di; Hou, Yongqing; Wu, Guoyao",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32174911/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00169,538

Yet, SCD is often an area which dentists and dental care professionals only encounter via referral or directly within a secondary care or community dental setting. At undergraduate level, though a listed aspect of the GDC's curriculum, experiences within special care departments are often limited. Additionally, with other specialties such as restorative dentistry taking precedence, there is a risk of SCD being viewed as an adjunct to the main curriculum. Despite this, lessons learned from SCD are key to understanding the holistic patient-centred experience. It is an opportunity to combine advanced clinical knowledge with patient management, which all dental professionals should possess in order to fulfil our duty of care for all. The aim of this article is to explore the lack of exposure to SCD in undergraduates, and highlight the reasons behind the management of patients with additional needs being an essential part of the undergraduate curriculum and beyond. The article also explores the importance of SCD in treating patients in an increasingly diverse society, particularly for those with complications related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","Britton, Jada; Bradley, Natalie",Br Dent J,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-021-3465-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34561583/,538

Fifteen active and previously resistance-trained males (age: 21 ± 1 years, body fat: 14.2 ± 2.7%) participated in this randomized, single-blind, crossover study. Participants performed an evening lower-body RE bout and were provided with 0.4 g/kg/LBM of whey protein (WP) supplement post-RE. A single dose of 0.6 g/kg/LBM of CP, 0.4 g/kg/LBM of CP and 0.2 g/kg/LBM WP (BLEND), or CTRL was consumed 30 min prior to sleep. Measurements of perceived recovery (visual analogue scales (VAS) for recovery, soreness, and fatigue), appetite (VAS for hunger, satiety, and desire to eat), as well as pressure-pain threshold (dolorimeter), average power, and peak torque (isokinetic dynamometry) of the right thigh muscles were assessed the following morning. Main effects of time were seen for all recovery variables (perceived recovery: F(2,28) = 96.753, p < 0.001, h(p)(2) = 0.874; perceived fatigue: F(2,28) = 76.775, p < 0.001; h(p)(2) = 0.846; perceived soreness: F(2,28) = 111.967, p < 0.001; h(p)(2) = 0.889). A main effect of supplement was only seen for perceived recovery (F(2,28) = 4.869; p = 0.015; h(p)(2) = 0.258), with recovery being 6.10 ± 2.58 mm greater in CP vs. BLEND (p = 0.033) and 7.51 ± 2.28 mm greater in CP than CTRL (p = 0.005). No main effects of supplement were seen in measures of perceived soreness, or fatigue (F(2,28) ≤ 2.291; p > 0.120; h(p)(2) ≤ 0.141). No differences between supplements were found in perceived next-morning hunger (p = 0.06), satiety (p ≥ 0.227), or desire to eat (p = 0.528). Main effects of supplement were seen between BLEND and CP vs. CTRL for measures of pain-pressure threshold at the rectus femoris (F(2,28) = 9.377; p = 0.001; h(p)(2) = 0.401), the vastus lateralis (F(2,28) = 10.887; p < 0.001; h(p)(2) = 0.437), and the vastus medialis (F(2,28) = 12.113, p < 0.001; h(p)(2) = 0.464). Values of peak torque and average power were similar between all supplement groups at 60°/sec (F(1.309,18.327) ≤ 1.994; p ≥ 0.173; h(p)(2) ≤ 0.125), 180°/s (F(2,28) ≤ 1.221; p ≥ 0.310; h(p)(2) ≤ 0.080), and 300°/sec (F(2,28) ≤ 2.854; p ≥ 0.074; h(p)(2) ≤ 0.169). Pre-sleep consumption of CP and BLEND at a dose relative to LBM may enhance perceived overnight recovery to a greater extent than CTRL as a result of less muscle soreness the following morning after an acute evening RE bout.","Costa, Juliana V.; Michel, J.

In-person interviews are typical, but virtual interviews present a potentially appealing alternative. Candidate and PD expectations and perceptions of virtual interviews during the 2020/2021 orthopaedic surgery application cycle were assessed. METHODS: Candidates and PDs were surveyed electronically. Questions covered pre–virtual-interview and post–virtual-interview expectations and perceptions, and past in-person experiences (PDs and reapplicants) on the relative importance of application components, ability to assess fit, interview costs, and preferred interview mode. Identical questions allowed between-group comparisons. RESULTS: Responses included n = 29 PDs and n = 99 candidates. PDs reported diminished ability to assess candidate fit; social, clinical, and surgical skills; and genuine interest in the virtual context (each p ≤ 0.01). They placed greater importance on research and less on the interview in the virtual vs. in-person context (each p = 0.02). Most candidates (78%) reported fair/good ability to demonstrate potential and were better able to assess research opportunities than expected (p < 0.01). Candidates expected virtual interviews to increase the importance of research, transcripts, and recommendations (for each, p ≤ 0.02) and decrease the importance of the interview itself (p < 0.01). Compared with PDs, candidates overvalued research, United States Medical Licensing Examination scores, transcripts, and recommendations (each p ≤ 0.02) and may have slightly undervalued the virtual interview (p = 0.08). Most candidates (81%) and PDs (79%) preferred in-person interviews, despite both groups reporting monetary savings. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cost savings associated with virtual interviews, orthopaedic surgery residency PDs and candidates identified reduced abilities to assess candidate or program fit and displayed a preference for in-person interviews.","Brueggeman, David A.; Via, Garrhett G.; Froehle, Andrew W.; Krishnamurthy, Anil B.",JB JS Open Access,https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.oa.21.00034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386687/,538

Therefore, the computational biology carrying this virus that correlates with the human population urgently needs to be understood. In this paper, the classification of the human protein sequences of COVID-19, according to the country, is presented based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed model is based on distinguishing 9238 sequences using three stages, including data preprocessing, data labeling, and classification. In the first stage, data preprocessing’s function converts the amino acids of COVID-19 protein sequences into eight groups of numbers based on the amino acids’ volume and dipole. It is based on the conjoint triad (CT) method. In the second stage, there are two methods for labeling data from 27 countries from 0 to 26. The first method is based on selecting one number for each country according to the code numbers of countries, while the second method is based on binary elements for each country. According to their countries, machine learning algorithms are used to discover different COVID-19 protein sequences in the last stage. The obtained results demonstrate 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 90% specificity via the country-based binary labeling method with a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Furthermore, with significant infection data, the USA is more prone to correct classification compared to other countries with fewer data. The unbalanced data for COVID-19 protein sequences is considered a major issue, especially as the US’s available data represents 76% of a total of 9238 sequences. The proposed model will act as a prediction tool for the COVID-19 protein sequences in different countries.

The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with the cause of death in hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study; deidentified discharge summaries of deceased patients were reviewed by two intensivists and classified as coronavirus disease 2019–related (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) or coronavirus disease 2019–unrelated (not caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or indeterminate) deaths. For classification disagreement, a separate group of three intensivists reviewed the discharge summaries and arbitrated to determine the cause of death. SETTING: Single-center study performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch. PATIENTS: All adult patients (> 18 yr) admitted from March 10, 2020, to October 22, 2020, with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results who expired during their hospitalization were identified. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient demographics, comorbidities, prescribed medications, and ventilatory support data were collected. Comparison between groups was performed using t test and chi-square test. During the study period, 1,052 patients were admitted within 14 days of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–positive test results, of whom 100 expired during the hospitalization.

It is the authors’ anecdotal experience that RPE may, however, inadvertently interfere with verbal communication between critical care staff. The literature pertaining to the effects of RPE wear on verbal communication was therefore reviewed. A literature search returned 98 articles, and 4 records were identified from other sources; after screening for content relevancy, 15 experimental studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Previous studies in both healthcare and other occupational settings suggest a detrimental impact on speech intelligibility, varying according to RPE type and test conditions. The effects of background noise and potential for increased cognitive load through compensatory behaviours are also identified. The clinical significance of these effects remains uncertain though, as evidence measuring clinical outcomes or errors is lacking.

Children may possess an immunity that adults lack, possibly from childhood vaccinations. This retrospective study suggests immunization against the poliovirus may provide an immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Publicly available data were analyzed for possible correlations between national median ages and epidemiological outbreak patterns across 100 countries. Sera from 204 adults and children, who were immunized with the poliovirus vaccine, were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of polio-immune serum on SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology in cell culture were then evaluated. Results: Analyses of median population age demonstrated a positive correlation between median age and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and death rates. Countries with effective poliovirus immunization protocols and younger populations have fewer and less pathogenic cases of COVID-19. Antibodies to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were found in pediatric sera and in sera from adults recently immunized with polio. Sera from polio-immunized individuals inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cell cultures. These results suggest the anti-D3-pol-antibody, induced by poliovirus vaccination, may provide a similar degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 to adults as to children. Conclusions: Poliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response. Antibodies created by poliovirus vaccination bind the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest proteins other than “spike” proteins may be suitable targets for immunity and vaccine development.","Comunale, Brittany A.; Engineer, Lilly; Jiang, Yong; Andrews, John C.; Liu, Qianna; Ji, Lyuqing; Yurkovich, James T.; Comunale, Roderick A.; Xie, Qiyi",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414206/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.710010,538

For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.","Smith, Anthony C; Thomas, Emma; Snoswell, Centaine L; Haydon, Helen; Mehrotra, Ateev; Clemensen, Jane; Caffery, Liam J",J Telemed Telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20916567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196391/,538

Materials and Methods: A representative sample was drawn from a large transdiagnostic clinical cohort of people with SMI, which was recruited between April 2016 and March 2020. The sample was re-surveyed a few months after the beginning of the restrictions. Descriptive frequency statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data. The free text responses were analysed thematically. Results: 367 participants responded to the survey. Two thirds were receiving support from mental health services with the rest supported in primary care or self-managing. A quarter thought they would need more mental health support in the coming year. Half had needed to used community mental health services during the pandemic and the majority had been able to get support. A minority reported that their mental health had deteriorated but they had either not got the supported they wanted or had not sought help. The biggest service change was the reduction in face-to-face appointments and increasing use of phone and video call support. Nearly half of those using mental health services found this change acceptable or even preferred it; acceptability was influenced by several factors. Participants were more likely to be satisfied with support received when seen in person. Discussion: Although most participants were satisfied with the mental health support they had received, a minority were not. This, couple with findings on future need for mental health support has implications for post pandemic demand on services. Remote care has brought benefits but also risks that it could increase inequalities in access to services.","Newbronner, E.; Spanakis, P.; Wadman, R.; Crosland, S.; Heron, P.; Johnston, G.; Walker, L.; Gilbody, S.; Peckham, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.24.21257694v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.24.21257694,538
605057,"microRNA Heterogeneity, Innate-Immune Defense and the Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Infection—A Commentary",2021-06-18,"INTRODUCTION: The addition of graphic health warnings to cigarette packets can facilitate smoking cessation, primarily through their ability to elicit a negative affective response. Smoking has been linked to COVID-19 mortality, thus making it likely to elicit a strong affective response in smokers. COVID-19-related health warnings (C19HW) may therefore enhance graphic health warnings compared to traditional health warnings (THW). Further, because impulsivity influences smoking behaviors, we also examined whether these affective responses were associated with delay discounting. METHODS: In a between-subjects design, 240 smokers rated the valence and arousal elicited by tobacco packaging that contained either a C19HW or THW (both referring to death). Participants also completed questionnaires to quantify delay discounting, and attitudes towards COVID-19 and smoking (eg, health risks, motivation to quit). RESULTS: There were no differences between the two health warning types on either valence or arousal, nor any secondary outcome variables. There was, however, a significant interaction between health warning type and delay discounting on arousal ratings. Specifically, in smokers who exhibit low delay discounting, C19HWs elicited significantly greater subjective arousal rating than did THWs, whereas there was no significant effect of health warning type on arousal in smokers who exhibited high delay discounting. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in smokers who exhibit low impulsivity (but not high impulsivity) C19HWs may be more arousing than THWs. Future work is required to explore the long-term utility of C19HWs, and to identify the specific mechanism by which delay discounting moderates the efficacy of tobacco health warnings. IMPLICATIONS: The study is the first to explore the impact of COVID-19-related health warnings on cigarette packaging. The results suggest that COVID-19-related warnings elicit a similar level of negative emotional arousal, relative to traditional warnings. However, COVID-19 warnings, specifically, elicit especially strong emotional responses in less impulsive smokers, who report low delay discounting. Therefore, there is preliminary evidence supporting COVID-19 related warnings for tobacco products to aid smoking cessation. Additionally, there is novel evidence that, for some warnings, high impulsiveness may be a factor in reduced warning efficacy, which may explain poorer cessation success in this population.","Brown, Chris R H; Faulkner, Paul",Nicotine Tob Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntab176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468005/,538

605568,The Clinical and Economic Value of a Successful Shutdown During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Germany,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Web-based screening may be suitable for identifying individuals with presymptomatic latent diseases for recruitment to clinical studies, as such people do not often visit hospitals in the presymptomatic stage. The promotion of such online screening studies is critical to their success, although it remains uncertain how the effectiveness of such promotion can differ, depending on the different promotion methods, domains of interest, or countries of implementation. OBJECTIVE: The Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) web study is our ongoing online screening registry to identify individuals with presymptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), aimed at facilitating the clinical trials for AD prevention. Within the first 9 months of its 2019 launch, the J-TRC web study recruited thousands of online participants via multiple methods of promotion, including press releases, newspaper advertisements, web advertisements, or direct email invitations. Here, we aimed to quantitatively evaluate efficacy and cost-effectiveness of each of these multimodal promotion methods. METHODS: We applied the vector-autoregression model to assess the degree of contribution of each type of promotion to the following target metrics: number of daily visitors to the J-TRC website, number of daily registrants to the J-TRC web study, daily rate of registration among visitors, daily rate of eligible participants among registrants, and median age of daily registrants. The average cost-effectiveness for each promotion method was also calculated using the total cost and the coefficients in the vector-autoregression model. RESULTS: During the first 9 months of the reviewed period from October 31, 2019 to June 17, 2020, there were 48,334 website visitors and 4429 registrations (9.16% of 48,334 visitors), of which 3081 (69.56%) were eligible registrations. Initial press release reports and newspaper advertisements had a marked effect on increasing the number of daily visitors and daily registrants. Web advertisements significantly contributed to the increase in daily visitors (P<.001) but not to the daily registrants, and it also lowered the rate of registrations and the median age of daily registrants. Website visitors from the direct email invitation sent to other cognitive registries seem to have registered with the highest reliability. The calculated average cost-effectiveness for the initial press release was US $24.60 per visitor and US $96.10 per registrant, while the calculated average cost-effectiveness for the newspaper advertisements was US $28.60 per visitor and US $227.90 per registrant. CONCLUSIONS: Our multivariate time-series analysis showed that each promotion method had different features in their effect of recruiting participants to the J-TRC web study. Under the advertisement condition settings thus far, newspaper advertisements and initial press releases were the most effective promotion methods, with fair cost-effectiveness that was equivalent to earlier online studies. These results can provide important suggestions for future promotions for the recruitment of presymptomatic participants to AD clinical trials in Japan.","Sato, Kenichiro; Niimi, Yoshiki; Ihara, Ryoko; Suzuki, Kazushi; Toda, Tatsushi; Iwata, Atsushi; Iwatsubo, Takeshi",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/26284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292159/,538
605699,The Care of the Leukemic Patients in Times of SARS-CoV-2,2021-08-03,"Implementation of cleaner production practices (CPP), service quality (SQ) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) is often studied at organizational level. A number of studies on trio have reported it’s significant impact on overall organizational performance and profitability across the globe. However, not much is studied about the individual level micro influence of these constructs on employee engagement (EE), organizational pride (OP), organizational identification (OI) and “desire to have a significant impact through work” (DSIW). Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR on EE, OP, OI and DSIW. Data collected from 320 non-managerial staff members employed at a garments manufacturing company in Pakistan was analyzed using partial least square (PLS) approach. Findings revealed that the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR plays an important role in shaping EE, OP, OI and DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. Further, it is found that the implementation of CPP has a non-significant impact on SQ. Additionally, results of the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) have also confirmed that the implementation of CPP at company level has shown a highest importance and performance amongst all the latent constructs proposed as predictors of DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. These findings are a step forward and unique contribution of this study in the domain of CPP, SQ, CSR, EE, OP, OI and DSIW.","Farooq, Muhammad Shoaib; Salam, Maimoona",J Clean Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071478/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620346497?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620346497,538

The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.","Rodríguez, Virginia; Lagares, Alfredo; Arteaga, Heiser; Mattar, Salim; Ruiz, Luis Carlos",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012819400300003X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012819400300003X,538

Based on the clustering abilities of self-organizing maps we are able to spatially group together countries that are similar according to their coronavirus cases, in this way being able to analyze which countries are behaving similarly and thus can benefit by using similar strategies in dealing with the spread of the virus. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained, that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus. Most of the previous papers dealing with data of the Coronavirus have viewed the problem on temporal aspect, which is also important, but this is mainly concerned with the forecast of the numeric information. However, we believe that the spatial aspect is also important, so in this view the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised self-organizing maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus proposing that strategies for similar countries could be established accordingly.","Melin, Patricia; Monica, Julio Cesar; Sanchez, Daniela; Castillo, Oscar",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303179?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303179; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501376/,538

To date, 47 million individuals have been infected and 1.2 million individuals have died worldwide. Some of the most important coinfections in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are opportunistic invasive fungal infections (OIFIs), which are sometimes not rapidly diagnosed and are often diagnosed after death. Aspergillosis and candidiasis are the most prevalent OIFIs in patients with COVID-19. Mycormycosis, cryptococcosis, and other fungal diseases have also been documented more rarely. This review aimed to summarize factors affecting COVID-19 transmission, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in Iran as well as to review common OIFIs in patients with COVID-19. Immunological factors, underlying diseases, and social, cultural, and environmental factors can affect COVID-19 transmission. There is a need to improve diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for OIFIs and to optimize management procedures so that patients with OIFIs can receive treatment as rapidly as possible. Screening of patients with confirmed COVID-19 for OIFIs at the treating physician’s discretion could enable early OIFI diagnosis, treatment, and mortality reduction.","Zia, Mohammadali; Goli, Mohammad",J Int Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494475/; https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211043413,538

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges in the contexts both of older peoples’ lives, wellbeing, and health, and also within prison settings, and thus it is timely to reflect on the links between older people, prisons, and cities, at a time of ongoing change. Just as there is an extensive body of ongoing research exploring age-friendly cities and communities, there is extensive published research on older people’s experiences of imprisonment, and a growing body of research on ageing in the prison setting. However, these two research and policy fields have evolved largely independently and separately, leading to a lack of visibility of prisons and prisoners within AFCC research and policy and, similarly, the omission of consideration of the relevance of AFCC research and policy to older prisoners and ex-prisoners. Existing checklists and tools for assessing and measuring the age-friendliness of cities and communities may be of limited relevance in the context of prisons and prisoners. This article identifies the potential for integration and for cross-disciplinary research in this context, concluding with recommendations for developing inclusive research, policies, and evaluation frameworks which recognise and include prisons and older prisoners, both during and after incarceration.","Codd, Helen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317095/,538

METHODS: A mannequin was connected to an active lung simulator. The inspiratory and expiratory variations in airways pressure observed with a high simulated effort, were determined relative to the preset CPAP level. NIV was applied in Pressure Support Mode at two simulated respiratory rates and two cycling-off flow thresholds. During the bench study, we measured the variables defining patient-ventilator interaction and performance. RESULTS: During nCPAP, the tested interfaces did not show significant differences in terms of ∆Pawi and ∆Pawe. During NIV, the snorkeling mask demonstrated a better patient-ventilator interaction compared to FFM, as shown by significantly shorter Pressurization Time and Expiratory Trigger Delay (p<0.01), but no significant differences were found in terms of Inspiratory Trigger Delay and Time of Synchrony between the interfaces tested. At RR 20sim, the snorkeling mask presented the lower ΔPtrigger (p<0.01), moreover during all the conditions tested the snorkeling mask showed the longer Pressure Time Product at 200, 300, and 500 ms compared to FFM (p<0.01). A major limitation of snorkeling mask is that during NIV with this interface it is possible to reach maximum 18 cmH(2)O of peak inspiratory pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The modified snorkeling mask can be used as an acceptable alternative to other interfaces for both nCPAP and NIV in emergencies.","Ferrone, Giuliano; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Costa, Roberta; Gullì, Antonio; Scapigliati, Andrea; Antonelli, Massimo; Conti, Giorgio",Pulmonology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531043721001185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531043721001185?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217695/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2021.05.009,538

Chronic patients are highly vulnerable to contracting an infection. Most people recover within a week, but chronic patients can face severe illness or death. The increasing of cases, complications, and mortality demands compulsory preventive measures. Therefore, this study was designed to identify major preventive practices and associated factors. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was employed from November to December 2020 among diabetics and HIV/AIDS follow-up clients in Dessie referral hospital. Data were entered into EpiData manager 4.6.0 version and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Logistic regression analysis was done and an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining the strength of association. RESULTS: Data were collected from 426 participants with a mean age of 46.54 years. The overall poor prevention practice rate of COVID-19 among diabetic and HIV/AIDS follow-up clients was 68.8% 95% CI (64.6–72.8%). Factors significantly associated with poor prevention practice were femaleness (AOR; 1.61; 95% CI; 1.03–2.51), illiterate [AOR; 2.59; 95% CI; 1.33–5.09]), family size greater than four (AOR; 2.06; 95% CI; 1.32–3.23), absence of health professional in the household (AOR; 1.79; 95% CI; 1.13–2.84), not having health insurance (AOR; 1.85; 95% CI; 1.18–2.89) and urban residence (AOR; 0.38; 95% CI; 0.18–0.79). CONCLUSION: The overall proportion of prevention practice towards COVID-19 among diabetic and HIV/AIDS follow-up clients was poor.

The principle is based on existing image-to-image translation approaches, where each pixel in an image is assigned to a class label. We show that established networks architectures can be trained for the task of multiclass face analysis in thermal infrared. Created class annotations consisted of pixel-accurate locations of different face classes. Subsequently, the trained network can segment an acquired unknown infrared face image into the defined classes. Furthermore, face classification in live image acquisition is shown, in order to be able to display the relative temperature in real-time from the learned areas. This allows a pixel-accurate temperature face analysis e.g. for infection detection like Covid-19. At the same time our approach offers the advantage of concentrating on the relevant areas of the face. Areas of the face irrelevant for the relative temperature calculation or accessories such as glasses, masks and jewelry are not considered. A custom database was created to train the network.

609885,Sensitivity evaluation of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR detection kits and strategy to reduce false negative,2020-05-05,"Background: Since December 2019, a pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614,538

Results & Conclusion: 94.4% of 3191 pwMS surveyed indicated they would get a COVID-19 vaccine, while 5.6% would not. PwMS who have previously had an influenza vaccine, increasing age and the perception of having sufficient information about the vaccine were associated with increased likelihood of getting a vaccine. 51.7% of 3191 pwMS completed a follow-up survey indicating they received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The proportion having had the vaccination based on their prior opinions was 53.2% in ‘Yes’ group and 27.0% in ‘No’ group, the latter reflecting a change based on their initial views. More information on COVID-19 vaccine safety in pwMS would be helpful for people to make informed decisions.","Huang, Yun; Rodgers, William J; Middleton, Rodden M; Baheerathan, Aravindhan; Tuite-Dalton, Katherine A; Ford, David V; Nicholas, Richard; Group, MS Register Research",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343866/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103175; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821004429?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821004429,538

Lung ultrasound is able to depict typical pulmonary findings of COVID-19 and is therefore suitable for diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. CLINICAL/METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE: Lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients in the emergency room and intensive care unit. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Computed tomography (low-dose CT) and X‑ray of the lung. METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: Lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients. RECOMMENDATIONS: Lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 offers similar performance as CT and is superior when compared to X‑ray in evaluating pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lung ultrasound plays an important role in the emergency room and intensive care unit. POCUS reduces exposure to radiation, therapy delays, and minimizes transport of high-risk patients. Differential diagnoses can also be clarified.","Schmid, M.; Escher, F.; Clevert, D.-A.",Radiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909049/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00117-020-00747-6,538

Data on patients of European origin affected by COVID-19 are limited. METHODS: All consecutive patients aged ≥18 years, coming from North-East of Milan's province and admitted at San Raffaele Hospital with COVID-19, between February 25th and March 24th, were reported, all patients were followed for at least one month. Clinical and radiological features at admission and predictors of clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 500 patients admitted to the Emergency Unit, 410 patients were hospitalized and analyzed: median age was 65 (IQR 56–75) years, and the majority of patients were males (72.9%). Median (IQR) days from COVID-19 symptoms onset was 8 (5–11) days. At hospital admission, fever (≥ 37.5 °C) was present in 67.5% of patients. Median oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93% (range 60–99), with median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, 267 (IQR 184–314). Median Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score was 9 (IQR 4–16). More than half of the patients (56.3%) had comorbidities, with hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and chronic kidney failure being the most common. The probability of overall survival at day 28 was 66%. Multivariable analysis showed older age, coronary artery disease, cancer, low lymphocyte count and high RALE score as factors independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of COVID-19 patients of European origin, main risk factors for mortality were older age, comorbidities, low lymphocyte count and high RALE.","Fabio, Ciceri; Antonella, Castagna; Patrizia, Rovere-Querini; Francesco, De Cobelli; Annalisa, Ruggeri; Laura, Galli; Caterina, Conte; Rebecca, De Lorenzo; Andrea, Poli; Alberto, Ambrosio; Carlo, Signorelli; Eleonora, Bossi; Maria, Fazio; Cristina, Tresoldi; Sergio, Colombo; Giacomo, Monti; Efgeny, Fominskiy; Stefano, Franchini; Marzia, Spessot; Carlo, Martinenghi; Michele, Carlucci; Luigi, Beretta; Maria, Scandroglio Anna; Massimo, Clementi; Massimo, Locatelli; Moreno, Tresoldi; Paolo, Scarpellini; Gianvito, Martino; Emanuele, Bosi; Lorenzo, Dagna; Adriano, Lazzarin; Giovanni, Landoni; Alberto, Zangrillo",Clin Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620304563?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108509; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661620304563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535188/,538
610498,On fractional approaches to the dynamics of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model including singular and non-singular kernels,2021-07-28,"Epimedium flavonoids inhibit extravascular lipid deposition during prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis. Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of β-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ and β mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of β-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis. Above findings supported desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent for potential prevention of disorders involving lipid metabolism.","Wang, Xin-Luan; Wang, Nan; Zheng, Li-Zhen; Xie, Xin-Hui; Yao, Dong; Liu, Ming-Yan; Yao, Zhi-Hong; Dai, Yi; Zhang, Ge; Yao, Xin-Sheng; Qin, Ling",Eur J Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299913004743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23792141/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299913004743,538

Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H(2)O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO(•) and SO(4)(•−), identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Cl(‒) in real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO(3)(‒), Cl(‒), NO(3)(‒), SO(4)(2‒), Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0–11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO(•) and SO(4)(•)(−) were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased. This study provides a highly efficient process for organic pollutant removal, which could be applied in water treatment.","Wen, Dong; Li, Wentao; Lv, Jinrong; Qiang, Zhimin; Li, Mengkai",J Hazard Mater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121855; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389419318096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32204952/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389419318096,538

612348,Discordant neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic targeting of host-cell factors required for SARS-CoV-2 entry is an alternative strategy to ameliorate COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung epithelium requires the TMPRSS2 cell surface protease. Pre-clinical and correlative data in humans suggest that anti-androgenic therapies can reduce the expression of TMPRSS2 on lung epithelium. Accordingly, we hypothesize that therapeutic targeting of androgen receptor signaling via degarelix, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist, will suppress COVID-19 infection and ameliorate symptom severity. METHODS: This is a randomized phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 198 patients to compare efficacy of degarelix plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care on improving the clinical outcomes of male Veterans who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. Enrolled patients must have documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction result performed on a nasopharyngeal swab and have a severity of illness of level 3–5 (hospitalized but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation). Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and severity are centrally randomized 2:1 (degarelix: placebo). The composite primary endpoint is mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at 15 after randomization. Important secondary endpoints include time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a normal temperature, and the maximum severity of COVID-19 illness. Exploratory analyses aim to assess the association of cytokines, viral load, and various comorbidities with outcome. In addition, TMPRSS2 expression in target tissue and development of anti-viral antibodies will also be investigated. DISCUSSION: In this trial, we repurpose the FDA approved LHRH antagonist degarelix, commonly used for prostate cancer, to suppress TMPRSS2, a host cell surface protease required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The objective is to determine if temporary androgen suppression with a single dose of degarelix improves the clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

613090,Non-permissive SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural cells in the developing human brain and neurospheres,2020-10-09,"Introduction and Aims: The increase in stress levels, social confinement, and addiction's physical consequences play an essential role in the proliferation of drug abuse. In this context, the Covid-19 pandemic produced remarkable effects on those individuals prone to addictions, especially to alcohol. Alcohol is linked to multiple dangerous conditions such as social issues, severe medical conditions, and road accidents. The determination of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in hair is frequently performed to test and monitor chronic excessive alcohol intake conditions, as it allows differentiation among low-risk/moderate drinkers, and excessive/chronic drinkers. Our study aimed to explore hair EtG levels in a controlled population to assess the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on alcohol intake along March-May 2020. Materials and Methods: EtG levels were measured in all hair samples collected in the months following April 2020 to evaluate the behaviors related to alcohol intake along with the time frame from March to May 2020. The measured concentration distributions for each month were compared with those reported in the same month during the previous 4 years (2016–2019). The dataset was built to highlight possible differences between genders, and the different categories of alcohol consumption, separately. Results: The samples collected from April to August 2020 (500 < N <1,100 per month) showed an increase in the percentage of subjects classified as abstinent/low-risk drinkers (from 60 up to 79%) and a decrease of subjects classified as moderate and chronic drinkers (−12 and −7%, respectively) when compared to the previous 4 years. A decrease in the overall mean value of EtG in the period April–June 2020 was observed, while the EtG levels of both June and July 2020 provided an increasing trend for chronic/excessive consumers (+27 and +19% for June and July 2020, respectively). A peculiar rise in the EtG levels of moderate and chronic/excessive female consumers was observed along April–June 2020, too. Discussion and Conclusions: Behavioral and social studies generally report a decrease in alcohol consumption during the Covid-19 lockdown. However, people already suffering from drug or alcohol addictions before Covid-19 pandemic seemingly enhance their harmful behavior. Our data from April to August 2020 are consistent with both suppositions. Our observations confirm once again the utility of EtG to investigate the patterns of alcohol consumption in the population.","Alladio, Eugenio; Visintin, Lia; Lombardo, Tonia; Testi, Roberto; Salomone, Alberto; Vincenti, Marco",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889098/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.632519,538

613954,The mystery of MIS-C post-SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-10-14,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures have been implemented globally. Canadians have been instructed to stay at home, which has likely resulted in significant changes in their physical activity. Using data from a national physical activity tracking app (PAC app), we aimed to determine device-measured physical activity levels immediately prior to and following the implementation of physical distancing measures in Canada to provide evidence for the development of physical activity recommendations for future pandemics or second wave infections. Methods: Demographic and physical activity data were extracted from the ParticipACTION app (PAC app), using a 10-week (10 February to 19 April 2020) quasi-experimental design to determine changes in physical activity 4 weeks pre-pandemic and 6 weeks post-pandemic declaration. Weekly physical activity levels were monitored through wearable fitness trackers and health apps linked to the PAC app, to record moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and steps. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine changes over time (mean ± SE). Findings: A total of 2,338 Canadians who were mostly 35–44 years old (26.6%) and female (90.2%) were included in the analysis. MVPA, LPA, and steps significantly declined immediately following the declaration of the pandemic (MVPA: pre-pandemic: 194.2 ± 5.2 min, post-pandemic: 176.7 ± 5.0 min, p < 0.001; LPA: pre-pandemic: 1,000.5 ± 17.0 min, post-pandemic: 874.1 ± 15.6 min, p < 0.001; steps: pre-pandemic: 48,625 ± 745 steps, post-pandemic: 43,395 ± 705 steps, p < 0.001). However, 6 weeks following pandemic declaration, MVPA (week 6: 204.4 ± 5.4 min, p = 0.498) had returned to pre-pandemic levels. LPA (week 6: 732.0 ± 14.3 min, p = < 0.001) and steps (week 6: 41,946 ± 763, p < 0.001) remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels at week 6. Interpretation: Although MVPA returned to pre-pandemic levels, significant and sustained declines in incidental LPA and steps were observed. Attenuating the loss of incidental physical activity should be a public health priority in response to future pandemics or a second wave of a COVID-19 infection, as it may have significant long-term implications for the physical and mental health of Canadians.","Di Sebastiano, Katie M.; Chulak-Bozzer, Tala; Vanderloo, Leigh M.; Faulkner, Guy",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849110/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01895,538

As a result, testing for COVID‐19 is still considered a vital method to contain infection. For testing to be effective, barriers towards testing intention need to be investigated; and available literature on the challenges are scarce. This study aimed to investigate barriers of COVID‐19 testing among a sample of Jordanian adults and predict testing intention within the context of these barriers. METHODS: A cross‐sectional, descriptive, and predictive design was employed in this study among a sample of 1074 Jordanian adults. RESULTS: Three clusters of barriers predicted testing intention; perceived discrimination at work, concerns of individual's privacy, and having negative feelings towards testing. While perceived discrimination at work and privacy concerns were negatively associated with individuals’ intention for testing, experiencing negative feelings towards COVID‐19 testing was a positive predictor. CONCLUSION: Within the context of the study findings, public health nurses need to promote safety at the workplace, protect an individual's privacy, and eliminate negative feelings towards testing uptake through the provision of accurate and up‐to‐date information regarding the COVID‐19 disease.","Shahrour, Ghada; Jaradat, Diana; Dardas, Latefa Ali",Public Health Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313354/; https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12950,538

Il existe peu de données concernant le risque d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 chez ces patients. Matériel et méthodes Nous avons voulu évaluer la fréquence des formes graves de COVID-19 (hospitalisation ou décès) chez nos patients psoriasiques sous TSB, et plus particulièrement dans les 4 mois suivant leur initiation. Étude multicentrique nationale transversale, incluant les patients adultes, sous TSB pour du psoriasis, vus en consultation ou téléconsultation entre le 27 avril et le 7 mai 2020. Étaient colligés : sexe, âge, traitement, période de traitement (initiation : 4 premiers mois ou entretien), poursuite ou non au cours de l’épidémie, comorbidités exposant à une forme grave de COVID (obésité, HTA, diabète), présence depuis le début de l’épidémie d’un tableau clinique de COVID, confirmation le cas échéant par PCR et hospitalisation. Résultats Un total de 1418 patients étaient inclus dont les caractéristiques sont précisées dans le tableau. 22,4 % des patients sous traitement systémique et 13,8 % de ceux sous biologique ont arrêté leur traitement au cours de l’épidémie. Cinq patients ont été hospitalisés pour un tableau de COVID-19 : une femme de 27 ans, obèse et atteinte d’une maladie de Crohn sous adalimumab, un homme de 36 ans sous guselkumab, un homme de 53 ans sous méthotrexate, dont 2 patients en réanimation : une femme de 71 ans, obèse sous méthotrexate et étanercept, un homme de 34 ans obèse sous ustékinumab. Aucun décès n’était rapporté. La fréquence des cas selon le traitement est précisée dans le tableau 2. Discussion Dans notre étude, 0,35 % des patients ont présenté une forme grave de COVID-19 nécessitant une hospitalisation, dont 60 % présentait d’autres facteurs de risque de forme grave. Deux patients ont été hospitalisés en début d’épidémie car le TSB était alors considéré comme à risque de forme grave de COVID-19. Nos données sont similaires aux données italiennes, ne trouvant pas sur-risque d’hospitalisation en réanimation et décès chez les patients sous traitement biologique pour du psoriasis par rapport à la population générale.

615357,Humoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2: Comparative Clinical Performance of Seven Commercial Serology Tests,2020-08-18,"Background COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and – importantly – some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% - 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year’s flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted.

615422,Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide,2020-09-12,"The changing spatiotemporal patterns of the individual susceptible-infected-symptomatic-treated-recovered epidemic process and the interactions of information/material flows between regions, along with the 2002–2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemiological investigation data in mainland China, including three typical locations of individuals (working unit/home address, onset location and reporting unit), are used to define the in-out flow of the SARS epidemic spread. Moreover, the input/output transmission networks of the SARS epidemic are built according to the definition of in-out flow. The spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic parameters, and the structural characteristics of the SARS transmission networks are comprehensively and systematically explored. The results show that (1) Beijing and Guangdong had the highest risk of self-spread and output cases, and prevention/control measures directed toward self-spread cases in Beijing should have focused on the later period of the SARS epidemic; (2) the SARS transmission networks in mainland China had significant clustering characteristics, with two clustering areas of output cases centered in Beijing and Guangdong; (3) Guangdong was the original source of the SARS epidemic, and while the infected cases of most other provinces occurred mainly during the early period, there was no significant spread to the surrounding provinces; in contrast, although the input/output interactions between Beijing and the other provinces countrywide began during the mid-late epidemic period, SARS in Beijing showed a significant capacity for spatial spreading; (4) Guangdong had a significant range of spatial spreading throughout the entire epidemic period, while Beijing and its surrounding provinces formed a separate, significant range of high-risk spreading during the mid-late period; especially in late period, the influence range of Beijing’s neighboring provinces, such as Hebei, was even slightly larger than that of Beijing; and (5) the input network had a low-intensity spread capacity and middle-level influence range, while the output network had an extensive high-intensity spread capacity and influence range that covered almost the entire country, and this spread and influence indicated that significant clustering characteristics increased gradually. This analysis of the epidemic in-out flow and its corresponding transmission network helps reveal the potential spatiotemporal characteristics and evolvement mechanism of the SARS epidemic and provides more effective theoretical support for prevention and control measures.","Hu, BiSong; Gong, JianHua; Sun, Jun; Zhou, JiePing",Chin Sci Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214741/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5501-8,538
616795,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protective immunity and limits transmission in Syrian hamsters,2021-02-11,"INTRODUCTION: After a vaccination, patients frequently have clinical symptoms of pain and swelling over the injection area which usually resolve 2–3 days after the injection. If the symptoms do not improve, a shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) will be considered, perhaps related to an improper injection technique. Herein we report our first case of a SIRVA after a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccination which occurred due to deep penetration and direction of the needle. The clinical symptoms of the patient improved after treatment with combined oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a short course of intravenous antibiotic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Thai male without prior shoulder pain had a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccination at his right shoulder. The injection was given by a nurse using a 27-gauge needle, 1.5 inches in length. The injection landmark was 3 finger breadths below the midlateral edge of the acromial process. The direction of the needle was 45° to the skin cephalad. Three days after receiving the vaccine the patient began to have right shoulder pain with limited range of motion and acute fever. He was admitted for medical treatment which his clinical symptoms gradually improved. CONCLUSION: We report a case of subacromial-subcoracoid-subdeltoid bursitis following a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine injection. This condition is rare, and usually related to an incorrect vaccination technique. To avoid this complication, nurses should identify the correct landmark, use an appropriate needle length, and point the needle in the correct direction.","Chuaychoosakoon, Chaiwat; Parinyakhup, Wachiraphan; Tanutit, Pramot; Maliwankul, Korakot; Klabklay, Prapakorn",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121005720?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336204/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121005720; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102622,538

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serological testing in COVID‐19 by providing summary sensitivity and specificity estimates with time from symptom onset. METHODS: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PubMed was performed up to May 13, 2020. All English language, original peer‐reviewed publications reporting the diagnostic performance of serological testing vis‐à‐vis virologically confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were included. RESULTS: Our search yielded 599 unique publications. A total of 39 publications reporting 11 516 samples from 8872 human participants met eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study. Pooled percentages of IgM and IgG seroconversion by Day 7, 14, 21, 28 and after Day 28 were 37.5%, 73.3%, 81.3%, 72.3% and 73.3%, and 35.4%, 80.6%, 93.3%, 84.4% and 98.9%, respectively. By Day 21, summary estimate of IgM sensitivity was 0.872 (95% CI: 0.784‐0.928) and specificity 0.973 (95% CI: 0.938‐0.988), while IgG sensitivity was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.823‐0.959) and specificity 0.960 (95% CI: 0.919‐0.980). On meta‐regression, IgM and IgG test accuracy was significantly higher at Day 14 using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Serological assays offer imperfect sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Estimates of population seroprevalence during or shortly after an outbreak will need to adjust for the delay between infection, symptom onset and seroconversion.","Zhang, John J.

A rapid, highly sensitive, specific, and simple operational method was needed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established a real-time reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay (RT-RAA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly. The primers and probe were designed based on the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The detection limit was 10 copies per reaction in this assay, which could be conducted within 15 min at a constant temperature (39 °C), without any cross-reactions with other respiratory tract pathogens, such as other coronaviruses. Furthermore, compared with commercial real-time RT-PCR assay, it showed a kappa value of 0.959 (p < 0.001) from 150 clinical specimens. These results indicated that this real-time RT-RAA assay may be a valuable tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2.","Wu, Tao; Ge, Yiyue; Zhao, Kangchen; Zhu, Xiaojuan; Chen, Yin; Wu, Bin; Zhu, Fengcai; Zhu, Baoli; Cui, Lunbiao",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682220301331; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682220301331?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758712/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.07.006,538

As a special category of the population, pregnant women are vulnerable during emergencies. This study was designed to explore whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced maternal and infant outcomes. We collected maternal characteristics, laboratory results, condition in the third trimester, maternal outcome, fetal or neonatal outcomes, and characteristics of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and placenta from pregnant women and fetals or newborns in the first affiliated hospital of Jinan university from 24 January to 31 March 2020 (peak period), chose the same types of data at the hospital during the same period in 2019 and 1 January—23 January 2020 (prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020) as a control. Our study focused on uncomplicated singleton pregnancies among women not infected by COVID-19. The results demonstrated that there was not an increase in adverse outcomes of pregnant women and newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; This might be associated with the updated design of major epidemic prevention and control systems in Guangzhou, and the extension of pregnant women’s rest time during the third trimester of pregnancy. Nevertheless, the survey showed an increased incidence rate of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and zinc deficiency in newborns during the epidemic, implying that pregnant women should participate in appropriate physical exercise, increase their exposure to outdoor sunlight and improve nutrition intake to ensure healthy newborns during the quarantine period.

We review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs. The acquisition of novel traits, including lethality to waterfowl, ferrets, felids, and humans, indicates an expanding host range. The natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations cocirculating in ducks contributes to the spread of H5N1 in Asia. Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.","Webster, Robert G.; Peiris, Malik; Chen, Honglin; Guan, Yi",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16494709/,538

The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

The aim of this study was to describe the side effects reported by vaccinated individuals in Jordan. A cross-sectional survey was used to recruit responses from participants who were vaccinated with either one dose or both doses of any of the administered vaccines in Jordan (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Sinopharm). A total of 1,086 participants were enrolled in the study. Most of participants have not been infected with SARS CoV2 before receiving the vaccine (77.2%). Larger proportion of the study population received Pfizer vaccine (40.6%) followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (33.0%), and Sinopharm vaccine (26.4%). Side effects after receiving the first dose of the vaccine were reported by most participants (89.9%) and included pain at the injection site (78.4%), fatigue (51.8%), myalgia (37.6%), headache (33.1%), and chills (32.3%). To a lesser extent, there were gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea (15.1%), loss of appetite (9.4%), and diarrhea (6.4%). More side effects were significantly associated with AstraZeneca vaccine (P < .001). Only one case for each of second dose of Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccines reported that their side effects required hospitalization. In this study, we found that people in Jordan experienced more side effects with AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Pfizer vaccine and the least one is Sinopharm vaccine. Our study showed that these side effects are not severe and should not be an obstacle against the successful control of the pandemic in Jordan.","Omeish, Haya; Najadat, Angam; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Tarabin, Nada; Abu Hameed, Amer; Al-Gallab, Neebal; Abbas, Hadeel; Rababah, Lana; Rabadi, Majd; Karasneh, Reema; Aldeyab, Mamoon A",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1981086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34614383/,538

Lung biology interfaces with inhaler performance to allow optimal delivery of therapeutic agent for disease treatment. Inhalation aerosol products consist of the therapeutic agent, formulation, and device. The manufacturing specifications on each of the components, and their combination, allow accurate and reproducible control of measures of quality and in-vitro performance. These product variables in combination with patient variables, including co-ordination skill during inhaler use, intrinsic lung biology, disease and consequent pulmonary function, contribute to drug safety and efficacy outcomes. Due to the complexity of pulmonary drug delivery, predicting biological outcomes from first principles has been challenging. Ongoing research appears to offer new insights that may allow accurate prediction of drug behavior in the lungs. Disruptive innovations were characteristic of research and development in inhaled drug delivery at the end of the last century. Although there were relatively few new inhaled products launched in the first decade of the new millennium it was evident that the earlier years of exploration resulted in maturation of commercially successful technologies. A significant increase in new and generic products has occurred in the last decade and technical, regulatory and disease management trends are emerging. Some of these developments can trace their origins to earlier periods of creativity in the field while others are a reflection of advances in other areas of basic and computer sciences and engineering.

AGI-10 impinger was used as the representative for all the impingers which would bubble during operation. It was found that the survival probability of the same bacteriophage bubbling with different sampling solutions was different except that there was no significant difference observed for the bacteriophage F2. The use of SM as the collection fluid was relative to a high survival probability for the four bacteriophages. And the endurance or resistance of different kinds of bacteriophages in the same sampling solution was different. We conclude that SM is a promising sampling solution for liquid impingers in the process of sampling phages.","Yu, Long; Wen, Zhanbo; Li, Jinsong; Yang, Wenhui; Wang, Jie; Li, Na; Lu, Jianchun",Aerobiologia (Bologna),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10453-009-9144-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214625/,538

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing MCPs with an age- and gender-matched mirror group in Florida from April 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. METHODS: A total of 38,193 MCPs in a Florida primary care group were monitored for COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. The highest-risk patients were managed by the medical group's COVID-19 Task Force. As part of a population health program, the COVID-19 Task Force contacted patients, conducted medical encounters, and tracked data including comorbidities and medical outcomes. The MCPs enrolled in the medical group were compared with a mirror group from the state of Florida. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age among the MCPs was 67.9 (15.2) years, and 60% were female. Older age and hypertension were the most important factors in predicting COVID-19. Obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) were linked to higher rates of hospitalizations. Patients prescribed off-label outpatient medications had 73% lower likelihood of hospitalization (P < .05). Compared with the mirror group, MCPs had 60% lower COVID-19 mortality (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: MCPs have risk factors similar to the general population for COVID-19 incidence and progression, including older age, hypertension, obesity, CHF, and CKD. Outpatient treatment with off-label medicines decreased hospitalizations.

A prompt identification of mental signs and symptoms is important for preventing mental disorders in the public. This study examined whether local public have adequate knowledge to identify mental health symptoms and the need to get timely professional help. METHODS: The population-based telephone surveys were conducted in 2015 and 2018. It involved a random sample of 4033 respondents aged 12–75 years. Mental health knowledge and help seeking attitude were assessed using six vignettes depicting subtle and obvious symptoms of anxiety disorders, mixed anxiety and depressive disorders, and dementia. Logistic regression models were performed to examine association between mental health knowledge and help-seeking attitude. RESULTS: Individuals with poor knowledge in subtle symptoms were more likely to be males (t = − 5.0, p < .001), younger (F = 15.0, p < .001), have tertiary education (F = 15.0, p < .001), and employed (t = − 2.1, p = .037). The knowledge scores of subtle and obvious symptoms were 1.5 and 2.3 respectively. Binary logistic regression found that poor knowledge of subtle symptoms was associated with reluctance to professional help seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly identified subtle mental health symptoms is a major barrier to early professional help in highly educated working males.

In this pandemic situation and absence of known drugs and vaccines against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), there is an urgent need for the repurposing of the existing drugs against it. So, here we have examined a safe and cheap alternative against this virus by screening hundreds of nutraceuticals compounds against known therapeutic targets of SARS-COV-2 by molecular docking. The virtual screening results were then analyzed for binding energy and interactive residues and compared with some already known hits in the best binding pose.

In this multicentric, retrospective, observational research the aim was to evaluate the impact of teicoplanin on the course of COVID‐19 in critically ill patients. Fifty‐five patients with severe COVID‐19, hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICUs) and treated with best available therapy were retrospectively analysed. Among them 34 patients were also treated with teicoplanin (Tei‐COVID group), while 21 without teicoplanin (control group). Crude in‐hospital Day‐30 mortality was lower in Tei‐COVID group (35.2%) than in control group (42.8%), however not reaching statistical significance (p = .654). No statistically significant differences in length of stay in the ICU were observed between Tei‐COVID group and control group (p = .248). On Day 14 from the ICU hospitalization, viral clearance was achieved in 64.7% patients of Tei‐COVID group and 57.1% of control group, without statistical difference. Serum C‐reactive protein level was significantly reduced in Tei‐COVID group compared to control group, but not other biochemical parameters. Finally, Gram‐positive were the causative pathogens for 25% of BSIs in Tei‐COVID group and for 70.6% in controls. No side effects related to teicoplanin use were observed.

In particular, aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, have significantly higher risks of hospitalization and death than normal individuals. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), belonging to the RAS family, has received much attention during this COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry. Additionally, the RAS greatly affects energy metabolism in certain pathological conditions, including cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, and viral infections. This article discusses the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the RAS and energy metabolism in individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus.

METHODS: Sixty medical and nursing interns in the medical oncology department of our hospital were selected between January 2019 and December 2020. Thirty students received traditional LBL instruction as the control group, and 30 students received combined seminars and CBL instruction as the observation group. The teaching evaluation and assessment was performed by theoretical and practical examinations and questionnaires. RESULTS: In the after-class examination, case analysis, clinical practice and overall scores of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (all p < 0.001). Theoretical knowledge scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.470). In the questionnaire regarding attitudes towards opioid use, the observation group had better perceptions of using opioids than the control group (all p < 0.01). In the meantime, students in the observation group outperformed the control group in four aspects: self-learning (p < 0.001), analytical and problem-solving (p < 0.001), clinical thinking (p = 0.001), and clinical practice (p = 0.002) abilities all improved, while stimulating learning interest (p = 0.184) and enhancing theoretical knowledge mastery (p = 0.221) were not significantly different from those of the control group.

633676,"Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2",2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND: The presence of coronaviruses on surfaces in the patient environment is a potential source of indirect transmission. Manual cleaning and disinfection measures do not always achieve sufficient removal of surface contamination. This increases the importance of automated solutions in the context of final disinfection of rooms in the hospital setting. Ozone is a highly effective disinfectant which, combined with high humidity, is an effective agent against respiratory viruses. Current devices allow continuous nebulization for high room humidity as well as ozone production without any consumables. AIM: In the following study, the effectiveness of a fully automatic room decontamination system based on ozone was tested against bacteriophage Φ6 (phi 6) and bovine coronavirus L9, as surrogate viruses for the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: For this purpose, various surfaces (ceramic tile, stainless steel surface and furniture board) were soiled with the surrogate viruses and placed at two different levels in a gas-tight test room. After using the automatic decontamination device according to the manufacturer's instructions, the surrogate viruses were recovered from the surfaces and examined by quantitative cultures. Then, reduction factors were calculated. FINDINGS: The ozone-based room decontamination device achieved virucidal efficacy (reduction factor >4 log10) against both surrogate organisms regardless of the different surfaces and positions confirming a high activity under the used conditions. CONCLUSION: Ozone is highly active against SARS-CoV-2 surrogate organisms.

In recent years, the number of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients has increased, and the number of these patients undergoing ECMO has also increased. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a high-risk factor for complications during ECMO. We studied the effects of ECMO on inflammatory response in a diabetic rat ECMO model. Twenty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: normal SHAM group (normal rats: n = 7), diabetic SHAM group (diabetic rats: n = 7), normal ECMO group (normal rats: n = 7), and diabetic ECMO group (diabetic rats: n = 7). We measured the plasma levels of cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) were examined in the rat cardiopulmonary bypass model to ascertain organ damage. In addition, the lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio was measured as an index of pulmonary tissue edema. A pathologic evaluation of kidneys was conducted by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic-acid-methenamine-silver (PAM) staining. In the diabetic ECMO group, levels of cytokines, AST, ALT, LDH, and L-FABP increased significantly, reaching a maximum at the end of ECMO in comparison with other groups (p < 0.05). In addition, hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-methenamine-silver staining of renal tissues showed marked injury in the ECMO group (normal ECMO and diabetic ECMO groups). Furthermore, when the normal ECMO and diabetic ECMO groups were compared, severe organ injury was seen in the diabetic ECMO group. There was remarkable organ injury in the diabetic ECMO group. These data demonstrate that diabetes enhances proinflammatory cytokine release, renal damage, and pulmonary edema during ECMO in an animal model.","Fujii, Yutaka; Abe, Takuya; Ikegami, Kikuo",Membranes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920465/; https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11040283,538

Since marriage is found to be beneficial to people’s quality of life (QoL), the study aimed to examine the QoL of married people in Indonesia during a large-scale social restriction of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online cross-sectional survey using Qualtrics was conducted in June 2020. Respondents’ sociodemographic data, spouse data (as reported by the respondents), and pandemic-related data were collected, followed by QoL data, measured by WHQOOL-BREF. WHOQL-BREF consists of 26 questions grouped into four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships, and environmental. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis H and Spearman correlation analyses were employed to compare QoL between groups of sociodemographic characteristics. In total, 603 respondents were recruited. The respondents’ mean age is 35.3 years (SD = 7.61), most are females (82%), bachelor degree graduate (95%), Islam (78%), employed (69%), and assigned to work from home during the pandemic (76%). Married men reported better QoL in almost all domains than women; employed respondents reported higher QoL scores than unemployed; higher educated respondents reported higher QoL than those with lower education; respondents with higher income reported higher QoL than those with lower income. We found significant positive correlations between the QoL scores and age, spouse’s age, and marriage length, although they were considered small. Compared to Indonesian population normative scores pre-pandemic, our sample reported no difference in physical and social domains, lower in the psychological domain, but higher in the environmental domain. Indonesian married people, especially women, those with low level of education, currently out of work, and below-average financial condition are the ones who reported worse quality of life during the lockdown. These results can help direct the Indonesian government efforts in dealing with psychosocial problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for married couples.","Purba, Fredrick Dermawan; Kumalasari, Asteria Devy; Novianti, Langgersari Elsari; Kendhawati, Lenny; Noer, Afra Hafny; Ninin, Retno Hanggarani",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496005/,538

The objective is to determine whether in the care of vulnerable patients, to succeed against COVID-19, multiple public health tools and interventions will be needed to minimize morbidity and mortality. The study is a prospective cohort investigation of patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19, who required to any of the Health Centers response from April 8, 2020, to August 18, 2020. In Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA), April 8, 2020 the virus was identified in patients hospitalized in the ""Southeast Network"" (SN), AMBA. SN covering an area of 661 square kilometers, with 1.8 million inhabitants residing in urban, and rural areas. A total of 14 health centers with different levels of care complexity provide care to patients in the region. The information of each patient with COVID-19 evaluated by SN, was incorporated in an Epidemiological Dashboard. The investigation was designed and reported with consideration of observational studies in epidemiology. We describe the hospitals presentation and care of persons who required SN response and were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. From April 8, 2020, to August 18, 2020, were included 1495 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in SN. A total of 58% patients were men, and the mean age (SD) was 48.9 (15.59) years. Eighty one percent patients with pre-existing diseases, most frequent hypertension and diabetes, but hypertension, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease presented higher risk. A total of 13% were hospitalized in Intensive Therapy Unit. The mortality of the cohort was 9.77%. Mortality was higher for patients aged 65 or more (OR 5.09), and for those had some pre-existing disease (OR 2.61). Our observations are consistent with reports demonstrating older persons, and those with comorbidities have the highest risk of mortality related to COVID-19. However, unlike other reports from developed or some developing countries, the mortality in our study is lower. This finding may be related to age of our cohort is younger than other published. Also, the health system was able to respond to the demand.","Yacobitti, A.; Otero, L.; Doldan Arrubarrena, V.; Arano, J.; Lage, S.; Silberman, M.; Zubieta, M.; Erbetta, I.; Danei, P.; Baeck, G.; Vallejos, V.; Cavalli, F.; Calderón, N.; Di Gregorio, M.; Hernandez, V.; Bruno, D.; Rodera, B.; Macherett, I.; Parisi, M.; Gallastegui, M.; Paz, A.; Bernardi, R.; Azcárate, S.; Hraste, A.; Caridi, I.; Boechi, L.; Salgado, P.; Kochen, S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958604/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87552-w,538

However, there are conflicting reports of estimated deaths in the post cardiac transplantation patient population associated with COVID‐19. METHODS: Observational, retrospective analysis of a large cohort of post OHT patients in a high volume heart transplantation program in Dallas, Texas that underwent outpatient COVID‐19 screening and testing for both SARS‐CoV‐2 nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR and anti‐SARS‐CoV2 IgG serology as a result of a clinic protocol to facilitate re‐opening of face‐to‐face outpatient clinical visits. RESULTS: The full outpatient cohort tested at time of their clinic visit tested negative for COVID‐19 by nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR. Only 2 patients tested seropositive for anti‐SARS‐COV2 IgG. Five positive inpatient cases were also identified and all, but one has recovered. CONCLUSION: A COVID‐19 surveillance protocol can be easily instituted in this high‐risk population and facilitate safe transplant clinic operation. As the cases and prevalence increase across the United States, further strategies will need to be developed to determine the best course of action to help manage this select population while minimizing their exposure to the ongoing pandemic.","Carey, Sandra A.; Afzal, Aasim; Jamil, Aayla; Williams, Sarah; Gottlieb, Robert L.",Clin Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978777/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14105,538

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically shifted the paradigm for many resident teaching modalities as institutions instituted social distancing to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus. The impact of this shift on pathology trainee education has not been well studied. We conducted an online survey of pathology trainees, program directors, and faculty to assess pre- and post-COVID-19 use of, and response to, various digital pathology modalities. Responses were solicited through both social media and directed appeals. A total of 261 respondents (112 faculty, 52 program directors, and 97 trainees) reported a dramatic and significant increase in the use of digital pathology-related education tools. A significant majority of faculty and program directors agreed that this shift had adversely affected the quality (59% and 62%, respectively) and effectiveness (66%) of their teaching. This perception was similar among learners relative to the impact on quality (59%) and effectiveness (64%) of learning. Most respondents (70%-92%) anticipate that their use of digital pathology education tools will increase or remain the same post-COVID. The global COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity and challenge for pathology training programs. Digital pathology resources were accordingly readily adopted to continue supporting educational activities. The learning curve and utilization of this technology was perceived to impair the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning. Since the use of digital tools appears poised to continue to grow post-COVID19, challenges due to impaired quality and effectiveness will need to be addressed.","Hassell, Lewis A.; Peterson, JoElle; Pantanowitz, Liron",Acad Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709031/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2374289521994240,538

The formulations were prepared by mixing the inhalable micronized drug with a large carrier lactose and dispersibility enhancers, leucine, and magnesium stearate. The drug-excipient interaction was studied using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. The drug and excipients showed no physical inter particulate interaction. The in-vitro drug aerosolization from the developed formulation was determined by a Twin Stage Impinger (TSI) at a flow rate of 60 ± 5 L /min. The amount of drug deposition was quantified by an established HPLC-UV method. The fine particle fraction (FPF) of EDX API from drug alone formulation was 7%, whereas the formulations with excipients increased dramatically to almost 7-folds up to 47%. The developed DPI formulation of EDX showed a promising in-vitro anticoagulation effect at a very low concentration. This novel DPI formulation of EDX could be a potential and effective inhalation therapy for managing pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate the toxicity and clinical application of the inhaled EDX DPI formulation.","Rashid, Md Abdur; Muneer, Saiqa; Mendhi, Jayanti; Sabuj, Mohammad Zaidur Rahman; Alhamhoom, Yahya; Xiao, Yin; Wang, Tony; Izake, Emad L.; Islam, Nazrul",Int J Pharm,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517321009285; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517321009285; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560207/,538

The shift to remote learning has required parents with preschool-age children to adapt to new ways of collaborating with teachers. Given the longstanding inequities in the education of children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, exacerbated by the pandemic, it is critical to learn about the challenges that parents encountered and how they supported their children’s learning. This knowledge will help to identify ways to better serve these communities during times of crisis and beyond. This study examined how Latinx parents from low-income backgrounds engaged in their children’s early education during the COVID-19 crisis. The term Latinx is used in an effort to be gender inclusive when referring to people of Latin American descent. We explored: 1) How do Latinx parents perceive and apply teachers’ suggested activities to support children’s learning during the early childhood education program closure? 2) What parent and child-initiated learning opportunities do parents report? 3) What challenges with remote learning do parents encounter? Twenty parents of preschoolers in a mountain state metropolitan area participated in a 30–45 min. phone interview. All parents spoke Spanish at home to a different degree. Findings revealed the emergence of more authentic parent-teacher partnerships and parents’ extensive engagement in teacher-suggested activities. Importantly, families created a variety of practices to support children’s learning and well-being. Yet, a vast majority of parents expressed feeling stressed with the demands of remote education, particularly keeping their child interested in remote learning.

METHODS: A total of 137 patients with suspected COVID-19 were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ). Psychological nursing intervention measures were implemented, after which the patients were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Before intervention, the rates of anxiety and depression among the patients with suspected COVID-19 were 46.72% and 48.20%, respectively. After intervention, statistically significant reductions were observed in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores (both P<0.05). Before intervention, the TCSQ positive and negative coping scores were 31.07±5.25 and 28.78±6.72, respectively, compared with 36.40±5.93 and 24.60±5.99, respectively, after intervention; these differences were statistically significant (both P<0.01). Before and after intervention, the patients' GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were negatively correlated with the positive coping score but positively correlated with the negative coping score.

Finally, a model based on the defaults was developed in AMOS software and the relationships between the variables were examined. The results showed that corona hypochondria could affect productivity in two ways. In the first place, hypochondria significantly increases job stress, thereby reducing productivity. The indirect effect of hypochondria on productivity in this direction was -0.09. In another way, hypochondria significantly reduces resilience and thus lowers productivity. The effect of hypochondria on productivity was equal to -0.04. Based on the results, the fit of the drawn model was confirmed.

However, trust in governmental organizations tends to decline over time, reducing the compliance with public health regulations. This study aimed at exploring, first, the role of future anxiety and fatigue as serial mediators of the relationship between trust in governmental organizations and protective behaviors, and, secondly, the role of Covid-19 risk perception as a moderator between fatigue and protective behaviors. A total of 948 Italian participants (302 males and 646 females), ranged from 18 to 80 years (M = 27.20, SD = 11.01), answered an online survey during the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak. A moderated serial mediation model was performed using a structural equation modeling. The results indicate that: (1) a higher trust in Italian governmental organizations was associated with a greater compliance in terms of adopting protective behaviors; (2) a lower trust in Italian governmental organizations increased anxiety about the future which, in turn, raised levels of fatigue, leading, finally, to a reduction in the levels of protective behaviors; and (3) as the perceived risk related to Covid-19 increased, the effect of fatigue on protective behaviors decreased. The findings of the current study may provide indications for public health policy on how to increase compliance with the recommended behaviors to be adopted in order to decrease the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","Scandurra, Cristiano; Bochicchio, Vincenzo; Dolce, Pasquale; Valerio, Paolo; Muzii, Benedetta; Maldonato, Nelson Mauro",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276170/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02059-x,538

The first Korean patient infected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was diagnosed on May 20, 2015, after he returned from Qatar and Bahrain. Thereafter, 186 Korean people were infected with the MERS-CoV in a short time through human-to-human transmission. All these cases were linked to healthcare settings, and 25 (13.5 %) infected patients were healthcare workers. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the MERS-CoV isolate found in the Korean patient was closely related to the Qatar strain, and did not harbor transmission efficiency-improving mutations. Nevertheless, with the same infecting virus strain, Korea experienced the largest MERS-CoV outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula, primarily due to the different characteristics of population density and the healthcare system.

Joint Bone Spine 2021;88:105150",2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 health crisis has disproportionately impacted populations who have been historically marginalized in health care and public health, including low-income and racial and ethnic minority groups. Members of marginalized communities experience undue barriers to accessing health care through virtual care technologies, which have become the primary mode of ambulatory health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Insights generated during the COVID-19 pandemic can inform strategies to promote health equity in virtual care now and in the future. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to generate insights arising from literature that was published in direct response to the widespread use of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and had a primary focus on providing recommendations for promoting health equity in the delivery of virtual care. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of literature on health equity and virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic published in 2020, describing strategies that have been proposed in the literature at three levels: (1) policy and government, (2) organizations and health systems, and (3) communities and patients. RESULTS: We highlight three strategies for promoting health equity through virtual care that have been underaddressed in this literature: (1) simplifying complex interfaces and workflows, (2) using supportive intermediaries, and (3) creating mechanisms through which marginalized community members can provide immediate input into the planning and delivery of virtual care. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude by outlining three areas of work that are required to ensure that virtual care is employed in ways that are equity enhancing in a post–COVID-19 reality.","Shaw, James; Brewer, LaPrincess C; Veinot, Tiffany",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739931/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23233,538
643487,Hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a person living with HIV,2020-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is interfering heavily with the screening, diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. Better knowledge of the seroprevalence and immune response after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in this population is important to manage them safely during the pandemic. METHODS: 922 cancer patients, 100 non-cancer patients and 94 healthcare workers (HCW) attending the Multidisciplinary Oncology Unit of Antwerp University Hospital from 24(th) of March 2020 till 31(st) of May 2020, and in the Oncology Unit of AZ Maria Middelares Hospital Gent from 13(th) of April 2020 till 31(st) of May 2020 participated. The Alinity® (A; Abbott) and Liaison® (D; Diasorin) commercially available assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while total SARS-CoV-2 Ig was measured by Elecsys® (R; Roche) RESULTS: In the overall study population IgG/total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in respectively 32/998 (3.2%), 68/1020(6.7%), 37/1010 (3.7%) and of individuals using the A, D or R test. Forty six out of 618 (7.4%) persons had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Seroprevalence in cancer patients (A:2.2%, D:6.2%, R:3.0%), did not significantly differ from that in non-cancer patients (A:1.1%, D:5.6%, R:0.0%), but was lower than the HCW (A:13%, D:12%, R:12%; respectively Fisher’s exact test p=0.00001, p=0.046, p=0.0004). A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was found in 6.8% of the cancer patients, 2.3% of the non-cancer patients and 28.1% of the HCW (Fisher’s exact test p=0.0004). Correlation between absolute value of the different Ig tests was poor in the cancer population. Dichotomizing a positive versus negative test result, the A and R test correlated well (kappa 0.82 p McNemar test=0.344), while A and D, and R and D did not (respectively kappa 0.49 and 0.57; result significantly different p McNemar test=<0.0001 for both). The rate of seroconversion (>75%) and median absolute antibody levels (A: 7.0 vs 4.7; D 74.0 vs 26.6, R: 16.34 vs 7.32; all > P Mann Whitney test=0.28) in cancer patients and HCW with a positive RT-PCR at least 7 days earlier did not show any differences. However, none (N=0/4) of the patients with hematological tumors had seroconversion and absolute antibody levels remained much lower compared to patients with solid tumors (R: 0.1 vs 37.6, p 0.003; D 4.1 vs 158, p 0.008) or HCW (all p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: HCW were at high risk to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Seroprevalence in cancer patients was low in the study period. Although Ig immune response in cancer patients with solid tumors does not differ from healthy volunteers, patients with hematological tumors have a very poor humoral immune response. This has to be taken into account in future vaccination programs in this population. SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have divergent results and seem to have little added value in the management of cancer patients.","van Dam, Peter; Huizing, Manon; Roelant, Ella; Hotterbeekx, An; De Winter, Fien HR.; Kumar-Singh, Samir; Moons, Pieter; Amajoud, Zainab; Vulsteke, Christof; Croes, Lieselot; Janssens, Annelies; Berneman, Zwi; Prenen, Hans; Meuris, Leander; Berghe, Wim Vanden; Smits, Evelien; Peeters, Marc",Eur J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773276/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.02.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921001076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921001076?v=s5,538

646157,Long-Term Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in an Immunocompromised Patient with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and more likely they have higher morbidity and mortality than the general population. On the other hand, the oncology patient sometimes can show asymptomatic COVID-19 disease with a risk of longer viral shedding and spreading the infection to others immunosuppressed individuals. Oncology patients also regularly travel between hospital and sometimes lodge in boarding house for routine chemotherapy. As we known, prevention strategy for COVID-19 among pediatric oncology patients can be implemented by minimizing these risks factors for transmission by identifying all patients infected with COVID-19. Here, we report our experience before and after implementing COVID-19 testing policy of patients with hematology and oncology diseases in our center. METHOD: We collected data of pediatric oncology patients admitted to Hasan Sadikin General hospital between July 1(st), 2020 to January 8(th), 2021. The data consisted of the total number of patients and COVID-19 status by using SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) performed in the patient during two periods. In the first period, we performed NAAT if the patient was suspected of COVID-19. In the second period, after the policy was changed, NAAT was performed routinely as screening for all oncologic patients admitted to the hospital. RESULTS: Between July 1(st) to December 2(nd), 2020, the first period, there was 3 positive results from 36 suspected COVID-19 patients among 181 total pediatric oncology patients. In the second period, we found 8 positive results from 121 hospitalized patients, none of them had signs and symptoms of COVID-19; and 4 of them came from boarding house. CONCLUSION: Routine screening for COVID-19 should be considered as a policy for hospitalization of a pediatric oncology patient because of the high risk that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can transmit the infection to other patient and to health care workers in the hospital.","Adrizain, Riyadi; Sari, Nurmelani",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab031.043,538
646342,Lung ultrasound findings in patients with novel SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-09,"The ongoing battle against current and rising viral infectious threats has prompted increasing effort in the development of vaccine technology. A major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing. Herein, a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles. Using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen, sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins. Following removal of free proteins, antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. As compared to inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with the sVLPs showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection. Comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the sVLPs. The study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application; it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture.","Chen, Hui-Wen; Huang, Chen-Yu; Lin, Shu-Yi; Fang, Zih-Syun; Hsu, Chen-Hsuan; Lin, Jung-Chen; Chen, Yuan-I; Yao, Bing-Yu; Hu, Che-Ming J.",Biomaterials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552321/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.08.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961216304045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216304045,538

We sought to better understand SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced recurrence of autoimmune- and complement-mediated hematologic conditions. Three illustrative cases were identified at the University of Washington Medical Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance from January through March 2021. We describe the recrudescence of 2 autoimmune conditions (ITP and acquired von Willebrand Disease [AvWD]/acquired hemophilia A) and 1 complementopathy (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]). We report the first known case of AvWD/acquired hemophilia A, and describe the first PNH exacerbation in the absence of complement inhibition after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced ITP is a known concern, our case clearly depicts how thrombocytopenia in the setting of preexisting ITP can sequentially worsen with each vaccine dose.

The mechanism of viral interspecies transmission is an important scientific question to be addressed. These coronaviruses contain a surface-located spike (S) protein that initiates infection by mediating receptor-recognition and membrane fusion and is therefore a key factor in host specificity. In addition, the S protein needs to be cleaved by host proteases before executing fusion, making these proteases a second determinant of coronavirus interspecies infection. Here, we summarize the progress made in the past decade in understanding the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by focusing on the features of the S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics, and the cleavage process involved in priming.","Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Qihui; Gao, George F.",Trends Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X15001316; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2015.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26206723/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X15001316,538

Nonetheless, data interpretation and real understanding of viral dynamics is still hampered by the sheer complexity of the various intertwined spatio-temporal processes. In this paper we present a tool to address these issues: a cellular automata model describing critical aspects of in vitro viral infections taking into account spatial characteristics of virus spreading within a culture well. The aim of the model is to understand the key mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection dynamics during the first 24 hours post infection. Using a simulated annealing algorithm we tune free parameters with data from SARS-CoV infection of cultured lung epithelial cells. We also interrogate the model using a Latin Hypercube sensitivity analysis to identify which mechanisms are critical to the observed infection of host cells and the release of measured virus particles.","Bankhead, Armand; Mancini, Emiliano; Sims, Amy C.; Baric, Ralph S.; McWeeney, Shannon; Sloot, Peter M.A.",Journal of Computational Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750311000858; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877750311000858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682300/; https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1289197/107946_346507.pdf,538

In this study, we have employed virtual screening approaches and selected 415 lead-like compounds from 103 million chemical substances, based on the existing drugs, from PubChem databases as potential candidates for the S protein-mediated viral attachment inhibition. Thereafter, based on drug-likeness and Lipinski's rules, 44 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of the viral-host attachment site of the spike protein. Corresponding ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were measured. Furthermore, four novel inhibitors were designed and assessed computationally for its efficacy. From the comparative analysis, we found that our screened compounds maintain better results than the proposed mother compounds VE607 and SSAA09E2. The designed four novel lead compounds possessed more fascinating output without deviating any of the Lipinski's rules. They also showed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score of 0.56 and 1.81 respectively compared to the mother compounds. All the screened compounds and novel compounds showed promising ADMET properties. Among them, the compound AMTM-02 was the best candidate through considering comparative analysis with a docking score of -7.5 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the binding study was verified by molecular dynamics simulation over 100ns by assessing the stability of the complex. Thus, we hope that our proposed screened compounds, as well as the novel compounds may give some breakthroughs for the development of a therapeutic drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 proficiently in vitro and in vivo.","Rahman Oany, Arafat; Mia, Mamun; Pervin, Tahmina; Junaid, Md.; Zahid Hosen, S.M.; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987103/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106177; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303836?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920303836,538

Focusing on Australians between 40 and 60 years who have reduced their working hours and income, we explore the relationship between working hours, care giving and consumption. Data from the national census (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016c) were analysed to contextualise patterns in paid working hours, income and carer roles for men and women aged between 40 and 60 years. Findings from a national survey on informal carers (ABS, 2016a) were also consulted. Taken together, the two sources of national data showed that two thirds of all informal carers are women, that the likelihood of assuming informal carer roles increases with age, and that men and women in carer roles work fewer paid hours per week and have a lower weekly income than non-carers of the same age. To gain qualitative insights into these patterns in Australian national data, and the likely implications of carer roles for household consumption, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten households who subsequently recorded details of their consumption-related expenses over a seven-day period. The interview data showed the strong connection between carer roles, reduced income and paid working hours and its strongly gendered dimension. We argue that women primarily ‘downshift’ to undertake care rather than for sustainability motivations and that there is consequently a need to connect scholarship on gender and care with that on downshifting. The link between reducing paid working hours, care-giving and household consumption appeared to be less straight forward and varied between households. Our findings suggest that a complex relationship exists between environmental and social welfare concerns that has policy implications and warrants further exploration.","Lane, Ruth; Arunachalam, Dharmalingam; Lindsay, Jo; Humphery, Kim",Geoforum,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718520301512; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016718520301512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32536704/,538

Current situation and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact: results of a survey,2021-02-13,"Bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly. We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease. We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n=100) with healthy elderly (n=91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and young healthy adults (n=187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P<0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (P<0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n=11), Rothia (n=51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n=42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n=183) were correlated with health (P<0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n=99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.","de Steenhuijsen Piters, Wouter A A; Huijskens, Elisabeth G W; Wyllie, Anne L; Biesbroek, Giske; van den Bergh, Menno R; Veenhoven, Reinier H; Wang, Xinhui; Trzciński, Krzysztof; Bonten, Marc J; Rossen, John W A; Sanders, Elisabeth A M; Bogaert, Debby",The ISME Journal,https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201599.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.99; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151645/,538
648418,Collaborative and Structured Network for Maintenance of Mechanical Ventilators during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021-06-18,"Background The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be a more reliable approach to detect true infected population, particularly in asymptomatic persons. Few studies focus on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using serological tests. To detect and assess asymptomatic infections of COVID-19 among people in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and provide evidence for planning adequate public health measures, we collected and analyzed the clinical data in the Wuhan General Hospital mandatory for 16- to 64-year-old asymptomatic people. This retrospective study estimated the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG and compared the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected population. Methods Demographical and radiological data were collected from the Wuhan General Hospital between March 26 and April 28, 2020. Serological tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were conducted with a colloidal gold method. Nucleic acid sequences of viruses were detected with RT-PCR. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20.0 software. Findings Between March 26 and April 28, 2020, 18,391 asymptomatic back-to-work participants were enrolled. Among them, 89 had positivity for IgM (0.48%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.58%); 620 cases had IgG positivity (3.37%, 95% CI: 3.11-3.64%), and 650 cases had either IgG positivity or IgM positivity (3.53%, 95% CI: 3.26-3.80%). After standardizing for the genders and ages in the population of Wuhan, the overall standardized seroprevalence of IgG was 3.33% (95% CI: 3.07-3.59%) and the standardized seroprevalence of IgG was 3.01% (95% CI: 2.69-3.33%) among males and 3.66% (95 % CI: 3.23-4.09%) among females. The standardized seroprevalence of IgG was higher in women than in men with a significant difference ({chi}2 = 2,060.3, p < 0.01). By a detection method adjustment, the seroprevalence of IgG was 1.57% (95% CI: 1.39-1.75%) in all medical records, of which males were 1.96% (95% CI: 1.64-2.28%), and females were 1.19% (95% CI: 0.99-1.39%). The assay-adjusted seroprevalence of IgG was higher in women than in men, and the difference was significant ({chi}2 = 5,871.0, p < 0.01). The differences were significant for the seroprevalence of IgG among people who went back to work in different categories of workplace ({chi}2 = 198.44, p < 0.01). The differences in seroprevalence for IgG positivity or IgM positivity among people who went back to work in different urban and rural areas was also significant ({chi}2 = 45.110, p < 0.01). Calculated as IgG and/or IgM antibody positivity, the number of new infections was reduced by 64.8% from March 26 to April 28, 2020. Based on the census population aged 16-64 years in Wuhan in 2017, we estimated that 172,340 (95% CI: 157,568-187,112) asymptomatic people aged 16-64 years were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan between March 25 and April 28, 2020. This estimate was 3.4-times higher than the officially reported 50,333 infections on April 28. Interpretation The seropositivity rate in Wuhan indicated that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represented a small part of the total number of cases. Seropositivity progressively decreased in the Wuhan population from March 26 to April 28, 2020, comparable to Japan and Denmark, but well below the level reported in New York, Iran, Italy, and Germany. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection was higher in women than in men among people who went back to work in Wuhan. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the population remains susceptible to COVID-19.

Telephone/video consultations have become widespread but have compounded concerns about objective evaluation. Therapeutic decisions need, more than ever before, to be considered in the best interests of both patients, and society, while not denying function‐preserving/restoring treatment. Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers. Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk. Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic. The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re‐deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.","Rajabally, Yusuf A.; Goedee, H.

649344,The future of neurorehabilitation after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2020-08-31,"Background: Solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at a high risk of severe COVID-19, and are priority for vaccination. Here, we describe three cases of severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in vaccinated SOT recipients. Methods: Three SOT patients were hospitalized in the Policlinico Hospital of Bari (southern Italy) and underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes and spike protein mutations by real-time PCR. One sample was subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Results: One patient was a heart transplant recipient and two were kidney transplant recipients. All were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 between March and May 2021. Two patients were fully vaccinated and one had received only one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All the patients showed a high viral load at diagnosis, and molecular typing revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2. In all three cases, prolonged viral shedding was reported. Conclusions: The three cases pose concern about the role of the B.1.1.7 lineage in severe COVID-19 and about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Protecting immunocompromised patients from COVID-19 is a challenge. SOT recipients show a suboptimal response to standard vaccination, and thus, an additive booster or a combined vaccination strategy with mRNA, protein/subunit, and vector-based vaccines may be necessary. This population should continue to practice strict COVID-19 precautions post-vaccination, until new strategies for protection are available.","Loconsole, Daniela; Stea, Emma Diletta; Sallustio, Anna; Fontò, Giulia; Pronzo, Virginia; Simone, Simona; Centrone, Francesca; Accogli, Marisa; Gesualdo, Loreto; Chironna, Maria",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451931/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080806,538

It regulates multiple aspects of protein function, including the localization to membranes, intracellular trafficking, protein interactions, protein stability, and protein conformation. This process is regulated by palmitoyl acyltransferases that have the conserved amino acid sequence DHHC at their active site. Although they have conserved catalytic cores, DHHC enzymes vary in their protein substrate selection, lipid substrate preference, and regulatory mechanisms. Alterations in DHHC enzyme function are associated with many human diseases, including cancers and neurological conditions. The removal of fatty acids from acylated cysteine residues is catalyzed by acyl protein thioesterases. Notably, S-acylation is now known to be a highly dynamic process, and plays crucial roles in signaling transduction in various cell types. In this review, we will explore the recent findings on protein S-acylation, the enzymatic regulation of this process, and discuss examples of dynamic S-acylation.","Chen, Jessica J.; Fan, Ying; Boehning, Darren",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981723/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.656440,538

Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%). In conclusion, mRT-PCR is a rapid, cost effective, specific and highly sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses.","Choudhary, Manohar L.; Anand, Siddharth P.; Heydari, Mostafa; Rane, Grishma; Potdar, Varsha A.; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Mishra, Akhilesh C.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413000049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313883/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413000049; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.12.017,538

OBJECTIVE: To investigate patterns and trends in diet quality by food sources among US children and adults overall and in sociodemographic subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This serial, cross-sectional survey study included respondents from 8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (2003-2018) with valid dietary recalls. Data were analyzed from April 16, 2020, to July 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: Survey cycle, food source, and key sociodemographic subgroups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean diet quality of foods (meals, snacks, and beverages) consumed per person, characterized by the American Heart Association diet score (range, 0-80, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), and their components. For the American Heart Association diet score, poor diet was defined as less than 40.0% adherence (score, <32.0), intermediate diet as 40.0% to 79.9% adherence (score, 32.0-63.9), and ideal as 80.0% or greater adherence (score, ≥64.0). RESULTS: The study included 20 905 children 5 to 19 years of age (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [5.24] years; 51.0% male) and 39 757 adults 20 years or older (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [15.1] years; 51.9% female). Diet quality of foods consumed from grocery stores increased modestly in children (53.2% to 45.1% with poor diet quality; P = .006 for trend) and adults (40.1% to 32.9% with poor diet quality; P = .001 for trend), with smaller changes for restaurants among children (84.8% to 79.6% with poor diet quality; P = .003 for trend). Changes for restaurants among adults were not statistically significant (65.4% to 65.2% with poor diet quality; P = .07 with poor diet quality); the same was true of worksites (adults: 55.6% to 50.7% with poor diet quality; P = .25 for trend). Food quality from other sources worsened (children: 40.0% to 51.7% with poor diet quality; adults: 33.8% to 43.8% with poor diet quality; P < .001 for trend each). The largest improvement in diet quality was in schools, with the percentage with poor diet quality decreasing from 55.6% to 24.4% (P < .001 for trend), mostly after 2010, and with equitable improvements across population subgroups. Findings were similar for Healthy Eating Index 2015. Significant disparities in diet quality trends were seen by sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and household income for food consumed from grocery stores. For example, the proportion of foods consumed from grocery stores that were of poor diet quality decreased among high-income adults (from 36.9% to 26.5%; P = .001 for trend) but not among low-income adults (from 45.8% to 41.3%; P = .09 for trend). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: By 2017-2018, foods consumed at schools improved significantly and provided the best mean diet quality of major US food sources, without population disparities. Additional improvements are needed from all major US food sources, with particular attention on equity.","Liu, Junxiu; Micha, Renata; Li, Yan; Mozaffarian, Dariush",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844000/,538

650611,SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and repercussions for male infertility patients: A proposal for the individualized provision of andrological services,2020-05-22,"BACKGROUND: Initially, the relative sizes of the asymptomatic and the symptomatic infected populations were not known for the COVID-19 pandemic and neither was the actual fatality rate. Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic’s course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible—Exposed—Infected—Recovered—Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate ℜ(0) was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8–1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1–20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.","Rasmussen, Steen; Petersen, Michael Skytte; Høiby, Niels",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836034/,538

Clinical information on airway management and expert recommendations in these patients are urgently needed. By analysing a two-centre retrospective observational case series from Wuhan, China, a panel of international airway management experts discussed the results and formulated consensus recommendations for the management of tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Of 202 COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency tracheal intubation, most were males (n=136; 67.3%) and aged 65 yr or more (n=128; 63.4%). Most patients (n=152; 75.2%) were hypoxaemic (Sao(2) <90%) before intubation. Personal protective equipment was worn by all intubating healthcare workers. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) or modified RSI was used with an intubation success rate of 89.1% on the first attempt and 100% overall. Hypoxaemia (Sao(2) <90%) was common during intubation (n=148; 73.3%). Hypotension (arterial pressure <90/60 mm Hg) occurred in 36 (17.8%) patients during and 45 (22.3%) after intubation with cardiac arrest in four (2.0%).

We describe the experience of strengthening the HIV surveillance system among those populations through the implementation of these surveys in Mozambique. We document the lessons learned through the impact on coordination and collaboration; workforce development and institutional capacity building; data use and dissemination; advocacy and policy impact; financial sustainability and community impact. Key lessons learned include the importance of multisectoral collaboration, vital role of data to support key populations visibility and advocacy efforts, and institutional capacity building of government agencies and key populations organizations. Given that traditional surveillance methodologies from routine data often do not capture these hidden populations, it will be important to ensure that Biobehavioral Surveillance Surveys are an integral part of ongoing HIV surveillance activities in Mozambique.","Semá Baltazar, Cynthia; Boothe, Makini; Chitsondzo Langa, Denise; Sathane, Isabel; Horth, Roberta; Young, Peter; Schaad, Nick; Raymond, Henry F.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33413261/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10110-y,538

651441,SARS-CoV-2 infection and parasitic diseases: A possible role for microbiome interaction?,2021-07-03,"BACKGROUND: COVID19 is a high burden for medicine and society as still no specific therapy exists. Most patients depend on symptomatic treatment, comparable to the symptomatic treatment in common respiratory infection e.g., Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. Many cases of COVID19 show mild forms without need of hospitalization. In this randomized, open-label, multicentre, comparative trial we analysed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the herbal medicinal product BNO 1030 in mild cases of COVID-19 to offer an additional symptomatic relive. METHODS: The study was designed as an open label randomized, prospective, multicentred clinical trial. Out of 133 screened outpatients aged 18 to 70 with mild COVID-19 symptoms 120 patients were randomised (1:1) in 2 parallel groups. The main group received BNO 1030 in addition to symptomatic therapy (acetaminophen or ibuprofen). The control group got a symptomatic therapy only. The patients with laboratory proven COVID 19 were included for the final analyses: 47 – in the main group and 46 – in the control one. The evaluation criteria were dynamics of the symptoms: hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, coughing, anosmia, rhinolalia, sore throat, duration of the use of antipyretics (clinically significant fever). These symptoms were assessed during the physician’s visit on a 4-point scale (0 — absent, 1 — insignificant, 2 — moderate, 3 — strong/pronounced) and self- assessed via ten-point visual analogue scale (VAS) daily in a patient’s diary. The primary endpoint was the decrease of the average score compared to the baseline defined as “therapeutic benefit” from the usage of BNO 1030. RESULTS: In the comparison of both groups over the treatment time, the main group (n = 47) showed a greater decrease in the severity of symptoms of fever, myalgia, nasal congestion, coughing, anosmia and rhinolalia, assessed by the doctor on a 4-point scale on V2 (4th day) and V3 (14th day) compared to those on V1, as well as a reduction of the antipyretics intake duration (p < 0.05). Significant differences of the main group were obtained, too, based on the results of symptoms self-assessment by the patient. The “therapeutic benefit from the use of BNO 1030 was 3 days. There is an increase in the number of recovered patients from 73.9–96.6 % according to the average symptom score, and a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients from 8.6–4.4 % in the main group., as compared to the data of the control group (p < 0.05). All patients tolerated the herbal medicine well, with no adverse drug reactions being reported. CONCLUSIONS: BNO 1030 (Imupret®) offers a safe and effective treatment benefit in patients with mild forms of diagnosed COVID-19 aged 18–70 in addition to symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. COVID 19 positive patients treated with Imupret showed an earlier relive of symptoms when being treated with BNO 1030.

651758,SARS-COV-2 pandemic: the significance of underlying conditions,2020-05-19,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is changing approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and care provision in multiple sclerosis (MS). During both the initial and peak phases of the epidemic, the administration of disease-modifying drugs, typically immunosuppressants administered in pulses, was suspended due to the uncertainty about their impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly in contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to present a safety algorithm enabling patients to resume pulse immunosuppressive therapy (PIT) during the easing of lockdown measures. METHODS: We developed a safety algorithm based on our clinical experience with MS and the available published evidence; the algorithm assists in the detection of contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases and of patients with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a view to withdrawing PIT in these patients and preventing new infections at day hospitals. RESULTS: We developed a clinical/microbiological screening algorithm consisting of a symptom checklist, applied during a teleconsultation 48 hours before the scheduled session of PIT, and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal exudate 24 hours before the procedure. CONCLUSION: The application of our safety algorithm presents a favourable risk-benefit ratio despite the fact that the actual proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals is unknown.

S-palmitoylated IFITM3 in particular engages incoming virus particles, prevents their cytoplasmic entry, and accelerates their lysosomal clearance by host cells. However, how S-palmitoylation modulates the structure and biophysical characteristics of IFITM3 to promote its antiviral activity remains unclear. To investigate how site-specific S-palmitoylation controls IFITM3 antiviral activity, we employed computational, chemical, and biophysical approaches to demonstrate that site-specific lipidation of cysteine 72 enhances the antiviral activity of IFITM3 by modulating its conformation and interaction with lipid membranes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that site-specific S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 directly alters its biophysical properties and activity in cells to prevent virus infection.","Garst, Emma H; Lee, Hwayoung; Das, Tandrila; Bhattacharya, Shibani; Percher, Avital; Wiewiora, Rafal; Witte, Isaac P; Li, Yumeng; Peng, Tao; Im, Wonpil; Hang, Howard C",ACS chemical biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887136/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.1c00013,538

COVID-19 symptoms in children are generally milder and radiological tests have fewer positive findings. Indications for chest imaging in pediatric COVID-19 patients remain unclear. This study aims to describe the chest radiographs performed in COVID-19 patients in a pediatric hospital, to review the current chest X-ray indications and to develop an specific age-adjusted protocol for chest-imaging in children with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective study in hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients in Navarre, Spain. Between March and December 2020, 44 children were included (mean age 3.8-year-old, 50 % males). Demographic information, cause of admission, symptoms, and clinical evolution were described. Chest imaging technique performed, indications and findings were analyzed. A literature review was performed searching for current COVID-19 pediatric chest-imaging indications. RESULTS: Chest X-rays were performed in 35 patients (80 % of admissions) and most common indications were fever and respiratory symptoms. 53 % of the chest X-rays were considered “normal” and the classical bilateral diffuse interstitial pattern, described in adults, was only present in 22 %. All patients with pathological chest X-rays were symptomatic and reported fever (100 %) and fever tended to be longer (fever duration: 4.25 vs. 2.46 days p:0.048) in patients with pathological radiographs. We present a specific protocol for chest-imaging in pediatric COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 clinical manifestations and radiological findings are milder and less specific in children. Imaging should not be used as a screening tool or a routine complementary test in pediatric COVID-19 patients, not even in hospitalized cases.","Ilundain López de Munain, Andrea; Jimenez Veintemilla, Cristina; Herranz Aguirre, Mercedes; Viguria Sánchez, Natividad; Ramos-Lacuey, Beatriz; Urretavizcaya-Martínez, María; Echeverría Esandi, Laura; Pina López, María del Mar; García Howard, Marcos; Fernández-Montero, Alejandro; Moreno-Galarraga, Laura",Eur J Radiol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738332/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047721000174?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2021.100337; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047721000174,538

To compare patient attendance in an interdisciplinary pain program (IPP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. To describe programmatic changes in response to patient needs during the pandemic. Design Cohort comparison of IPP attendance rates before versus during the pandemic. Setting Outpatient IPP (consisting of physical therapy [PT], cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], and medication management [MM]) within an academic medical center. Participants Adults diagnosed with chronic pain (N=259) who attended ≥ 1 IPP session between March 2017 and February 2020. Interventions Before COVID-19, PT, CBT, and MM delivered in-person. During COVID-19, PT and MM delivered remotely and in person; CBT delivered via telehealth to individuals and groups to allow social distance and respond to facial affect. Main Outcome Measures Objective 1. Patient attendance = attending ≥ 6 days of PT or CBT (individual and/or group). Results Objective 1. Before COVID-19, IPP attendance (from 3/20/2017 to 3/4/2020) was 76%. Since COVID-19 and through 2/2021, attendance was 65%. Objective 2: During COVID-19, PT included both telehealth and masked, in-person sessions. CBT was delivered through telehealth. IPP psychologist's role grew to promote evidence-based nonpharmacologic intervention for COVID-19 and reduce vaccination hesitation. Conclusions Overall, IPP clinicians and staff maintained safe access to interdisciplinary care for adults with chronic pain. Despite the global pandemic 65% of the patients completed the IPP. The 11% reduction in attendance may reflect increased biopsychosocial burdens experienced by patients with chronic pain during COVID-19. As chronic pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined, future studies are needed to identify the barriers to attendance among patients before and after COVID-19. Determining how to best reduce the risk of attrition will assist patients in benefiting fully from IPP treatment.

Here, we have used a graph theory-based systems biology approach to determine topological properties and robustness of the LN FRC network in mice. We found that the FRC network exhibits an imprinted small-world topology that is fully regenerated within 4 wk after complete FRC ablation. Moreover, in silico perturbation analysis and in vivo validation revealed that LNs can tolerate a loss of approximately 50% of their FRCs without substantial impairment of immune cell recruitment, intranodal T cell migration, and dendritic cell-mediated activation of antiviral CD8(+) T cells. Overall, our study reveals the high topological robustness of the FRC network and the critical role of the network integrity for the activation of adaptive immune responses.","Novkovic, Mario; Onder, Lucas; Cupovic, Jovana; Abe, Jun; Bomze, David; Cremasco, Viviana; Scandella, Elke; Stein, Jens V.; Bocharov, Gennady; Turley, Shannon J.; Ludewig, Burkhard",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27415420/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002515,538

The newly emerging VOC, the B.1.617.2/Delta variant, closely associates with a huge COVID-19 surge in India in Spring 20212. However, its virological property remains unclear. Here, we show that the B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic, and notably, more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein, which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates the spike protein cleavage and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity than the parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark that characterizes the virological phenotype of the B.1.617.2/Delta variant and is closely associated with enhanced pathogenicity.","Saito, Akatsuki; Irie, Takashi; Suzuki, Rigel; Maemura, Tadashi; Nasser, Hesham; Uriu, Keiya; Kosugi, Yusuke; Shirakawa, Kotaro; Sadamasu, Kenji; Kimura, Izumi; Ito, Jumpei; Wu, Jiaqi; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Ito, Mutsumi; Yamayoshi, Seiya; Ozono, Seiya; Butlertanaka, Erika P; Tanaka, Yuri L; Shimizu, Ryo; Shimizu, Kenta; Yoshimatsu, Kumiko; Kawabata, Ryoko; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Tokunaga, Kenzo; Yoshida, Isao; Asakura, Hiroyuki; Nagashima, Mami; Kazuma, Yasuhiro; Nomura, Ryosuke; Horisawa, Yoshihito; Yoshimura, Kazuhisa; Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi; Imai, Masaki; Nakagawa, So; Ikeda, Terumasa; Fukuhara, Takasuke; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Sato, Kei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.448820,538
654063,ARDS and Cytokine Storm in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Caribbean Vervets,2020-08-11,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has led to more than 3.25 million recorded deaths worldwide as of May 2021. COVID-19 is known to be clinically heterogeneous, and whether the reported oral signs and symptoms in COVID-19 are related to the direct infection of oral tissues has remained unknown. Here, we review and summarize the evidence for the primary infection of the glands, oral mucosae, and saliva by SARS-CoV-2. Not only were the entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 found in all oral tissues, but these were also sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Furthermore, saliva from asymptomatic individuals contained free virus and SARS-CoV-2-infected oral epithelial cells, both of which were found to transmit the virus. Collectively, these studies support an active role of the oral cavity in the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to maintaining the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and regimens to limit microbial spread via aerosol or droplet generation, the dental community will also be involved in co-managing COVID-19 'long haulers'-now termed Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome. Consequently, we propose that, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and as new clinical challenges related to COVID-19 are documented, oral symptoms should be included in diagnostic and prognostic classifications as well as plans for multidisciplinary care.

654596,Unusual Presentation of Acute Perimyocarditis Following SARS-COV-2 mRNA-1237 Moderna Vaccination,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND: The Sars-CoV-2 pandemic exacerbates existing inequalities across health care systems globally, both within countries and between countries. It also highlights, like no other crisis before, existing weaknesses in health information systems (HIS). This article summarizes these key challenges for HIS in times of a pandemic and beyond, with a focus on European countries. It builds on the experiences of a large consortium representing HIS experts in key positions in national public health or similar institutes across Europe. METHODS: Data were collected in bi-weekly conference calls organized by the InfAct project between February and June 2020. Emerging themes were clustered and analysed around a WHO framework for health information systems (HIS). We analyse strengths of HIS at two levels: (i) dealing with health information directly, and (ii) dealing with other parts of information systems that allow for a holistic assessment of the pandemic (including health-related aspects). RESULTS: The analysis highlights the need for capacity-building in HIS before a pandemic hits, the relevance of going beyond health information only related to health care but taking a broader perspective (e.g. on vulnerable groups), the need for strong reporting systems on staffing numbers and in primary care. Further, data linkage emerges as a crucial precondition to identify unmet needs for essential health care services in a timely manner. Finally, room for innovation and digitalisation is key to be able to react flexibly in times of crisis. Trust for health information stakeholders is another important factor to create strong HIS. CONCLUSIONS: The strengths and shortcomings of European HIS that have been observed during the COVID-19 crisis highlight the need for strong HIS beyond the crisis. The experiences reported leave as a central message that successful reactions to the pandemic are (also) grounded in strong HIS that ultimately not only benefit the health of the population but also create a number of economic and psycho-social benefits. Strong data reporting schemes may also support fine-tuning of containment measures during a pandemic as well as transition phases.","Schmidt, Andrea E.; Abboud, Linda A.; Bogaert, Petronille",Arch Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00531-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514433/,538

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) department and general infection department of TaiKang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital from February 10 to March 27, 2020, were included. Data on clinical features, complications, laboratory parameters, chest CT, nutrient requirement, and electrolyte imbalance were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 123 (50 critical and 73 non‐critical) patients were enrolled. 65% of patients with comorbidities, hypertension (45.5%), diabetes (21.9%), 36.5% of patients had more than one comorbidity. The proportion of lymphocytes in critical patients was significantly lower than that of non‐critical patients. The proportion of patients with increased NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP levels, and chest CT score was significantly higher in the critical than that of non‐critical patients. The logistic regression analysis identified low lymphocyte count, high NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP levels, and CT score as independent factors for discerning critical cases and high NLR, PLR, IL‐6, and CT score could predict poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, we identified patients who needed nutrition support (HR 16.99) and with correction of electrolyte imbalance (HR 18.24) via intravenous injection were more likely to have a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of lower lymphocyte count, high levels of NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP, chest CT score, and the statue of nutrient requirement or electrolyte imbalance could assist clinicians in discerning critical cases and predict the poor outcome in patients with COVID‐19.","Wang, Weili; Zhao, Zhongxiu; Liu, Xi; Liu, Gang; Xie, Dongjing; Xu, Zhi; Zhao, Jinghong; Zhang, Jingbo",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860454/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23547,538

Here, we analyze various concentrations of BPL to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and their effects on the biochemical properties of the virion particles. BPL at 1:2000 (v/v) concentrations effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2. However, higher BPL concentrations resulted in the loss of both protein content as well as the antigenic integrity of the structural proteins. Higher concentrations also caused substantial aggregation of the virion particles possibly causing undesirable outcomes including a potential immune escape by infectious virions, and a loss in antigenic potential. We also identify that the viral RNA content in the culture supernatants can be a direct indicator of their antigenic content.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; rt-PCR) is the gold standard diagnostic test, and chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan are the other main investigations. Several medications and passive immunization are in use to treat the condition. We searched using PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords such as COVID-19, coronavirus, and their combination with pathological findings, clinical features, management, and treatment to search for relevant published literature. After the removal of duplications and the selection of only published English literature from the past five years, we had a total of 31 papers to review. Most of the COVID-19 affected patients have mild pneumonia symptoms, and those with severe disease have comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 had pathological findings, like ground-glass opacities, consolidations, pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells. Radiological changes show lung changes such as consolidations and opacities, and the pathological findings were infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyalinization. Patients with mild symptoms should self-quarantine, whereas those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are treated in the hospital. Medications under trial include antivirals, antibacterials, antimalarials, and passive immunization. Supportive treatment such as oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and ventilator support can also be used. The symptoms shown by patients are very mild and self-limiting.

It is largely unknown whether lncRNA would deregulate in SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing ongoing pandemic COVID-19. To identify, if lncRNA was deregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we analyzed in silico the data in GSE147507. It was revealed that expression of 20 lncRNA like MALAT1, NEAT1 was increased and 4 lncRNA like PART1, TP53TG1 was decreased in at least two independent cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. Expression of NEAT1 was also increased in lungs tissue of COVID-19 patients. The deregulated lncRNA could interact with more than 2800 genes/proteins and 422 microRNAs as revealed from the database that catalogs experimentally determined interactions. Analysis with the interacting gene/protein partners of deregulated lncRNAs revealed that these genes/proteins were associated with many pathways related to viral infection, inflammation and immune functions. To find out whether these lncRNAs could be regulated by STATs and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), we used ChIPBase v2.0 that catalogs experimentally determined binding from ChIP-seq data. It was revealed that any one of the transcription factors IRF1, IRF4, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5A had experimentally determined binding at regions within -5kb to +1kb of the deregulated lncRNAs in at least 2 independent cell lines/conditions. Our analysis revealed that several lncRNAs could be regulated by IRF1, IRF4 STAT1 and STAT3 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lncRNAs might be involved in antiviral response. However, these in silico observations are necessary to be validated experimentally.","Laha, Sayantan; Saha, Chinmay; Dutta, Susmita; Basu, Madhurima; Chatterjee, Raghunath; Ghosh, Sujoy; Bhattacharyya, Nitai P.",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688586/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021005004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021005004?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06395,538

By the end of the 8 week (4/23/2020) since the virus's emergence in New York City, there have been 142,432 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,977 deaths attributed to complications from COVID-19-related illnesses. Secondary to policies enacted by the New York State government to limit spread of the virus, Orthopedic Surgery departments at hospitals around the area have witnessed an abrupt change in clinical demands. At a local level one trauma hospital in Queens, New York, Orthopedic Surgery elective cases have been cancelled, trauma consult volume has experienced a sharp decline, and both residents and attendings have been repurposed to meet the new clinical demands of this medical crisis. Our own orthopedic surgery service has adopted care for patients normally admitted to an internal medicine service in a novel Ortho-Medical COVID-19 management team.

Unsupervised clustering of SC transcriptomes, which is the default technique for defining cell types, is prone to group cells by technical, rather than biological, variation. Compared to de-novo (unsupervised) clustering, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects and data quality artifacts. Here, we present RCA2, the first algorithm to combine reference projection (batch effect robustness) with graph-based clustering (scalability). In addition, RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework incorporating multiple commonly used downstream analysis modules. RCA2 also provides new reference panels for human and mouse and supports generation of custom panels. Furthermore, RCA2 facilitates cell type-specific QC, which is essential for accurate clustering of data from heterogeneous tissues. We demonstrate the advantages of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Scalable supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of cohort-scale SC datasets.","Schmidt, Florian; Ranjan, Bobby; Lin, Quy Xiao Xuan; Krishnan, Vaidehi; Joanito, Ignasius; Honardoost, Mohammad Amin; Nawaz, Zahid; Venkatesh, Prasanna Nori; Tan, Joanna; Rayan, Nirmala Arul; Ong, Sin Tiong; Prabhakar, Shyam",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320202/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab632,538

Based on national health profile assessments, this study investigated perceived changes of lifestyle habits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associations between perceived lifestyle changes and mental health in Swedish working adults. Among 5599 individuals (50% women, 46.3 years), the majority reported no change (sitting 77%, daily physical activity 71%, exercise 69%, diet 87%, alcohol 90%, and smoking 97%) due to the pandemic. Changes were more pronounced during the first wave (April–June) compared to the second (October–December). Women, individuals <60 years, those with a university degree, white-collar workers, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits at baseline had higher odds of changing lifestyle habits compared to their counterparts. Negative changes in lifestyle habits and more time in a mentally passive state sitting at home were associated with higher odds of mental ill-health (including health anxiety regarding one’s own and relatives’ health, generalized anxiety and depression symptoms, and concerns regarding employment and economy). The results emphasize the need to support healthy lifestyle habits to strengthen the resilience in vulnerable groups of individuals to future viral pandemics and prevent health inequalities in society.","Blom, Victoria; Lönn, Amanda; Ekblom, Björn; Kallings, Lena V.; Väisänen, Daniel; Hemmingsson, Erik; Andersson, Gunnar; Wallin, Peter; Stenling, Andreas; Ekblom, Örjan; Lindwall, Magnus; Salier Eriksson, Jane; Holmlund, Tobias; Ekblom-Bak, Elin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806951/,538

The expression of ORF1b occurs by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism since the ORF1a/ORF1b overlapping nucleotide sequence is capable of inducing ribosomal frameshifting in vitro as well as in vivo. A stem-loop structure and a pseudoknot are predicted in the nucleotide sequence involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of MHV ORF1b with the amino acid sequence deduced from the corresponding gene of the avian coronavirus IBV demonstrated that in contrast to the other viral genes this ORF is extremely conserved.

Although the reported imaging findings of coronavirus infection are variable and non-specific, the most common initial chest radiograph (CXR) and CT findings are ground-glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral predominance and eventually spread to involve both lungs as the disease progresses. These findings can be explained by the immune pathogenesis of coronavirus infection causing diffuse alveolar damage. Although it is insensitive in mild or early coronavirus infection, the CXR remains as the first-line and the most commonly used imaging modality. That is because it is rapid and easily accessible and helpful for monitoring patient progress during treatment. CT is more sensitive to detect early parenchymal lung abnormalities and disease progression, and can provide an alternative diagnosis. In this pictorial review, various coronavirus infection cases are presented to provide imaging spectrums of coronavirus infection and present differences in imaging among them or from other viral infections, and to discuss the role of imaging in viral infection outbreaks.","Franquet, Tomas; Jeong, Yeon Joo; Lam, Hiu Yin Sonia; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Chang, Yeun-Chung; Chung, Myung Jin; Lee, Kyung Soo",Br J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584604/; https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200515,538

Blood samples were obtained before cannulation, and screened for the expression of 754 circulating microRNA (miRNAs) using high-throughput qPCR and hierarchical cluster analysis. The miRNet database was used to predict target genes of deregulated miRNAs, and the DIANA tool was used to identify significant enrichment pathways. A hierarchical cluster of 229 miRNAs (identified after quality control screening) produced a clear separation of 11 patients into two groups: considering the baseline SAPS II, SOFA, and RESP score cluster A (n = 6) showed higher severity compared to cluster B (n = 5); p values < 0.05. After analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs between the two clusters, 95 deregulated miRNAs were identified, and reduced to 13 by in silico analysis. These miRNAs target genes implicated in tissue remodeling, immune system, and blood coagulation pathways. The blood levels of 13 miRNAs are altered in severe ARDS.

In a traditional poultry house, breeders must usually observe the health of the broilers in person on the basis of their breeding experience at regular times every day. When a breeder finds unhealthy broilers, they are removed manually from the poultry house to prevent viruses from spreading in the poultry house. Therefore, in this study, we designed and constructed a novel small removal system for dead chickens for Taiwanese poultry houses. In the mechanical design, this system mainly contains walking, removal, and storage parts. It comprises robotic arms with a fixed end and sweep-in devices for sweeping dead chickens, a conveyor belt for transporting chickens, a storage cache for storing chickens, and a tracked vehicle. The designed system has dimensions of approximately 1.038 × 0.36 × 0.5 m(3), and two dead chickens can be removed in a single operation. The walking speed of the chicken removal system is 3.3 cm/s. In order to enhance the automation and artificial intelligence in the poultry industry, the identification system was used in a novel small removal system. The conditions of the chickens in a poultry house can be monitored remotely by using a camera, and dead chickens can be identified through deep learning based on the YOLO v4 algorithm. The precision of the designed system reached 95.24% in this study, and dead chickens were successfully moved to the storage cache. Finally, the designed system can reduce the contact between humans and poultry to effectively improve the overall biological safety.","Liu, Hung-Wei; Chen, Chia-Hung; Tsai, Yao-Chuan; Hsieh, Kuang-Wen; Lin, Hao-Ting",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063974/,538

The underlying idea, known as the ‘monoculture effect,' is well documented in agricultural studies. Low genetic diversity in the wild can result from bottlenecks (that is, founder effects), biparental inbreeding or self-fertilization, any of which might increase the risk of epidemics. Host genetic diversity could buffer populations against epidemics in nature, but it is not clear how much diversity is required to prevent disease spread. Recent theoretical and empirical studies, particularly in Daphnia populations, have helped to establish that genetic diversity can reduce parasite transmission.

To evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in pauci-symptomatic and asymptomatic people, the associated epidemiological factors, and IgG antibody kinetic over a 5-month period to get a better knowledge of the disease transmissibility and the rate of susceptible persons that might be infected. METHODS. Seroprevalence was evaluated by a cross-sectional study based on the general population of Santa Fe, Argentina (non-probabilistic sample) carried out between July and November 2020. A subgroup of 20 seropositive individuals was followed-up to analyze IgG persistence. For the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection, the COVID-AR IgG(®) ELISA kit was used. RESULTS. 3 000 individuals were included conforming asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic groups (n=1 500 each). From the total sample, only 8.83% (n=265) presented reactivity for IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. A significant association was observed between positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a history of contact with a confirmed case; the transmission rate within households was approximately 30%. In the pauci-symptomatic group, among the seropositive ones, anosmia and fever presented an OR of 16.8 (95% CI 9.5-29.8) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.6), respectively (p <0.001). In asymptomatic patients, IgG levels were lower compared to pauci-symptomatic patients, tending to decline after 4 months since the symptoms onset. CONCLUSION. We observed a low seroprevalence, suggestive of a large population susceptible to the infection. Anosmia and fever were independent significant predictors for seropositivity. Asymptomatic patients showed lower levels of antibodies during the 5-month follow-up. IgG antibodies tended to decrease over the end of this period regardless of symptoms.","Rodeles, Luz María; Peverengo, Luz María; Benítez, Romina; Benzaquen, Nadia; Serravalle, Priscila; Long, Ana Karina; Ferreira, Virginia; Benitez, Agostina Daiana; Zunino, Luisina; Lizarraga, Camila; Vicco, Miguel Hernán",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168682/; https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2021.66,538

Since de novo compound design is an extremely long, time-consuming, and expensive process, efforts are underway to discover existing compounds that can be repurposed for COVID-19 and new viral diseases. MODEL: We propose a machine learning representation framework that uses deep learning induced vector embeddings of compounds and viral proteins as features to predict compound-viral protein activity. The prediction model in-turn uses a consensus framework to rank approved compounds against viral proteins of interest. RESULTS: Our consensus framework achieves a highmean Pearson correlation of 0.916, mean R2 of 0.840 and a low mean squared error of 0.313 for the task of compound-viral protein activity prediction on an independent test set.

CLINICAL HISTORY: A 28-year-old G5P1 38w1d female presented with 4 days of blurry vision, left dilated pupil, and headache. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine nasal swab testing but denied cough or fever. Endocrine testing demonstrated an elevated serum prolactin level, and central hypothyroidism. MRI showed a cystic-solid lesion with a fluid level in the pituitary fossa and expansion of the sella consistent with pituitary apoplexy. Her visual symptoms improved with corticosteroid administration and surgery was delayed to two weeks after her initial COVID-19 infection and to allow for safe delivery of the child. A vaginal delivery under epidural anesthetic occurred at 39 weeks. Two days later, transsphenoidal resection of the mass was performed under strict COVID-19 precautions including use of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) and limited OR personnel given high risk of infection during endonasal procedures. Pathology demonstrated a liquefied hemorrhagic mass suggestive of pituitary apoplexy. She made a full recovery and was discharged home two days after surgery. CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the first known case of successful elective induction of vaginal delivery and transsphenoidal intervention in a near full term gravid patient presenting with pituitary apoplexy and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further reports may help determine if there is a causal relationship or if these events are unrelated.

Therefore, we address the stakes of “chosen family” for queer and transgender (Q/T) young adults in terms of health, illness and the mutual provision of care. “Chosen family” is a refuge specifically generated by and for the queer experience, so we draw upon anthropological theory to explore questions of queer kinship in terms of care. We employ a phenomenological approach to semi-structured interviews (n = 11), open coding, and thematic analysis of transcriptions to meet our aims: (1) Develop an understanding of the beliefs and values that form the definition of “chosen family” for Q/T young adults; and (2) Understand the ways in which “chosen family” functions in terms of care for health and illness. Several themes emerged, allowing us to better understand the experiences of this population in navigating the concept of “chosen family” within and beyond health care settings. Emergent themes include: (1) navigating medical systems; (2) leaning on each other; and (3) mutual aid.

Recent AIB outbreaks in India have been associated with poor growth in broilers, drop in egg production, and thin egg shells in layers. The complete spike gene of Indian AIB vaccine strain was amplified and sequenced using a conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and is submitted to the GenBank (accession no KF188436). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the vaccine strain currently used belongs to H120 genotype, an attenuated strain of Massachusetts (Mass) serotype. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that the reported spike gene from Indian isolates have 71.8%–99% and 71.4%–96.9% genetic similarity with the sequenced H120 strain. The study identifies live attenuated IBV vaccine strain, which is routinely used for vaccination, for the first time. Based on nucleotide and amino acid relatedness studies of the vaccine strain with reported IBV sequences from India, it is shown that the current vaccine strain is efficient in controlling the IBV infection.

A cross-sectional study of MERS-CoV was conducted in Kenya from July 2016 to July 2017. Seroprevalence was stratified into four age groups: <1, 1–2, 2–3 and >3 years old. Age-independent and age-dependent linear and quadratic generalised linear models were used to estimate FOI in pastoral and ranching camel herds. Models were compared based on computed AIC values. Among pastoral herds, the age-dependent quadratic FOI was the best fit model, while the age-independent FOI was the best fit for the ranching herd data. FOI provides an indirect estimate of infection risk, which is especially valuable where direct estimates of incidence and other measures of infection are challenging to obtain. The FOIs estimated in this study provide important insight about MERS-CoV dynamics in the reservoir species, and contribute to our understanding of the zoonotic risks of this important public health threat.","Gardner, E.

In these antibodies, we detected undesired autoantibody reactivity specific for the carbohydrate moieties of an abundant human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR). This observation provides important clues for the selection of specific immunologic probes to examine whether SARS-CoV expresses antigenic structures that mimic the host glycan. We found that lectin PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), which is specific for a defined complex carbohydrate of ASOR, stained the SARS-CoV-infected cells specifically and intensively. Taken together, we present immunologic evidence that a carbohydrate structure of SARS-CoV shares antigenic similarity with host glycan complex carbohydrates. The experimental approaches we applied in this study are likely applicable for the identification of immunologic targets of other viral pathogens.","Wang, Denong; Lu, Jiahai",Physiol Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15161967/,538

Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use is critical to providing a safe environment and to minimize the risk of contagion. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, a series of supply chain issues, constant changes in PPE use policy, and higher demand for PPE led to shortages in PPE, specifically N95 masks and face shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed N95 mask reuse but, required masks to be unsoiled. Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. The University of Nebraska Medical Center produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products. Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. Importantly, we created and implemented a simple but effective decontamination protocol, which allowed reuse of the face shields. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production of face shields used at Tripler Army Medical Center (Tripler AMC, Hawaii). The effectiveness of the decontamination protocol was evaluated using the average log(10) reduction in colony counts for Escherichia coli ATCC 8937 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Understanding the genetic basis of susceptibility and prognosis to COVID‐19 is of great significance to disease prevention, molecular typing, prognosis, and treatment. However, so far, there have been only two genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) on the susceptibility of COVID‐19. Starting with these reported DNA variants, we found the genes regulated by these variants through cis‐eQTL and cis‐meQTL acting. We further did a series of bioinformatics analysis on these potential risk genes. The analysis shows that the genetic variants on EHF regulate the expression of its neighbor CAT gene via cis‐eQTL. There was significant evidence that CAT and the SARS‐CoV‐2‐related S protein binding protein ACE2 interact with each other. Intracellular localization results showed that CAT and ACE2 proteins both exists in the cell membrane and extracellular area and their interaction could have an impact on the cell invasion ability of S protein. In addition, the expression of these three genes showed a significant positive correlation in the lungs. Based on these results, we propose that CAT plays a crucial intermediary role in binding effectiveness of ACE2, thereby affecting the susceptibility to COVID‐19.","Qian, Yu; Li, Yi; Liu, Xinxuan; Yuan, Na; Ma, Jinjie; Zheng, Qiwen; Liu, Fan",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710662/,538

The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a good prognosis, but variable percentages in different countries develop pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia and severe inflammatory response due to uncontrolled release of cytokines. These immune mediators are transcriptionally regulated by JAK-STAT molecular pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules. Here, we provide evidences on the efficacy of baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, in correcting the immune abnormalities observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, we demonstrate a significant reduction in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a rapid recovery in circulating T and B cell frequencies and an increased antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in baricitinib-treated patients.

However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers”. METHODS: This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS‐CoV‐2 laboratory‐positive (SARS‐CoV‐2(+)) and 50 laboratory‐negative (SARS‐CoV‐2(‐)) individuals) presenting to our Neuro‐Covid‐19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid‐19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia, and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient‐reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. RESULTS: Mean age was 43.2 ± 11.3 years, 70% were female, and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were: “brain fog” (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), and myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS‐CoV‐2(+) than SARS‐CoV‐2(‐) patients (37/50 [74%] vs. 18/50 [36%]; p < 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery.

However, the benefits of CP for patients with different conditions are still in debate. To contribute clinical evidence of CP on critically ill patients, we analyze the characteristics and outcomes of patients with or without CP transfusion. METHODS: In this cohort study, 14 patients received CP transfusion based on the standard treatments, whereas the other 10 patients received standard treatments as control. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. The cumulative survival rate was calculated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Data analysis was performed on 24 patients (male/female: 15/9) with a median age of 64.0 (44.5–74.5) years. Transient fever was reported in one patient. The cumulative mortality was 21% (3/14) in patients receiving CP transfusion during a 28-day observation, whereas one dead case (1/10) was reported in the control group. No significant difference was detected between groups in 28-day mortality (P = 0.615) and radiological alleviation of lung lesions (P = 0.085). CONCLUSION: In our current study, CP transfusion was clinically safe based on the safety profile; however, the clinical benefit was not significant in critically ill patients with more comorbidities at the late stage of disease during a 28-day observation.

Mortensen1,2021-08-31,"Current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put a spotlight on the spread of infectious diseases brought on by pathogenic airborne bacteria and viruses. In parallel with a relentless search for therapeutics and vaccines, considerable effort is being expended to develop ever more powerful technologies to restricting the spread of airborne microorganisms in indoor spaces through the minimization of health- and environment-related risks. In this context, UV-based and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-based technologies (i.e., the combined action of ultraviolet (UV) light and photocatalytic materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO(2))) represent the most widely utilized approaches at present because they are cost-effective and ecofriendly. The virucidal and bactericidal effect relies on the synergy between the inherent ability of UV light to directly inactivate viral particles and bacteria through nucleic acid and protein damages, and the production of oxidative radicals generated through the irradiation of the TiO(2) surface. In this literature survey, we draw attention to the most effective UV radiations and TiO(2)-based PCO technologies available and their underlying mechanisms of action on both bacteria and viral particles. Since the fine tuning of different parameters, namely the UV wavelength, the photocatalyst composition, and the UV dose (viz, the product of UV light intensity and the irradiation time), is required for the inactivation of microorganisms, we wrap up this review coming up with the most effective combination of them. Now more than ever, UV- and TiO(2)-based disinfection technologies may represent a valuable tool to mitigate the spread of airborne pathogens.","Bono, Nina; Ponti, Federica; Punta, Carlo; Candiani, Gabriele",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669103/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14051075,538

OBJECTIVES: Provide a review of the research literature, propose hypotheses and therapies based on the potential link between testosterone (T) and COVID‐19 induced mortality in elderly men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of publications in academic electronic databases, and government and public health organization web sites on T, aging, inflammation, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, and COVID‐19 disease state and outcomes was performed. RESULTS: The link between T, the immune system and male aging is well‐established, as is the progressive decline in T levels with aging. In women, T levels drop before menopause and variably increase with advanced age. Elevated IL‐6 is a characteristic biomarker of patients infected with COVID‐19 and has been linked to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus far, half of the admitted COVID‐19 patients developed ARDS, half of these patients died, and elderly male patients have been more likely to develop ARDS and die. Low T is associated with ARDS. These data suggest that low T levels may exacerbate the severity of COVID‐19 infection in elderly men. It may also stand to reason that normal T levels may offer some protection against COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2, present in high levels in the testis. CONCLUSION: At present, it is not known whether low T levels in aging hypogonadal males create a permissive environment for severe responses to COVID‐19 infection or if the virus inhibits androgen formation. Given the preponderance of COVID‐19 related mortality in elderly males, additional testing for gonadal function and treatment with T may be merited.","Papadopoulos, Vassilios; Li, Lu; Samplaski, Mary",Andrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681716/; https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12868,538

RESULTS: A total of 192 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the present study, of whom 67 patients had DM. Low lymphocytes % [0.4(0.1–0.9), P = .011] and QTc interval prolongation [0.4(0.1–0.8), P = .022] were associated with increased length of ICU stay. On the other hand, metformin use [0.3(0.2–4), P = .032] and DPP-4 inhibitors use [0.3(0.2–3), P = .040] were associated with decreased length of ICU stay. QTc interval prolongation [0.4(0.1–0.9), P = .017] was associated with increased length of hospital stay, while using metformin [0.4(0.2–3), P = .022] was associated with decreased length of hospital stay.

Using innovative approaches such as video conferencing can connect mentors with practitioners regardless of location. This study describes and evaluates the methods, outputs, and outcomes of a quality improvement program implemented in 12 public hospital laboratories in Cambodia between January 2018 and April 2019. The program used mixed intervention methods including both in-person and remote-access training and mentorship. METHODS: Training outputs were quantified from the activity reports of program trainers and mentors. Program outcomes were measured by pre- and postimplementation audits of laboratory quality management system conformity to international standards. Variations in improved outcomes were assessed in relation to the time spent by laboratory personnel in video conference training and mentoring activity. An additional cross-sectional comparison described the difference in final audit scores between participating and nonparticipating laboratories. RESULTS: Laboratories significantly improved their audit scores over the project period, showing significant improvement in all sections of the ISO 15189 standard. Pre- and postaudit score differences and laboratory personnel participation time in remote mentoring activities showed a strong monotonic relationship. Average input per laboratory was 6,027±2,454 minutes of participation in video conference activities with mentors. Audit scores of participating laboratories were significantly higher than those of laboratories with no quality improvement program. CONCLUSION: Laboratories improved significantly in ISO 15189 conformity following structured laboratory quality management systems training supported by remote and on-site mentoring.

The use of nanotechnology in medicine has great potential, especially in medical microbiology. Promising data show the possibility of shaping immune responses and fighting severe infections using synthetic materials. Different studies have suggested that the addition of synthetic nanoparticles in vaccines and immunotherapy will have a great impact on public health. On the other hand, antibiotic resistance is one of the major concerns worldwide; a recent report of the World Health Organization (WHO) states that antibiotic resistance could cause 300 million deaths by 2050. Nanomedicine offers an innovative tool for combating the high rates of resistance that we are fighting nowadays, by the development of both alternative therapeutic and prophylaxis approaches and also novel diagnosis methods. Early detection of infectious diseases is the key to a successful treatment and the new developed applications based on nanotechnology offer an increased sensibility and efficiency of the diagnosis. The aim of this review is to reveal and discuss the main advances made on the science of nanomaterials for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Highlighting innovative approaches utilized to: (i) increasing the efficiency of vaccines; (ii) obtaining shuttle systems that require lower antibiotic concentrations; (iii) developing coating devices that inhibit microbial colonization and biofilm formation.","Torres-Sangiao, Eva; Holban, Alina Maria; Gestal, Monica Cartelle",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules21070867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27376260/,538

Estas exacerbaciones se deben a infecciones bacterianas y virales, y a factores estresantes medioambientales, pero otras enfermedades concomitantes como las cardiopatías, otras enfermedades pulmonares (como la embolia pulmonar, la aspiración o el neumotórax) y otros procesos sistémicos, pueden desencadenar o complicar estas agudizaciones. En la fisiopatología de las exacerbaciones los dos factores que más influyen son la hiperinsuflación dinámica y la inflamación local y sistémica. El tratamiento farmacológico en la mayoría de los pacientes incluye broncodilatadores de acción corta, corticoides sistémicos y antibióticos. La insuficiencia respiratoria hipoxémica requiere oxigenoterapia controlada y en la insuficiencia respiratoria hipercápnica la ventilación con presión positiva no invasiva puede permitir ganar tiempo hasta que otros tratamientos empiecen a funcionar y, así, evitar la intubación endotraqueal. El uso de ventilación mecánica no invasiva nunca debe retrasar la intubación si ésta está indicada. Los criterios de alta hospitalaria se basan en la estabilización, tanto clínica como gasométrica, y en la capacidad del paciente para poder controlar la enfermedad en su domicilio. La hospitalización domiciliaria puede ser una opción de tratamiento de la exacerbación de la EPOC con eficacia equivalente a la hospitalización convencional. Abstract Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are considered to be episodes of instability that favor disease progression, reduce quality of life, increase the risk of death and cause substantial healthcare resource use. These exacerbations are due to bacterial and viral infections and environmental stressors. However, other concomitant diseases such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aspiration or pneumothorax) and other systemic processes can trigger or complicate these exacerbations. The two factors with the greatest influence on the physiopathology of exacerbations are dynamic overinflation and local and systemic inflammation. In most patients, drug treatment includes short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. Hypoxemic respiratory failure requires controlled oxygen therapy. In hypercapnic respiratory failure, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time to be gained until other treatments begin to take effect and can thus avoid endotracheal intubation. The use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation should never delay intubation, if indicated. Hospital discharge criteria are based on both clinical and gasometric stabilization and on the patient's ability to manage his or her disease at home. Hospitalization at home can be a treatment option in COPD exacerbations and is as effective as conventional hospitalization.","Calle Rubio, Myriam; Chacón, Beatriz Morales; Rodríguez Hermosa, Juan Luis",Archivos de Bronconeumología,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289610700429; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289610700429,538

A component of this immune recognition is the family of lectins; pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognise viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral glycoproteins. In this review we discuss the contribution of soluble and membrane-associated PRRs to immunity against virus pathogens, and the potential role of these molecules in facilitating virus replication. These processes are illustrated with examples of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). We focus on the structure, function and genetics of the well-characterised C-type lectin mannose-binding lectin, the ficolins, and the membrane-bound CD209 proteins expressed on dendritic cells. The potential for lectin-based antiviral therapies is also discussed.","Mason, Christopher P.; Tarr, Alexander W.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules20022229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642836/,538
673656,Position statement of the Spanish Society of Nephrology on the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines(),2021-09-22,"Climate change is a threat to global food security due to the reduction of crop productivity around the globe. Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security.","Razzaq, Ali; Kaur, Parwinder; Akhter, Naheed; Wani, Shabir Hussain; Saleem, Fozia",Front Plant Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.620420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367194/,538
674095,On the timing of interventions to preserve hospital capacity: lessons to be learned from the Belgian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020,2021-09-13,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Research regarding COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) in older adults is scarce. We evaluated the risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized older adults with and without COVID-19. METHOD: Observational study of patients admitted to two geriatric clinics in the Stockholm Region of Sweden during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1st to June 15th 2020. The difference in incidence, risk factors and adverse outcomes for AKI between patients with or without COVID-19 were examined. Odds ratios (ORs) for AKI were obtained from logistic regressions. The hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of in-hospital death were calculated from Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: We analyzed 316 older patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and 876 patients for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. The mean age was 83±9 years, 57% were women, and mean baseline kidney function as depicted by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62±23 ml/min/1.73m(2). AKI occurred in 92 (29%) of patients with COVID-19 vs. 159 (18%) without COVID-19. The severity of AKI was significantly worse in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID patients. The odds for developing AKI were higher in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04-2.76), low baseline kidney function [4.19 (2.48-7.05), for eGFR 30 ∼ <60 ml/min/1.73m(2), and 20.3 (9.95-41.3) for eGFR <30ml/min/1.73m(2)], and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level (OR 1.81(1.11-2.95)). The risk of in-hospital death was highest in patients with COVID-19 and AKI [adjusted HR 23.5, 95% CI (8.75-63.0)], followed by COVID-19 without AKI [9.10 (3.52-23.6)] and by patients without COVID-19 and with AKI [6.38 (2.28-17.9)] after adjusting for patient demographics, vital signs, baseline kidney function and medications and using non-COVID patients with no AKI as reference. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of AKI compared with patients hospitalized with other diagnoses. AKI and COVID-19 were associated with in-hospital death. Optimal management of AKI may improve the outcome of COVID-19 in geriatric patients.","Xu, Hong; Garcia-Ptacek, Sara; Annetorp, Martin; Bruchfeld, Annette; Cederholm, Tommy; Johnson, Peter; Kivipelto, Miia; Metzner, Carina; Religa, Dorota; Eriksdotter, Maria",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab082.0012,538

For mental health providers, the pandemic required a sudden shift from in person to online service delivery. As therapists learn and embrace a new modality for providing therapy, crisis situations may present with some anxiety.

The authors believe that regardless of the primary model(s) therapists utilize in session, solution-focused brief therapy is an integrative model that uniquely captures client’s resources and reasons for living and when clients are in crisis. The purpose of this paper is to present recommendations for applying solution-focused language in teletherapy practice, to provide ethical, evidenced based care for clients in crisis.

Identification of the contributors to preventable injuries would assist in guiding policy and prevention strategies at a local and international level. In response to SARS-nCOV-2 (COVID19), a national restrictive lockdown was implemented in South Africa with, amongst other restrictions, a complete ban on non-essential travel and alcohol sales. With the most intensive restrictions implemented between March to May 2020, this period offers an unprecedented opportunity for the assessment of social restrictions on possible effects of trauma burdens. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted between March to May 2019 and compared to data from the same period in 2020. Descriptive analysis was undertaken to understand the influence of lockdown on demographics and injury causation in trauma presentations. RESULTS: The results showed a 51.42% decline in trauma during the early lockdown period. Sub-analyses however, revealed little change in the mechanism of injury ratios and the demographics of presenting patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that although all cause presentation of trauma cases was reduced following the implementation of lockdown procedures in 2020, the injury patterns and ratios of intentional to accidental harm remained largely unchanged. This prompts the need for further research and root cause analysis into how trauma prevention strategies can be improved. This will assist with the improved efficacy of trauma prevention policies in a country with a well-documented trauma burden and thus a pressing need for an implementable and nationwide harm reduction policy.","Mahoney, Scott H.; Steyn, Elmien; Lategan, Hendrik",Afr J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367897/,538

Improving health system efficiency could mitigate these outcomes and, in the COVID-19 era, reduce risks of viral exposure. OBJECTIVE: As part of a system-wide transformation to improve healthcare value among populations with high healthcare utilization and morbidity, UCLA Health evaluated a new patient-centered approach that we hypothesized would reduce inpatient utilization for CKD patients. DESIGN: For 18 months in 2015–2016 and 12 months in 2017, we conducted an interrupted time series regression analysis to evaluate the intervention’s impact on inpatient utilization. We used internal electronic health records and claims data across six payers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1442 stage 4–5 CKD patients at a large academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Between October and December 2016, the organization implemented a Population Health Value CKD intervention for the CKD stages 4–5 population. A multispecialty leadership team risk stratified the population and identified improvement opportunities, redesigned multispecialty care coordination pathways across settings, and developed greater ambulatory infrastructure to support care needs. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included utilization of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient bed days, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. KEY RESULTS: During the 12 months following intervention implementation, the monthly estimated rate of decline for hospitalizations was 5.4% (95% CI: 3.4–7.4%), which was 3.4 percentage points faster than the 18-month pre-intervention decline of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0–2.2%) per month (p = 0.004). Medicare CKD patients’ monthly ED visit rate of decline was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.2–4.8%) after intervention, which was 2.6 percentage points faster than the pre-intervention decline of 0.4% (95% CI: − 0.8 to 1.6%) per month (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: By creating care pathways that link primary and specialty care teams across settings with increased ambulatory infrastructure, healthcare systems have potential to reduce inpatient healthcare utilization.

Subjective experiences were reported for each trainee using questionnaires. METHODS: During the first four weeks of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, the objective impact of the pandemic on each trainee’s surgical caseload exposure was assessed using data from individual trainee logbook profiles in the deanery of the Republic of Ireland. Independent predictor variables included the trainee grade (ST 3 to 8), the individual trainee, the unit that the logbook was reported from, and the year in which the logbook was recorded. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to assess for any statistically significant predictor variables. The subjective experience of each trainee was captured using an electronic questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean number of total procedures per trainee over four weeks was 36.8 (7 to 99; standard deviation (SD) 19.67) in 2018, 40.6 (6 to 81; SD 17.90) in 2019, and 18.3 (3 to 65; SD 11.70) during the pandemic of 2020 (p = 0.043). Significant reductions were noted for all elective indicative procedures, including arthroplasty (p = 0.019), osteotomy (p = 0.045), nerve decompression (p = 0.024) and arthroscopy (p = 0.024). In contrast, none of the nine indicative procedures for trauma were reduced.

CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of operative cases per trainee has been significantly reduced for four of the 13 indicative procedures, as outlined by the JCST. Reassignment of trainees to high-volume institutions in the future may be a plausible approach to mitigate significant training deficits in those trainees worst impacted by the reduction in operative exposure.","Sheridan, Gerard A.; Hughes, Andrew J.; Quinlan, John F.; Sheehan, Eoin; O'Byrne, John M.",Bone Jt Open,https://doi.org/10.1302/2633-1462.110.bjo-2020-0149.r1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215097/,538

The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic infections reported in a seroprevalence survey in Hongkong, and the population size of Shenzhen are used to infer the SARS-CoV transfusion–transmission risk. Statistical resampling methods are used. RESULTS: Based on data from Shenzhen, Hongkong and Taiwan, the maximum and mean risk (per million) of SARS-CoV transmission from donors in Shenzhen were estimated as 23.57 (95% CI: 6.83–47.69) and 14.11 (95% CI: 11.00–17.22), respectively. The estimated risk peaked on April 02, 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, recent research data indicate that transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV is at least theoretically possible. Although the risk is low, with its rapid spread of the disease, appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and high fatality rate, public health authorities need to consider strategies for blood donor recruitment and virus inactivation during an epidemic to further ensure blood safety.","Shang, Guifang; Biggerstaff, Brad J.; Yang, Baocheng; Shao, Chaopeng; Farrugia, Albert",Transfus Apher Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18036985/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050207001371; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050207001371,538
678680,Varicella-zoster virus reactivation causing herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination – report of three cases,2021-09-16,"OBJECTIVES: The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is now available. This vaccine induces antibody production against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein S1 (S1-RBD). This study evaluated the performance of new immunoassays to measure this type of antibody. METHODS: Blood samples were collected at t0 (prime dose), after 21 days (t1, booster dose), and then after another 15 days (t2) from 70 health care professionals who had tested negative for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent vaccination with BNT162b2. RESULTS: Antibodies against S1-RBD were measured using 4 commercial assays. At t0, t1, and t2, the median antibody concentrations (interquartile range) were, respectively, 0.2 (0.1-0.4), 49.5 (19.1-95.7), and 888.0 (603.6-1,345.8) U/mL by Maglumi SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Shenzen New Industries Biomedical Engineering, Snibe Diagnostics); 0.0 (0.0-0.0), 7.9 (4.2-15.6), and 112.3 (76.4-205.6) U/mL by Atellica IM SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Siemens Healthineers); 0.0 (0.0-0.0), 59.9 (18.3-122.0), and 2,646.0 (1,351.2-4,124.0) U/mL by Elecsys Anti–SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics); and 1.8 (1.8-1.8), 184 (94-294), and 1,841.0 (1,080.0-2,900.0) AU/mL by LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (DiaSorin). The differences between medians at t0, t1, and t2 were all statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against nucleocapsid proteins (N) were also measured using Maglumi 2019-nCoV IgG assay, which showed all negative results. All the considered anti-RBD methods detected response to the vaccine, while the method directed against anti-N failed to show response.","Carta, Mariarosa; Marinello, Irene; Cappelletti, Anna; Rodolfi, Alessandra; Cerrito, Erica; Bernasconi, Camilla; Gottardo, Marlene; Dal Lago, Francesca; Rizzetto, Daniele; Barzon, Elena; Giavarina, Davide",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463321/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab107,538

The DMV biogenesis has been connected with the early secretory pathway. CoV-induced DMVs, however, lack conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi protein markers, leaving their membrane origins in question. We show that MHV co-opts the host cell machinery for COPII-independent vesicular ER export of a short-living regulator of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), EDEM1, to derive cellular membranes for replication. MHV infection causes accumulation of EDEM1 and OS-9, another short-living ER chaperone, in the DMVs. DMVs are coated with the nonlipidated LC3/Atg8 autophagy marker. Downregulation of LC3, but not inactivation of host cell autophagy, protects cells from CoV infection. Our study identifies the host cellular pathway hijacked for supplying CoV replication membranes and describes an autophagy-independent role for nonlipidated LC3-I.","Reggiori, Fulvio; Monastyrska, Iryna; Verheije, Monique H.; Calì, Tito; Ulasli, Mustafa; Bianchi, Siro; Bernasconi, Riccardo; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.; Molinari, Maurizio",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542253/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2010.05.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312810001769; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312810001769,538

Here, in an attempt to design an efficient vaccine, a thorough immunoinformatics approach was followed to predict the most suitable viral proteins epitopes for building that vaccine. METHODS: The amino acid sequences of four structural proteins (S, M, N, E) along with one potentially antigenic accessory protein (ORF1a) of SARS-CoV-2 were inspected for the most appropriate epitopes to be used for building the vaccine construct. Several immunoinformatics tools were used to assess the antigenicity (VaxiJen server), immunogenicity (IEDB immunogenicity tool), allergenicity (AlgPred), toxigenicity (ToxinPred server), interferon-gamma inducing capacity (IFNepitope server), and the physicochemical properties of the construct (ProtParam tool). RESULTS: The final candidate vaccine construct consisted of 468 amino acids, encompassing 29 epitopes. The CTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and immunogenicity assessment were four epitopes from S protein, one from M protein, two from N protein, 12 from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from E protein. While the HTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and INF-[Formula: see text] were one from S protein, three from M protein, six from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from N and E proteins. All the vaccine properties and its ability to trigger the humoral and cell-mediated immune response were validated computationally. Molecular modeling, docking to TLR3, simulation, and molecular dynamics were also carried out. Finally, a molecular clone using pET28::mAID expression plasmid vector was prepared. CONCLUSION: The overall results of the study suggest that the final multi-epitope chimeric construct is a potential candidate for an efficient protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Adam, Khalid Mohamed",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238372/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-021-00147-1,538
679754,"Validation of a combined ELISA to detect IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mild or moderate non-hospitalised patients",2021-03-26,"Background: Exercise rehabilitation programmes, traditionally involving supervised exercise sessions, have had to rapidly adapt to virtual delivery in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to minimise patient contacts. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the pandemic is likely to persist in the medium term and during this time it is important that the feasibility and effectiveness of remote solutions is considered. We have previously established the feasibility of the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer (ReStOre) intervention - a face to face multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer survivors. This study will examine the feasibility of a virtually delivered 12-week multi-component ReStOre@Home programme. Methods: This single arm feasibility study will recruit 12 patients who have completed curative treatment for oesophago-gastric cancer. Participants will complete the 12-week ReStOre@Home programme consisting of exercise (aerobic and resistance training), 1:1 dietary counselling and group education sessions through virtual delivery. Underpinned by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework, feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, adherence, retention, incidents, and acceptability. Acceptability will be assessed qualitatively through post-intervention interview and the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be assessed pre and post-intervention and will include measures of physical performance (cardiopulmonary exercise test, short physical performance battery, hand grip strength, Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire, and body composition), health related quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and oesophago-gastric cancer specific subscale (EORTC-QLQ-OG25), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and venous blood samples will be collected for the UGI Cancer Survivorship Biobank.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence rates among HCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-facing oncology HCPs working at three large UK hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing [Luminex and point-of-care (POC) tests] on two occasions 28 days apart (June–July 2020). RESULTS: In total, 434 HCPs were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%), administrators (10.1%); 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2. All participants were PCR negative during the study, but 18.4% were Luminex seropositive on day 1, of whom 42.5% were POC seropositive. Nurses had the highest seropositive prevalence trend (21.3%, P = 0.2). Thirty-eight per cent of seropositive HCPs reported previous SARS-CoV-2 symptoms: 1.9 times higher odds than seronegative HCPs (P = 0.01). Of 400 participants retested on day 28, 13.3% were Luminex seropositive (92.5% previously, 7.5% newly). Thirty-two per cent of initially seropositive HCPs were seronegative on day 28. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of PCR-negative patient-facing oncology HCPs, almost one in five were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of the pandemic's first wave. Our findings that one in three seropositive HCPs retested 28 days later became seronegative support regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing until widespread immunity is achieved by effective vaccination.","Favara, D.M.; McAdam, K.; Cooke, A.; Bordessa-Kelly, A.; Budriunaite, I.; Bossingham, S.; Houghton, S.; Doffinger, R.; Ainsworth, N.; Corrie, P.G.",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0936655521001540; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2021.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655521001540?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941453/,538
680617,Clinical characteristics and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in COVID-19 patients in Japan,2021-04-16,"Recently, [8] has proposed that heterogeneity of infectiousness (and susceptibility) across individuals in infectious diseases, plays a major role in affecting the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT). Such heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or ""super-spreading""). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute significantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely to get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R_0 {approx} 3 (attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in contrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1,2,4,10]. This work follows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness (susceptibility) has two ""faces"" whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1) Personal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The former is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is nullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is event-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective throughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]'s model to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is very sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R_0 {approx} 3 it can vary between 5% and 67%. Preliminary data from COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity is not reached at 5%. We address operational aspects and analyze the effects of lockdown strategies on the spread of a disease. We find that herd immunity (and HIT) is very sensitive to the lockdown type. While some lockdowns affect positively the disease blocking and increase herd immunity, others have adverse effects and reduce the herd immunity.","Tavori, J.; Levy, H.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250242; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250242v1?rss=1,538
680676,Response to the comments received on a case report SARS-CoV-2 viral sepsis with meningoencephalitis,2021-04-28,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? During the COVID‐19 pandemic, there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. While nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE? This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the COVID‐19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE? By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so, we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic and the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: While evidence has emerged concerning the impact of COVID‐19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care. AIM: This paper aimed to explore how COVID‐19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. METHOD: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed‐methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. DISCUSSION: Key themes within the data explore the following: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Service developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic.","Foye, Una; Dalton‐Locke, Christian; Harju‐Seppänen, Jasmine; Lane, Rebecca; Beames, Lewys; Vera San Juan, Norha; Johnson, Sonia; Simpson, Alan",J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608956/,538
680827,Responding to SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa: What can we learn from drug-resistant tuberculosis?,2020-05-29,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To understand the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on persons with alcohol use disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25(th), 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course. Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups. It is essential to understand and respond to the current situation, intervene early, and prevent further repercussions of the pandemic.

Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses. Based on these findings, a drug repurposing analysis was performed to identify potential drug candidates for combating COVID-19.","Krishnamoorthy, Pandikannan; Raj, Athira S.; Roy, Swagnik; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Kumar, Himanshu",Comput Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482520304546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104123; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482520304546?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260034/,538
682564,Presence of SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA in Aqueous Humor of Asymptomatic Individuals,2021-05-19,"OBJECTIVES: The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. We aim to quantify vulnerability to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing and mask usage. SETTING: The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. PARTICIPANTS: None (simulation study). RESULTS: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2–3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8–12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30–50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%–18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%–25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%–100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Stuart, Robyn M; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Klein, Dan J; Gray, Richard T; Hellard, Margaret; Scott, Nick",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879491/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045941,538
682678,Possible role of 99mTC-Sestamibi scintigraphy in the follow-up of Kawasaki-like disease related to SARS-CoV-2,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious and highly pathogenic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and it has become a pandemic. As a vulnerable population, university students are at high risk during the epidemic, as they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease because they receive incomplete information about the epidemic. In addition to the risk of death from infection, the epidemic has placed substantial psychological pressure on the public. In this respect, university students are more prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population because for most students, university life is their first time outside the structure of the family, and their mental development is still immature. Internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure on students, and unhealthy lifestyles also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students’ mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this study was to investigate the influencing factors of the psychological responses of Chinese university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study used data from a survey conducted in China between February 21 and 24, 2020, and the data set contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the compulsive behaviors portion of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A total of 2284 questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them were valid and were used for analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 nonmedical students. Among them, 251/2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.363, P=.02), past medical history (OR 3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR 3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health issues. Older students (OR 0.928, P=.02), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.410, P<.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.456, P<.001), and concern related to COVID-19 (OR 0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for mental health issues. CONCLUSIONS: According to the study results, mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are beneficial for identifying groups of university students who are at risk for possible mental health issues so that universities and families can prevent or intervene in the development of potential mental health issues at the early stage of their development.","Zhang, Xudong; Shi, Xin; Wang, Yang; Jing, Huiquan; Zhai, Qingqing; Li, Kunhang; Zhao, Dan; Zhong, Shiyu; Song, Yuequn; Zhang, Feng; Bao, Yijun",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156961/; https://doi.org/10.2196/29312,538

Mortality rates are greater in people with both cancer and Covid-19. In comparison, patients with non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) had reduced susceptibility to moderate Covid-19 mortality. The treatment and clinical management of NMIBC are consistent with BCG-mediated intravesical adjuvant therapy as a protective function against tumors. BCG vaccination exhibits a non-specific protective role against respiratory infections. This non-specific effect of BCG is partially mediated by innate immune memory due to epigenetic changes in innate and adaptive immune system cells induced by the microbe.

685088,Mounting evidence for immunizing previously infected subjects with a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,2021-05-21,"Women remain underrepresented within academic medicine despite past and present efforts to promote gender equity. The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock–extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.","Woitowich, Nicole C.; Jain, Shikha; Arora, Vineet M.; Joffe, Hadine",Acad Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003040/; https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003782,538
685237,Highly functional virus-specific cellular immune response in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Background Genome-wide association studies have found many genetic risk variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, how these risk variants affect deeper phenotypes such as disease progression and immune response remains elusive. Also, our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms from disease risk variants to various phenotypes is still limited. To address these problems, we performed an integrative multi-omics analysis of genotype, transcriptomics, and epigenomics for revealing gene regulatory mechanisms from disease variants to AD phenotypes. Method First, given the population gene expression data of a cohort, we construct and cluster its gene co-expression network to identify gene co-expression modules for various AD phenotypes. Next, we predict transcription factors (TFs) regulating co-expressed genes and AD risk SNPs that interrupt TF binding sites on regulatory elements. Finally, we construct a gene regulatory network (GRN) linking SNPs, interrupted TFs, and regulatory elements to target genes and gene modules for each phenotype in the cohort. This network thus provides systematic insights into gene regulatory mechanisms from risk variants to AD phenotypes. Results Our analysis predicted GRNs in three major AD-relevant regions: Hippocampus, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), Lateral Temporal Lobe (LTL). Comparative analyses revealed cross-region-conserved and region-specific GRNs, in which many immunological genes are present. For instance, SNPs rs13404184 and rs61068452 disrupt SPI1 binding and regulation of AD gene INPP5D in the Hippocampus and LTL. However, SNP rs117863556 interrupts bindings of REST to regulate GAB2 in DLPFC only. Driven by emerging neuroinflammation in AD, we used Covid-19 as a proxy to identify possible regulatory mechanisms for neuroimmunology in AD. To this end, we looked at the GRN subnetworks relating to genes from shared AD-Covid pathways. From those subnetworks, our machine learning analysis prioritized the AD-Covid genes for predicting Covid-19 severity. Decision Curve Analysis also validated our AD-Covid genes outperform known Covid-19 genes for classifying severe Covid-19 patients. This suggests AD-Covid genes along with linked SNPs can be potential novel biomarkers for neuroimmunology in AD. Finally, our results are open-source available as a comprehensive functional genomic map for AD, providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interplay among multi-omics, brain regions, gene functions like neuroimmunology, and phenotypes.","Khullar, Saniya; Wang, Daifeng",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189529/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449165,538

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective study of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 52 Spanish hospitals. The primary outcome was the need for critical care. We used a multivariable Bayesian model to estimate the probability of needing critical care. RESULTS: The study enrolled 350 children from March 12, 2020, to July 1, 2020: 292 (83.4%) and 214 (73.7%) were considered to have relevant COVID-19, of whom 24.2% required critical care. Four major clinical syndromes of decreasing severity were identified: multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) (17.3%), bronchopulmonary (51.4%), gastrointestinal (11.6%), and mild syndrome (19.6%). Main risk factors were high C-reactive protein and creatinine concentration, lymphopenia, low platelets, anemia, tachycardia, age, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and low oxygen saturation. These risk factors increased the risk of critical disease depending on the syndrome: the more severe the syndrome, the more risk the factors conferred. Based on our findings, we developed an online risk prediction tool (https://rserver.h12o.es/pediatria/EPICOAPP/, username: user, password: 0000). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include inflammation, cytopenia, age, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction. The more severe the syndrome, the more the risk factor increases the risk of critical illness. Risk of severe disease can be predicted with a Bayesian model.","Domínguez-Rodríguez, Sara; Villaverde, Serena; Sanz-Santaeufemia, Francisco J; Grasa, Carlos; Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Saavedra-Lozano, Jesús; Fumadó, Victoria; Epalza, Cristina; Serna-Pascual, Miquel; Alonso-Cadenas, José A; Rodríguez-Molino, Paula; Pujol-Morro, Joan; Aguilera-Alonso, David; Simó, Silvia; Villanueva-Medina, Sara; Iglesias-Bouzas, M Isabel; Mellado, M José; Herrero, Blanca; Melendo, Susana; De la Torre, Mercedes; Del Rosal, Teresa; Soler-Palacin, Pere; Calvo, Cristina; Urretavizcaya-Martínez, María; Pareja, Marta; Ara-Montojo, Fátima; Ruiz Del Prado, Yolanda; Gallego, Nerea; Illán Ramos, Marta; Cobos, Elena; Tagarro, Alfredo; Moraleda, Cinta",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34250967/,538

Objective To characterize population-level and relative change in suicide-related ED encounters among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study evaluated ED encounters in 2019 and 2020 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California-a large, integrated, community-based health system. Youth aged 5 to 17 years who presented to the ED with suicidal thoughts or behaviors were included. Exposure The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Population-level incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and percent relative effects for suicide-related ED encounters as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes in 4 periods in 2020 compared with the same periods in 2019. Results There were 2123 youth with suicide-related ED encounters in 2020 compared with 2339 in 2019. In the 2020 group, 1483 individuals (69.9%) were female and 1798 (84.7%) were aged 13 to 17 years. In the 2019 group, 1542 (65.9%) were female, and 1998 (85.4%) were aged 13 to 17 years. Suicide-related ED encounter incidence rates were significantly lower in March through May 2020 compared with this period in 2019 (IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.51-0.63; P < .001), then returned to prepandemic levels. However, suicide-related ED visits among female youth from June 1 to August 31, 2020, and September 1 through December 15, 2020, were significantly higher than in the corresponding months in 2019 (IRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.35; P = .04 and IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35; P < .001, respectively), while suicide-related ED visits for male youth decreased from September 1 through December 15, 2020 (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94). Youth with no history of outpatient mental health or suicide encounters (129.4%; 95% CI, 41.0-217.8) and those with comorbid psychiatric conditions documented at the ED encounter (6.7%; 95% CI, 1.0-12.3) had a higher risk of presenting with suicide-related problems from September to December 2020 vs the same period in 2019. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of youth experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, suicide-related presentations to the ED initially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely owing to shelter-in-place orders, then were similar to 2019 levels. However, a greater number of female youth, youth with no psychiatric history, and youth with psychiatric diagnoses at the time of the ED encounter presented for suicide-related concerns during the pandemic, suggesting these may be vulnerable groups in need of further interventions. Adjustments in care may be warranted to accommodate these groups during periods of crisis.","Ridout, Kathryn K; Alavi, Mubarika; Ridout, Samuel J; Koshy, Maria T; Awsare, Sameer; Harris, Brooke; Vinson, David R; Weisner, Constance M; Sterling, Stacy; Iturralde, Esti",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468724/,538

We investigated the association of these risk factors with massive PE and PEACE in a consecutive PE cohort (n = 364). METHODS: Massive PE was defined as an acute central clot (proximal to the lobar artery) in a patient with right heart strain and systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mg. PEACE was defined as any massive PE who died or required one or more of the following: ACLS, assisted ventilation, vasopressor use, thrombolytic therapy, or invasive thrombectomy, within seven days of PE diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analysis assessing associations between the risk factors (age, gender, comorbidities, PE provoking risks, and whether the PE was felt to be idiopathic) and massive PE or PEACE were performed. Significance was determined at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (n = 48) of patients presented with massive PE, and 9% (n = 32) had PEACE. In the final multivariate model, recent invasive procedure (RR = 7.4, p = 0.007), recent hospitalization (RR = 7.3, p = 0.002), and idiopathic PE (RR = 6.5, p = 0.003) were associated with massive PE. Only idiopathic PE (RR = 5.7, p = 0.005) was significantly associated with PEACE. No comorbidities or other PE provoking risks were associated with massive PE or PEACE. CONCLUSIONS: As a take-home message, recent invasive procedure, recent hospitalization, and idiopathic PE were associated with massive PE, and only idiopathic PE was associated with PEACE. Simultaneously, comorbidities like age or chronic cardiopulmonary disease seem not to be associated with massive PE or PEACE.","Hariharan, Praveen; Giordano, Nicholas; Muzikansky, Alona; Kabrhel, Christopher",Int J Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535077/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016752732100139X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016752732100139X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.01.057,538

Knowing what patients are searching for online can help plastic surgeons understand public interest, enhance patient engagement, and improve service provision. This study analyses the correlation between Google Trends (GT) search activity and the number of cosmetic procedures carried out in the UK. METHODS: GT search term data were analysed for popularity of use and geographical variation in the UK. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to analyse GT data against the number of cosmetic surgery procedures undertaken in the UK in the corresponding year and with 1-year time lag. RESULTS: GT score was higher for most colloquial search terms, such as “tummy tuck” compared to “abdominoplasty” (GT score 59 vs 6), but “otoplasty” was higher than “ear correction” (GT score 55 vs 19). Geographical variation showed that London ranked first in proportional search term activity for “brow lift” and Birmingham for “tummy tuck”. There was statistically significant positive correlation for three search terms and the number of corresponding surgeries undertaken. This increased to nine search terms when analysed with a 1-year time lag. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the trends in online search activity in the UK and their correlation with cosmetic procedures. The higher number of significant correlations with 1-year time lag may reflect the patient’s decision-making journey to undergo cosmetic surgery. These results can be utilised for SEO, thus leading to a better-informed public and more robust practice building.

Galectin-9 has been in the limelight in tumor immunology. Galectin-9 possesses its multiplex biological functions both extracellularly and intracellularly, plays a pivotal role in the modulation of adaptive and innate immunity, and induces immune tolerance. NK-92MI cell lines against different malignancies were extensively studied, and recently published trials used genetically chimeric antigen receptor-transfected NK-92MI cells in tumor immunotherapy. Besides the intensive research in tumor immunotherapy, limited information is available on their immune-checkpoint expression and the impact of checkpoint ligands on their effector functions. To uncover the therapeutic potential of modulating Galectin-9-related immunological pathways in NK-cell-based therapy, we investigated the dose-dependent effect of soluble Galectin-9 on the TIM-3 checkpoint receptor and NKG2D, CD69, FasL, and perforin expression of NK-92MI cells. We also examined how their cytotoxicity and cytokine production was altered after Gal-9 treatment and in the presence of different serum supplements using flow cytometric analysis. Our study provides evidence that the Galectin-9/TIM-3 pathway plays an important role in the regulation of NK cell function, and about the modulatory role of Galectin-9 on the cytotoxicity and cytokine production of NK-92MI cells in the presence of different serum supplements. We hope that our results will aid the development of novel NK-cell-based strategies that target Galectin-9/TIM-3 checkpoint in tumors resistant to T-cell-based immunotherapy.","Meggyes, Matyas; Nagy, David U; Balassa, Timea; Godony, Krisztina; Peterfalvi, Agnes; Szereday, Laszlo; Polgar, Beata",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439744/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081066,538
