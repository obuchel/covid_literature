3877,3877,3877,Ambulatory and stationary healthcare use in survivors of ARDS during the first year after discharge from ICU: findings from the DACAPO cohort,20.36749,10.859101,2019-06-14,"BACKGROUND: For many survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the process from discharge from intensive care unit (ICU) to recovery is long and difficult. However, healthcare use after discharge from ICU has received only little attention by research. This study sets out to investigate the extent of ambulatory and stationary healthcare use among survivors of ARDS in Germany (multicenter DACAPO cohort) and to analyze predictors of stationary healthcare use. RESULTS: A total of 396 survivors of ARDS provided data at 1 year after discharge from ICU. Fifty percent of 1-year survivors were hospitalized for 48 days or longer after discharge from ICU, with 10% spending more than six out of 12 months in stationary care. The duration of hospitalization increased significantly by the length of the initial ICU stay. All participants reported at least one outpatient visit (including visits to general practitioners), and 50% contacted four or more different medical specialties within the first year after discharge from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: For most of the patients, the first year after ARDS is characterized by an extensive amount of healthcare utilization, especially with regard to stationary health care. These findings shed light on the substantial morbidity of patients after ARDS and contribute to a better understanding of the situation of patients following discharge from ICU.","Brandstetter, Susanne; Dodoo-Schittko, Frank; Brandl, Magdalena; Blecha, Sebastian; Bein, Thomas; Apfelbacher, Christian",Ann Intensive Care,235,12
4244,4244,4244,Aortic volume determines global end-diastolic volume measured by transpulmonary thermodilution,20.267134,11.169333,2020-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) measured by transpulmonary thermodilution is regarded as indicator of cardiac preload. A bolus of cold saline injected in a central vein travels through the heart and lung, but also the aorta until detection in a femoral artery. While it is well accepted that injection in the inferior vena cava results in higher values, the impact of the aortic volume on GEDV is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a larger aortic volume directly translates to a numerically higher GEDV measurement. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 88 critically ill patients with thermodilution monitoring and who did require a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan. Aortic volumes derived from imaging were compared with GEDV measurements in temporal proximity. RESULTS: Median aortic volume was 194 ml (interquartile range 147 to 249 ml). Per milliliter increase of the aortic volume, we found a GEDV increase by 3.0 ml (95% CI 2.0 to 4.1 ml, p < 0.001). In case a femoral central venous line was used for saline bolus injection, GEDV raised additionally by 2.1 ml (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7 ml, p = 0.01) per ml volume of the vena cava inferior. Aortic volume explained 59.3% of the variance of thermodilution-derived GEDV. When aortic volume was included in multivariate regression, GEDV variance was unaffected by sex, age, body height, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aortic volume is a substantial confounding variable for GEDV measurements performed with transpulmonary thermodilution. As the aorta is anatomically located after the heart, GEDV should not be considered to reflect cardiac preload. Guiding volume management by raw or indexed reference ranges of GEDV may be misleading.","Akohov, Aleksej; Barner, Christoph; Grimmer, Steffen; Francis, Roland CE; Wolf, Stefan",Intensive Care Med Exp,235,12

METHODS: An adult manikin was connected to a dual-chamber model lung, which was driven by a critical care ventilator to simulate spontaneous breathing. A HFNC system was utilized with temperature at 37 ° C while gas flow at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/min. Inspiration synchronized and continuous aerosol generation were compared at different positions (at the inlet of humidifier vs close to patient). One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement. Continuous nebulizer needs to be placed at the inlet of humidifier.","Li, Jie; Wu, Wei; Fink, James B.",Intensive Care Med Exp,235,12

The induced temperature rise generated at these exposure parameters, hereafter termed thermal gradient, was measured and applied independently to cell suspensions in order to differentiate inactivation triggered by electric field (E-field) from heating. Treated cell suspensions were plated and cellular inactivation was quantified by colony counts after a 24-hour (h) incubation period. Additionally, cells from both exposure conditions were incubated with various antibiotic-soaked discs to determine if nsPEF exposure would induce changes in antibiotic susceptibility. Results indicate that, for both species, the total delivered energy (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) determined the magnitude of cell inactivation. Specifically, for 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm(−1) exposures, L. acidophilus was more sensitive to the inactivation effects of nsPEF than E. coli, however, for the 13.5 kV cm(−1) exposures E. coli was more sensitive, suggesting that L. acidophilus may need to meet an E-field threshold before significant inactivation can occur. Results also indicate that antibiotic susceptibility was enhanced by multiple nsPEF exposures, as observed by increased zones of growth inhibition. Moreover, for both species, a temperature increase of ≤ 20 °C (89% of exposures) was not sufficient to significantly alter cell inactivation, whereas none of the thermal equivalent exposures were sufficient to change antibiotic susceptibility categories.","Martens, Stacey L.; Klein, Savannah; Barnes, Ronald A.; TrejoSanchez, Patricia; Roth, Caleb C.; Ibey, Bennett L.",AMB Express,235,12

A positive correlation between the ratio of target gene versus siRNA and the suppression of SPAG9 expression was observed. Further, the cotransfection of BS/U6/spag9 with pcDNA-SPAG9 and pFlag-CMV2-JNK-3 resulted in specific suppression of SPAG9 without affecting JNK-3 expression.

Brain injury and neurology, renal failure and endocrinology, metabolism and nutrition, sepsis, infections and pneumonia",20.125292,10.990229,2008-12-09,"OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes respiratory failure in patients with extensive pulmonary parenchymal involvement, but it is a rare cause of ARDS. We report our experience of TB presenting with ARDS. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 187 patients admitted with a diagnosis of ARDS over the previous 7 years. Data are presented in a descriptive fashion using mean±SD or median (range). RESULTS: Nine (4.9%) of 187 patients had ARDS secondary to tuberculosis. All patients were mechanically ventilated. The diagnosis was made on clinico-radiological grounds and confirmed later using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy in seven patients, and lymph node biopsy and examination of the joint aspirate in the remaining two. All patients were empirically started on anti-tubercular therapy with a median time to initiation of therapy being 3 days (range 2–8 days). Three patients had multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) without any evidence of bacterial infection. Seven of nine (77.8%) patients survived; two died because of severe ARDS, MODS, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is an uncommon but definite cause of ARDS, and in patients with ARDS of obscure aetiology where the clinical features suggest tuberculosis as the inciting cause, antitubercular therapy should be started empirically and the diagnosis actively pursued later.","Agarwal, Ritesh; Gupta, Dheeraj; Aggarwal, Ashutosh N.; Behera, Digamber; Jindal, Surinder K.",Intensive Care Med,235,12
5760,5760,5760,ECLS in pertussis: does it have a role?,20.41699,11.407665,1998,"An increase in the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol occurs in a wide variety of tissues by the action of specific ligands(1–3). In platelets, the interaction of thrombin with its receptor initiates the degradation of phosphatidylinositol by the action of a specific phospholipase C (refs 4–8). In normal conditions of stimulation, the resultant 1,2-diacylglycerol is rapidly and completely phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid(4–11). The formation of phosphatidic acid precedes the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids of stimulated platelets(5). This early appearence of phosphatidate might result in the initial production of arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidic acid by the action of a phospholipase A(2) specific for phosphatidate(12). Phosphatidate/lysophosphatidate could induce calciumgating(13–15) and subsequently stimulate phospholipases of the A(2)-type(8), that degrade phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and a further fraction of phosphatidylinositol(6). Alternatively, the lysophosphatidate produced may serve as a substrate for the transfer of arachidonate directly from other phospholipids(16,17) to form new phosphatidate which in turn can release more arachidonate. Overall, such a sequence would be equivalent to phospholipase A(2) activation of other phospholipids. Our present data indicate that when the release of arachidonic acid is completely inhibited by cyclic AMP or quinacrine, phosphatidic acid is redirected entirely to phosphatidylinositol and there is no production of arachidonate. In these conditions, the availability of calcium might be profoundly restricted. The correlation in platelets of a phosphatidylinositol by a specific phospholipase A(2) might suggest that these phenomena are applicable to activations in other cell systems.","Lapetina, Eduardo G.; Billah, M.

5773,5773,5773,Leukocytes: friend or foe,20.328148,11.143324,2000,"Natural killer (NK) activity is a poorly understood component of the immune system, generally identified as the ability to kill certain tumour cells(1,2). Perhaps the most controversial issue has been the lineage to which cells displaying this activity belong. Extensive studies of surface antigens on cells with NK activity in both mouse and man have led to enigmatic results, such cells apparently bearing markers of both T-cell (Thy-1 and E receptor) and myeloid (Mac-1 and OKM1) lineages(3–6). A fresh approach to this problem would be to take cells of known lineage and test whether they express, or could be induced to express, NK cell function. Using this approach we show here that monoclonal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines can be induced, by culture in high concentrations of spleen cell supernatant, to express a new lytic activity apparently identical with that of splenic cells NK activity. Preliminary evidence implicates both interleukin-2(IL-2) and interferon (IFN) as mediators of this phenomenon. These findings clearly demonstrate that cells of T cell lineage have the capacity to express NK activity.","Brooks, Colin G.",Nature,235,12

Design: Prospective randomized controlled study. Setting: Two intensive care units, university hospital and county hospital, respectively. Patients: Twenty-two critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Interventions: Albumin synthesis was measured twice in each patient, with a 5-day interval. The patients in the control group (n=11) received standard intensive care unit (ICU) treatment between measurements, whereas those in the GH group (n=11) also received 0.3 U/kg daily of human recombinant GH. Measurements and results: Albumin synthesis was measured by labeling with L-[(2)H(5)]phenylalanine. In the control group, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin was 16.3±4.1%/day (mean and SD) in the first measurement and 15.7±4.2%/day 5 days later (NS), whereas in the GH group the corresponding values were 17.0±4.7%/day and 16.7±5.5%/day (NS). The calculated absolute synthesis rates of albumin, based on FSR and intravascular albumin mass, also showed no effect of GH. Conclusion: Albumin synthesis rates were consistently higher in the two groups of critically ill patients than previously reported values in healthy subjects. However, GH treatment for 5 days neither stimulated nor inhibited albumin synthesis rates in these critically ill patients.","Barle, Hans; Gamrin, Lena; Essén, Pia; McNurlan, Margaret A.; Garlick, Peter J.; Wernerman, Jan",Intensive Care Med,235,12
5831,5831,5831,OP 001-035,20.227747,11.167337,2005-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Molecular targeted therapy increased overall and disease-free survival in a wide range of malignancies. Although generally well tolerated compared to chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy may be associated with adverse events requiring ICU admission. Informing clinicians about clinical features of these toxic events might maintain awareness and favor early recognition, prompt diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published case reports of molecular targeted therapy-related life-threatening toxicity that led to ICU admission. The search used the Pubmed database using medical subject heading (Mesh) terms, including all FDA-approved molecular targeted therapy (TT), up to March 2019. No language restriction was applied. All cases reports of patients admitted to the ICU for molecular targeted therapy-related toxicity were included. Non-FDA-approved combinations of treatments or hormonal therapy were not included. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-three cases were identified. Nearly half of them (n = 102; 40.3%) were related to anti-angiogenic agents, mostly for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications. Other molecules responsible for adverse events were chiefly immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 85, 33.6%), EGFR inhibitors (n = 33; 13.0%), and anti-HER2 (n = 10; 4.0%). They were associated with adverse events such as respiratory or hypersensitivity events. Management and outcomes associated with these life-threatening complications are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the vast number of treated patients, only 253 cases of molecular therapy-related severe toxicity are reported in cancer patients. Symptoms and biomarkers that depict these events need to be better identified as to allow appropriate reporting and improving dose and schedule of the treatment adapted to each patient.

We assessed whether haplotypes in the EPCR gene modify the risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock (SS/SS) development in critically ill patients. METHODS: Three polymorphisms in the EPCR gene were genotyped in 389 Caucasian critically ill patients, hospitalized in the intensive care units of two major hospitals in Athens, Greece. Multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, sex, and diagnosis was performed to determine the effect of haplotypes H1 and H3 in the EPCR gene on the development of SS/SS. RESULTS: H2 carriers versus all other genotypes combined had a nonsignificant excess of SS/SS (p = 0.087). SS/SS occurred in 38.8 % of critically ill patients carrying minor alleles belonging to both H1 and H3 haplotypes, in 58.0 % of H1 carriers, 64.3 % of H3 carriers, and 65.2 % of patients carrying all common alleles (H2). Compared with H2 carriers, the odds ratios (OR) for developing SS/SS were 0.34 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.16–0.76, p = 0.008] for simultaneous H1 and H3 carriers, 0.65 (95 % CI 0.37–1.13, p = 0.123) for H1 carriers, and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.39–1.70, p = 0.590) for H3 carriers.

Setting: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary children's hospital. Methods: The data from 60 consecutive critically ill mechanically ventilated children who underwent NB-BAL was reviewed from November 1997 to December 1999. PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database. Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg). Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support. Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL. However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL. Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications. Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed. All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.","Burmester, Margarita; Mok, Quen",Intensive Care Med,235,12

We wished to determine the potential for pulmonary overexpression of the extracellular isoform of superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) to reduce the severity of endotoxin-induced lung injury. METHODS: Animals were randomly allocated to undergo intratracheal instillation of (1) surfactant alone (vehicle); (2) adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing a null transgene (AAV-null); and (3) adeno-associated virus vectors containing the EC-SOD transgene (AAV-EC-SOD) and endotoxin was subsequently administered intratracheally. Two additional groups were randomized to receive (1) vehicle or (2) AAV-EC-SOD, and to undergo sham (vehicle) injury. The severity of the lung injury was assessed in all animals 24 h later. RESULTS: Endotoxin produced a severe lung injury compared to sham injury. The AAV vector encoding EC-SOD increased lung EC-SOD concentrations, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the lung. EC-SOD overexpression decreased the severity of endotoxin-induced ALI, reducing the decrement in systemic oxygenation and lung compliance, decreasing lung permeability and decreasing histologic injury. EC-SOD attenuated pulmonary inflammation, decreased bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, and reduced interleukin-6 and CINC-1 concentrations. The AAV vector itself did not contribute to inflammation or to lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary overexpression of EC-SOD protects the lung against endotoxin-induced ALI.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Ben Taub General Hospital (BTGH), Houston, Texas, and King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH), Mumbai, India. PATIENTS: Women admitted during pregnancy or 6 weeks postpartum between 1992 and 2001. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients from BTGH (n=174) and KEMH (n=754) had comparable age, number of organs affected, incidence of medical disorders (30%), liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. Fewer KEMH patients received prenatal care (27 vs 86%) and came to hospital within 24 h of onset of symptoms (60 vs 90%). They had higher APACHE II scores (median 16 vs 10), greater incidence of neurological (63 vs 36%), renal (50 vs 37%), and cardiovascular dysfunction (39 vs 29%). Severe malaria, viral hepatitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and poisoning were common medical disorders. The BTGH group had higher incidence of respiratory dysfunction (59 vs 46%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (40 vs 23%), placental anomalies, HELLP syndrome, chorioamnionitis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, puerperal sepsis, urinary infection, bacteremia, substance abuse, and asthma. More BTGH patients required mechanical ventilation and blood component therapy, whereas more KEMH patients needed dialysis. Of BTGH patients, 78.2% were delivered by cesarean section (vs 15.4%). Maternal (2.3 vs 25%) and fetal (13 vs 51%) mortality were lower in BTGH patients. CONCLUSIONS: There were marked differences in medical diseases, organ failure, and intensive care needs. Higher mortality in the Indian ICU may be due to difference in case mix, inadequate prenatal care, delay in reaching hospital, and greater severity of illness.","Munnur, Uma; Karnad, Dilip R.; Bandi, Venkata D.

Consequently, the fast e.p.s.p. in neurones of sympathetic ganglia, elicited by a nicotinic action of acetylcholine (ACh)(2), could be followed by a hyperpolarization, produced by the opening of M channels during the depolarizing e.p.s.p. and their subsequent slow closure (time constant∼150 ms)(1). This introduces the concept that transmitter-induced p.s.ps may trigger voltage-sensitive conductances other than those initiating action potentials, and that in the present case this could produce a true post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization.

AKI is a common clinical critical illness with few drugs options offering effective treatment. Phillyrin (Phil), the main pharmacological component of Forsythia suspensa, possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the effects of Phil on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI have yet to be reported. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of Phil on HS damage and inflammatory signaling pathways in LPS-induced AKI. Results revealed that Phil reduces pathological changes and improves renal function in LPS-induced AKI. Further analysis indicated that Phil effectively protects against glycocalyx HS degradation in LPS-stimulated EA.hy926 cells in vitro and LPS-induced AKI mice in vivo. The protective effect of Phil on HS damage may be associated with the isolate’s ability to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species, and decrease expression levels of cathepsin L and heparanase in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ELISA and Western blot results revealed that Phil inhibits the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and decreases the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in LPS-induced ARDS mice. In general, protection against endothelial glycocalyx HS damage and inhibition of inflammatory responses by Phil may be used as treatment targets for LPS-induced AKI.","Zhang, Dong; Qi, Boyang; Li, Dongxiao; Feng, Jiali; Huang, Xiao; Ma, Xiaohong; Huang, Lina; Wang, Xiaozhi; Liu, Xiangyong",Inflammation,235,12

Remarkable progress has been made in attenuating the inflammatory injury associated with ALI using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based cell and gene therapy. However, to date, the benefits of interleukin-35 (IL-35)-modified MSCs in ALI intervention have not been investigated. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice randomly received intravenous infusion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) constitutively expressing IL-35 (IL-35-GFP-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (8 × 10(5) cells per mice) or isotonic saline 7 days before ALI modeling to investigate the effect and related mechanism. ALI was performed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation for 24 h. Normal mice served as the sham group. The results indicated that compared with GFP-ADSCs, IL-35-modified ADSCs significantly increased cellular and pulmonary IL-10 and IL-35 production. Pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs markedly reduced body weight loss, pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio and pathological injury. The PO(2) was rescued to normal levels in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs. IL-35-ADSCs infusion apparently inhibited IL-6 release, protein leakage and MPO activity but greatly elevated IL-35 level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Splenic regulatory T cells in IL-35-ADSCs-pretreated mice got effective increase. Moreover, IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment remarkably inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and greatly decreased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. In conclusion, pretreatment with IL-35-engineered ADSCs provided effective protection against LPS-induced ALI through suppression of pulmonary inflammation and, thus, might be a promising strategy to improve outcomes after ALI. The enhanced paracrine and immunosuppressive capacity of IL-35-ADSCs might contribute to their beneficial effects. However, further studies are needed to illuminate the detailed mechanism.","Zhang, Xiaoning; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Ju, Mingyan; Li, Jiaci; Jing, Yaqing; Zhao, Yuxia; Gu, Chao; Dong, Ming; Li, Guang; Liu, Yi",Inflammopharmacology,235,12

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study in which each patient served as his/her own control. SETTING: Multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric ICU. PATIENTS: 8 ventilator dependent premature infants with CLD. INTERVENTIONS: Salbutamol, 10 μg/kg was given intravenously, and 10–19 h later, twice 100 μg as pressurized aerosol, or vice versa, sequence randomized. The pressurized aerosol was delivered by a metered dose inhaler into a newly developed aerosol holding chamber, integrated into the inspiratory limb of the patient circuit.

METHODS: In 16 ICUs, we prospectively collected adverse events during or within 24 h after BAL and assessed the BAL input for decision making in consecutive adult patients. The occurrence of a clinical adverse event at least of grade 3, i.e., sufficiently severe to need therapeutic action(s), including modification(s) in respiratory support, defined poor BAL tolerance. The BAL input for decision making was declared satisfactory if it allowed to interrupt or initiate one or several treatments. RESULTS: We included 483 BAL in 483 patients [age 63 years (interquartile range (IQR) 53–72); female gender: 162 (33.5%); simplified acute physiology score II: 48 (IQR 37-61); immunosuppression 244 (50.5%)]. BAL was begun in non-intubated patients in 105 (21.7%) cases. Sixty-seven (13.9%) patients reached the grade 3 of adverse event or higher. Logistic regression showed that a BAL performed by a non-experienced physician (non-pulmonologist, or intensivist with less than 10 years in the specialty or less than 50 BAL performed) was the main predictor of poor BAL tolerance in non-intubated patients [OR: 3.57 (95% confidence interval 1.04–12.35); P = 0.04]. A satisfactory BAL input for decision making was observed in 227 (47.0%) cases and was not predictable using logistic regression.

Here, we summarize the primary points of contention regarding biodiversity–disease relationships and suggest that vector-borne, generalist wildlife and zoonotic pathogens are the types of parasites most likely to be affected by changes to biodiversity. One synthesis on this topic revealed a positive correlation between biodiversity and human disease burden across countries, but as biodiversity changed over time within these countries, this correlation became weaker and more variable. Another synthesis—a meta-analysis of generally smaller-scale experimental and field studies—revealed a negative correlation between biodiversity and infectious diseases (a dilution effect) in various host taxa. These results raise the question of whether biodiversity–disease relationships are more negative at smaller spatial scales. If so, biodiversity conservation at the appropriate scales might prevent wildlife and zoonotic diseases from increasing in prevalence or becoming problematic (general proactive approaches). Further, protecting natural areas from human incursion should reduce zoonotic disease spillover. By contrast, for some infectious diseases, managing particular species or habitats and targeted biomedical approaches (targeted reactive approaches) might outperform biodiversity conservation as a tool for disease control. Importantly, biodiversity conservation and management need to be considered alongside other disease management options. These suggested guiding principles should provide common ground that can enhance scientific and policy clarity for those interested in simultaneously improving wildlife and human health.","Rohr, Jason R.; Civitello, David J.; Halliday, Fletcher W.; Hudson, Peter J.; Lafferty, Kevin D.; Wood, Chelsea L.; Mordecai, Erin A.",Nat Ecol Evol,235,12

We now understand that one mechanism in which NO/SNOs provide cardiovascular protection is through their direct inhibition of cardiac G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2) activity via S-nitrosylation of GRK2 at cysteine 340 (C340). This maintains GPCR homeostasis, including β-adrenergic receptors, through curbing receptor GRK2-mediated desensitization. Previously, we have developed a knockin mouse (GRK2-C340S) where endogenous GRK2 is resistant to dynamic S-nitrosylation, which led to increased GRK2 desensitizing activity. This unchecked regulation of cardiac GRK2 activity resulted in significantly more myocardial damage after ischemic injury that was resistant to NO-mediated cardioprotection. Although young adult GRK2-C340S mice show no overt phenotype, we now report that as these mice age, they develop significant cardiovascular dysfunction due to the loss of SNO-mediated GRK2 regulation. This pathological phenotype is apparent as early as 12 mo of age and includes reduced cardiac function, increased cardiac perivascular fibrosis, and maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, which are common maladies found in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). There are also vascular reactivity and aortic abnormalities present in these mice. Therefore, our data demonstrate that a chronic and global increase in GRK2 activity is sufficient to cause cardiovascular remodeling and dysfunction, likely due to GRK2’s desensitizing effects in several tissues. Because GRK2 levels have been reported to be elevated in elderly CVD patients, GRK2-C340 mice can give insight into the aged-molecular landscape leading to CVD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Research on G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the setting of cardiovascular aging is largely unknown despite its strong established functions in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. This study uses a mouse model of chronic GRK2 overactivity to further investigate the consequences of long-term GRK2 on cardiac function and structure. We report for the first time that chronic GRK2 overactivity was able to cause cardiac dysfunction and remodeling independent of surgical intervention, highlighting the importance of GRK activity in aged-related heart disease.","Lieu, Melissa; Traynham, Christopher J.; de Lucia, Claudio; Pfleger, Jessica; Piedepalumbo, Michela; Roy, Rajika; Petovic, Jennifer; Landesberg, Gavin; Forrester, Steven J.; Hoffman, Matthew; Grisanti, Laurel A.; Yuan, Ancai; Gao, Erhe; Drosatos, Konstantinos; Eguchi, Satoru; Scalia, Rosario; Tilley, Douglas G.; Koch, Walter J.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,235,12

The control of gas exchange, and in particular oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels, is fundamental in mechanically ventilated patients after resuscitation, as arterial blood gases derangement might have important effects on the cerebral blood flow and systemic physiology. In particular, the pathophysiological role of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) levels is strongly underestimated, as its alterations quickly affect also the changes of intracellular pH, and consequently influence metabolic energy and oxygen demand. Hypo/hypercapnia, as well as mechanical ventilation during and after resuscitation, can affect CO(2) levels and trigger a dangerous pathophysiological vicious circle related to the relationship between pH, cellular demand, and catecholamine levels. The developing hypocapnia can nullify the beneficial effects of the hypothermia.

We hypothesised that CENP applied regionally to the thorax or the abdomen only, increases the caudal end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure depending on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in lung-injured pigs. Eight pigs were anesthetised and mechanically ventilated in the supine position. Pressure sensors were placed in the left pleural space, and a lung injury was induced by saline lung lavages. A CENP shell was placed at the abdomen and thorax (randomised order), and animals were ventilated with PEEP 15, 7 and zero cmH(2)O (15 min each).

Electrical impedance tomography allowed assessment of centre of ventilation. RESULTS: Compared to positive pressure ventilation alone, the caudal transpulmonary pressure was significantly increased by CENP of ≤ 20 cmH(2)O at all PEEP levels.

The driving pressure decreased at CENP of ≤ 10 at PEEP of 0 and 7 cmH(2)O (P < 0.001 each) but increased at CENP of – 30 cmH(2)O during the highest PEEP (P = 0.001). CENP of – 30 cmH(2)O reduced the mechanical power during zero PEEP (P < 0.001). Both elastance (P < 0.001) and resistance (P < 0.001) were decreased at CENP ≤ 30 at PEEP of 0 and 7 cmH(2)O. Oxygenation increased at CENP of ≤ 20 at PEEP of 0 and 7 cmH(2)O (P < 0.001 each). Applying external negative pressure significantly shifted the centre of aeration towards dorsal lung regions irrespectively of the PEEP level. Cardiac output decreased significantly at CENP -20 cmH(2)O at all PEEP levels (P < 0.001). Effects on caudal transpulmonary pressure, elastance and cardiac output were more pronounced when CENP was applied to the abdomen compared with the thorax. CONCLUSIONS: In this lung injury model in pigs, CENP increased the end-expiratory caudal transpulmonary pressure. This lead to a shift of lung aeration towards dependent zones as well as improved respiratory mechanics and oxygenation, especially when CENP was applied to the abdomen as compared to the thorax. CENP values ≤ 20 cmH(2)O impaired the haemodynamics.","Scharffenberg, Martin; Wittenstein, Jakob; Herzog, Moritz; Tauer, Sebastian; Vivona, Luigi; Theilen, Raphael; Bluth, Thomas; Kiss, Thomas; Koch, Thea; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; de Abreu, Marcelo Gama; Huhle, Robert",Intensive Care Med Exp,235,12

There are no therapies for sepsis, and it has become a global cause for concern. Advances in patient care and management now mean that most patients survive the initial hyper-inflammatory phase of sepsis but progress to a later immunosuppressed phase, where 30% of patients die due to secondary infection. Deficits in the adaptive immune response may play a major role in sepsis patient mortality. The adaptive immune response involves a number of cell types including T cells, B cells and dendritic cells, all with immunoregulatory roles aimed at limiting damage and returning immune homeostasis after infection or insult. However, in sepsis, adaptive immune cells experience cell death or exhaustion, meaning that they have defective effector and memory responses ultimately resulting in an ineffective or suppressed immune defence. CD4+ T cells seem to be the most susceptible to cell death during sepsis and have ensuing defective secretory profiles and functions. Regulatory T cells seem to evade apoptosis and contribute to the immune suppression observed with sepsis. Preclinical studies have identified a number of new targets for therapy in sepsis including anti-apoptotic agents and monoclonal antibodies aimed at reducing cell death, exhaustion and maintaining/restoring adaptive immune cell functions. While early phase clinical trials have demonstrated safety and encouraging signals for biologic effect, larger scale clinical trial testing is required to determine whether these strategies will prove effective in improving outcomes from sepsis.","Brady, Jack; Horie, Shahd; Laffey, John G.",Intensive Care Med Exp,235,12

One of the most abundant microRNAs in lymphocytes is miR-181a, which controls T cell receptor (TCR) activation thresholds in thymic selection as well as in peripheral T cell responses. We previously found that miR-181a levels decline in T cells in the elderly. In this study, we identified TCF1 as a transcriptional regulator of pri-miR-181a. A decline in TCF1 levels in old individuals accounted for the reduced miR-181a expression impairing TCR signaling. Inhibition of GSK3ß restored expression of miR-181a by inducing TCF1 in T cells from old adults. GSK3ß inhibition enhanced TCR signaling to increase downstream expression of activation markers and production of IL-2. The effect involved the upregulation of miR-181a and the inhibition of DUSP6 expression. Thus, inhibition of GSK3ß can restore responses of old T cells by inducing miR-181a expression through TCF1.","Ye, Zhongde; Gould, Timothy M.; Zhang, Huimin; Jin, Jun; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, Jörg J.",NPJ Aging Mech Dis,235,12

Despite that these probiotics have GRAS (generally regarded as safe) and qualified presumption of safety (QPS) statuses, the safety of particular strains still needs to be thoroughly studied. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain by investigating toxicity and the effects on gut microbiota in experimental animal model. Male BALB/c mice (7–8 weeks, weight 20–24 g) were treated with amounts of Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain: 5 × 10(6), 5 × 10(8), or 5 × 10(9) CFU/animal once per day during 7 days, or in the amount of 1 × 10(10) CFU/animal once per day during 3 days (most of the proposed probiotic doses for humans—from 10(8) to 10(9) CFU) and monitored during 14 days. Blood tests and serum biochemistry were conducted; the cecal content from mice of the experimental and control groups were freshly collected and analyzed. At the end of the experiments (15th day), the presence of LAB in the heart, liver, kidney, and mesenteric lymph nodes and peripheral blood was determined; histology of the brain, liver, heart, fragments of the small and large intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes was conducted. Survival rate of BALB/c mice treated with Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain in different concentrations in toxicity experiments during 14 days was 100%. We observed no signs of toxicity as changes in gait, lethargy, sleep, somatomotor activity as well as changes in fur, eyes, skin and mucous membranes, tremors, behavior pattern, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, and local injuries in mice from all experimental groups. After administration of probiotic strain, the number of opportunistic bacteria in cecal contents, such as Staphylococcus spp., Candida spp., Pseudomonas spp., and total aerobic and optionally anaerobic bacteria decreased compared to controls; the population of beneficial bacteria such as lactobacilli increased in cecal contents of these mice. LAB were not detected in the peripheral blood, heart, liver, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph nodes after administration of this strain to intact mice. Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain is safe at dose up to 10(10) CFU/animal during 3- and 7-day oral administration to mice and has a positive effect on the gut microbiota composition; it could be potentially considered as safe probiotic for humans.","L.M., Lazarenko; L.P., Babenko; S.G., Gichka; L.O., Sakhno; O.M., Demchenko; R.V., Bubnov; L.M., Sichel; M.Ya., Spivak",Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins,235,12

Molecular data indicate that the resurgence of pertussis in populations with high vaccine coverage is associated with genomic adaptation of B. pertussis, to vaccine selection pressure. Pertactin-negative B. pertussis isolates were suspected to contribute to the reduced vaccine effectiveness. It was shown that one of the isolates used is PRN deficient. The mice were intranasally challenged with bacterial suspension containing approximately 5 × 10 (7) CFU/ml B. pertussis. The immunogenicity of the tested vaccines against PT (pertussis toxin), PRN (pertactin), FHA (filamentous haemagglutinin) and FIM (fimbriae types 2 and 3) was examined. The commercial whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines induced an immunity effective at eliminating the genetically different B. pertussis isolates from the lungs. However, the elimination of the PRN-deficient isolate from the lungs of mice vaccinated with commercial vaccines was delayed as compared to the PRN ( +) isolate, suggesting phenotypic differences with the circulating isolates and vaccine strains. The most effective vaccine was the experimental vaccine with the composition identical to that of the strains used for infection.","Prygiel, Marta; Mosiej, Ewa; Wdowiak, Karol; Górska, Paulina; Polak, Maciej; Lis, Klaudia; Krysztopa-Grzybowska, Katarzyna; Zasada, Aleksandra Anna",Med Microbiol Immunol,235,12

It has been classified as an inhibitory coreceptor for the B-cell receptor because of its function in establishing a baseline level of B-cell inhibition. The restricted expression of CD22 on B cells and its inhibitory function make it an attractive target for B-cell depletion in cases of B-cell malignancies. Genetically modified T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) derived from the m971 antibody have shown promise when used as an immunotherapeutic agent against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A key aspect of the efficacy of this CAR-T was its ability to target a membrane-proximal epitope on the CD22 extracellular domain; however, the molecular details of m971 recognition of CD22 have thus far remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the m971 fragment antigen-binding in complex with the two most membrane-proximal Ig-like domains of CD22 (CD22(d6–d7)). The m971 epitope on CD22 resides at the most proximal Ig domain (d7) to the membrane, and the antibody paratope contains electrostatic surfaces compatible with interactions with phospholipid head groups. Together, our data identify molecular details underlying the successful transformation of an antibody epitope on CD22 into an effective CAR immunotherapeutic target.","Ereño-Orbea, June; Liu, Xianglei; Sicard, Taylor; Kucharska, Iga; Li, Wei; Borovsky, Dorota; Cui, Hong; Feng, Yang; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Julien, Jean-Philippe",J Biol Chem,235,12

We used a new method (richness, diversity, evenness, and similarity analyses) to classify cities according to the occupational classification of hepatitis E patients across regions in China and compared the results of cluster analysis. Methods: Data on reported hepatitis E cases from 2008 to 2018 were collected from 24 cities (9 in Jilin Province, 13 in Jiangsu Province, Xiamen City, and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture). Traditional statistical methods were used to describe the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis E patients, while the new method and cluster analysis were used to classify the cities by analyzing the occupational composition across regions. Results: The prevalence of hepatitis E in eastern China (Jiangsu Province) was similar to that in the south (Xiamen City) and southwest of China (Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture), but higher than that in the north (Jilin Province). The age of hepatitis E patients was concentrated between 41 and 60 years, and the sex ratio ranged from 1:1.6 to 1:3.4. Farming was the most highly prevalent occupation; other sub-prevalent occupations included retirement, housework and unemployment. The incidence of occupations among migrant workers, medical staff, teachers, and students was moderate. There were several occupational types with few or no records, such as catering industry, caregivers and babysitters, diaspora children, childcare, herders, and fishing (boat) people. The occupational similarity of hepatitis E was high among economically developed cities, such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Baicheng, and Xiamen, while the similarity was small among cities with large economic disparities, such as Nanjing and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture. A comparison of the classification results revealed more similarities and some differences when using these two methods. Conclusion: In China, the factors with the greatest influence on the prevalence of hepatitis E are living in the south, farming as an occupation, being middle-aged or elderly, and being male. The 24 cities we studied were highly diverse and moderately similar in terms of the occupational distribution of patients with hepatitis E. We confirmed the validity of the new method on in classifying cities according to their occupational composition by comparing it with the clustering method.","Yu, Shanshan; Rui, Jia; Cheng, Xiaoqing; Zhao, Zeyu; Liu, Chan; Lin, Shengnan; Zhu, Yuanzhao; Wang, Yao; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Meng; Liu, Xingchun; Wang, Mingzhai; Lei, Zhao; Zhao, Benhua; Zhao, Qinglong; Zhang, Xuefeng; Chen, Tianmu",Front Public Health,235,12

It was shown that the use of transfer learning based on features learned from visible light images results in mAP greater than 82% for half of the investigated models. The best model turned out to be the one based on Yolov3 model (mean average precision—mAP, was at least 99.3%, while the precision was at least 66.1%).

However, the clinical cases of human SHV1 encephalitis are still rarely reported, and the clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of human SHV1 encephalitis are still unclear. METHODS: In this study, we reported 2 cases of human encephalitis associated with SHV1 infection and reviewed the other 18 cases from the literatures. A total of 20 cases with human SHV1 encephalitis were summarized and re-analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 patients had a history of swine-related occupational exposure before illness onset. All patients initially presented with influenza-like symptoms and then developed seizures, disturbed consciousness, and endophthalmitis. All patients with clinical outcome of modified Rankin Scale of 5 or 6 suffered from rapid progressive respiratory failure. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicated aseptic or viral infection. MRI findings of SHV1 encephalitis were prone to distribute in temporal-frontal and insular cortex, which was similar to the pattern of herpes simplex virus encephalitis, while some cases with involvements of gray matter nuclei had a high rate of mortality. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) revealed that all patients had unique SHV1 sequences with variable reads in the CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The variant SHV1 can cause a new type of human viral encephalitis, characterized by acute, fulminating, and catastrophic central nervous system infection. Rapid progressive respiratory failure and extensive lesions of deep gray matter nuclei might be indicators to poor prognosis. No approved treatments for the encephalitis are available, but it is possible to diagnose encephalitis quickly by mNGS.

However, it was found that the mineralization by UV/[H(2)O(2)](g) significantly decreased, which in turn decreased the conductivity after the reaction. Increasing the pollutant concentration and the pH of the H(2)O(2) had a negative effect on the treatment, but the UV radiation had a positive effect at powers of up to 40 W.

Because of the dynamic technological developments in molecular multiplexing and sequencing procedures, the spectrum of potential pathogens is increased and challenges the current dogma of virulence and pathogenicity of certain pathogens. Classical pathogens of the lungs are thereby not questioned but are increasingly placed in a context that reflects co-infections with viruses and changes of the local microbiome in more depth. Recent data indicate that integration of this novel information is required for a better understanding of the seasonal differences in the frequency of particular lung infections and to find new approaches to risk stratification of patients. This becomes most obvious in the subgroup of immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of severe courses of diseases with higher morbidity and mortality from infections with viruses and facultative pathogens, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).

Short hairpin RNAs targeting green fluorescence protein (pshRNA-GFP) and firefly luciferase (pshRNA-luc) were designed and inserted into a eukaryotic transcriptional vector pTZU6+1, respectively. The shRNA expressing vectors were co-transfected with plasmids containing the target gene with or without P19. The GFP expression level was assayed by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and RT-PCR. The luciferase expression level was analyzed by the dual-luciferase assay system. pshRNA designed in this study down-regulated the target gene specifically and efficiently, with a decrease of expression of both genes of about 70%, respectively. When P19 was introduced into the RNAi systems, the expression of both GFP and the luciferase were mostly recovered compared with the control groups. The RNAi systems of GFP and luciferase were constructed successfully, demonstrating that P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus has the ability to counteract the RNAi effect induced by shRNA in mammal cells.","Wei-xian, Chen; Juan, Chen; Zhen-zhen, Zhang; Ai-long, Huang",Virol Sin,235,12

The seriousness of the epidemic calls for effective control measures to tackle the problems in order to avoid the tragedy in Africa from happening in China. “Prevention First” is the cornerstone of the country’s health policy. On 2003 World AIDS Day, Premier Jiabao Wen announced a new national AIDS control policy, “Four Frees and One Care”. This policy clearly shows that the Chinese government has once again taken full responsibility to solve public health problems and has profound impact far beyond the AIDS field. In early 2006, the central government put scientific and technology innovation as a national priority and set the target to build an innovative China by year 2020. Since then, the government has been increasing investment in science and technology with major emphasis on both infectious diseases control and new drug research and development. For the first time, development of 100 new drugs and control of major infectious diseases (AIDS, HBV, TB and other emerging infectious diseases) have been selected as national key scientific projects. China’s best minds in related fields will be pooled to work together in order to remove the technical barriers blocking efficient control of the major infectious disease in China. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology, immunology, pathogenesis, HAART, as well as HIVDR strains will certainly provide urgently needed scientific information for China’s AIDS control program. Only evidence-based strategy from good research will provide long-term effective control of AIDS.","Shao, Yi-ming",Virol Sin,235,12

Understanding airflow dynamics and transport property within an aircraft cabin is critical to creating a healthy cabin environment and improving control of epidemics. This work reveals the temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region and evaluates impact of airflow’s large-scale flow structures (swing motion around the aisle region and large-scale vortices) on transport property by calculating traces of marked fluid particles (MFPs) passing through passengers’ exhalation area within a Boeing 737-200 cabin mock-up. The Peixoto theorem has been used to interpret temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region. Transport property within this single-aisle aircraft cabin is a mixed effect of the airflow’s swing motion, large-scale vortices and longitudinal airflow. Airflow’s swing motion around the aisle region tends to carry MFPs nearby across the aisle region and invade the large-scale vortex in the opposite side. The large-scale vortices try to control MFPs in its each separated zone. The airflow’s swing motion and large-scale vortices dominate MFPs’ latitudinal transmission, while longitudinal airflow dominates MFPs’ longitudinal transmission.","Yang, Changwei; Liu, Jiawei; He, Feng",Build Simul,235,12

The one-step RT-LAMP assay for N-GoAstV detection, using Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase with strong reverse transcription activity and primer sets targeting the opening reading frame 1b (ORF1b) of N-GoAstV, could be completed in 30 min using a water bath at 61°C; the detection results could be visually observed by adding a pH-sensitive dye containing phenol red and cresol red. The detection limit of the one-step RT-LAMP assay was 57.8 copies/μL, which was similar to that of reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The assay specifically detected N-GoAstV without any cross-reaction with other reference viruses, and this was further confirmed using enzyme digestion. These results indicated that the newly established RT-LAMP assay could accomplish reverse transcription, amplification, and visual result determination in one step, and the results obtained via this rapid and cost-effective method could be used to support disease control on farms in terms of N-GoAstV infection.","Ji, Jun; Chen, Qinxi; Sui, Chaoge; Hu, Wen; Yu, Zhengli; Zhang, Zhibin; Mu, Xinhao; Xu, Xin; Yao, Lunguang; Kan, Yunchao; Xie, Qingmei",Poult Sci,235,12

Despite the consistent presence of A. catenella along our coast, very little is known about the movement of its toxins through local marine food webs. In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3-year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55% of surface water samples (n = 307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17,387 cells L(−1) at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71% of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962 ng STXeq L(−1). Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23.2 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49.3 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23.8 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)). PSTs were also present in one sample of Pacific herring (Clupea pallas; 13.3 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)) and one sample of English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus; 4.5 μg STXeq 100 g(−1)), and not detected in seven other species of flatfish tested. The presence of PSTs in several of these organisms reveals that toxins produced by A. catenella are more prevalent in California food webs than previously thought and also indicates potential routes of toxin transfer to higher trophic levels.

METHODS We searched the MEDLINE database and performed a manual search of the references of selected articles to select reports reporting the outcomes of PMT alone and PMT compared to catheter-direct thrombolysis (CDT). Outcomes of interest included clot lysis rate, incidence of pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, recurrent deep vein thrombosis, number of venograms needed and amount of lytic utilized. RESULTS We found nine articles that reported outcomes of PMT. Three devices were utilized for PMT, the Angiojet, Trellis and Helix. Different thrombolytics were used to facilitate thrombus removal including urokinase, reteplase, tecneteplase, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Complete and partial thrombus removal were achieved in up to 84% and 64% and 81% and 59% of the limbs treated with PMT and CDT alone, respectively. Data on PE and bleeding risk after PMT compared to CDT are scarce. The duration of the thrombolysis process, amount of lytics and number of venograms were substantially reduced in the patients who had PMT compared to those who underwent CDT alone. Two articles evaluated the obstacles that limit the indication of PMT in patients with VTE. CONCLUSION VTE is a prevalent burden in Western societies. The rationale of early thrombus is to reduce valvular damage and improve venous patency in order to reduce the risk of PTS. PMT is a feasible, safe and faster alternative to expedite the thrombolysis process in patients with VTE.","Malgor, R D; Gasparis, A P",Phlebology,235,12

Our study aimed to explore healthcare professionals' perceptions of factors affecting presentation of people with type 1 diabetes in a low socioeconomic area of Queensland, Australia. METHODS This was a qualitative study. Individual semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews were completed with patients with type 1 diabetes who had presented in diabetic ketoacidosis, and healthcare professionals who have experience in related care. Data were analysed using Gibbs's framework of thematic analysis. RESULTS Four patients with type 1 diabetes and 18 healthcare professionals were interviewed. Restricted access was identified as a factor contributing to diabetic ketoacidosis and delayed presentation, with ketone testing supplies, continuous glucose monitoring technology and transport considered barriers. Many of these factors were arguably preventable. Opportunities to improve the care available to patients with type 1 diabetes were detailed, with particularly strong support for dedicated out of hours telephone help lines for adults with type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Gaps in support for patient self-care to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis presentations and prevent late presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis revealed by this study require service reconfiguration to support care delivery. Until change is made, people with type 1 diabetes will continue to make both avoidable and delayed, acutely unwell, presentations to Emergency Departments.","James, Steven; Annetts, Kylie; Frakking, Thuy; Broadbent, Marc; Waugh, John; Perry, Lin; Lowe, Julia; Clark, Sean",BMC health services research,235,7

SUMMARY ANSWER There is insufficient evidence to conclude EM yields a difference in the resolution of tubal EP, the avoidance of surgery or time to resolution of tubal EP when compared to intramuscular methotrexate in stable patients with β-hCG <1500 IU/l. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN The utilisation of medical and surgical management for EP is well established. EM aims to allow spontaneous resolution of the EP without intervention. STUDY DESIGN SIZE AND DURATION We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, OpenGrey.eu, Google Scholar, cross-referencing citations and trial registries to 15 December 2019. There were no limitations placed on language or publication date. Search terms included tubal EP and EM as well as variations of these terms. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING AND METHOD We considered studies that included patients with tubal EP, EM as a comparator, and that were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was resolution of tubal EP. Secondary outcomes included avoidance of surgery and the time to resolution of EP. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, assessed bias and extracted data. Relative risk (RR) and mean difference with 95% CI were assessed using a random effects model. The certainty of evidence was scored according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In total, 920 studies were screened. Five studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Two RCTs comparing methotrexate to EM were identified as being eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis. No RCTs comparing surgery to EM were identified. Compared with EM, there was insufficient evidence that methotrexate yields a difference on resolution of tubal EP (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88-1.23, P = 0.67; two RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), avoiding surgery (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.29, P = 0.25; two RCTs, low-certainty evidence) or the time to resolution of tubal EP (-2.56 days (favouring EM), 95% CI -7.93-2.80, P = 0.35; two RCTs, low-certainty evidence). LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION Only two RCTs with a total of 103 patients were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Further RCTs comparing EM to medical and surgical management are needed and these should also report adverse events. Patient preference should also be evaluated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS We found insufficient evidence of differences in terms of resolution, avoidance of surgery and time to resolution between expectant and medical management. Given the imprecision in the effect estimates as demonstrated by the wide CIs, resulting in the downgrading of certainty of evidence for all outcomes in this meta-analysis, larger RCTs comparing interventions for tubal EP are needed. Caution should be exercised when trying to decide between EM and methotrexate to treat tubal EP. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS There was no funding for this study.

This proves that histochemistry is still an active and innovative discipline with relevance in basic and applied biological research, but also demonstrates that especially the small histochemical Journals should likely reconsider their scopes and strategies to preserve their authorship. A review of the last three years volumes of the European Journal of Histochemistry, taken as an example of a long-time established small Journal, confirmed that the published articles were widely heterogeneous in their topics and experimental models, as in this Journal's tradition. This strongly suggests that a Journal of histochemistry should keep its role as a forum open to an audience as broad as possible, publishing papers on cell and tissue biology in a wide variety of models. This will improve knowledge of the basic mechanisms of development and differentiation, while helping to increase the number of potential authors since scientists who generally do not use histochemistry in their research will find hints for the applications of histochemical techniques to novel still unexplored subjects.","Pellicciari, C",European journal of histochemistry : EJH,235,17

The inclusion criteria were experimental studies, studies focusing on microblogs, studies focusing on healthy adult populations, and studies focusing on either source credibility or authenticity. Exclusion criteria were studies involving participants aged under 18 years and clinical populations, gray literature, blogs, WeChat conversations, web-based reviews, non-English papers, and studies not involving participants' perceptions. RESULTS Overall, 22 eligible papers were included, giving a total of 25 research studies. Among these studies, Facebook and Twitter were the most common SM platforms investigated. The most effective communication style differed depending on the SM platform. Factors reported to impact credibility included language used online, expertise heuristics, and bandwagon heuristics. No papers were found that assessed authenticity. CONCLUSIONS Credibility and authenticity are important concepts studied extensively in the marketing and communications disciplines; however, further research is required in a health context. Instagram is a less-researched platform in comparison with Facebook and Twitter.","Jenkins, Eva L; Ilicic, Jasmina; Barklamb, Amy M; McCaffrey, Tracy A",Journal of medical Internet research,235,5

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Our first patient was a 42-year-old man with cholangitis and jaundice from tumor obstructing the hepatic duct bifurcation who underwent a right extended hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Bismuth IIIa), radical portal lymphadenectomy, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy using laparoscopic techniques. A four-trocar, one 6-cm wound protector laparoscopic technique was used. Inflow and outflow exclusion was achieved first, followed by liver transection. Radical portal lymphadenectomy was performed. A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was constructed laparoscopically. We have performed three other cases using the same technique: two requiring right extended hepatectomy and one requiring left extended hepatectomy. RESULTS No intraoperative complications occurred during the 4.0-hour procedure. Tumor margins were clear. The patient was given oral diet on Day 1 and discharged on Day 3 after surgery. No blood transfusions were necessary. A cholangiogram performed 10 days after surgery demonstrated patent hepaticojejunostomy, and magnetic resonance imaging performed during week 3 demonstrated the normal caliber of the intrahepatic biliary system. At 6 months, the patient was completely without symptoms and exhibited normal liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-assisted right extended hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with laparoscopically hand-sewn hepaticojejunostomy in select patients can be achieved with good outcomes.","Lin, Edward; Sarmiento, Juan M",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We present data from the Bristol Imperial MDMA in Alcoholism (BIMA) study. This is the first MDMA addiction study, an open-label safety and tolerability proof-of-concept study investigating the potential role for MDMA therapy in treating patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). AIMS This study aimed to assess if MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be delivered safely and can be tolerated by patients with AUD post detoxification. Outcomes regarding drinking behaviour, quality of life and psychosocial functioning were evaluated. METHODS Fourteen patients with AUD completed a community alcohol detoxification and received an eight-week course of recovery-based therapy. Participants received two sessions with MDMA (187.5 mg each session). Psychological support was provided before, during and after each session. Safety and tolerability were assessed alongside psychological and physiological outcome measures. Alcohol use behaviour, mental well-being and functioning data were collected for nine months after alcohol detoxification. RESULTS MDMA treatment was well tolerated by all participants. No unexpected adverse events were observed. Psychosocial functioning improved across the cohort. Regarding alcohol use, at nine months post detox, the average units of alcohol consumption by participants was 18.7 units per week compared to 130.6 units per week before the detox. This compares favourably to a previous observational study (the 'Outcomes' study) by the same team with a similar population of people with AUD. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary support for the safety and tolerability of a novel intervention for AUD post detox. Further trials to examine better the therapeutic potential of this approach are now indicated.","Sessa, Ben; Higbed, Laurie; O'Brien, Steve; Durant, Claire; Sakal, Chloe; Titheradge, Daniel; Williams, Tim M; Rose-Morris, Anna; Brew-Girard, Elsa; Burrows, Sam; Wiseman, Chantelle; Wilson, Sue; Rickard, James; Nutt, David J",Journal of psychopharmacology,235,7

This could reflect analytic heterogeneity, such as use of region-wise cortical thickness based on the Freesurfer Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas or surface-based morphometry (SBM). The Freesurfer Destrieux (DS) atlas (more, smaller regions) has not been utilized in depression studies. This could also reflect differential gender and age effects. METHODS Cortical thickness was collected from 170 currently depressed adults and 52 never-depressed adults. Visually inspected and approved Freesurfer-generated surfaces were used to extract cortical thickness estimates according to the DK atlas (68 regions) and DS atlas (148 regions) for region-wise analysis (216 total regions) and for SBM. RESULTS Overall, except for small effects in a few regions, the two region-wise approaches generally failed to discriminate depressed adults from nondepressed adults or current episode severity. Differential effects by age and gender were also rare and small in magnitude. Using SBM, depressed adults showed a significantly thicker cluster in the left supramarginal gyrus than nondepressed adults (P = 0.047) but there were no associations with current episode severity. CONCLUSIONS Three analytic approaches (i.e., DK atlas, DS atlas, and SBM) converge on the notion that cortical thickness is a relatively weak discriminator of current depression status. Differential age and gender effects do not appear to represent key moderators. Robust associations with demographic factors will likely hinder translation of cortical thickness into a clinically useful biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, non-recyclability of these oxides has restricted their practical applications. In present work, a novel nanostructured composite monoclinic bismuth vanadate@ activated carbon fibers (BiVO4@ACF) photocatalyst was efficaciously synthesized using a solvothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Bruner-Emmett-Teller (BET). The specific surface area, phase composition, microstructure, binding and photocatalytic activity of BiVO4@ACF pose great dependence on solvent nature and chelating agents utilized for synthesis. The photocatalytic and antibacterial potential of this composite was evaluated and optimized by using a model pollutant, Reactive Rhodamine Blue (RhB) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The composite possesses enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity and was reutilized for three rounds of respective reaction without any loss of activity and structure as evident from SEM and XRD results. The photocatalytic mechanism of photodegradation of dye and bactericidal properties of samples under visible light irradiation was determined by scavenger and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity, chemical stability and most importantly good recyclability of BiVO4@ACFs highlight the potential application of this composite in water purification and other biological applications.","Saleem, Aimen; Ahmed, Toheed; Ammar, Muhammad; Zhang, Hong-Ling; Xu, Hong-Bin; Tabassum, Romana","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

We aimed to assess whether preadmission treatment with SSRIs in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with post-thrombolysis symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and functional outcome. METHODS A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted in prospective registries of patients treated by thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. The association between preadmission treatment with SSRIs and sICH (ECASS II definition [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]) or unfavorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale >2) was assessed by logistic regression, taking into account potential interaction with concomitant use of antithrombotics. RESULTS Six thousand two hundred forty-two patients were included (mean age, 70.1±14.0 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 9 [5-16]). Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was present in 4.3% (n=266) of patients. Overall, SICH rate was 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-4.4%; n=244), and SSRI use was not significantly associated with sICH in unadjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.72-2.27) or adjusted (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.71-2.40) analysis. However, there was a significant interaction of concomitant use of OACs (international normalized ratio <1.7) and SSRI for occurrence of sICH (P=0.01). SICH was significantly more frequent in patients taking both OAC and SSRI (23.1%; 95% CI, 8.2%-50.3%) than in patients taking OAC but not SSRI (adjusted OR, 9.04; 95% CI, 1.95-41.89). Preadmission use of SSRI was associated with unfavorable 3-month outcome (unadjusted OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.48-2.46; adjusted OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15-2.19). CONCLUSIONS Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was not significantly associated with an increased risk of post-thrombolysis sICH in this cohort study. However, subgroup analysis suggested an increased risk of sICH in patients taking both SSRI and OAC. Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was associated with unfavorable outcome, which may reflect the prognostic significance of prestroke depression.","Scheitz, Jan F; Turc, Guillaume; Kujala, Linda; Polymeris, Alexandros A; Heldner, Mirjam R; Zonneveld, Thomas P; Erdur, Hebun; Curtze, Sami; Traenka, Christopher; Brenière, Céline; Wiest, Roland; Rocco, Andrea; Sibolt, Gerli; Gensicke, Henrik; Endres, Matthias; Martinez-Majander, Nicolas; Béjot, Yannick; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Oppenheim, Catherine; Arnold, Marcel; Engelter, Stefan T; Strbian, Daniel; Nolte, Christian H",Stroke,235,13

RNA synthesis by the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is carried out by a replicase-transcriptase composed of 16 nonstructural protein (nsp) subunits. Among these, nsp3 is the largest and the first to be inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum. nsp3 comprises multiple structural domains, including two papain-like proteases (PLPs) and a highly conserved ADP-ribose-1″-phosphatase (ADRP) macrodomain. We have previously shown that the ubiquitin-like domain at the amino terminus of nsp3 is essential and participates in a critical interaction with the viral nucleocapsid protein early in infection. In the current study, we exploited atypical expression schemes to uncouple PLP1 from the processing of nsp1 and nsp2 in order to investigate the requirements of nsp3 domains for viral RNA synthesis. In the first strategy, a mutant was created in which replicase polyprotein translation initiated with nsp3, thereby establishing that complete elimination of nsp1 and nsp2 does not abolish MHV viability. In the second strategy, a picornavirus autoprocessing element was used to separate a truncated nsp1 from nsp3. This provided a platform for further dissection of amino-terminal domains of nsp3. From this, we found that catalytic mutation of PLP1 or complete deletion of PLP1 and the adjacent ADRP domain was tolerated by the virus. These results showed that neither the PLP1 domain nor the ADRP domain of nsp3 provides integral activities essential for coronavirus genomic or subgenomic RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The largest component of the coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex, nsp3, contains multiple modules, many of which do not have clearly defined functions in genome replication or transcription. These domains may play direct roles in RNA synthesis, or they may have evolved for other purposes, such as to combat host innate immunity. We initiated a dissection of MHV nsp3 aimed at identifying those activities or structures in this huge molecule that are essential to replicase activity. We found that both PLP1 and ADRP could be entirely deleted, provided that the requirement for proteolytic processing by PLP1 was offset by an alternative mechanism. This demonstrated that neither PLP1 nor ADRP plays an essential role in coronavirus RNA synthesis.","Hurst-Hess, Kelley R; Kuo, Lili; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,235,24

However, the primary endpoint, clinical response rate (RR), did not reach the expected level (Ito et al. in Gastric Cancer 20:322-31, 2017). Herein, we report our long-term survival results. METHODS Patients with BN and/or PAN metastasis received 2 or 3 cycles of DCS therapy (docetaxel at 40 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and S-1 at 80 mg/m2 per day for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest) followed by gastrectomy with D2 plus PAN dissection and postoperative S-1 for 1 year. RESULTS Between July 2011 and May 2013, 53 patients were enrolled. Clinically, 17.0% had both PAN and BN metastasis, and the rest had either PAN (26.4%) or BN (56.6%) metastasis.

A significant number of these deaths are preventable and the purpose of this review is to highlight causes such as delays in recognition and early treatment.

Surveillance should not only include during pregnancy, but also throughout the postpartum period, up to 42 days postpartum. Education and awareness to highlight this importance are not only vital for obstetric healthcare provides, but also for nonobstetric healthcare providers, patients, and support persons. SUMMARY Through education and continual review and analysis of evidence-based practice, a reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality secondary to maternal sepsis should be attainable with dedication from all disciplines that care for obstetric and postpartum patients.

The researchers also aim at exploring the construct validity further through examining the relationship between FCV-19S, wellbeing and life satisfaction in Egyptian universities context. The current study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale among Egyptian population. METHODS The FCV-19S is translated and validated in Egyptian context. The forward backward translation method is used to translate the English version of the survey into Arabic. The sample is comprised of 1832 Egyptian participants, who have conducted an online survey based on the Arabic versions of FCV-19S. RESULTS The Cronbach α value for the Egyptian FCV-19S is 0.87, indicating a good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S has fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S is significantly correlated with the seven-item survey. Moreover, the results show a significant negative relationship between Fear of COVID-19 and both wellbeing and life satisfaction (r = -0.42, p < 0.001; r = -0.24, p < 0.01.), respectively.

It remains poorly understood whether this is due to illness severity or personal or health system barriers. We explored the experiences of stroke patients with financial barriers in a qualitative descriptive pilot study, seeking to capture perceived challenges that interfere with their poststroke health and recovery. METHODS We interviewed six adults with a history of stroke and financial barriers in Alberta, Canada, inquiring about their: (1) experiences after stroke; (2) experience of financial barriers; (3) perceived reasons for financial barriers; (4) health consequences of financial barriers; and (5) mechanisms for coping with financial barriers. Two reviewers analyzed data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS The participants developed new or worsened financial circumstances as a consequence of stroke-related disability. Poststroke impairments and financial barriers took a toll on their mental health. They struggled to access several aspects of long-term poststroke care, including allied health professional services, medications, and proper nutrition. They described opportunity costs and tradeoffs when accessing health services. In several cases, they were unaware of health resources available to them and were hesitant to disclose their struggles to their physicians and even their families. CONCLUSION Some patients with financial barriers perceive challenges to accessing various aspects of poststroke care. They may have inadequate knowledge of resources available to them and may not disclose their concerns to their health care team. This suggests that providers themselves might consider asking stroke patients about financial barriers to optimize their long-term poststroke care.","Ganesh, Aravind; King-Shier, Kathryn; Manns, Braden J; Hill, Michael D; Campbell, David J T",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of LYC on chronic stress-induced hippocampal lesions and learning and memory dysfunction. Rats were administered LYC and/or chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 21 days. Morris water maze results demonstrated that LYC prevented CRS-induced learning and memory dysfunction. Histopathological staining and transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that LYC ameliorated CRS-induced hippocampal microstructural and ultrastructural damage. Furthermore, LYC alleviated CRS-induced oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. LYC also improved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by recovering mitochondrial membrane potential, and complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and II (succinate dehydrogenase) activities. Moreover, LYC reduced CRS-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end-labeled positive cells. Additionally, western blot analysis demonstrated that LYC inhibited CRS-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Correlation analysis indicated that ROS levels, JNK activation, and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were positively correlated. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine inhibited CRS-induced JNK activation. Furthermore, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 relieved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and learning and memory dysfunction. Together, these results suggest that LYC alleviates hippocampal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis by inhibiting the ROS/JNK signaling pathway, thereby improving CRS-induced hippocampal injury and learning and memory dysfunction.

As a result, IBGE postponed the 2020 Demographic Census and started to formulate a COVID-19 PNAD. The survey included a total sample of 349 thousand people in about 200 thousand households. Of the total Brazilian resident population, the IBGE estimated in May/2020 that 24.0 million (11.4%) had at least one of the flu-like syndrome symptoms. Of this contingent, 20.2 million (84.3% of all symptomatic patients) did not seek health care. The innovations brought to health surveillance and the IBGE's pioneering spirit show that it is possible, in a continental country that has been experiencing several local epidemics at different times in its territory, that other countries also develop similar household surveys, with weekly data collection (referred to epidemiological weeks) by telephone in an innovative and timely manner.

It cripples people from living a normal life; sometimes it leads people to the extreme condition of permanent damage. The COVID-19 situation has brought in unexpected misery - victimizing millions of people. It has been an equalizer as both the rich and the poor have been affected; both the affluent and the developing countries have become a prey to the pandemic. For nearly one year the world is wondering which way to turn for comfort or solution, as the fear of the second and third waves looms over. Science has not given the timely preventive medication; world leaders are not able to lead the people with effective insight; financial system is on the brink of collapse; and even the faith of people seems to become a question mark. But any problem should have a solution, with often multiple aspects of solutions. Apart from medicine, one could become strengthened to face the situation. Starting with the analysis of the cause and the effect of Coronavirus Pandemic, this talk explores the intellectual and emotional aspects of the situation with the focus on the psychological and spiritual solutions to face the crisis; how to get reconciled with the reality; and how to thrive in his situation. The ultimate goal is to come out of the crisis with a spirit of creativity. If the pandemic is a period of cocoon, the butterfly-joy would be the hope to come out soon.

On the basis of the known esophageal past medical history as well as the absence of bones in the bolus, the patient was submitted to a new conservative treatment, the ""Nitro-Push Blind Technique"". CONCLUSIONS The new technique performed with naso-gastric tube thrust after nitrates medication in definite clinical case supported by known functional disease, represents a safe and successful method, with short observational period to minimize exposure to potential morbidity and reduce the inpatient stay in emergency department. It should be recommended, once validated in a larger cohort, as the initial treatment of choice in the selected patients with food boneless bolus impaction in the emergency settings.

Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has generated preclinical data suggesting that it selectively targets the myocardium. We sought to characterize extra-atrial injuries after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) between PFA and thermal ablation methods. METHODS AND RESULTS Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed before, acutely (<3 h) and 3 months post-ablation in 41 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing PVI with PFA (N = 18, Farapulse) or thermal methods (N = 23, 16 radiofrequency, 7 cryoballoon). Oesophageal and aortic injuries were assessed by using late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) imaging. Phrenic nerve injuries were assessed from diaphragmatic motion on intra-procedural fluoroscopy. Baseline CMR showed no abnormality on the oesophagus or aorta. During ablation procedures, no patient showed phrenic palsy. Acutely, thermal methods induced high rates of oesophageal lesions (43%), all observed in patients showing direct contact between the oesophagus and the ablation sites. In contrast, oesophageal lesions were observed in no patient ablated with PFA (0%, P < 0.001 vs. thermal methods), despite similar rates of direct contact between the oesophagus and the ablation sites (P = 0.41). Acute lesions were detected on CMR on the descending aorta in 10/23 (43%) after thermal ablation, and in 6/18 (33%) after PFA (P = 0.52). CMR at 3 months showed a complete resolution of oesophageal and aortic LGE in all patients. No patient showed clinical complications. CONCLUSION PFA does not induce any signs of oesophageal injury on CMR after PVI. Due to its tissue selectivity, PFA may improve safety for catheter ablation of AF.","Cochet, Hubert; Nakatani, Yosuke; Sridi-Cheniti, Soumaya; Cheniti, Ghassen; Ramirez, F Daniel; Nakashima, Takashi; Eggert, Charles; Schneider, Christopher; Viswanathan, Raju; Derval, Nicolas; Duchateau, Josselin; Pambrun, Thomas; Chauvel, Remi; Reddy, Vivek Y; Montaudon, Michel; Laurent, François; Sacher, Frederic; Hocini, Mélèze; Haïssaguerre, Michel; Jais, Pierre","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",235,27

The fixation of a ligand in the active site of RdRp may alter the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Present work aimed at identifying novel inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme by performing pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Initially, the pharmacophore model of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was constructed and the resulting model was used to screen compounds from ChEMBL, ZINC and PubChem databases. During the investigation, 180 compounds were screened using the above model and subjected to molecular docking with RdRp. Two compounds viz. ChEMBL1276156 and PubChem135548348 showed a strong binding affinity with RdRp than its standard inhibitor, Remdesivir. Toxicity prediction of these two compounds reveals their non-toxic nature. These compounds were further subjected to MDS for 100 ns to check their stability after binding with RdRp. The MDS of RdRp-ChEMBL1276156 and RdRp-PubChem135548348 complexes show enhanced stability in comparison to the RdRp-Remdesivir complex. The average interaction energy calculated after 100 ns of MDS was -146.56 and -172.68 KJ mol-1 for RdRp-CHEMBL1276156 complex and RdRp-PubChem135548348 complex, respectively, while -59.90 KJ mol-1 for RdRp-Remdesivir complex.

METHODOLOGY We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. CONCLUSIONS POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing.","Fauziah, Nisa; Koesoemadinata, Raspati C; Andriyoko, Basti; Faridah, Lia; Riswari, Silvita F; Widyatmoko, Leonardus; Prihatni, Delita; Ekawardhani, Savira; Fibriani, Azzania; Rachmawati, Emma; Ristandi, Ryan B; Alamanda, Cut Nc; Prodjosoewojo, Susantina; Lestari, Bony W; Santoso, Ida P",Journal of infection in developing countries,235,6

We describe the results of the largest UK series of laparoscopic approach to pancreatic duct drainage and head resection for CP. METHODS Patients with CP and intractable abdominal pain requiring duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (Berne modification of Beger procedure) or Puestow procedure were offered laparoscopic surgery by a single surgeon. The results shown represent median (range). RESULTS Six patients (3 males) with CP (alcohol induced, n=4; idiopathic, n=2) underwent surgery between 2009 and 2012. The pancreatic duct diameter was 8.75 (6 to 11) mm. Five patients have had lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and 1 patient underwent Berne modification of Beger procedure, all of which were completed laparoscopically. The operating time was 277.5 (250 to 360) minutes. There were no deaths and 1 patient was readmitted 10 days postoperatively and had laparotomy for pancreatic bleeding after pancreaticojejunostomy (morbidity, 17%). The hospital stay was 5 (5 to 8) days. At a follow-up of 14.2 (10 to 35) months, 4 of the patients were pain free, whereas 2 patients required one third and half of the preoperative oral opioid dose for pain control. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach to pancreatic duct drainage and duodenum-preserving head resection in carefully selected patients and in experienced hands is feasible and safe with good short-term results and potential advantages.

It has no particular symptoms, and may cause different complaints according to tumor diameter and localization. Local invasion may develop in the short term and distant metastasis may occur in vascular structures in its neighborhood. That's why, resectability rates are low at the time of diagnosis with a negative effect on survival rates. Minimally invasive surgery is being increasingly implemented in pancreas lesions owing to the positive short-term oncologic results of the technique in many other procedures. Traditionally, conventional open surgery is performed in pancreatic head tumors. As laparoscopic resection of pancreatic head cancer has serious technical difficulties and requires advanced laparoscopic experience, minimal invasive attempts in this field have not yet reached sufficient acceptance worldwide. Besides the fact that laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy may provide sufficient short-term oncologic results that are comparative with open surgery, it can be implemented in selected patients in centers with advanced laparoscopic resection capacity. In this case series, we aimed to present our experience of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in pancreatic head cancer patients.","Kayaoğlu, Hüseyin Ayhan; Çaycı, Hacı Murat; Erdoğdu, Umut Eren; Dilektaşlı, Evren; Bayam, Mehmet Emrah; Çantay, Hasan",Turkish journal of surgery,235,31

METHODS We reviewed clinical and imaging data of consecutive patients attending our center for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2012 and November 2017. IAD was defined according to published criteria and our own angiographic criteria (no clot following MT, and normalization of the vessel caliber after stenting). RESULTS IAD was retrospectively diagnosed in 13/391 (3%) patients (inter-rater agreement κ=0.885, P<0.001). It was an extending of extracranial dissection in 7/13 (54%) patients. A total of 21 recanalization approaches (with or without IV tissue plasminogen activator) were analyzed in 13 patients. A medical approach was used in 7/21 (33%), MT in 7/21 (33%) (stent retriever=6, thromboaspiration=1), and permanent stenting in 7/21 (33%). A rescue recanalization was necessary after 8/14 (57%) approaches without stenting. Stenting was associated with a best rate of recanalization (P=0.001) and with a trend towards a lower rate of ischemic recurrence (P=0.057). Stenting of a circulating false lumen failed to recanalize the artery in two patients. At the last follow-up, no patient had developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the dissection. The outcome at 3 months was favorable in 8/13 (62%) patients. One patient died at 3 weeks owing to a severe cerebellar infarction. CONCLUSION IAD is a rare diagnosis that should be systematically considered in patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion, especially in patients with extracranial artery dissection and when MT does not retrieve any clot. Stenting of IAD as first-line approach should be assessed in further studies.","Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Civelli, Vittorio; Reiner, Peggy; Aymard, Armand; Saint-Maurice, Jean-Pierre; Zetchi, Akli; Houdart, Emmanuel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,235,1

The sparse information available, mainly for seamounts outside Chilean jurisdiction and shallow-water fauna of the Desventuradas Islands, suggests that the area is a hotspot of endemism. This apparent uniqueness of the fauna motivated the creation of the large Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park (NDMP, ~ 300,000 km2) around the small islands San Felix and San Ambrosio in 2015. We report for the first time a detailed description of benthic microhabitats (i.e., centimeter to meter scale), macrohabitats (i.e., meter to kilometer-scale) and associated megafauna within the NDMP. Descriptions were based on analysis of fauna collected by trawling and ROV video observations from ~ 50 to 370 m depth. Rocky, coarse sand and silty sediment bottom habitats were observed at island slopes. In contrast, rocky and coarse sandy bottom habitats with a predominance of rhodoliths, thanatocoenosis, and other biogenic components were observed at seamounts. Mobile fauna and predators dominated the oceanic islands and nearby seamounts, whereas seamounts farther from the islands were dominated by sessile and hemisessile fauna that were mainly suspension and deposit feeders. Based on the register of 118 taxonomic units, our results provide an expanded and updated baseline for the benthic biodiversity of NDMP habitats, which seemed pristine, without evidence of trawling or anthropogenic debris.","Tapia-Guerra, Jan M; Mecho, Ariadna; Easton, Erin E; Gallardo, María de Los Ángeles; Gorny, Matthias; Sellanes, Javier",Scientific reports,235,26

Although, several non-invasive brain stimulation studies have proven their efficacy in the treatment of stroke recovery, finding more effective brain regions that responsible for stroke rehabilitation as well as optimizing neural stimulation protocol are the main goals of further investigations. In this study, the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) was exposed to Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) to reduce the cerebellar damage resulting from crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) phenomenon after cerebral ischemia. A mouse brain ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A level of decrease in Purkinje cell (PC) number and a quantity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive neutrophils in the cerebral cortex were compared between stroke and stroke+LIFU groups after MCAO. In stroke+LIFU group, the increased ipsilateral water content due to tissue swelling was observed, showing an attenuation of brain edema. Prominently, the reduction of the neuroimmune reactivity at the infarct core and the peri-infarct regions, and the increased rate of survival among PCs clearly demonstrated primary evidence of neuroprotective effect induced by LIFU-mediated cerebellar modulation.","Baek, Hongchae; Sariev, Anvar; Kim, Min-Ju; Lee, Hojin; Kim, Jinhyun; Kim, Hyungmin",Conference proceedings : ...

OBJECTIVE Six Brazilian medicinal plant species were subjected to an antiviral screening bioassay to investigate and evaluate their biological activities against five viruses: bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), murine hepatitis virus type 3, porcine parvovirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS The antiviral activity was determined by a titration technique that depends on the ability of plant extract dilutions (25 or 2.5 µg/mL) to inhibit the viral induced cytopathic effect and the extracts' inhibition percentage (IP). RESULTS Two medicinal plant species showed potential antiviral activity. The Aniba rosaeodora Ducke (Lauraceae) extract had the best results, with 90% inhibition of viral growth at 2.5 µg/mL when the extract was added during the replication period of the aMPV infection cycle. The Maytenus ilicifolia (Schrad.) Planch. (Celastraceae) extracts at a concentration of 2.5 µg/mL exhibited antiviral activity during the attachment phase of BHV-5 (IP = 100%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The biomonitored fractionation of the active extracts from M. ilicifolia and A. rosaeodora could be a potential tool for identifying their active compounds and determining the exact mechanism of action.","Kohn, L K; Queiroga, C L; Martini, M C; Barata, L E; Porto, P S S; Souza, L; Arns, C W",Pharmaceutical biology,235,12

It is a medically accepted position for improving oxygenation while breathing. Respiration in supine position, compresses the posterior surface of the lung preventing normal distension of the alveoli. This results in suboptimal oxygenation of the blood circulating in the lobes of the lung, particularly lower lobes. Lowered V/Q ratio from these regions of the lung contributes to the venous admixture. In the prone position, the heart with its pericardial chamber, occupies anterior dependent portion of the mediastinum, resulting in better expansion of the alveoli. This leads to improved V/Q ratio from these regions and lowers the physiological shunt effect on the oxygen saturation. © 2021 National Journal of Clinical Anatomy ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Pushpa, N.; Viveka, S.; Ravi, K.; Vallabhaneni, V.",National Journal of Clinical Anatomy,235,25

We showed that the human aminopeptidase-N (hAPN) cannot substitute for pAPN in this respect, although the two enzymes have 80% amino acid sequence identity. In order to map the TGEV binding site on pAPN, we constructed a series of APN cDNA chimeras between pAPN and hAPN and analyzed them for their capacity to confer infectivity. The region between residues 717 and 813 was found to be essential for infectivity. This region also contains the epitopes for three TGEV-blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against pAPN. These data support the view that the catalytic site and the TGEV receptor site are located in different domains. Moreover, APN inhibitors and mutations in the catalytic site had no obvious effect on permissiveness for virus, thus providing evidence that the APN enzymatic activity is not involved in the process of infection.","Delmas, B; Gelfi, J; Kut, E; Sjöström, H; Noren, O; Laude, H",Journal of virology,235,4

Typically, mFGL2 functions as prothrombinase that is capable of initiating coagulation in tissue without activation of the blood clotting cascade, whereas sFGL2 largely acts as an immunosuppressor that can repress proliferation of alloreactive T lymphocytes and maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells. Protein sequences of FGL2 exhibit evolutionary conservation across wide variety of species, especially at the carboxyl terminus that contains fibrinogen related domain (FRED). The FRED of FGL2 confers specificity and complexity in the action of FGL2, including receptor recognition, calcium affiliation, and substrate binding. Constitutive expression of FGL2 during embryogenesis and in mature tissues suggests FGL2 might be physiologically important. However, excessive induction of FGL2 under certain medical conditions (e.g., pathogen invasion) could trigger complement activation, inflammatory response, cellular apoptosis, and immune dysfunctions. On the other hand, complete absence of FGL2 is also detrimental as lack of FGL2 can cause autoimmune glomerulonephritis and acute cellular rejection of xenografts. All these roles involve mFGL2, sFGL2, or their combination. Although it is not clear how mFGL2 is cleaved off its host cells and secreted into the blood, circulating sFGL2 has been found correlated with disease severity and viral loading among patients with human hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. Further studies are warranted to understand how FGL2 expression is regulated under physiological and pathological conditions. Even more interesting is to determine whether mFGL2 can fulfill an immunoregulatory role through its FRED at carboxyl end of the molecule and, and vice versa, whether sFGL2 is procoagulant upon binding to a target cell. Knowledge in this area should shed light on development of sFGL2 as an alternative immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation or as a biomarker for predicting disease progression, monitoring therapeutic effects, and targeting FGL2 for repression in ameliorating fulminant viral hepatitis.","Yang, Genyan; Hooper, W Craig",World journal of clinical infectious diseases,235,17

The present study was performed in an attempt to improve the specificity of current commercial rotavirus and adenovirus EIAs without significant loss of sensitivity by optimizing the cut-off value. A collective of 174 stool samples obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis was tested. Electron microscopy (EM) and PAGE were used as reference methods for rotavirus detection. For the evaluation of the adenovirus kits, virus isolation in cell culture and the polymerase chain reaction served as reference standards. The highest sensitivity for rotavirus and adenovirus detection was achieved by the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus. However, the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus produced the highest number of false-positive results (n = 9) for each rotavirus and adenovirus detection. Cross-reactivities to coronaviruses and reoviruses were observed with the rotavirus antigen EIAs. For Rotazyme II, Ridascreen Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus, the specificity could be markedly increased without loss of sensitivity by doubling the cut-off value. For the alternative immunoassays, which were overall more specific, it was not possible to significantly decrease the rate of false-positive results without impairment of sensitivity by raising the cut-off value. In conclusion, at least for some rotavirus and adenovirus antigen EIAs, the cut-off value set by the manufacturer may not permit an optimal differentiation between true-positive and -negative samples. By raising the cut-off value from 50 to 100%, the specificity of two rotavirus antigen and one adenovirus antigen EIA can be improved markedly without significant loss of sensitivity.","Rabenau, H; Knoll, B; Allwinn, R; Doerr, H W; Weber, B",Intervirology,235,7

The M protein is anchored in the viral envelope by three transmembrane segments flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. The M endodomain interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, which consists of the positive-strand RNA genome helically encapsidated by N protein monomers. In previous work with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a highly defective M protein mutant, MDelta2, was constructed. This mutant contained a 2-amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation of the M protein. Analysis of second-site revertants of MDelta2 revealed mutations in the carboxy-terminal region of the N protein that compensated for the defect in the M protein. To seek further genetic evidence corroborating this interaction, we generated a comprehensive set of clustered charged-to-alanine mutants in the carboxy-terminal domain 3 of N protein. One of these mutants, CCA4, had a highly defective phenotype similar to that of MDelta2. Transfer of the CCA4 mutation into a partially diploid MHV genome showed that CCA4 was a loss-of-function mutation rather than a dominant-negative mutation. Analysis of multiple second-site revertants of CCA4 revealed mutations in both the M protein and the N protein that could compensate for the original lesion in N. These data more precisely define the region of the N protein that interacts with the M protein. Further, we found that fusion of domain 3 of the N protein to the carboxy terminus of a heterologous protein caused it to be incorporated into MHV virions.","Hurst, Kelley R; Kuo, Lili; Koetzner, Cheri A; Ye, Rong; Hsue, Bilan; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,235,33

While, in recent years, progress has been made in understanding the role of Mre11 nuclease activities in DNA double-strand break repair, their role during replication has remained elusive. The nucleoside analog gemcitabine, widely used in cancer therapy, acts as a replication chain terminator; for a cell to survive treatment, gemcitabine needs to be removed from replicating DNA. Activities responsible for this removal have, so far, not been identified. We show that Mre11 3' to 5' exonuclease activity removes gemcitabine from nascent DNA during replication. This contributes to replication progression and gemcitabine resistance.

Fourteen recreational athletes (7 men and 7 women; VO2max = 35.7 ± 6.1 mlkg-1min-1) performed a bout of continuous and a bout of interval exercise (IE) both consisted of 5-min cycling at low intensity [80% of the power output (W) of the predetermined gas exchange threshold (GET) (80%WGET)] and 5-min cycling at high intensity {WGET plus the work rate corresponding to 50% of the difference between peak power output (PPO) at oxygen uptake (VO2max) test and the WGET [WGET + 0.50 &#916;(PPO - WGET)]}. CE compared to IE induced significant higher heart rate and ventilation as well as significant higher levels of mouth occlusion pressure for 0.1 s (P0.1) (P < 0.05) during low and high intensities. Our results indicate that CE stimulates respiration more than IE when the exercise is performed at the same relative intensity.,"Thomakos, Pierros; Geladas, Nikolaos; Paschalis, Vassilis; Giannopoulou, Ifigenia; Varouhakis, George; Behrakis, Panagiotis",J Sports Sci,235,16

The effect of reducing anthropogenic activities including transportation had an impact on the urban environment in terms of air quality which is shown to have improved for a number of pollutants, such as Nitrogen Dioxides (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO), based on monitoring data on the ground and from a satellite. In addition to primary pollutants CO and NOx emitted from mobile sources, PM2.5 (primary and secondary) and secondary Ozone (O3) during the lockdown period will also be analyzed using both statistical methods on air quality data and the modelling method with emission and meteorological data input to an air quality model. By estimating the decrease in traffic volume in the Sydney region, the corresponding decrease in emission input to the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (WRF-CMAQ) air quality model is then used to estimate the effect of lockdown on the air quality especially CO, NO2, O3, and PM2.5 in the Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) of Sydney. The results from both statistical and modelling methods show that NO2, CO, and PM2.5 levels decreased during the lockdown, but O3 instead increased. However, the change in the concentration levels are small considering the large reduction of ~30% in traffic volume.","Duc, Hiep; Salter, David; Azzi, Merched; Jiang, Ningbo; Warren, Loredana; Watt, Sean; Riley, Matthew; White, Stephen; Trieu, Toan; Tzu-Chi Chang, Lisa; Barthelemy, Xavier; Fuchs, David; Nguyen, Huynh",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),235,24

However, previous studies on pregnant patients were limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: This study retrospectively collected epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, imaging, management, and outcome data of 43 childbearing-age women patients (including 17 pregnant and 26 nonpregnant patients) who presented with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 19 to March 2, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 43 childbearing-age women in this study, none developed a severe adverse illness or died. The median ages of pregnant and nonpregnant women were 33.0 and 33.5 years, respectively. Pregnant women had a markedly higher proportion of history exposure to hospitals within 2 weeks before onset compared to nonpregnant women (9/17, 53% vs 5/26, 19%, P=.02) and a lower proportion of other family members affected (4/17, 24% vs 19/26, 73%, P=.004). Fever (8/17, 47% vs 18/26, 69%) and cough (9/17, 53% vs 12/26, 46%) were common onsets of symptoms for the two groups. Abdominal pain (n=4, 24%), vaginal bleeding (n=1, 6%), reduced fetal movement (n=1, 6%), and increased fetal movement (n=2, 13%) were observed at onset in the 17 pregnant patients. Higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte percent were observed in the pregnant group compared to the nonpregnant group (79% vs 56%, P<.001; 15% vs 33%, P<.001, respectively). In both groups, we observed an elevated concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and D-dimer in the pregnant group were significantly higher than those of the nonpregnant group (119.0 vs 48.0 U/L, P<.001; 2.1 vs 0.3µg/mL, P<.001, respectively). Both pregnant (4/10, 40%) and nonpregnant (8/15, 53%) women tested positive for influenza A virus. A majority of pregnant and nonpregnant groups received antiviral (13/17, 76% vs 25/26, 96%) and antibiotic (13/17, 76% vs 23/26, 88%) therapy. Additionally, both pregnant (2/11, 18%) and nonpregnant (2/19, 11%) recovered women redetected positive for SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology and clinical and laboratory features of pregnant women with COVID-19 were diverse and atypical, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis. Most pregnant women with COVID-19 were mild and moderate, and rarely developed severe pneumonia or severe adverse outcomes.","Wei, Lijie; Gao, Xuan; Chen, Suhua; Zeng, Wanjiang; Wu, Jianli; Lin, Xingguang; Zhang, Huiting; Mwamaka Sharifu, Lali; Chen, Ling; Feng, Ling; Wang, Shaoshuai",J Med Internet Res,235,30

Minimizing the spread of coronavirus and its economic consequences, and creating a new and safe lifestyle has now become the common goals of governments all over the world. Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. 'Government', 'Foreign Governments', 'Organizations', and 'General Public', as well as the interactions with 'W.H.O'. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed. In total 1440 causal factors of the UCAs were identified, and 2880 requirements were proposed to avoid such unsafe interactions.","Chen, Shufeng; Khastgir, Siddartha; Jennings, Paul",Saf Sci,235,20

In this review, we will summarise and put into perspective findings and debates relating to the diverse aspects of cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19. We will review evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the risk of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 susceptibility and course, and the mechanism of acute and long-term myocardial injury. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses membrane-bound angiotensin converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry. ACE2 is part of an important counter-regulatory circuit antagonising the harmful effects of angiotensin II on lung and heart. Modulation of ACE2 may therefore affect disease susceptibility and disease course. However, observational clinical studies and one randomised trial have so far not yielded evidence for harmful or beneficial effects of blockers of the RAAS during COVID-19. Age, gender, and multi-morbidity all increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases do so only minimally, but they may aggravate the disease course. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart tissue and myocytes is rare. Nevertheless, COVID-19 may lead to myocarditis-like acute cardiac injury, characterised by myocardial oedema, but lacking extensive myocyte loss and lymphocytic infiltration. Independent of this, increases in cardiac biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, D-dimer) are frequent, especially in the phase of severe systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and quantitatively associated with poor outcome. The pulmonary infection may result initially in right ventricular dysfunction, but in cases with severe systemic infection hypoxia, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm heart failure may eventually ensue. Unlike other infections and inflammatory states, COVID-19 does not appear to trigger acute coronary syndromes. In children, even mild COVID-19 can induce a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki-like symptoms frequently accompanied by cardiogenic shock.","Kurz, David J.; Eberli, Franz Robert",Swiss Med Wkly,235,6

This swift spread has caused the public to panic and look to scientists for answers. Fortunately, these scientists already have a wealth of data—the Covid-19 reports that each country releases, reports with valuable spatial-temporal properties. These data point toward some key actions that humans can take in their fight against Covid-19. Technically, the Covid-19 records can be described as sequences, which represent spatial-temporal linkages among the data elements with graph structure. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, the Interaction-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (IT-GCN), to analyze pandemic data. Specifically, IT-GCN introduces ARIMA into GCN to model the data which originate on nodes in a graph, indicating the severity of the pandemic in different cities. Instead of regular spatial topology, we construct the graph nodes with the vectors via ARIMA parameterization to find out the interaction topology underlying in the pandemic data. Experimental results show that IT-GCN is able to capture the comprehensive interaction-temporal topology and achieve well-performed short-term prediction of the Covid-19 daily infected cases in the United States. Our framework outperforms state-of-art baselines in terms of MAE, RMSE and MAPE. We believe that IT-GCN is a valid and reasonable method to forecast the Covid-19 daily infected cases and other related time-series. Moreover, the prediction can assist in improving containment policies.","Yu, Zehua Zheng Xianwei Yang Zhulun Bowen Lu Li Xutao Fu Maxian",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,235,3

To enable real-time monitoring of the incidence of mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - for which medical consultation might not be required - the Infectieradar web-based syndromic surveillance system was launched in mid-March 2020. Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms. The incidence rate of COVID-19-like illness was estimated and multivariable Poisson regression used to estimate the relative risks associated with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Between 17 March and 24 May 2020, 25 663 active participants were identified, who reported 7060 episodes of COVID-19-like illness over 131 404 person-weeks of follow-up. The incidence rate declined over the analysis period, consistent with the decline in notified cases. Male sex, age 65+ years and higher education were associated with a significantly lower COVID-19-like illness incidence rate (adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84), 0.77 (0.70-0.85), 0.84 (0.80-0.88), respectively) and the baseline characteristics ever-smoker, asthma, allergies, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and children in the household were associated with a higher incidence (RRs of 1.11 (1.04-1.19) to 1.69 (1.50-1.90)). Web-based syndromic surveillance has proven useful for monitoring the temporal trends in, and risk factors associated with, the incidence of mild disease. Increased relative risks observed for several patient factors could reflect a combination of exposure risk, susceptibility to infection and propensity to report symptoms.","McDonald, Scott A; van den Wijngaard, Cees C; Wielders, Cornelia C H; Friesema, Ingrid H M; Soetens, Loes; Paolotti, Daniela; van den Hof, Susan; van Hoek, Albert Jan",Epidemiol Infect,235,16

METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2020 were reviewed, including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for specialty drugs, biosimilars, and diabetes medications. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2020 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2019, overall US pharmaceutical expenditures grew 5.4% compared to 2018, for a total of $507.9 billion. This increase was driven to similar degrees by prices, utilization, and new drugs. Adalimumab was the top drug in US expenditures in 2019, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $36.9 billion (a 1.5% increase from 2018) and $90.3 billion (an 11.8% increase from 2018) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals growth was driven by new products and price increases. Several new drugs that will likely influence spending are expected to be approved in 2020. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures. CONCLUSION: For 2020 we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 9.0% to 11.0% and 2.0% to 4.0%, respectively, compared to 2019. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","Tichy, Eric M; Schumock, Glen T; Hoffman, James M; Suda, Katie J; Rim, Matthew H; Tadrous, Mina; Stubbings, JoAnn; Cuellar, Sandra; Clark, John S; Wiest, Michelle D; Matusiak, Linda M; Hunkler, Robert J; Vermeulen, Lee C",Am J Health Syst Pharm,235,16

It can treat dysentery, relieve heat, remove dampness, and regulate the intestines and stomach. The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 µmol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent. This study unleashed that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , and Liupao tea has a certain significance as a tea drink for the prevention of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The objective of this study was to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19.

In this article, we propose a simple and easy-to-use Bayesian model to estimate the infection rate, which is only partially identified. The model is based on the mapping from the fraction of positive test results to the cumulative infection rate, which depends on two unknown quantities: the probability of a false negative test result and a measure of testing bias towards the infected population.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of ocular and facial injuries in dental professionals and to investigate factors in dental practice contributing to ocular injuries. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in public and private sector universities. The study had 301 participants including final year undergraduate students, interns, postgraduate trainees, general practitioners, and dental specialists. Data were gathered online using Google forms. Information on sociodemographic, practice details, history of ocular and facial encounters during the clinical experience, and protective measures adopted by the dentists were collected. Means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables whereas frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. A Chi-square test was applied for association between variables. RESULTS: Ocular events and facial injuries occurred more in females 204 (67.8%) than in males 97(32.2%). Final year students reported more incidence of ocular encounters than specialists (40.9%, 3.3%). Dentists working in the government sector underwent more ocular encounters than those in private sectors 185(61.4%) and 96 (31.8%). Majority of participants reported that scaling was the procedure in which dentists experienced an ocular event. A significant association was found between ocular events, qualification, years of experience in clinical practice, number of patients treated per day, improper posture, and proper armamentarium (pâ<â0.05). However, no association was found between ocular events, gender, working sector, and dental procedures. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of ocular injuries were high compared to facial injuries and these outcomes were dependent on dental expertise and experiences. Appropriate measures should be adopted to minimize the risk of disease transmission and COVID-19 through the eyes among practicing dentists.","Anzar, Wajiha; Afaq, Ashar; Baig, Qaiser Ali; Mohamed, Osama Y; Bukhari, Ishfaq A; Vohra, Fahim",Work,235,22

The objectives of this study were to determine what the food industry needs to be able to control COVID-19 impacts in the work environment and what mitigation strategies are being implemented. A web-based needs assessment survey was distributed from January to April 2021, via 13 food professional/trade organizations and 2 social networks, targeting management professionals at food (produce, dairy, poultry, and beef/pork) processing facilities and produce farm operations in the US. Statistical analyses evaluated patterns in self-reported adoption of mitigation strategies against COVID-19 in the participants facilities/operations and perceived needs of the industry regarding COVID-Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis. In total 145 responses were received, of which 79 were usable, including 38 (48%) from the dairy, 17 (22%) from the fresh produce, and 24 (30%) from a mixture of other food industry sectors. Only two usable responses were from the beef/pork sector and none from the poultry sector. Findings revealed that several social distancing, biosecurity, and surveillance mitigation strategies against COVID-19 are commonly implemented in the participants facilities/operations, but their implementation frequency differs by the facility/operation size and industry sector. Also, findings indicated that collaboration between the food industry and government agencies, contingency plans and appropriate training, and new technologies are needed to control COVID- 19 in the food industry. Subject to limitations associated with the relatively low response rate (possible selection bias), the findings suggest that the US food industry is prepared to safeguard workers health and businesses in the event of a new COVID-19 variant or similar future disaster, provided that appropriate structures are put in place to ensure coordination and compliance, both before and during such an outbreak.","Llanos-Soto, Sebastian; Bulut, Ece; Murphy, Sarah I; Henry, Christopher J; Zoellner, Claire; Wiedmann, Martin; Wetherington, Diane; Adalja, Aaron; Alcaine, Samuel D; Ivanek, Renata",,235,12

This could be achieved via the inhibition of viral entry and/or replication, or by suppression of the immunologic response that is provoked by the infection (known as the cytokine storm). Probiotics are defined as 'live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host'. There is scarcity of evidence about the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota. So, whether or not these supplements can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19-associated symptoms is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to provide an indirect evidence about the utility of probiotics in combating COVID-19 or its associated symptoms, through the review of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, animal models and human trials. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The role of probiotics in alleviation of the novel COVID-19 has not been established. This review provides an insight about the anti-inflammatory, antiviral effects of probiotics in vitro, animal models and human. The latter can provide an indirect evidence and/or hypothesis-driven approach to investigate the use of probiotics as adjunctive therapy in the prophylaxis and/or alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms.","Akour, A",Lett Appl Microbiol,235,16

Information regarding coronavirus infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to describe the clinical course of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 (69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease. The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was at a mean of 29±6 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 30±6 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.","Pierce-Williams, Rebecca A M; Burd, Julia; Felder, Laura; Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S; Avila, Karina; Penfield, Christina A; Roman, Ashley S; DeBolt, Chelsea A; Stone, Joanne L; Bianco, Angela; Kern-Goldberger, Adina R; Hirshberg, Adi; Srinivas, Sindhu K; Jayakumaran, Jenani S; Brandt, Justin S; Anastasio, Hannah; Birsner, Meredith; O039,; Brien, Devon S; Sedev, Harish M; Dolin, Cara D; Schnettler, William T; Suhag, Anju; Ahluwalia, Shabani; Navathe, Reshama S; Khalifeh, Adeeb; Anderson, Kathryn; Berghella, Vincenzo",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,235,15

We applied quasi-Poisson regression models to the daily number of emergency transportations due to heat illness from 2008 to 2020 from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, to estimate the expected weekly number of emergency transportations from heat illness, with adjustment for their long-term trend and the weather conditions, including temperatures. We found that, at the national level, the number of heat illness emergency transports did not significantly increase or decrease from the annual trend in 2020. By prefecture, on the other hand, there were some prefectures in which the number of heat illness emergency transports was less than the average year, and most of them were in the week of August 10-16. By age group, the number of heat illness emergency transports in the 0-17 and 18-64 age groups was particularly low in some prefectures, and by severity, those in mild cases was particularly low. A caution is necessary that there is a possibility that a decrease in cases possibly associated with COVID-19 measures, such as, outdoor activity restrictions at schools/universities and cancellation of public events, may offset the possible increase in heat illness cases occurring elsewhere associated with wearing masks. Given that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is not expected yet, continuous and appropriate awareness-raising activities to prevent heat-related illness remain important.","Uryu, Shinya; Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Matsuura, Kentaro; Makiyama, Koji; Kawashima, Takayuki; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Eguchi, Akifumi; Kawamura, Yumi; Gilmour, Stuart; Sakamoto, Haruka; Shimizu, Kazuki; Ng, Chris Fook Sheng; Hashizume, Masahiro",Sci Total Environ,235,8

Although protective measures have been taken, the impact of the pandemic on key workers is yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: Participants were from four longitudinal age-homogeneous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970 and 1958). A web-based survey provided outcome data during the first UK national lockdown (May 2020) on COVID-19 infection status, changes in financial situation, trust in government, conflict with people around, household composition, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, smoking and sleep duration. Generalised linear models with logit link assessed the association between being a key worker and the above outcomes. Adjustment was made for cohort design, non-response, sex, ethnicity, adult socioeconomic position (SEP), childhood SEP, the presence of a chronic illness and receipt of a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts. FINDINGS: 13 736 participants were included. During lockdown, being a key worker was associated with increased chances of being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68) and experiencing conflict with people around (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). However, key workers were less likely to be worse off financially (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), to consume more alcohol (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) or to smoke more (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.80) during lockdown. Interestingly, being a key worker was not associated with psychological distress (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). INTERPRETATION: Being a key worker during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown was a double-edged sword, with both benefits and downsides. The UK government had the basic duty to protect its key workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it may have failed to do so, and there is an urgent need to rectify this in light of the ongoing third wave.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Wong, Andrew; Moon, James C; Hughes, Alun D; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Conti, Gabriella; Bann, David; Patalay, Praveetha; Captur, Gabriella",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),235,16

Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC50: 2.16 μg/mL) or after the polarization (EC50: 5.99 μg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells. Cephalandole B did not inhibit the IL-17A protein secretion. Nevertheless, both isolates notably inhibited IL-17A gene expression, especially cephalandole B, in a dose-dependent manner in Jukat cells with IL-17A luciferase reporter. Conclusions Indole alkaloids, indigodoles A, C, D, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to anti-IL 17A properties of Qing Dai. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated in this investigation for further promising anti-IL-17 lead drugs development.","Lee, Chia-Lin; Wang, Chien-Ming; Kuo, Yueh-Hsiung; Yen, Hung-Rong; Song, Ying-Chyi; Chou, Yu-Lun; Chen, Chao-Jung",Journal of Ethnopharmacology,235,1

People have had to resort to virtual events, with a subsequent proliferation of webinars, online meetings, and digital resources. In this situation we have had to find new ways of measuring the impact of these activities. Using the activities of the Italian Lichen Society (Società Lichenologica Italiana, SLI), Google Trends and colleagues’ contributions, we evaluated the performances and impacts of virtual tools on lichenological literacy. We compared the relative success of virtual and in-person events and the effort required; we evaluated followers’ appreciation of various categories of posts on SLI Facebook page; and designed a questionnaire to collate information on individual experiences of in-person and virtual events linked to lichens. As expected, online events generally required less effort to put together and deploy than in-person events and engaged more people, especially when recorded and made available online for a long time. Using online searches for the word “lichens” we found an association with national events, and there was a notable increase in membership of SLI over the last 10 years, demonstrating an increasing interest by people in lichens. Without excluding the positive effects of in-person experiences, we believe that online events offer a powerful tool to help increase interest in, and knowledge about lichens. This interest may help to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on this sensitive component of the ecosystem and help human-lichen relationships.

Description Dans cette étude, nous avons évalué la réponse vaccinale humorale chez une population de dialysé chronique après 2 ou 3 injections de vaccin anti-SARS-CoV-2. Méthodes Au total, 102 patients ont été inclus dans l’étude dont 82 hémodialysés et 20 dialysés péritonéaux. Tous ont reçu au moins 2 doses de 30μg de vaccin BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) à 28jours d’intervalle et ont totalisé 1 mois de suivi après la seconde dose. Résultats Après deux doses de vaccin, le taux de séroconversion était de 83,5 % (n = 81/97) parmi les patients initialement séronégatifs, plus précisément 83,1 % (n = 64/77) chez les patients en hémodialyse contre 90,2 % (n = 17/20) chez les patients en dialyse péritonéale.

The paucity of theory doubtless reflects an understandable focus on case studies and practical solutions. Yet this works against big picture thinking. Consequently, both our comprehension of social suffering and our ability to mitigate it are fragmented. Communitas is exemplary here. This refers to the improvisational acts of mutual help, collective feeling and utopian desires that emerge in the wake of disasters. It has been observed for as long as there has been a sociology of disasters. Within the field, there have been numerous efforts to name and describe it. Yet there has been far less enthusiasm to theorize it, which means that the disaster literature has not adequately explained the social conditions under which communitas arises (or fails to). In this article, we synthesize numerous case studies to do so. This takes us beyond simple statements of what communitas is and what it should be called, to considerations of the conditions under which it emerges, how it should be conceptualized, the factors that might prevent communitas, and how we might encourage it. While primarily a theoretical work, the identification of communitas’ facilitators and barriers have practical import for disaster risk reduction (DRR) policy as communitas has frequently proven to be a positive and potent force.","Matthewman, Steve; Uekusa, Shinya",Theory Soc,235,5

Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: We analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China. We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value. RESULTS: Fatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P<.001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P<.001) and stuffed nose (95% CI –0.499 to –0.082, P=.006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis. Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity. Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance. Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe. Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients. More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache. Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients. Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients. Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male patients.","Li, Jitian; Chen, Zhe; Nie, Yifei; Ma, Yan; Guo, Qiaoyun; Dai, Xiaofeng",J Med Internet Res,235,31
656051,656051,656051,Expanding controlled donation after the circulatory determination of death: statement from an international collaborative,20.543064,11.063438,2021-02-26,"SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus that has caused serious health crisis world-wide resulting into a pandemic situation. As per the literature, the SARS-CoV-2 is known to exploit humanACE2 receptors (similar toprevious SARS-CoV-1) for gaining entry into the host cell for invasion, infection, multiplication and pathogenesis. However, considering the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 along with the complex etiology and pathophysiological outcomes seen in COVID-19 patients, it seems that there may be an alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. I performed comparative protein sequence analysis, database based gene expression profiling, bioinformatics based molecular docking using authentic tools and techniques for unveiling the molecular basis of high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previous known coronaviruses. My study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) harbors a RGD motif in its receptor binding domain (RBD) and the motif is absent in all other previously known SARS-CoVs. The RGD motif is well known for its role in cell-attachment and cell-adhesion. My hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 may be (via RGD) exploiting integrins, that have high expression in lungs and all other vital organs, for invading host cells. However, an experimental verification is required. The expression of ACE2, which is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was found to be negligible in lungs. I assume that higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 could be due to this RGD-integrin mediated acquired cell-adhesive property. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of integrins is significantly high in lung cells, in particular αvβ6, α5β1, αvβ8 and an ECM protein, ICAM1. The molecular docking experiment showed the RBD of spike protein binds with integrins precisely at RGD motif in a similar manner as a synthetic RGD peptide binds to integrins as found by other researchers. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a number of phosphorylation sites that can induce cAMP, PKC, Tyr signaling pathways. These pathways either activate calcium ion channels or get activated by calcium. In fact, integrins have calcium & metal binding sites that were predicted around and in vicinity of RGD-integrin docking site in our analysis which suggests that RGD-integrins interaction possibly occurs in calcium-dependent manner. The higher expression of integrins in lungs along with their previously known high binding affinity (∼K(D) = 4.0nM) for virus RGD motif could serve as a possible explanation for high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. On the contrary, human ACE2 has lower expression in lungs and its high binding affinity (∼K(D)= 15nM) for spike RBD alone could not manifest significant virus-host attachment. This suggests that besides human ACE2, an additional or alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to exist. A highly relevant evidence never reported earlier which corroborate in favor of RGD-integrins mediated virus-host attachment is an unleashed cytokine storm which causes due to activation of TNF-α and IL-6 activation; and integrins role in their activation is also well established. Altogether, the current study has highlighted possible role of calcium and other divalent ions in RGD-integrins interaction for virus invasion into host cells and suggested that lowering divalent ion in lungs could avert virus-host cells attachment.","Chand Dakal, Tikam",Immunobiology,235,24

The main goal of all solutions was the principle of “reducing citizen activity and strengthening government control.” METHODS: We created a suitable exercise, creating 15 hypothetical situations for 3 stages. All participating units designed and proposed policy plans and execution protocols according to each situation. RESULTS: In the course of the exercise, many existing policies and execution protocols were validated. These addressed (1) situations occurring in Stage 1, when the epidemic was spreading to the point of lockdown preparations; (2) approaches to curb the continued spread of the epidemic in Stage 2; and (3) returning to work after the epidemic was controlled and lockdown lifted in Stage 3. Twenty response units participated in the exercise. Although favorable outcomes were obtained, the evaluators provided comments suggesting further improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our exercise demonstrated a successful example to help policy-making and revision in a large city of over 4 million people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also enhanced participants’ subject knowledge and familiarity with the implementation of a city lockdown. For locations intending to go into lockdown, similar tabletop exercises are an effective verification option.","Lo, I-Tien; Lin, Ching-Yuan; Cheng, Ming-Tai",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,235,1

Alternatively, g-C3N4-based visible-light-enabled photocatalytic disinfection can meet the above requirements and thus has attracted increasing interest in recent years. Here, we explored for the first time the antimicrobial ability and mechanisms of a wide spectrum of representative pathogens ranging from bacteria (Escherichia coli), to viruses (human adenoviruses) and spores (Bacillus subtilis spores) by g-C3N4/Vis system with the assistance of two common oxidants (H2O2 and PMS), especially in a comparative perspective. Pristine g-C3N4 could achieve a complete inactivation of bacteria (5-log) within 150 min, but displayed negligible antimicrobial activity against human viruses and spores (< 0.5-log). Fortunately, simple addition of oxidants into the system could greatly enhance the inactivation of bacteria (5-log with PMS within 120 min) and human viruses (2.6-log with H2O2 within 150 min). Roles of reactive oxygen species were found to be quite different in the disinfection processes, depending on both types of chemical oxidants and microbial pathogens. Additionally, disinfection efficiency could be facilely and effectively improved by statistical optimization of two important operating factors (i.e., catalyst loading and oxidant addition). Selection of added oxidants was determined by not only the target pathogen but also the water matrix. As a proof of concept, this work can provide some meaningful and useful information for advancing the field of green and sustainable water disinfection.","Zhang, Chi; Li, Yi; Wang, Chao; Zheng, Xinyi",Sci Total Environ,235,28

We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid‐19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial “cytokine storm”, as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl‐coenzyme A (acetyl‐CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian “resetting” of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl‐CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N‐acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus‐ and cytokine‐storm‐driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus‐and cytokine storm‐driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short‐chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid‐19 and other viral infections.","Anderson, George; Reiter, Russel J.",Rev Med Virol,235,16

Within the area of psychosis-risk syndromes, a highly heterogeneous clinical population, the picture is quite nuanced as the social restrictions resulting from the pandemic have reduced stress for some and increased it for others. Further, a number of pandemic-related societal and cultural changes have obfuscated the diagnostic and treatment landscape in this area as well. In this opinion article, we describe several prototypical cases, representative of presentations seen in our clinical high-risk (CHR) research programs. The cases highlight considerable clinical variability and, in addition, speak to the current complexities faced by diagnosticians and treatment providers. In addition to discussing these issues, this piece introduces potential solutions highlighting the promise of incorporating data-driven strategies to identify more homogenous CHR subtypes and employ precision medicine.","Mittal, Vijay A; Walker, Elaine F; Strauss, Gregory P",Schizophr Bull,235,22

MATERIAL AND METHODS: : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios RESULTS: : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2-5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20-68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. DISCUSSION: : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs. Further targeted research is necessary as well as targeted intervention in vulnerable groups but concerning mental health as well as the reduction of believing in conspiracy theories.","Patsali, Mikaella E.; Mousa, Danai-Priskila V.; Papadopoulou, Eleni V.K.; Papadopoulou, Konstantina K.K.; Kaparounaki, Chrysi K.; Diakogiannis, Ioannis; Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N",Psychiatry Res,235,16
