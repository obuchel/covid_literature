The ongoing DAPASALT mechanistic clinical study will evaluate natriuretic, diuretic, plasma/extracellular volume and blood pressure responses to dapagliflozin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with normal or impaired renal function (D-NRF and D-IRF, respectively), and in normoglycemic individuals with renal impairment (N-IRF). In this study, a mathematical model of renal physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology was used to prospectively predict changes in sodium excretion, blood and interstitial fluid volume (IFV), blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria in DAPASALT. After validating the model with previous diabetic nephropathy trials, virtual patients were matched to DAPASALT inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the DAPASALT protocol was simulated. Predicted changes in glycosuria, blood pressure, GFR, and albuminuria were consistent with other recent studies in similar populations. Predicted albuminuria reductions were 46% in D-NRF, 34.8% in D-IRF, and 14.2% in N-IRF. The model predicts similarly large IFV reduction between D-NRF and D-IRF, and less but still substantial IFV reduction in N-IRF, even though glycosuria attenuated in groups with impaired renal function. When DAPASALT results become available, comparison with these simulations will provide a basis for evaluating how well we understand the cardiorenal mechanism(s) of SGLT2i. Meanwhile, these simulations link dapagliflozin's renal mechanisms to changes in IFV and renal biomarkers, suggesting these benefits may extend to those with impaired renal function and nondiabetics. Significance Statement Mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors' cardiorenal benefits remain incompletely understood. We used a mathematical model of renal physiology/pharmacology to prospectively predict responses to dapagliflozin in the ongoing DAPASALT study. Key predictions include similarly large interstitial fluid volume (IFV) reductions between subjects with normal and impaired renal function, and less but still substantial IFV reduction in non-diabetics, even though glycosuria is attenuated in these groups. Comparing prospective simulations and study results will assess how well we understand the cardiorenal mechanism(s) of SGLT2i.","Hallow, Karen Melissa; Boulton, David; Penland, Robert C; Helmlinger, Gabriel; Nieves, Emily; van Raalte, Daniel H; Heerspink, Hiddo L; Greasley, Peter J",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,,964

299599,Reply to letter to the editor regarding article: Estimation of effects of nationwide lockdown for containing coronavirus infection on worsening of glycosylated haemoglobin and increase in diabetes-related complications: A simulation model using multivariate regression analysis (Ghosal et al.),2020,"In this article we develop a highly integrated effective degree approach to modeling epidemic and awareness spreading processes on multiplex networks coupled with awareness-dependent adaptive rewiring. This approach keeps track of the number of nearest neighbors in each state of an individual; consequently, it allows for the integration of changes in local contacts into the multiplex network model. We derive a formula for the threshold condition of contagion outbreak; also, we provide a lower bound for the threshold parameter to indicate the effect of adaptive rewiring. The threshold analysis is confirmed by extensive simulations. Our results show that awareness-dependent link rewiring plays an important role in enhancing the transmission threshold as well as lowering the epidemic prevalence. Moreover, it is revealed that intensified awareness diffusion in conjunction with enhanced link rewiring makes a greater contribution to disease prevention and control. In addition, the critical phenomenon is observed in the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the awareness diffusion rate, supporting the metacritical point previously reported in the literature. This work might shed light on the understanding of the interplay between epidemic dynamics and social contagion on adaptive networks.","Peng, Xiao-Long; Zhang, Yi-Dan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14073v1.pdf,964
467000,Analyzing the risk factors and predicting the learning ability of students during pandemic and comparing machine learning algorithms using orange tool,2021,"On his most recent solo album, Winter Wheat (2016), Winnipeg singer-songwriter John K Samson lingers in the liminal space between despair and hope, locating a fragile fecundity in the dormant growing season evoked by the album's title Winter Wheat voices a series of missed connections, unfinished stories, and interrupted conversations that cycle through many registers of despair before partially resolving into the tenuous hope that, as Samson writes in the title track (borrowing from Miriam Toews' novel A Complicated Kindness), ""this world is good enough, because it has to be"" Rather than advocating for complacency, Samson's songs perform a painful recounting of the past in order to imagine the troubled present as a time of tentative potential: though the world is not and has not been ""good enough"" as it is, still, to quote the title track, we must ""salute the ways we tried, [and] find a way to rise"" (""Winter Wheat"") Though we may not know exactly ""what survival means"" (""Confessions of a Futon Revolutionist,"" Fallow), to use the words of artist Jenny Holzer that Samson quotes in Winter Wheat's album liner epigraph, listening to, for, and with weak hope in Winter Wheat might model some collaborative ""way[s] to survive"" Many narrators on Winter Wheat struggle with a central agon that feels very contemporary: when action is likely futile, should we act anyway? According to Samson, the band's name emerged from ""a few places"" (see Todd)","Malloy, Bronwyn",Canadian Literature,,964
635805,Estimation of effects of nationwide lockdown for containing coronavirus infection on worsening of glycosylated haemoglobin and increase in diabetes-related complications: A simulation model using multivariate regression analysis,2020-04-10,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It emerged from China in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, causing a pandemic with unprecedented impacts on public health and economy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of curative treatments and vaccines. In humans, COVID-19 pathogenesis shows a wide range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Identifying animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that reflect the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 is of critical importance. Nonhuman primates (NHPss) correspond to relevant models to assess vaccine and antiviral effectiveness. This review discusses the use of NHPs as models for COVID-19 research, with focus on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, drug discovery and pre-clinical evaluation of vaccine candidates.","Albrecht, Laure; Bishop, Elodie; Jay, Basile; Lafoux, Blaise; Minoves, Marie; Passaes, Caroline",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452011/,964
