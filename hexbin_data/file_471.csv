2774,Recurrent rhinovirus infections in a child with inherited MDA5 deficiency,2017-07-03,"MDA5 is a cytosolic sensor of double-stranded RNA (ds)RNA including viral byproducts and intermediates. We studied a child with life-threatening, recurrent respiratory tract infections, caused by viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We identified in her a homozygous missense mutation in IFIH1 that encodes MDA5. Mutant MDA5 was expressed but did not recognize the synthetic MDA5 agonist/(ds)RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. When overexpressed, mutant MDA5 failed to drive luciferase activity from the IFNB1 promoter or promoters containing ISRE or NF-κB sequence motifs. In respiratory epithelial cells or fibroblasts, wild-type but not knockdown of MDA5 restricted HRV infection while increasing IFN-stimulated gene expression and IFN-β/λ. However, wild-type MDA5 did not restrict influenza virus or RSV replication. Moreover, nasal epithelial cells from the patient, or fibroblasts gene-edited to express mutant MDA5, showed increased replication of HRV but not influenza or RSV. Thus, human MDA5 deficiency is a novel inborn error of innate and/or intrinsic immunity that causes impaired (ds)RNA sensing, reduced IFN induction, and susceptibility to the common cold virus.","Lamborn, Ian T.; Jing, Huie; Zhang, Yu; Drutman, Scott B.; Abbott, Jordan K.; Munir, Shirin; Bade, Sangeeta; Murdock, Heardley M.; Santos, Celia P.; Brock, Linda G.; Masutani, Evan; Fordjour, Emmanuel Y.; McElwee, Joshua J.; Hughes, Jason D.; Nichols, Dave P.; Belkadi, Aziz; Oler, Andrew J.; Happel, Corinne S.; Matthews, Helen F.; Abel, Laurent; Collins, Peter L.; Subbarao, Kanta; Gelfand, Erwin W.; Ciancanelli, Michael J.; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Su, Helen C.",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502429/,471

5198,Rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen für mobileHealth,2015-07-23,"In the setting of the new A(H1N1) outbreak, the study was conducted to assess: (1) fear of the A(H1N1) pandemic; (2) risk avoidance behavior; (3) health-protective behavior; and (4) psychosocial impact in the ethnically diverse population of Malaysia. A cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted between July 11 and September 12, 2009. A total of 1,050 respondents were interviewed. Fear about the pandemic was high, with 73.2% of respondents reporting themselves as Slightly fearful/Fearful. High risk avoidance and health protective behavior were reported, with 78.0 and 99.0% reporting at least one avoidance and protective behavior respectively. Knowledge was a significant predictor for practice of healthprotective behavior across the three ethnic groups. Level of fear was significantly correlated with number of protective and avoidance behaviors. The study highlights the need for provision of accurate information that increases risk avoidance and health protective behaviors, while at the same time decreases fear or panic in the general public.","Wong, Li Ping; Sam, I-Ching",J Behav Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088090/,471

30842,Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and camels,2014-11-06,"Overstory and understory data were collected from 49 forest stands in 27 small stream bottoms in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of southwestern Alabama. The stands were arranged in a single—dimensioned ordination on the basis of the importance values of the persistent species in the overstories. Leading dominant species, from the dry end to the wet end of the ordination gradient, were Cornus florida, Pinus palustris, Quercus nigra, Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa sylvatica v. sylvatica, Magnolia virginiana, and N. sylvatica v. biflora. Two important seral species, most prominent at the middle of the ordination gradient and of relatively little importance at either end, were Pinus elliottii and Liriodendron tulipifera. The stand position on the ordination gradient, referred to as the moisture—regime index, was significantly related to water—table depth, soil—surface gradient, and soil pH at 63.5 cm. Failure to obtain significant relationship with other soil variables was attributed to the high frequency of fresh soil deposition in the small stream bottoms. As a check on the ordination analysis, species—present data were used to construct a species—correlation diagram. When species moisture—regime numbers from the ordination analysis were inserted in this diagram, good agreement was revealed in the results of the two independent analyses.","Gemborys, S.

60216,Release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nuclear import block enhances host transcription in human lung cells.,2013,"BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces a systemic inflammatory reaction that may contribute to postoperative complications. Preventing this reaction with steroids may improve outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of prophylactic steroids on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative corticosteroid administration with a control group in adults undergoing CPB. Outcomes of interest included mortality, myocardial infarction, and new onset atrial fibrillation. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS Fifty-six RCTs published between 1977 and 2015 were included in this meta-analysis. Mortality was not significantly different between groups [3.0% (215/7258 patients) in the steroid group and 3.5% (252/7202 patients) in the placebo group; relative risk (RR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-1.01; P=0.07; I2 = 0%]. Myocardial injury was more frequent in the steroid group [8.0% (560/6989 patients), compared with 6.9% (476/6929 patients); RR, 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; P=0.008; I2=0%]. New onset atrial fibrillation was lower in the steroid group [25.7% (1792/6984 patients) compared with 28.3% (1969/6964 patients), RR, 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.96, P=0.0005, I2=43%]; this beneficial effect was limited to small trials (P for interaction <0.00001). CONCLUSIONS After randomising 16 013 patients, steroid administration at the time of cardiac surgery had an unclear impact on mortality, increased the risk of myocardial injury, and the impact on atrial fibrillation should be viewed with caution given that large trials showed no effect.","Dvirnik, N; Belley-Cote, E P; Hanif, H; Devereaux, P J; Lamy, A; Dieleman, J M; Vincent, J; Whitlock, R P",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2017.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29576107/,471
65719,Simultaneous treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with serine and cysteine protease inhibitors prevents severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus entry.,2012,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia has increased considerably in recent years. To evaluate the efficacy of combined treatment of azithromycin with intravenous immunoglo-bulin (IVIG) or methylprednisolone in children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP). METHODS Children with RMPP were randomly allocated to group A [intravenous azithromycin (IA)+ methylprednisolone], group B (IA+IVIG) or group C (IA alone). Following a 7-day treatment, group C patients were randomly separated into two sub-groups: group C1 (IA+methylprednisolone) and group C2 (IA+IVIG). Temperature, respiratory symptoms and signs were examined. The average febrile period after treatment (F2), average total febrile period (F3), infiltration absorption, atelectasis resolution, pleural effusion disappearance were determined. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. RESULTS Seven days after enrollment, the average F2 after treatment of group A was the shortest. Compared with the control group C, the combined treatment group A and B showed higher rates of infiltration absorption, atelectasis resolution and pleural effusion disappearance, while lower levels of serum CRP, D-dimer and LDH. Fourteen days after enrollment, all children with combined therapy clinically improved, and presented better laboratory results. Group C1 showed shorter F3 and lower levels of CRP and LDH than those of group C2. Overall, group A showed the shortest F3, also has the lowest CRP and LDH. CONCLUSIONS Azithromycin with IVIG or methylprednisolone was better treatment for children with RMPP than azithromycin alone. IVIG treatment may be beneficial, especially when the efficacy of corticosteroids is insecure, thus could be considered as an alternative of primary therapeutic approaches.","Shan, Li-Shen; Liu, Xin; Kang, Xin-Yuan; Wang, Fei; Han, Xiao-Hua; Shang, Yun-Xiao",World journal of pediatrics : WJP,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-017-0014-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130749/,471

Are cytokines and cortisol important predictors for the severity of pediatric croup: A case control study. Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 281-287. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and PAF), cortisol, and IgE in the pathogenesis of croup and the factors determining its clinical severity. Patients diagnosed with croup at the Pediatric Emergency Department were included and thirty healthy children were included as a control group. Patients` demographic characteristics, clinical findings, recurrent croup history, and patient-family atopy history were recorded. Patients were grouped according to the Westley croup scoring system. Blood samples were taken from the control group and the patients for cytokines and cortisol. Respiratory pathogens were studied with PCR. Sixty-nine pediatric cases who were diagnosed as croup were included in the study (34 mild, 31 moderate, 4 severe). Group comparisons were made in terms of mild and moderate/severe groups. In the moderate/severe group, IL-10 and cortisol levels were higher than the mild group. The moderate/severe cortisol levels between 12:00 am-6:00 pm were found to be higher. PAF and TNF-alpha levels were detected to be higher in patients with a history of atopy. Viral agents were isolated in 45 patients; rhinovirus PCR tests were positive in 22 patients. In this study, rhinovirus was the most common etiology for croup. Increased levels of IL-10 and cortisol in the moderate/severe group indicate that different systemic and local mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of croup.","Üzüm, Özlem; Çağlar, Aykut; Küme, Tuncay; Sayıner, Arzu; Er, Anıl; Akgül, Fatma; Ulusoy, Emel; Yılmaz, Durgül; Duman, Murat",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2017.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29376573/,471
67628,Membrane Cholesterol Modulates Oligomeric Status and Peptide-membrane Interaction of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Fusion Peptide.,2019-11-19,"BACKGROUND Decades of research to understand the impacts of various types of environmental occupational and medical stressors on human health have produced a vast amount of data across many scientific disciplines. Organizing these data in a meaningful way to support risk assessment has been a significant challenge. To address this and other challenges in modernizing chemical health risk assessment, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) formalized the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework, an approach to consolidate knowledge into measurable key events (KEs) at various levels of biological organization causally linked to disease based on the weight of scientific evidence (http://oe.cd/aops). Currently, AOPs have been considered predominantly in chemical safety but are relevant to radiation. In this context, the Nuclear Energy Agency's (NEA's) High-Level Group on Low Dose Research (HLG-LDR) is working to improve research co-ordination, including radiological research with chemical research, identify synergies between the fields and to avoid duplication of efforts and resource investments. To this end, a virtual workshop was held on October 7-8th, 2020 with experts from the OECD AOP Programme together with the radiation and chemical research/regulation communities. The workshop, was a coordinated effort of Health Canada, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). The AOP approach was discussed including key issues to fully embrace its value and catalyze implementation in areas of radiation risk assessment. Conclusion: A joint chemical and radiological expert group was proposed as a means to encourage cooperation between risk assessors and an initial vision was discussed on a path forward. A global survey was suggested as a way to identify priority health outcomes of regulatory interest for AOP development. Multidisciplinary teams were needed to address the challenge of producing the appropriate data for risk assessments. Data management and machine learning tools were highlighted as a way to progress from weight of evidence to computational causal inference.","Chauhan, Vinita; Wilkins, Ruth; Beaton, Danielle; Sachana, Magdalini; Delrue, Nathalie; Yauk, Carole; O'Brien, Jason; Marchetti, Francesco; Halappanavar, Sabina; Boyd, Mike; Villeneuve, Daniel; Barton-Maclaren, Tara S; Meek, Bette; Anghel, Catalina; Heghes, Crina; Barber, Chris; Perkins, Edward; Leblanc, Julie; Burtt, Julie; Laakso, Holly; Laurier, Dominique; Lazo, Ted; Whelan, Maurice; Thomas, Russel; Cool, Donald",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09553002.2021.1884314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539251/,471
67915,Structural basis for potent cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody protection against lethal human and zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus challenge.,2008,"BACKGROUND The Southern Stingray (Dasyatis americana) is a batoid elasmobranch frequently exhibited in zoological institutions. Blood is commonly collected from the caudal hemal arch at the tail base in stingrays for the purpose of health assessment and clinical pathology tests. An alternative site that allows a dorsal or ventral approach without necessitating puncture of a cartilaginous structure has been identified between the cartilaginous pectoral fin rays (ceratotrichia). OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to compare CBC, plasma biochemistry analytes, and blood gas variables between blood samples collected from the caudal and pectoral fin vasculature sites of the Southern Stingray. METHODS Fifteen captive Southern Stingrays (10 females, 5 males) from 4 zoo and aquarium facilities were sampled. Lithium heparinized blood samples were collected from the caudal and pectoral venipuncture sites of each animal. Values from estimated total and differential leukocyte counts, plasma biochemistry analytes, and blood gas variables were compared. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between venipuncture sites for the measured analytes except for CK activity, which was statistically significantly higher in the pectoral site samples. Levels of agreement between sites were good or moderate for 22 analytes and poor for ALT, AST, CK, pO2 , lactate, monocytes, and eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS The good agreement between sampling sites for the majority of the measured analytes and the lack of differences that would alter clinical interpretation support the use of the pectoral site as an alternative to the traditional caudal fin venipuncture site in Southern Stingrays.","Phillips, Brianne E; Christiansen, Emily F; Stoskopf, Michael K; Broadhurst, Heather; George, Robert; Harms, Craig A",Veterinary clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27977062/,471

Numerous studies have demonstrated that bariatric operations ameliorate T2DM significantly. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L-RYGB) is considered as the gold standard procedure. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and impact of L-RYGB with ileal transposition (or interposition) on diabetes resolution in a patient who has not benefited from any medical therapy, with its additional effect on the amelioration of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient was a 38-year-old diabetic woman with uncontrolled blood glucose despite medical treatment, with additional gastroesophageal reflux disease. Following the procedure, her biochemical parameters and reflux symptoms improved significantly within 10 months. We think that L-RYGB with ileal transposition may be easily employed to gain a maximum effect in diabetics with adverse prognosis. This technique may be an alternative in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with gastroesophageal reflux.","Ersoz, Feyzullah; Duzkoylu, Yigit; Deniz, Mehmet Mehdi; Boz, Mustafa",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2015.54224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26649100/,471

DESIGN This was a descriptive, retrospective-cohort observational study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING The sample comprised 417 adults admitted to an urban community hospital licensed for 249 acute and 52 acute rehabilitation beds in Charleston, South Carolina, and referred to WOC nurses for evaluation and treatment. METHODS Prevalence and incidence rates were calculated from data previously collected for quality improvement purposes from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, by the WOC nurses and documented in a secure, password-protected electronic spreadsheet. The prevalence of IAD/ITD was calculated as the proportion of patients diagnosed with IAD/ITD on admission to our facility. The incidence of IAD and ITD was calculated as percentage of patients who developed IAD/ITD during the course of their hospital stay. All units in the hospital were included. RESULTS The mean prevalence of IAD present on admission was 16%; the prevalence decreased over the data collection period; it was 21% in 2014, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired IAD during the data collection period was 23%; the highest rate (26%) occurred in 2016. Patients classified as normal weight from their body mass index and patients 60 years and older had the highest incidence of hospital-acquired IAD. The mean prevalence of ITD for patients admitted to the hospital was 40% for the 3-year time; annual rates varied from a low of 36% in 2015 to a high of 42% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired ITD was 33% over the data collection period; mean incidence rates were 32% in 2014, 39% in 2015, and 29% in 2016. The incidence of ITD was higher in patients classified as obese based on body mass index in patients 60 years and older. The most common location was the gluteal cleft. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of IAD fell within the range of prior epidemiologic studies, but the facility-acquired IAD incidence rates were higher than other studies based in the acute care setting. The prevalence of ITD was higher than rates reported in prior studies; we searched the literature and found no previous reports of ITD occurrences over the course of a hospital stay. Additional research regarding IAD prevention and ITD in the gluteal cleft is needed. Data collection regarding IAD and ITD prevalence and incidence could be incorporated into the data collection tool used for pressure injury data collection for the National Database of Nursing Sensitive Indicators.","Arnold-Long, Mary; Johnson, Emily","Journal of wound, ostomy, and continence nursing : official publication of The Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society",https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870318/,471

Though, slight known about the function of an individual gut bacterium in zebrafish. In this study, germ-free (GF) and conventionally reared (CV) zebrafish models utilized for studying the role of gut bacteria Vibrio sp. and Aeromonas sp. After the analysis of gut microbial profile in zebrafish male and female at three-month age, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria dominated the main composition of zebrafish intestinal microflora. However, the relative richness of them was different base on gender variance. Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. belonging to Proteobacteria phylum of bacteria were isolated from zebrafish gut, and their potential capacities to trigger innate immunity were investigated. In gut microbiota absence, the expression levels of the innate immunity genes in the GF group were not significantly changed compared to the CV group. After exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp., the expression levels of myd88, TLRs-, and inflammation-related genes were increased in both GF and CV groups, except tlr2 and NLRs-related genes. However, the expression level of NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 pathway genes were all decreased after exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. in both GF and CV groups. Interestingly, inflammation-related genes (tnfa, tnfb, and il1β) were activated in the CV group, and there were not significantly changed in the GF group, indicating that other bacteria were indispensable for Aeromonas sp. or Vibrio sp. to activate the inflammation response. Taken together, this is the first study of gut bacteria Vibrio sp. and Aeromonas sp. prompting the innate immune response using the GF and CV zebrafish model.","Xin, Guangyuan; Li, Wei-Guo; Yoganandham, Suman Thodhal; Jia, Pan-Pan; Ma, Yan-Bo; Pei, De-Sheng",Fish & shellfish immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.08.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810528/,471
82305,Quantitative proteomics analysis reveals BAG3 as a potential target to suppress severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication.,2010,"Evidence from multiple samples of trauma-exposed populations across the globe suggests that intergenerational trauma constitutes a biopsychological risk factor which manifests itself throughout the life cycle of offspring of trauma survivors. Prior empirical studies have shown that adult children of Holocaust survivors (OHS, also referred to in select quotes as 2G for ""Second Generation"") are vulnerable to life-threatening situations. This study aimed to examine the reactions of OHS to the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a serious threat to the lives of many, in particular to older adults. As they enter middle age, OHS were observed to have more medical health issues and less positive perceptions of their own aging relative to peers. Less positive subjective aging was associated with more negative psychiatric symptoms in relation to Covid-19-related loneliness, further suggesting that OHS are a group of aging adults with particular vulnerabilities to negative mental health effects of the pandemic and of the social distancing and isolation it imposed. This study is a qualitative report of experiences expressed by over 1,200 participants in several web-based interactive webinars for OHS during the period of ""shelter at home"" in March and April 2020. It is proposed that this format of ""web-based, second-best"" way of being together, an intervention that emerged spontaneously in response to the coronavirus and social distancing, offers a novel, nonpathologizing, effective form of supportive psychosocial intervention uniquely suited to the unprecedented challenges experienced during times requiring social distancing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed and compared the demographic data, radiological workups and patient-reported outcomes of 39 patients treated with rPELD and 78 patients treated with fluoroscopy-assisted PELD (fPELD) at our institution between January 2019 and December 2019. RESULTS Our data showed a single-shot puncture in rPELD group was significantly more precise compared to 4.12 ± 1.71 trials in fPELD group (p < 0.001). There was an overall reduction of fluoroscopy (21.33 ± 3.89 vs. 33.06 ± 2.92 times, p < 0.001), puncture-channel time (13.34 ± 3.03 mins vs. 15.03 ± 4.5 mins, p = 0.038) as well as total operation time (57.46 ± 7.49 mins vs. 69.40 ± 12.59 mins, p < 0.001) using the rPELD technique against the fPELD technique. However, there were no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes, length of hospital stay, and complication rate between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our data indicate that rPELD provides a precise skin entry point and optimal trajectory for puncture, which increases the success rate of PELD, thus negates the need for a revision surgery. However, further studies are required to confim the superiority and application rPELD technique.","Jin, Mengran; Lei, Longyue; Li, Fengqing; Zheng, Biao",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.12.095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385595/,471

Our aim was to determine the optimal prehospital transportation strategy for individual patients and to assess which factors influence this decision. Methods- We constructed a decision tree model to compare outcome of ischemic stroke patients after transportation to a primary stroke center versus a more distant intervention center. The optimal strategy was estimated based on individual patient characteristics, geographic location, and workflow times. In the base case scenario, the primary stroke center was located at 20 minutes and the intervention center at 45 minutes. Additional sensitivity analyses included an urban scenario (10 versus 20 minutes) and a rural scenario (30 versus 90 minutes). Results- Direct transportation to the intervention center led to better outcomes in the base case scenario when the likelihood of a large vessel occlusion as a cause of the ischemic stroke was >33%. With a high likelihood of large vessel occlusion (66%, comparable with a Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation score of 5 or above), the benefit of direct transportation to the intervention center was 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (=36 days in full health). In the urban scenario, direct transportation to an intervention center was beneficial when the risk of large vessel occlusion was 24% or higher. In the rural scenario, this threshold was 49%. Other factors influencing the decision included door-to-needle times, door-to-groin times, and the door-in-door-out time. Conclusions- The preferred prehospital transportation strategy for suspected stroke patients depends mainly on the likelihood of large vessel occlusion, driving times, and in-hospital workflow times. We constructed a robust model that combines these characteristics and can be used to personalize prehospital triage, especially in more remote areas.","Venema, Esmee; Lingsma, Hester F; Chalos, Vicky; Mulder, Maxim J H L; Lahr, Maarten M H; van der Lugt, Aad; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Hunink, M G Myriam; Dippel, Diederik W J; Roozenbeek, Bob",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.022562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661502/,471

This retrospective study was performed to assess the actual outcomes of SPALS in 2 simple gynecological oncology procedures, namely, diagnostic laparoscopy and bilateral adnexectomy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective monocentric study. Case files of only those women who underwent bilateral adnexectomies and diagnostic and/or staging laparoscopy were studied with respect to the operative room time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative pain, and lengths of hospital stays. The main objective was to assess the feasibility and utility of SPALS surgery in gynecology. The secondary objective was to compare this group with a cohort of patients with multiport conventional laparoscopic surgery (MPCLS) performed during the same period. RESULTS From December 2009 to March 2013, there were 134 patients who underwent these 2 procedures. Eighty adnexectomies were performed, 41 by SPALS and 39 by MPCLS. Fifty-four diagnostic laparoscopies were performed, with 27 patients in each group. In the group of adnexectomies, operative time was significantly lower in SPALS compared with MPCLS (36 vs 59 minutes, P < 10) and also compared with the postoperative stay (1 vs 2.2 nights, P < 10). By contrast, no significant difference was observed between the 2 methods of access in all the parameters studied in the group of diagnostic laparoscopies. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrates that SPALS is feasible and safe for simple gynecological procedures. This approach may result in a smooth postoperative course and shorter hospital stay and can thus be promoted to a day care procedure.","Figurelli, Justine; Bresson, Lucie; Narducci, Fabrice; Katdare, Ninad; Coulon, Pascale; Fournier, Charles; Leblanc, Eric",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887443/,471

This is offered to patients that prefer a temporary outcome or would like to avoid general anesthesia. In addition, it can be used in postrhinoplasty patients to correct nasal deformities or irregularities. This systematic review highlights common filler types and injection techniques, and associated patient satisfaction and complications to further guide practitioners. METHODS A systematic review was performed using keywords and Medical Subject Headings search terms. PubMed, EmBase, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched using the appropriate search terms. Data collected from each study included patient satisfaction and complications, in addition to injection material, location, and technique. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred thirty-two studies were found based on search criteria. After full-text screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies were included. A total of 1600 patients underwent nonsurgical rhinoplasty, most commonly with hyaluronic acid (73.38 percent), followed by calcium hydroxyapatite (12.44 percent). Nearly 95 percent of patients were satisfied with results, and there were only 26 relatively minor complications reported. There were no reports of vascular complications such as skin necrosis or visual compromise. CONCLUSIONS Based on the authors' review of the literature, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is an effective temporary alternative to traditional augmentation rhinoplasty for corrections of nasal shape with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Complications may be underreported, and thus further investigation is needed to better understand the true incidence of major complications related to vascular compromise.","Williams, Lauren C; Kidwai, Sarah M; Mehta, Karan; Kamel, George; Tepper, Oren M; Rosenberg, Joshua D",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000006892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32590640/,471

99716,Engineering T cells specific for a dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus CD8 T cell epitope.,2011,"BACKGROUND Healthcare expenditure in the Netherlands is increasing at such a rate that currently 1 in 7 employees are working in healthcare/curative care. Future increases in healthcare spending will be restricted, given that 10% of the country's gross domestic product is spent on healthcare and the fact that there is a workforce shortage. Dutch healthcare consists of a curative sector (mostly hospitals) and nursing care at home. The two entities have separate national budgets (€25 bn + €20 bn respectively) AIM: In a proof of concept, we explored a new hospital-at-home model combining hospital cure and nursing home care budgets. This study tests the feasibility of (1) providing hospital care at home, (2) combining financial budgets, (3) increasing workforces by combining teams and (4) improving perspectives and increasing patient and staff satisfaction. RESULTS We tested the feasibility of combining the budgets of a teaching hospital and home care group for cardiology. The budgets were sufficient to hire three nurse practitioners who were trained to work together with 12 home care cardiovascular nurses to provide care in a hospital-at-home setting, including intravenous treatment. Subsequently, the hospital-at-home programme for endocarditis and heart failure treatment was developed and a virtual ward was built within the e‑patient record. CONCLUSION The current model demonstrates a proof of concept for a hospital-at-home programme providing hospital-level curative care at home by merging hospital and home care nursing staff and budgets. From the clinical perspective, ambulatory intravenous antibiotic and diuretic treatment at home was effective in safely achieving a reduced length of stay of 847 days in endocarditis patients and 201 days in heart-failure-at-home patients. We call for further studies to facilitate combined home care and hospital cure budgets in cardiology to confirm this concept.","van Ramshorst, J; Duffels, M; de Boer, S P M; Bos-Schaap, A; Drexhage, O; Walburg, S; de Beij, J; van der Stoop, D; Umans, V A W M",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-021-01614-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524621/,471
102138,Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 response: Micorobiots as Lactobacilli could make the difference.,2020-12-18,"INTRODUCTION Molecular genetic analyses of lung adenocarcinoma have recently become standard of care for treatment selection. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium was formed to enable collaborative multi-institutional analyses of 10 potential oncogenic driver mutations. Technical aspects of testing and clinicopathologic correlations are presented. METHODS Mutation testing in at least one of the eight genes (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], KRAS, ERBB2, AKT1, BRAF, MEK1, NRAS, and PIK3CA) using SNaPshot, mass spectrometry, Sanger sequencing+/- peptide nucleic acid and/or sizing assays, along with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and/or MET fluorescence in situ hybridization, were performed in six labs on 1007 patients from 14 institutions. RESULTS In all, 1007 specimens had mutation analysis performed, and 733 specimens had all 10 genes analyzed. Mutation identification rates did not vary by analytic method. Biopsy and cytology specimens were inadequate for testing in 26% and 35% of cases compared with 5% of surgical specimens. Among the 1007 cases with mutation analysis performed, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and ERBB2 alterations were detected in 22%, 25%, 8.5%, and 2.4% of cases, respectively. EGFR mutations were highly associated with female sex, Asian race, and never-smoking status; and less strongly associated with stage IV disease, presence of bone metastases, and absence of adrenal metastases. ALK rearrangements were strongly associated with never-smoking status and more weakly associated with presence of liver metastases. ERBB2 mutations were strongly associated with Asian race and never-smoking status. Two mutations were seen in 2.7% of samples, all but one of which involved one or more of PIK3CA, ALK, or MET. CONCLUSION Multi-institutional molecular analysis across multiple platforms, sample types, and institutions can yield consistent results and novel clinicopathological observations.","Sholl, Lynette M; Aisner, Dara L; Varella-Garcia, Marileila; Berry, Lynne D; Dias-Santagata, Dora; Wistuba, Ignacio I; Chen, Heidi; Fujimoto, Junya; Kugler, Kelly; Franklin, Wilbur A; Iafrate, A John; Ladanyi, Marc; Kris, Mark G; Johnson, Bruce E; Bunn, Paul A; Minna, John D; Kwiatkowski, David J",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1097/jto.0000000000000516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738220/,471

Even in well organised screening programmes, achieving high population coverage is challenging. The transition to using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing as the primary screening modality, rather than cytology, has introduced the possibility of using a self-collected sample for the primary HPV test. This has been shown to be a reliable method of detecting CIN2+ (Polman et al, Lancet Oncology 2019;20(2):229-38). Regardless of the way the sample is collected, the low specificity of a positive HPV test means that positive results must be triaged. In all cases where self-sampling has been integrated into a cervical screening programme to date, this triage is by cytology on a subsequent, clinician taken sample. Other molecular tests which can be performed on the original sample may in the future be an alternative, but are not yet fully evaluated.","Denton, Karin J",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.16388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32613689/,471

This study aimed to leverage the rapid implementation of telehealth due to COVID-19 to understand the perspectives of young people and clinicians on how telehealth impacts service delivery, service quality, and to develop pathways for future uses. Youth mental health service users (aged 12-25) and clinicians took part in an online survey exploring service provision, use, and quality following the adoption of telehealth. Service use data from the period were also examined. Ninety-two clinicians and 308 young people responded to the survey. Service use was reduced compared to the same period in 2019, however, attendance rates were higher. Across eight domains of service quality, the majority of young people reported that telehealth positively impacted service quality, and were significantly more likely to rate telehealth as having a positive impact on service quality than clinicians. There was high interest in continuing to use telehealth as part of care beyond the pandemic, supporting its permanent role in youth mental health care for a segment of service users. Future work should explore how best to support its long-term implementation.","Nicholas, Jennifer; Bell, Imogen H; Thompson, Andrew; Valentine, Lee; Simsir, Pinar; Sheppard, Holly; Adams, Sophie",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725578/,471

109739,Efficient activation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein by the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2.,2010,"The aims of the current study were to identify Mycoplasma suis antigens and develop a multiplex microbead immunoassay (MIA). A M. suis-expression library was screened for immunogens using sera from infected pigs. Based on bioinformatics, putative antigens were identified within positive inserts; gene fragments were expressed and purified as polyhistidine fusion proteins, and immunoreactivity was confirmed by Western blot. Selected antigens were used to develop a MIA. Sera from noninfected and infected pigs were used to set the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) cutoffs and as positive controls, respectively. Assay specificity was tested using sera from pigs seropositive for other pathogens (2 different pigs seropositive for each pathogen). Samples from 51 field pigs and 2 pigs during the course of acute (pig 1) and chronic (pig 2) infections were tested using MIA, indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Sixteen reactive plaques (52 genes) were detected. A heat-shock protein (GrpE), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), and 4 proteins from paralogous gene families (PGFs) were identified as antigens by Western blot. While GrpE, GAPN, and 1 PGF protein were strong antigens, the others were not suitable as MIA targets. A MIA using GrpE, GAPN, and the strongly reactive PGF protein was developed. Cross-reactivity with sera from pigs infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Porcine circovirus-2, Porcine parvovirus, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine respiratory coronavirus with this MIA was not observed. Pig 2 was consistently positive by MIA and qPCR, whereas pig 1, initially negative, seroconverted before becoming qPCR positive. Only 2 samples (from pig 1) were IHA positive. Five (9.8%) field samples were qPCR positive and 40 (78.43%) were positive for all 3 MIA antigens; however, all were IHA negative. In summary, the MIA is specific and more sensitive than qPCR and IHA, providing simultaneous evaluation of antibody response to M. suis antigens.","Guimaraes, Ana M S; Santos, Andrea P; Timenetsky, Jorge; Bower, Leslie P; Strait, Erin; Messick, Joanne B","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638713520542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557752/,471

Herein, we report the design and validation of chemiluminescence probe ADLumin-1 as a turn-on probe for amyloid beta (Aβ) species. Two-photon imaging indicates that ADLumin-1 can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and provides excellent contrast for Aβ plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In vivo brain imaging shows that the chemiluminescence signal of ADLumin-1 from 5-month-old transgenic 5xFAD mice is 1.80-fold higher than that from the age-matched wild-type mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to further dually-amplify signal via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (DAS-CRET) using two non-conjugated smart probes (ADLumin-1 and CRANAD-3) in solutions, brain homogenates, and in vivo whole brain imaging. Our results show that DAS-CRET can provide a 2.25-fold margin between 5-month-old 5xFAD mice and wild type mice. We believe that our strategy could be extended to other aggregating-prone proteins.","Yang, Jing; Yin, Wei; Van, Richard; Yin, Keyi; Wang, Peng; Zheng, Chao; Zhu, Biyue; Ran, Kathleen; Zhang, Can; Kumar, Mohanraja; Shao, Yihan; Ran, Chongzhao",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17783-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792510/,471

Green infrastructure (GI) has been increasingly recognized as a promising nature-based solution for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and other societal objectives for sustainable development. Although the climate contribution of GI has been extensively addressed in the literature, the linkages between the climate benefits and associated co-benefits and trade-offs remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence from 141 papers, focusing on their climate benefits, relevant co-benefits and trade-offs, and the GI types that provide such climate (co-)benefits. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the links between climate benefits, co-benefits and types of GI, categorized along a green-grey continuum so that researchers/practitioners can find information according to their topic of interest. We further provide an analysis of trade-offs between various GI benefits. 'Bundles' of major co-benefits and trade-offs for each climate benefit can be identified with recommendations for strategies to maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs. To promote climate-resilient pathways through GI, it is crucial for decision-makers to identify opportunities to deliver multiple ecosystem services and benefits while recognizing disservices and trade-offs that need to be avoided or managed.","Choi, Changsoon; Berry, Pam; Smith, Alison",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932834/,471

For patients in whom systemic sepsis is absent or well controlled, minimal access techniques, such as endoscopic therapies, are being increasingly employed to reduce the morbidity of surgical re-intervention. In this review, we aim to assess the utility of endoscopic management in the acute setting of colorectal anastomotic complications, focusing on anastomotic leak. METHOD A literature search was performed for published full text articles using the PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases using the search criteria string ""colorectal anastomotic (""leak"" OR ""bleed""), ""endoscopy"", endoscopic management"". Additional papers were detected by scanning the references of relevant papers. Data were extracted from each study by two authors onto a dedicated pro-forma. Given the nature of the data extracted, no meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 89 papers were identified, 16 of which were included in this review; an additional 14 papers were obtained from reference searches. In patients who are not physiologically compromised, there are promising data regarding the salvage rate of stents, over-the-scope endoscopic clips, vacuum therapy and fibrin glue in the early management of colorectal anastomotic leak. There is no consensus regarding the optimal approach, and data to assist the physician in patient selection are lacking. Whilst data on salvage (i.e. healing and avoidance of surgery) are well understood, no data on functional outcomes are reported. CONCLUSION Endoscopic therapy in the management of stable patients with colorectal anastomotic leaks appears safe and in selected patients is associated with high rates of technical success. Challenges remain in selecting the most appropriate strategy, patient selection, and understanding the functional and long-term sequelae of this approach. Further evidence from large prospective cohort studies are needed to further evaluate the role of these novel strategies.","Clifford, R E; Fowler, H; Govindarajah, N; Vimalachandran, D; Sutton, P A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06670-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675662/,471

The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic GB drainage for patients with symptomatic GB disease. METHODS Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were performed in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled proportions were calculated for measured outcomes including technical success, clinical success, adverse event rate, recurrence rate, and rate of reintervention. Subgroup analyses were performed for transmural versus transpapillary, transmural lumen apposing stent (LAMS), and comparison to percutaneous transhepatic drainage. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. Publication bias was ascertained by funnel plot and Egger regression testing. RESULTS Thirty-six studies (n = 1538) were included. Overall, endoscopic GB drainage achieved a technical and clinical success of 87.33% [(95% CI 84.42-89.77); I2 = 39.55] and 84.16% [(95% CI 80.30-87.38); I2 = 52.61], with an adverse event rate of 11.00% [(95% CI 9.25-13.03); I2 = 7.08]. On subgroup analyses, EUS-guided transmural compared to ERC-assisted transpapillary drainage resulted in higher technical and clinical success rates [OR 3.91 (95% CI 1.52-10.09); P = 0.005 and OR 4.59 (95% CI 1.84-11.46); P = 0.001] and lower recurrence rate [OR 0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.52); P = 0.002]. Among EUS-guided LAMS studies, technical success was 94.65% [(95% CI 91.54-96.67); I2 = 0.00], clinical success was 92.06% [(95% CI 88.65-94.51); I2 = 0.00], and adverse event rate was 11.71% [(95% CI 8.92-15.23); I2 = 0.00]. Compared to percutaneous drainage, EUS-guided drainage possessed a similar efficacy and safety with significantly lower rate of reintervention [OR 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.13); P < 0.001].

Herein, we report on the synthesis, identification and biological evaluation of a quinazolinedione reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer, QD394, with significant cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. QD394 shows a transcriptomic profile remarkably similar to napabucasin, a cancer stemness inhibitor. Both small molecules inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation, increase cellular ROS and decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio. Moreover, QD394 causes an iron- and ROS-dependent, GPX4 mediated cell death, suggesting ferroptosis as a major mechanism. Importantly, QD394 decreases the expression of LRPPRC and PNPT1, two proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA catabolic processes and both negatively correlated with the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Pharmacokinetic-guided lead optimization resulted in the derivative QD394-Me which showed improved plasma stability and reduced toxicity in mice compared to QD394. Overall, QD394 and QD394-Me represent novel ROS-inducing drug-like compounds warranting further development for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Hu, Shuai; Sechi, Mario; Singh, Pankaj Kumar; Dai, Lipeng; McCann, Sean; Sun, Duxin; Ljungman, Mats; Neamati, Nouri",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809827/,471

However, several studies indicate that the benefit of adjudication in estimating treatment effect may be limited. AIMS This post hoc analysis of SOCRATES (NCT01994720) compared the treatment effects and investigated the agreement of clinical event assessment by site investigators and independent adjudicators. METHODS SOCRATES compared ticagrelor and aspirin in 13,199 patients with acute minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. The primary endpoint was stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Stroke was the major component of the primary endpoint and a secondary endpoint. The endpoints were adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. We compared the treatment effect on the primary endpoint and stroke alone based on the investigators' and adjudicators' assessments, and investigated the agreement rate on the stroke endpoint and major hemorrhages. RESULTS The hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for ticagrelor versus aspirin therapy for the primary endpoint were 0.89 (0.78-1.01) when calculated on adjudicator-assessed events and 0.88 (0.78-1.00) for investigator-assessed events. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stroke were 0.86 (0.75-0.99) based on the adjudicators' diagnoses and 0.85 (0.75-0.97) based on the investigators' diagnoses. The overall agreement between adjudicator- and investigator-diagnosed stroke was 91%, and for major hemorrhages was 88%. CONCLUSIONS In SOCRATES, there was no clinically meaningful difference in the estimated treatment effect, on either the primary endpoint or stroke, by using investigator- or adjudicator-assessed events. Double-blind treatment outcome studies with stroke endpoints may not benefit from adjudication.

147241,Effects of human anti-spike protein receptor binding domain antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus neutralization escape and fitness.,2014,"OBJECTIVE Chest drains are used routinely after wedge resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), although this practice is based largely on tradition rather than evidence. Chest drains may furthermore cause pain, infections, and prolonged length of stay. The aim of this prospective observational study was to assess the feasibility of avoiding chest drains following VATS wedge resection for pulmonary nodules. METHODS Between 1 February and 25 August 2015 166 consecutive patients planned for VATS wedge resection of pulmonary nodules were screened for inclusion using the following criteria: Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ≥60 % of expected, FEV1/forced vital capacity ≥70 %, tumour diameter ≤2 cm, distance from tumour to visceral pleura ≤3 cm, ≤2 separate wedges, no air leak on an intraoperative air leakage test and absence of severe adhesions, bullous/emphysematous disease, pleural effusion and coagulopathy. Chest X-rays were done twice on the day of surgery. 30-day complications were compiled from patient records. RESULTS 49 patients underwent 51 unilateral VATS wedge resections without using a post-operative chest drain. No patient required reinsertion of a chest drain. 30 (59 %) patients had a pneumothorax of mean size 12 ± 12 mm on supine 8-h post-operative X-ray for which the majority resolved spontaneously within 2-week control. There were no complications on 30-day follow-up. Median length of stay was 1 day. CONCLUSIONS The results support that VATS wedge resection for pulmonary nodules without a post-operative chest drain may be safe in a selected group of patients.","Holbek, Bo Laksáfoss; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Kehlet, Henrik; Petersen, René Horsleben",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-016-0692-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27510705/,471

Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-α (Ad5-pIFN-α) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5-pIFN-α. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5-pIFN-α, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5-pIFN-α, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-α at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.","Brockmeier, Susan L; Loving, Crystal L; Nelson, Eric A; Miller, Laura C; Nicholson, Tracy L; Register, Karen B; Grubman, Marvin J; Brough, Douglas E; Kehrli, Marcus E",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.05490-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22301694/,471

People with dysfunctional endothelium, defined by nitric oxide deficiency, appear to have a more severe disease course. As such, nitric oxide has therapeutic potential to mitigate COVID-19 severity. Inhaled nitric oxide appears to improve outcomes, although this strategy neglects systemic endothelium. Meanwhile, early studies have documented that endothelial protective medications, such as the administration of statins and ACE-inhibitors, are associated with less severe disease and reduced mortality.

Such post-processors accept the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and feature vectors resulting from a database search, train a machine learning classifier, and recalibrate PSMs using the trained parameters, often yielding significantly more identified peptides across q-value thresholds. However, current state-of-the-art post-processors rely on shallow machine learning methods, such as support vector machines. In contrast, the powerful training capabilities of deep learning models have displayed superior performance to shallow models in an ever-growing number of other fields. In this work, we show that deep models significantly improve the recalibration of PSMs compared to the most accurate and widely-used post-processors, such as Percolator and PeptideProphet. Furthermore, we show that deep learning is able to adaptively analyze complex datasets and features for more accurate universal post-processing, leading to both improved Prosit analysis and markedly better recalibration of recently developed database-search functions.","Halloran, John T.; Urban, Gregor; Rocke, David; Baldi, Pierre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.380881,471
183421,Mapping of antigenic sites on the nucleocapsid protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2004,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that is currently affecting over 200 countries around the world and impacting billions of people. The first step to mitigate and control its spread is to identify and isolate the infected people. But, because of the lack of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR) tests, it is important to discover suspected COVID- 19 cases as early as possible, such as by scan analysis and chest X-ray by radiologists. However, chest X-ray analysis is relatively time-consuming since it requires more than 15 minutes per case. In this paper, an automated novel detection model of COVID-19 cases is proposed to perform real-time detection of COVID-19 cases. The proposed model consists of three main stages: Image segmentation using Harris Hawks optimizer, synthetic image augmentation using an enhanced Wasserstein And Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network, and image classification using Conventional Neural Network. Raw chest X-ray images datasets are used to train and test the proposed model. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is very efficient in the automatic detection of COVID-19 positive cases.

This case study illustrates how a traditional lecture-based activity for undergraduate students in a Management of Health Service Organizations program was transformed into an argumentation-based learning activity using the technique of digital concept mapping and was deployed in an online format during the COVID-19 lockdown. Design/methodology/approach: The students were tasked with solving an ill-structured problem bearing significance for their future professional lives and connected to the contents of their course (entitled “Assimilation of service quality in health systems”). The activity was composed of two phases. In Phase 1, participants were asked to provide five arguments to establish their proposed solution to the problem by using a concept map on a digital platform (Mindomo). In Phase 2, they were asked to substantiate their arguments. Reflective journals were used to ascertain how the participants viewed the activity. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data by searching for themes demonstrating different epistemological positions. Findings: Six themes were inductively derived from the students' reflections: (1) transitioning from passive to active learning;(2) generating epistemic change;(3) social perspective-taking;(4) domain-based knowledge;(5) prior knowledge and experience;and (6) online collaboration with other students. Episodes, thoughts and feelings expressed by the students were reported so as to increase the reliability of the recurrent and common themes.

This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study aimed to determine the generalized anxiety disorders among the nursing staff working in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Punjab province, Pakistan. A GAD-7 scale was used to assess anxiety. Non-parametric statistics were applied to estimate the difference among the groups. Multiple regression model was adopted to explore the impact of covariates on the GAD-7 score. A total of 133 nurses responded to this survey. It was revealed that being female (7.38 +/- 4.20, p=0.032) and having an age of &gt;= 31 years (7.68 +/- 5.14) might lead to a higher GAD-7 score. 19.6% of the respondents had a high level of generalized anxiety (GAD-7 score &gt;= 10), and about 49.6% were falling in the range of mild anxiety. Female nursing staff have the probability of higher GAD-7 score up to 15% [0.148(-0.450 - 4.697), p= 0.049]. Job experience, especially being new to the field (&lt;= 3 years) might increase the likelihood of having a higher GAD-7 score by 14%. In conclusion, 19.6% of the respondents were meeting the GAD-7 criteria of moderate-severe level of generalized anxiety and depressive disorder. Being female, having less job experience, and no training on how to handle COVID patients were revealed to the main factors influencing the GAD-7 score. Risk of getting COVID, transmission of COVID to family members through them, and uncertainty about the consequence of COVID in Pakistan were some of the common stressors reported by the nurses who participated in this study.","Khan, T.

Global air travelling offers an easy and fast opportunity not only for people but also for infectious diseases to spread around the world within a few days. Therefore a rapid on-site screening of infected people is urgently needed. Due to the small size and easy handling, the ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is a very promising, sensitive method for the on-site identification of infectious pathogens based on scents, volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether differentiation between patients suffering from common cold and those from Influenza-A-infection based on VOCs with MCC-IMS is possible. Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive patients suspected of having Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Ten patients with negative PCR diagnosis served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from PCR- negative patients with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept- study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 minutes by MCC-IMS.

In line with this aim, a content analysis of social media profiles maintained by 70 active technoparks examines the use of dialogic features originally developed in Dialogic Communication Theory. Results indicate that technoparks could not fully utilize the dialogic features of the social media platforms and that they mostly preferred to manage their social media platforms to disseminate information, which means they were away from dialogue.

Thus, it is not a surprise that the threat posed by untrustworthy websites has emerged as a central concern on the public agenda in many countries, including Czechia and Slovakia. However, combating this harmful phenomenon has proven to be difficult, with approaches primarily focusing on tackling consequences instead of prevention, as websites are routinely seen as quasi-sovereign organisms. Websites, however, rely upon a host of service providers, which, in a way, hold substantial power over them.

RESULTS: 380 patients with the mean age of 53.62 ± 16.66 years were evaluated (66.1% male). The most frequent chest CT scan abnormalities were in peripheral (86.6%) and peribronchovascular interstitium (34.6%), with ground glass pattern (54.1%), and round (53.6%) or linear (46.7%) shape. There was a significant correlation between shape of abnormalities (p = 0.003), CT scan Severity Score (CTSS) (p <0.0001), and pulmonary artery CT diameter (p = 0. 01) with mortality. The mean CTSS of non-survived cases was significantly higher (13.68 ± 4.59 versus 8.72 ± 4.42; <0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of CTSS in predicting the patients’ mortality was 0.800 (95% CI: 0.716-0.884). The best cut off point of chest CTSS in this regard was 12 with 75.82% (95% CI: 56.07%-88.98%) sensitivity and 75.78% (95% CI: 70.88%-80.10%) specificity. The mean main pulmonary artery diameter in patients with CTSS ≥ 12 was higher than cases with CTSS < 12 (27.89 ± 3.73 vs 26.24 ± 3.14 mm; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study it seems that there is a significant correlation between chest CT scan characteristics and mortality of COVID-19 cases. Patients with lower CTSS, lower pulmonary artery CT diameter, and round shape opacity had lower mortality.","Raoufi, Masoomeh; Safavi Naini, Seyed Amir Ahmad; Azizan, Zahra; Jafar Zade, Fatemeh; Shojaeian, Fatemeh; Ghanbari Boroujeni, Masoud; Robatjazi, Farzaneh; Haghighi, Mehrdad; Arhami Dolatabadi, Ali; Soleimantabar, Hossein; Shoaee, Simindokht; Hatamabadi, Hamidreza",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305634/,471
186921,Structural and functional analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus endoribonuclease Nsp15.,2008,"Equine arteritis virus (EAV), the prototype Arterivirus, is a positive-stranded RNA virus that expresses its replicase in the form of two large polyproteins of 1,727 and 3,175 amino acids. The functional replicase subunits (nonstructural proteins), which drive EAV genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription, are generated by extensive proteolytic processing. Subgenomic mRNA transcription involves an unusual discontinuous step and generates the mRNAs for structural protein expression. Previously, the phenotype of mutant EAV030F, which carries a single replicase point mutation (Ser-2429-->Pro), had implicated the nsp10 replicase subunit (51 kDa) in viral RNA synthesis, and in particular in subgenomic mRNA transcription. nsp10 contains an N-terminal (putative) metal-binding domain (MBD), located just upstream of the Ser-2429-->Pro mutation, and a helicase activity in its C-terminal part. We have now analyzed the N-terminal domain of nsp10 in considerable detail. A total of 38 mutants, most of them carrying specific single point mutations, were tested in the context of an EAV infectious cDNA clone. Variable effects on viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were observed. In general, our results indicated that the MBD region, and in particular a set of 13 conserved Cys and His residues that are assumed to be involved in zinc binding, is essential for viral RNA synthesis. On the basis of these data and comparative sequence analyses, we postulate that the MBD may employ a rather unusual mode of zinc binding that could result in the association of up to four zinc cations with this domain. The region containing residue Ser-2429 may play the role of ""hinge spacer,"" which connects the MBD to the rest of nsp10. Several mutations in this region specifically affected subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, one of the MBD mutants was replication and transcription competent but did not produce infectious progeny virus. This suggests that nsp10 is involved in an as yet unidentified step of virion biogenesis.","van Dinten, L C; van Tol, H; Gorbalenya, A E; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10799597/,471

187439,Identification of an antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies.,2004,"OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on healthcare resource use and costs in the US from the third-party payer perspective. DESIGN The study retrospectively analysed cross-sectional medical encounter data from three federally funded databases that comprise nationally representative samples of hospital inpatient stays, physician office visits and visits to hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms. METHODS Identification of RSV infection-related medical encounters was based on the occurrence of RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases (9th Edition)-Clinical Modification diagnosis codes (079.6, 466.11, 480.1) as principal discharge diagnoses or the assumption that 10-15% of all otitis media visits were due to RSV infection. Outpatient drug costs were estimated based on average wholesale price, and physician fees and test/procedure costs were estimated based on prevailing national fees. Inpatient costs were estimated from total billed charges using a cost-to-charge ratio of 0.53. RESULTS In 2000, nearly 98% of RSV infection-related hospitalisations occurred in children <5 years old. There were approximately 86,000 hospitalisations, 1.7 million office visits, 402 000 emergency room visits and 236,000 hospital outpatient visits for children <5 years old that were attributable to RSV infection. Total annual direct medical costs for all RSV infection-related hospitalisations ($US394 million) and other medical encounters ($US258 million) for children <5 years old were estimated at $US652 million in 2000. Otitis media was a major cost driver for physician visits. RSV infection-related hospitalisations increased from 1993 to 2000, but average costs per hospitalisation were relatively stable. CONCLUSION Treatment of RSV infection-related illness represents a significant healthcare burden in the US. The economic impact of ambulatory care for RSV infection-related illness could be as important as that for RSV infection-related hospitalisation.","Paramore, L Clark; Ciuryla, Vincent; Ciesla, Gabrielle; Liu, Larry",PharmacoEconomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15061677/,471

Cefdinir, an oral cephalosporin, has extended-spectrum, bactericidal activity against common acute bacterial rhinosinusitis pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir shows rapid oral absorption and good respiratory tissue penetration, and may be administered once daily. In randomised clinical trials, cefdinir showed efficacy similar to that of other recommended regimens in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, namely amoxicillin/clavulanate and levofloxacin. Cefdinir is well tolerated and has shown a low propensity to suppress the normal commensal flora. Cefdinir oral suspension is rated highly by children in terms of its taste and smell. As the only once-daily beta-lactam currently recommended by acute bacterial rhinosinusitis guidelines (for first-line use in patients with mild acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and no recent antibacterial use), cefdinir offers a convenient and attractive treatment option.","Hadley, James A",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722817/,471
187585,Identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus by simultaneous multigene DNA sequencing.,2004,"INTRODUCTION Robotic partial nephrectomy is an effective alternative to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. The 3-arm and 4-arm transperitoneal robotic approaches are well described in the literature. However, a retroperitoneal robotic technique has yet to be fully described. We report our technique and initial experience with robotic retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy with a novel 4-arm approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed our current experience with the robotic retroperitoneal approach. Descriptive statistics on patient characteristics, operative parameters, and oncologic outcomes are reported. RESULTS A total of 67 robotic-assisted partial nephrectomies were performed by one surgeon between October 2009 and October 2010. The 4-arm retroperitoneal approach was used in 8 patients (12%) with no complications. Median tumor size was 2cm. All were posterior renal tumors, with 5 located in the upper pole. The median operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay were 202 minutes, 18 minutes, 100cc, and 2 days, respectively. Pathology indicated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 7 patients with negative margins. CONCLUSION The 4-arm robotic approach to retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy is safe, reproducible, and easily used. The fourth arm provides optimal traction on target tissues in key maneuvers and may decrease complications and positive margins secondary to impaired exposure.","Feliciano, Joseph; Stifelman, Michael",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477167/,471
187641,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.,2015,"Perforin-deficient [perforin (-/-)] mice were infected with two strains of JHM virus (JHMV) to analyze the role of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity in acute lethal and subacute central nervous system (CNS) infections. During both acute and subacute infections, the overall mortality of the perforin (-/-) mice was not different from that of the controls. Perforin (-/-) mice survived longer than the controls, consistent with reduced morbidity. Both strains of virus were cleared from the perforin (-/-) mice as in the controls; however, the rate of clearance was delayed in the perforin (-/-) mice, indicating that perforin-mediated cytolysis is involved in viral clearance. The absence of perforin-mediated cytolysis did not prevent encephalomyelitis or extensive demyelination. Cells undergoing apoptosis were detected in the CNS of both the perforin (-/-) and control groups, indicating that perforin is not essential for programmed cell death. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in either group of mice until day 9 postinfection, when the majority of the virus had been cleared. These data further confirm the importance of cell-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that additional components of the immune response contribute to the clearance of JHMV from the CNS.","Lin, M T; Stohlman, S A; Hinton, D R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8985361/,471

When studying infections in cultured polarized epithelial cells, we found previously that coronaviruses are released from specific plasma-membrane domains; thus, mouse hepatitis virus (strain A59; MHV-A59) leaves murine epithelial kidney cells from the basolateral surface, whereas release of transmissible gastroenteritis virus from porcine epithelial kidney cells is confined to the apical membrane. This observation begged the question whether a particular coronavirus is consistently shed through the same membrane, irrespective of the nature of the epithelial cell. We therefore extended our studies with MHV-A59 to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) strain I and human colon carcinoma (Caco-2) cells, both of which are naturally refractory to MHV-A59 but were made susceptible to infection by transfection with recombinant MHV receptor cDNA. The release of MHV-A59 from Caco(MHVR) cells occurred preferentially from the basolateral side, consistent with our previous observations. In contrast, release from MDCK(MHVR) cells occurred almost exclusively from the apical surface. Because of this difference, we studied MHV-A59 infection of MDCK(MHVR) cells in more detail. The virus entered the cells preferentially from the apical side, a situation similar to that in murine epithelial cells, where the highest density of MHV receptor glycoprotein was found. The results from this and previous studies show that targeting of vesicles containing MHV-A59 to a specific side of epithelial cells may vary in different epithelial cell types.","Rossen, J W; Strous, G J; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9010286/,471

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2014 classifies skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) as either non-purulent (which includes cellulitis, erysipelas, and necrotizing infection) or purulent (including furuncle, carbuncle, and abscess). Among hospitalized patients with SSTI, healthcare-associated infections account for 73.5% of all cases. Notably, skin and skin-structure infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common hospital pathogen, was reported to cause higher total cost and longer hospital length of stay compared to non-P. aeruginosa cases, despite causing only approximately 5.7% of all healthcare-associated SSTIs. Infection with P. aeruginosa should always be considered in non-healing skin infections in patients with prolonged hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. Tissue culture, preferably taken by surgical debridement, should be promptly performed; and when hospital-infection is suspected, appropriate antibiotics should be started along with removal of all devitalized tissue and to promote skin and soft tissue healing. Expedited discharge should be considered when possible, with adequate antibiotic treatment and follow up for definitive wound treatment.","Nelwan, Erni Juwita; Tunjungputri, Rahajeng N; Tunjung, Narottama; Widodo, Djoko",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818413/,471
188527,Cross-neutralization of human and palm civet severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses by antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain of spike protein.,2006,"To better understand mechanisms of persistent rotavirus infections of cultured cells, we established independent, persistently infected cultures of MA104 cells, using rotavirus strain SA11. The cultures were either passaged when the cells reached confluence or supplemented with fresh medium every 7 days. Viral titers in culture lysates varied from 10(4) to 10(7) PFU per ml during 350 days of culture maintenance. Trypan blue staining indicated that 72 to 100% of cells in the cultures were viable, and immunocytochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody directed against viral protein VP6 demonstrated that 38 to 63% of the cells contained rotavirus antigen. We tested the capacity of rotaviruses isolated from the persistently infected cultures (PI viruses) to infect cells cured of persistent infection. Although wild-type (wt) and PI viruses produced equivalent yields in parental MA104 cells, PI viruses produced greater yields than wt virus in cured cells, which indicates that viruses and cells coevolve during persistent rotavirus infections of MA104 cells. To determine whether mutations in viruses and cells selected during these persistent infections affect viral entry, we tested the effect of trypsin treatment of the viral inoculum on growth of wt and PI viruses. Trypsin pretreatment is required for postattachment penetration of rotavirus virions into cells. In contrast to the case with wt virus, PI viruses produced equivalent yields with and without trypsin pretreatment in parental MA104 cells. However, PI viruses required trypsin pretreatment for efficient growth in cured cells. These results indicate that mutant viruses and cells are selected during maintenance of persistent rotavirus infections of MA104 cells and suggest that mutations in each affect trypsin-dependent steps in rotavirus entry.","Mrukowicz, J Z; Wetzel, J D; Goral, M I; Fogo, A B; Wright, P F; Dermody, T S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525634/,471

Using the Essential Public Health Services framework, the instruments were evaluated for (1) clarity of measurement parameters, (2) balance between structural and process measures, (3) evidence of effectiveness, and (4) specification of an accountable entity. RESULTS There was a great deal of overlap but little consistency in what constitutes ""preparedness"" or how it should be measured. Most instruments relied excessively on subjective or structural measures, lacked scientific evidence for measures assessed, and failed to clearly define what entity was accountable for accomplishing the task or function.

Memory B cells can be generated through heterogeneous pathways within and outside germinal centers (GCs). Once developed, they appear to be maintained like stem cells for long periods by homeostatic proliferation. In response to reencountered antigens, memory B cells robustly secrete antibodies with help of the anti-apoptotic effect of Ras-mediated signals. We have recently found that following intranasal infection with an influenza virus, virus-specific memory B cells develop in the lungs and persist for a long time along with GC B cells and plasma cells; this appears to be unique feature of the mucosal memory response. Thus memory B cell responses in the systemic and mucosal sites are regulated by distinct processes and further understanding of them should provide a theoretical framework for the development of new vaccine strategies.","Takahashi, Yoshimasa","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928717/,471

METHODS Using random-digit dialing, we sampled 4481 Hong Kong residents in 6 population-based surveys that were conducted at different times during and after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS Respondents' State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score (range, 10-40) showed a decreasing temporal trend, from a high mean value of 24.8 during the peak of the Amoy Gardens outbreak to a postepidemic mean baseline value of 14.5. Those who perceived a higher likelihood of contracting or dying of SARS had significantly higher anxiety scores. Female respondents, individuals aged 30-49 years, and individuals with only a primary education or less were predisposed to greater anxiety. There was a positive dose-response gradient between anxiety level and uptake of personal protective measures. Males respondents, individuals at the extremes of age, and individuals with lower educational levels were less likely to engage in self-protective behavior. The presence of symptoms was the only consistent predictor for greater use of health services. There was remarkable stability in the magnitude and the direction of associations between predictors and outcomes over time. CONCLUSIONS Our findings can assist in modifying public service announcements in the future, which should be tailored to psychobehavioral surveillance intelligence to achieve the desired behavioral outcomes. Future research should explore the use of more-sophisticated techniques, including structural equation modeling and game-theoretical frameworks, to analyze population psychology and behavior, and it should integrate such findings with transmission dynamics modeling.","Leung, Gabriel M; Ho, Lai-Ming; Chan, Steve K K; Ho, Sai-Yin; Bacon-Shone, John; Choy, Ray Y L; Hedley, Anthony J; Lam, Tai-Hing; Fielding, Richard",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15909256/,471
191714,Rapid and sensitive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus by rolling circle amplification.,2005,"Two agents not agglutinating chicken erythrocytes were isolated, one in each of two flocks, from organ samples and tracheal swabs taken from 4- to 7-week-old chicks of 8 broiler flocks experiencing respiratory signs. Virus isolation was done in embryonated SPF hen's eggs. Morphological changes of the embryos, appearing as dwarfing or curling into a spherical form, usually occurred in the 3rd or 4th passage on postinoculation (PI) days 5-9. Some embryos had swollen kidneys covered with urate. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of these kidneys revealed the presence of virions reminiscent of coronaviruses. Similar viral particles were seen in resuspended pellets of isolates concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Based on embryo changes, cross-neutralization tests with type-specific antisera, physicochemical tests, results obtained in cell cultures, and electron microscopic findings the two isolates were identified as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). By cross-neutralization tests the isolates differed from IBV reference strains M41 and H52 and can be considered distinct variants. Elucidation of their epizootiological role requires further investigations.","al Tarcha, B; Kojnok, J; Varró, C",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1965995/,471

SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS virus) cDNA chip was developed and applied to detect the virus RNA transcription levels in the interferon-treated and untreated cell cultures, and the mechanism of anti-SARS virus activity of interferon alpha2b in cell culture system was explored. METHODS SARS virus cDNA chip was prepared by comparing the published SARS virus genome sequence, and the cDNA chip was used to study the interferon alpha2b function during SARS virus replication. RESULTS SARS virus cDNA chip was successfully prepared by using PCR method. The results showed that the cDNA chip could be used to detect the viral RNA transcription level. Interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost all the SARS virus gene transcription. An unknown gene at the position 28130-28426 bp, named as U gene, may play an important role during the viral replication. CONCLUSION A SARS virus whole genome cDNA chip was established. It could be used to study the virus molecular biology and antiviral drug screening. The results also showed that interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost the whole virus gene transcription by using the cDNA chip.","Shu, Yue-long; Duan, Zhao-jun; Wang, Zheng; Sun, Mei-sheng; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Li-lan; Ma, Xue-jun; Peng, Jun-ping; Jin, Qi; Hou, Yun-de",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15340559/,471
192792,Generation and characterization of DNA vaccines targeting the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2004,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis, which is characterized by respiratory, reproductive, and renal signs. However, the role of IBV as an enteric pathogen in still controversial. In Brazil, antigenic groups of IBV divergent from the Massachusetts serotype used for vaccination schedules in that country have already been demonstrated. The present study aimed to assess the different genotypes of IBV in Brazilian commercial poultry flocks by partial sequencing of the S1 amino-terminus coding region using enteric contents as samples and examine their relationship with the vaccine serotype currently in use. Samples of enteric contents were taken as pools of five birds from each of 18 poultry farms (17 broiler and one laying farm) from five Brazilian states between 2002 and 2006. Birds were presenting watery diarrhea and poor general condition but were without respiratory, renal, or reproductive signs. Conventional antibacterial and anticoccidial therapies were unsuccessful and, furthermore, all samples proved negative for rotavirus, reovirus, and astrovirus. Eleven IBV samples were isolated in embryonated eggs and resulted in S1 sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these segregated into an exclusive cluster, close to serotype D274, but distant from Massachusetts. Mean amino acid identity amongst these Brazilian strains was 94.07%; amongst these and serotypes D274, 4/91, and Massachusetts, mean amino acid identity was 77.17%, 69.94%, and 68.93%, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of genotype variant strains of IBV in Brazilian poultry flocks has been demonstrated and might be the reason for the unsuccessful control of IBV in Brazil. Furthermore, these results also strengthen the implications of IBV in enteric diseases of poultry.","Villarreal, L Y B; Brandão, P E; Chacón, J L; Saidenberg, A B S; Assayag, M S; Jones, R C; Ferreira, A J P",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18251411/,471

We analyzed retrospectively synovial fluid parameters (interleukin-6, total-protein, glucose, lactate, synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count) of 62 patients with culture-verified native septic arthritis and compared them to 57 patients with acute aseptic arthritis. Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curves were calculated to determine the 'Area-under-the-curves' (AUC), the best thresholds and the corresponding likelihood-ratios. The best parameter for diagnosing septic arthritis was synovial lactate (AUC = 0.864, sensitivity = 74.5%, specificity = 87.2%), followed by synovial interleukin-6 (AUC = 0.803, sensitivity = 92.5%, specificity = 64.1%) and the synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count (AUC = 0.782, sensitivity = 71.2%, specificity = 84.9%). Synovial lactate levels above 10 mmol/l almost proofed septic arthritis (interval-Likelihood-Ratio = 20.4), synovial interleukin-6 levels lower than 7000 pg/ml almost ruled out infection (interval-Likelihood-Ratio = 0.12). If none of these thresholds are met, physicians should estimate disease probability by the simultaneous use of the interval-Likelihood-Ratios of synovial lactate, synovial interleukin-6 and synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count.","Lenski, Markus; Scherer, Michael A",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873080/,471

We examined patients' perspectives regarding prioritization for surgery. METHODS We surveyed consecutively recruited patients awaiting bariatric surgery about 9 hypothetical scenarios describing patients waiting for surgery. Respondents were asked to rank the priority of these hypothetical patients on the wait list relative to their own. Scenarios examined variations in age, clinical severity, functional impairment, social dependence and socioeconomic status. Willingness to pay for faster access was assessed using a 5-point ordinal scale and analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The 99 respondents had mean age of 44.7 ± 9.9 years, 76% were women, and the mean body mass index was 47.3 ± SD 7.6. The mean wait for surgery was 34.4 ± 9.4 months. Respondents assigned similar priority to hypothetical patients with characteristics identical to theirs (p = 0.22) and higher priority (greater urgency) to those exhibiting greater clinical severity (p < 0.001) and functional impairment (p = 0.003). Lower priority was assigned to patients at the extremes of age (p = 0.006), on social assistance (p < 0.001) and of high socioeconomic status (p < 0.001). Most (85%) respondents disagreed with payment to expedite access, although participants earning more than $80 000/year were less likely to disagree. CONCLUSION Most patients waiting for bariatric surgery consider greater clinical severity and functional impairments related to obesity to be important prioritization indicators and disagreed with paying for faster access. These findings may help inform future efforts to develop acceptable prioritization strategies for publicly funded bariatric surgery.","Gill, Richdeep S; Majumdar, Sumit R; Wang, Xiaoming; Tuepah, Rebecca; Klarenbach, Scott W; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer; Sharma, Arya M; Padwal, Raj S",Canadian journal of surgery.

195802,Successful treatment of suspected organizing pneumonia in a patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a case report.,2016,"This paper provides evidence for a measles virus receptor other than CD46 on transformed marmoset and human B cells. We first showed that most tissues of marmosets are missing the SCR1 domain of CD46, which is essential for the binding of Edmonston measles virus, a laboratory strain that has been propagated in Vero monkey kidney cells. In spite of this deletion, the common marmoset was shown to be susceptible to infections by wild-type isolates of measles virus, although they did not support Edmonston measles virus production. As one would expect from these results, measles virus could not be propagated in owl monkey or marmoset kidney cell lines, but surprisingly, both a wild-type isolate (Montefiore 89) and the Edmonston laboratory strain of measles virus grew efficiently in B95-8 marmoset B cells. In addition, antibodies directed against CD46 had no effect on wild-type infections of marmoset B cells and only partially inhibited the replication of the Edmonston laboratory strain in the same cells. A direct binding assay with insect cells expressing the hemagglutinin (H) proteins of either the Edmonston or Montefiore 89 measles virus strains was used to probe the receptors on these B cells. Insect cells expressing Edmonston H but not the wild-type H bound to rodent cells with CD46 on their surface. On the other hand, both the Montefiore 89 H and Edmonston H proteins adhered to marmoset and human B cells. Most wild-type H proteins have asparagine residues at position 481 and can be converted to a CD46-binding phenotype by replacement of the residue with tyrosine. Similarly, the Edmonston H protein did not bind CD46 when its Tyr481 was converted to asparagine. However, this mutation did not affect the ability of Edmonston H to bind marmoset and human B cells. The preceding results provide evidence, through the use of a direct binding assay, that a second receptor for measles virus is present on primate B cells.","Hsu, E C; Sarangi, F; Iorio, C; Sidhu, M S; Udem, S A; Dillehay, D L; Xu, W; Rota, P A; Bellini, W J; Richardson, C D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9525611/,471

In addition, CoV infection may cause inflammation, alter immune and stress responses, and modify the coagulation pathways. The balance between the up- and downregulated genes could explain the pathogenesis caused by these viruses. We review specific aspects of CoV-host interactions. CoV genome replication takes place in the cytoplasm in a membrane-protected microenvironment and may control the cell machinery by locating some of their proteins in the host cell nucleus. CoVs initiate translation by cap-dependent and cap-independent mechanisms. CoV transcription involves a discontinuous RNA synthesis (template switching) during the extension of a negative copy of the subgenomic mRNAs. The requirement for base-pairing during transcription has been formally demonstrated in arteriviruses and CoVs. CoV N proteins have RNA chaperone activity that may help initiate template switching. Both viral and cellular proteins are required for replication and transcription, and the role of selected proteins is addressed.","Enjuanes, Luis; Almazán, Fernando; Sola, Isabel; Zuñiga, Sonia",Annual review of microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16712436/,471

MATERIALS We evaluated trends in patient encounters and laboratory testing for DM in a pediatric healthcare system from March to September 2019 and during the same period in 2020. RESULTS Evaluation of 17,367 patient encounters illustrated that the pandemic was associated with significantly fewer in-person office visits and point-of-care HbA1c tests for patients with DM in 2020 relative to 2019. A separate analysis of 7,193 HbA1c results measured by point-of-care testing in the general population found a significant increase in the number of measured HbA1c >14 % in May 2020 relative to 2019, but other measured HbA1c values did not differ. As a means to address lapses in the monitoring of HbA1c due to the pandemic, we evaluated the use of the dried blood spot (DBS) matrix for measurement of HbA1c by the Vitros 5600 chemistry analyzer. DBS HbA1c was well correlated to whole blood (r=0.9889) and exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision from 0.5-3.5%. CONCLUSION DBS measurement of HbA1c presents a viable alternative to routine in-person laboratory monitoring of DM.","Garnett, Emily R; Recio, Brandy; Jung, Joanna; Tam, Estella; Devaraj, Sridevi",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452892/,471

Cellular receptors play an important role in virus attachment and entry. However, the low permissiveness of PEDV to APN-expressing porcine cell lines has made it difficult to elucidate the role of pAPN in vitro. The purpose of this study was to prove whether the treatment of soluble pAPN could enhance the antibody production against PEDV in guinea pigs, rabbits and sows. The animals (20 guinea pigs, 8 rabbits and 20 sows) were divided into 4 groups. Group A was injected intramuscularly (IM) with soluble pAPN at one hour before intramuscular infection of PEDV on the same site, group B for IM simultaneous injection of pAPN and PEDV, and group C for IM injection of PEDV only. Group D served as a control of pAPN treatment or PEDV infection. Antibody production against PEDV was compared among groups at regular intervals. The results suggested that pAPN could enhance the antibody production against PEDV in guinea pigs and rabbits which are free of pAPN, however, the effect of pAPN treatment in sows was not clearly elucidated.","Oh, Jin Sik; Song, Dae Sub; Yang, Jeong Sun; Song, Ju Young; Yoo, Han Sang; Jang, Yong Suk; Park, Bong Kyun",Journal of veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15613820/,471

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from Mx1-deficient mice that also lack either the protein kinase R (PKR) or the latent RNase L or both PKR and RNase L were screened. In RNase L-deficient but not wild-type or PKR-deficient MEF, there was continuous synthesis of minus-strand templates and the formation of new replication complexes producing viral plus strands. Inhibiting translation caused minus-strand synthesis to stop and a loss of transcription activity of the mature replication complexes. This turnover of replication complexes that were stable in cells containing RNase L suggested that RNase L plays some role, albeit possibly indirect, in the formation of stable replication complexes during alphavirus infection. In addition, confluent monolayers of RNase L-deficient murine cells readily established persistent infections and were not killed. This phenotype is contrary to what has been observed for infection in vertebrate cells with a presumably functional RNase L gene and more resembled alphavirus replication in Aedes mosquito cells, in which the activity of replication complexes making plus stands was also found to decay with inhibition of translation.","Sawicki, Dorothea L; Silverman, Robert H; Williams, Bryan R; Sawicki, Stanley G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12525614/,471

Of 5 BTV serotypes (2, 10, 11, 13, and 17) tested, each produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) on initial passage at 33 C. A field isolate (serotype 10) of BTV from a black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in its second passage in Vero-M cells also produced CPE when inoculated into BHFTE cells. Antigens of BTV were demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of BHFTE cells inoculated with homogenates of chicken embryos injected with clinical specimens from a domestic sheep and an Arabian oryx (Oryx gazella leucoryx). A suspension of BTV-infected gnats (Culicoides spp.) produced CPE and BTV-specific fluorescence on the first passage in cells inoculated with a suspension of blood from sheep experimentally infected with BTV.

As such, the exposures have exceeded lung overload levels, making quantitative assessment of these studies difficult if not impossible. To assess the cellular and pathological response in the rat lung to a well-characterized aerosol of chrysotile asbestos, a 90-day subchronic inhalation toxicology study was performed using a commercial Brazilian chrysotile (CA 300).

Wistar male rats were randomly assigned to an air control group and to 2 CA 300 exposure groups at mean fiber aerosol concentrations of 76 fibers L > 20 microm/cm3 (3413 total fibers/cm3; 536 WHO fibers/cm3) or 207 fibers L > 20 microm/cm3 (8941 total fibers/cm3; 1429 WHO fibers/cm3). The animals were exposed using a flow-past, nose-only exposure system for 5 days/wk, 6 h/day, during 13 consecutive weeks (65 exposures), followed by a subsequent nonexposure period lasting for 92 days. Animals were sacrificed after cessation of exposure and after 50 and 92 days of nonexposure recovery. At each sacrifice, subgroups of rats were assessed for the determination of the lung burden; histopathological examination; cell proliferation response; bronchoalveolar lavage with the determination of inflammatory cells; clinical biochemistry; and for analysis by confocal microscopy. Through 90 days of exposure and 92 days of recovery, chrysotile at a mean exposure of 76 fibers L > 20 microm/cm3 (3413 total fibers/cm3) resulted in no fibrosis (Wagner score 1.8 to 2.6) at any time point. The long chrysotile fibers were observed to break apart into small particles and smaller fibers. In vitro modeling has indicated that these particles are essentially amorphous silica. At an exposure concentration of 207 fibers L > 20 microm/cm3 (8941 total fibers/cm3) slight fibrosis was observed. In comparison with other studies, chrysotile produced less inflammatory response than the biosoluble synthetic vitreous fiber CMS. As predicted by the recent biopersistence studies on chrysotile, this study clearly shows that at that at an exposure concentration 5000 times greater than the U.S. threshold limit value of 0.1 f(WHO)/cm3, chrysotile produces no significant pathological response.","Bernstein, David M; Rogers, Rick; Smith, Paul; Chevalier, Jörg",Inhalation toxicology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16513591/,471

To help undergraduate neuroscience faculty meet these challenges, we introduce two important neuroscience research tools we designed and built. The first is a precision micromanipulator for neurophysiology applications costing less than $40 USD. We compare data generated using the DIY manipulator with commercial micromanipulators costing over $1000. The second tool is our newly designed 3D printed epi-fluorescence microscope. Commercial fluorescence imaging devices often cost over $20,000, but our 3D printed version is constructed for less than $1200. This epi-fluorescence microscope uses interchangeable LED light sources and filter sets to image static fluorescence in prepared slides and calcium imaging of neuronal activity in living Drosophila brains. This later technique uses transgenic flies with a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP). During an action potential, calcium ions (Ca2+) enter neurons and are observed as an increase in fluorescence intensity from a series of video images. These neuronal firing patterns can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively to understand neural circuits leading to specific behaviors. We plan to develop curricula around the use of the epi-fluorescence microscope for calcium imaging in the next year, and to provide detailed parts sources and construction guides for the student and faculty DIY experience.","Ryan, James; Johnson, Bruce R; Deitcher, David","Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880101/,471

Methods Data during the period from January 29, 2020, till April 14, 2020, were extracted from 76 WHO situational reports and from the Worldometer website. Numbers of populations in each country were considered during data analysis. Susceptible, infectious, recovered, and deaths (SIRD) model and smoothing spline regression model were used to predict the number of cases in each country. Results SIRD model in KSA yielded β = 2e-0.6, γ = 0.006, and μ = 0.00038 and R0= 0.00029. It is expected that by the 1st of May 2020, that number of cumulative infected cases would rise to 16848 in KSA and to 11,825 in Pakistan while in Iran, it is expected that the number mostly will be 100485. Moreover, the basic reproduction number R0 is expected to decrease by time progression. Conclusion The cumulative infected cases are expected to grow exponentially. Although R0 is expected to be decreased, the quarantine measures should be maintained or even enhanced.","Sharif, Asmaa Fady; Mattout, Sara Kamal; Mitwally, Noha Adel",International journal of health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952503/,471

Clinically affected male and female pups were first identified when they were from 14 to 25 d old. Unaffected littermates were healthy and were weaned successfully. Postmortem findings in 8 clinically affected mice included a small, poorly differentiated exocrine pancreas comprising cytokeratin-negative duct-like structures but lacking recognizable acinar cells with their normal carboxypeptidase B-positive zymogen granules. Endocrine pancreas islets were unremarkable and contained insulin-positive beta cells and glucagon-positive alpha cells. There was mild inflammation of the hindgut but no evidence of intestinal pathogens or marked inflammation or necrosis of pancreas, either alone or as part of a multisystemic inflammatory condition. Sera from pups in 4 affected litters did not contain antibodies to reovirus 3, mouse coronavirus, rotavirus, or mouse adenovirus 2. Furthermore, 4 sets of parental mice and sentinel mice from the facility were negative for 13 viruses, bacteria, and parasites. C3HeB/FeJ and 101/H inbred strains may be genetically predisposed because the steatorrhea and runting was absent in 13 other mouse strains and subspecies bred in the specific pathogen-free facility. This condition resembles exocrine pancreas hypoplasia, but the inheritance is complex. A wider implication is that runting coupled with steatorrhea are phenotypic criteria to suspect pancreatic disease that could be used in the context of a mouse N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenesis program to identify potential mutants with defects in pancreas development.","Cheeseman, Michael T; Chrobot, Nikki; Fray, Martin D; Deeny, Adrian A",Comparative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536623/,471

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, adapting these programs to telehealth modalities is necessary to ensure continued services to children and families. This study evaluates the use of telehealth versus in-person modality to deliver the Helping Our Toddlers, Developing Our Children's Skills (HOT DOCS) BPT. The study design was quasi-experimental with two nonequivalent groups: in-person HOT DOCS (n = 152) and internet-HOT DOCS (n = 46). Participants were caregivers of children ages 2-5 exhibiting disruptive behaviors. Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures were collected for child disruptive behavior and parenting stress and post-test only for consumer satisfaction. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models were performed to assess the effect of class modality on the outcomes. Child disruptive behavior and parenting stress post-test scores for in-person and telehealth groups were not significantly different, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Consumer satisfaction scores were significantly more positive for the in-person group. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence for the i-HOT DOCS modality as being as effective as the in-person program. Study findings may be beneficial to practitioners utilizing telehealth interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and onward.","Agazzi, Heather; Hayford, Holland; Thomas, Nicholas; Ortiz, Cristina; Salinas-Miranda, Abraham",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,,471

of the USSR The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation determined the Center as the head scientific institution for toxicological, radiation and biological safety The Institution is a Precision Center of developing a methodology for identifying and evaluating radioactive contamination, indicating potent toxic substances, toxicants and pathogens of infectious diseases in environmental objects, pathological material, agricultural goods of domestic and import production The Center deposits especially dangerous microorganisms for state needs;works on the development, production and introduction of medicines for veterinary use necessary for anti-epizootic measures;organizes the courses of advanced studies Scientific research is conducted in 15 laboratory and vivarium boxes, including special radiobiological and “dioxin” boxes, which provide a closed technological cycle The Center employs highly qualified personnel: more than 130 Doctors and Candidates of Sciences The Department of Toxicology, one of the major divisions of the Center, conducts large-scale theoretical and experimental studies to analyze the mechanism of action of toxic substances at the body, organ, cellular and molecular levels and to find means and methods for diagnosing, treating and preventing animal poisoning Toxicologists have developed fundamentally new therapeutic and preventive antidotes of prolonged action, which protect animals from poisoning by toxic substances, and highly sensitive express methods for their indication, monitoring toxic substances of technogenic and natural origin in all parts of the trophic chain: soil-plants-animal products (including imported products) To eliminate the effects of exposure to highly active chemical toxic substances at the objects of veterinary supervision the Center created facilities (receipts) that have no analogues in world practice The results of studies on the development of MPC and MRL of potent toxic substances in feed and water, organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins and dioxin are important in research and practice The drug “Adilin-super” has been developed and is widely used for emergency immobilization and mass bloodless slaughter of animals in the field The study of the mechanism of the toxic effect of dioxins and the search for means of treatment and prevention of dioxin toxicosis is a significant aspect of the work of the Department The Center created and operates unique radiobiological complex, where complex fundamental and applied research is carried out to ensure the protection, prevention and treatment of farm animals from radiation injuries using modern irradiation equipment The most significant aspects of scientific research are the development of a prolonged-action bioprotective agent (radiovaccine) based on a cytoplasmic antigen from organs of irradiated animals and microorganisms and an unique method for diagnosing radiation sickness by indicating radio-induced antigens in the peripheral blood of irradiated animals using modern molecular biological and immunochemical tests -systems The Department developed the technology of the production of specific diagnostic kits (enzyme immunoassay, antibody-based erythrocyte diagnosticum and radiation allergen) for conducting immunochemical, serological and allergic studies to indicate radioinduced toxins and radiation sensitizers in acute radiation sickness Scientists have tested biochemical genetic test systems for accelerated diagnosis of ARS and prediction of its outcome Methodological guidelines have been developed and implemented to identify radio-induced antigens in animal and vegetable products and to use EIA and IHT methods for early diagnosis of animal diseases exposed to ionizing radiation In recent years, the Center has been actively cooperating with State Corporation named “Rosatom” on the introduction of small doses of radiation in the national economy Epizootological and immunological monitoring of brucellosis, anthrax, chlamydia, CoES, rabies, necrobacteriosis, rota-, coronavirus infection of young animals, salmonellosis, leukemia and other infections is carried out in the field of biological safety in many regions of the Russian Federation Diagnostic tools for especially dangerous diseases have been improved using new primers for PCR, monoclonal antibodies sensitive to cell culture viruses, and new microbiological agents As a result of basic research, strains were obtained, on the basis of which highly effective vaccines against brucellosis, chlamydia, necrobacteriosis, parainfluenza-3 and infectious rhinotracheitis of cattle were created and introduced into veterinary practice;pig

The framework we present circumvents the requirements for forecasting expected returns and allows us to directly optimise portfolio weights by updating model parameters. Instead of selecting individual assets, we trade Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) of market indices to form a portfolio. Indices of different asset classes show robust correlations and trading them substantially reduces the spectrum of available assets to choose from. We compare our method with a wide range of algorithms with results showing that our model obtains the best performance over the testing period, from 2011 to the end of April 2020, including the financial instabilities of the first quarter of 2020.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this question, we report here the association between pre-infection Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services (LHSs), Israel, between 1 February and 30 April 2020. Using the LHS-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, HbA1c, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c &#8805; 9%. CONCLUSION: Using pre-infection glycaemic control data, we identify HbA1c as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources, and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.","Merzon, Eugene; Green, Ilan; Shpigelman, Miriam; Vinker, Shlomo; Raz, Itamar; Golan-Cohen, Avivit; Eldor, Roy",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,471

Various geographical contexts of the COVID-19 impacts are considered: national, European, and global. Generalized method of moments was applied to investigate the influence of reported COVID-19 cases (deaths) on both occupancy and revenue per available room. The results show that the most significant, negative impact of the pandemic on hotel performances is confirmed at the European level of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the negative influence of national cases of COVID-19 is more significant in less internationalized (or less-populated) urban destinations.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths due to COVID-19 in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected all the six GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This region has a relatively high temperature and humidity, and has homogenous Arab ethnicity with a similar socioeconomic culture. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, including daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web ""Time and Date"". The daily basis, mean temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of COVID-19 in the region, Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020. We also evaluated the growth factor, ""a ratio by which a quantity multiplies itself over time; it equals daily cases divided by cases on the previous day"". RESULTS: In GCC countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020 was 29.20±0.30°C and humidity was 37.95±4.40%. The results revealed that there was a negative correlation and decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths from COVID-19 with increase in humidity in Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The correlation coefficient between temperature with daily cases shows that an increase in temperature was associated with an increase in daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19, however, the temperature is still gradually rising in the region. The growth factor result for daily cases was 1.09±0.00 and daily deaths was 1.07±0.03 for COVID-19, and shows declining trends in GCC region. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in GCC countries. The daily growth factor for patients and deaths shows a declining trend. However, the climate is swiftly changing in the region; further studies may be conducted during the peak of summer season. The findings have outcomes for policymakers and health officials about the impact of temperature and humidity on epidemiological trends of daily new cases and deaths due to COVID-19.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Alsalame, N M; Al-Khlaiwi, T; Usmani, A M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,471

The anxiety level of mothers was measured before and after study using Spielberger Inventory along with the labour pain. To improve the strength of this study, a meta-analysis was conducted on the effect of acupressure in point LI-4 on anxiety during labour. Ninety women in labour were randomly divided into three groups: acupressure with ice, acupressure without ice and the control group. The result suggested that women receiving both acupressure with ice (p = .005) or without ice (p < .001) experienced less labour pain in comparison with the control group. Also, the labour pain severity in acupressure without ice was lower than the group with ice (p < .001). Acupressure with (p = 1) or without (p = .09) ice was not significantly different from the control group in terms of the anxiety level. However, women in the group of acupressure without ice experienced less anxiety in comparison with acupressure with ice (p = .04). The difference in pain severity before and after treatment with acupressure with (RCI = 2.86) or without ice (RCI = 5.54) was clinically significant. The intervention was not clinically meaningful in terms of anxiety.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous trials have exhibited that acupressure with/without ice reduced pain and anxiety during labour.What do the results of this subject add? The results of this research was consistent with previous studies, suggesting that acupressure, with or without ice, is more effective than the control group regarding labour pain. However, the group of acupressure with ice was not different from the control group with respect to the anxiety level.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In light of advantages, such as growing preference of women, researcher and health care providers for physiological delivery coupled with its safety and simplicity, it can be used as an effective technique to manage labour pain. Further studies are required to assess the effect of acupressure at L4 on the anxiety level.","Mirzaee, Firoozeh; Hasaroeih, Fatemeh Esmaeilinejad; Mirzaee, Moghaddameh; Ghazanfarpour, Masumeh",J Obstet Gynaecol,,471
273451,Predicting the recombination potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: The home environment is an important facilitator of young child movement behaviors, including physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen-time. Household chaos, characterized by crowding, noise, and disorder in the home, may hinder efforts to obtain adequate amounts of movement behaviors. The COVID-19 outbreak impacted many families, and social distancing during this time may create conditions for more household chaos. Family routines can help establish order in the home and encourage an appropriate balance of movement behaviors, such as less screen-time and more sleep. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between household chaos and young child movement behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and the role of family routines in this relationship. METHODS: A national online survey including 1836 mothers of preschoolers (3.0-5.9 years) was conducted during May 2020. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, family routines, and the preschooler's movement behaviors during the outbreak. Mothers completed a household chaos questionnaire and were grouped into chaos categories (low, moderate/low, moderate/high, and high) for analysis. Linear regression was used to assess the association between chaos category, family routines, and movement behaviors with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Mothers were 35.9 ± 4.1 years of age, middle income (47.8%), and preschoolers were 3.8 ± 0.8 years of age. Most mothers reported their preschooler was less physically active (38.9%), slept the same amount of time (52.1%), and increased their screen-time (74.0%) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Preschoolers in the high chaos households performed less total PA (ß = - 0.36 days/week, 95% CI:-0.62 to - 0.09, p = 0.008), slept less (ß = - 0.42 h, 95% CI:-0.59 to - 0.25, p = 0.001) and had more screen-time (ß = 0.69 h, 95% CI:0.45 to 0.92, p = 0.001) compared to those in low chaos households. In most chaos categories, having a bed-time ritual was related to more child sleep, and mothers who viewed routines as ""less/not important"" reported more preschooler screen-time compared to mothers who viewed routines as ""very important"". CONCLUSION: Promoting bed-time rituals and prioritizing routines, even somewhat, may be related to an improved balance of child movement behaviors. Innovative measures are needed to support families during periods of disruption such as that experienced in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kracht, Chelsea L; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",BMC Public Health,,471

The proper attribution of deaths to this pandemic has a range of societal, legal, mortuary, and public health consequences. This article discusses the current difficulties of disaster death attribution and describes the strengths and limitations of relying on death counts from death certificates, estimations of indirect deaths, and estimations of excess mortality. Improving the tabulation of direct and indirect deaths on death certificates will require concerted efforts and consensus across medical institutions and public health agencies. In addition, actionable estimates of excess mortality will require timely access to standardized and structured vital registry data, which should be shared directly at the state level to ensure rapid response for local governments. Correct attribution of direct and indirect deaths and estimation of excess mortality are complementary goals that are critical to our understanding of the pandemic and its effect on human life.","Kiang, Mathew V; Irizarry, Rafael A; Buckee, Caroline O; Balsari, Satchit",Ann. intern. med,,471

The case-fatality rate is significantly higher in older patients and those with diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular disorders. The human proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and basigin (BSG), are involved in high-confidence host-pathogen interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We considered these three proteins as seed nodes and applied the random walk with restart method on the human interactome to construct a protein-protein interaction sub-network, which captures the effects of viral invasion. We found that Insulin resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications and adipocytokine signaling were the common pathways associated with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The association of these critical pathways with ageing and its related diseases explains the molecular basis of COVID-19 fatality. We further identified drugs that have effects on these proteins/pathways based on gene expression studies. We particularly focused on drugs that significantly downregulate ACE2 along with other critical proteins identified by the network-based approach. Among them, COL-3 had earlier shown activity against acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress, while entinostat and mocetinostat have been investigated for non-small-cell lung cancer.

But the reliability, reproducibility, and selectivity of majority of such diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread. In this regard, a selective ""naked-eye"" detection of SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable, which can be tested without accessing any advanced instrumental techniques. We herein report the development of a colorimetric assay based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), when capped with suitably designed thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 min from the isolated RNA samples. The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance. Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/µL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Thus, the current study reports a selective and visual ""naked-eye"" detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques.","Moitra, Parikshit; Alafeef, Maha; Dighe, Ketan; Frieman, Matthew B; Pan, Dipanjan",ACS Nano,,471

295034,Modeling the Transmission Dynamics of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus with the Impact of Media Coverage,2021,"Interferons (IFN) are antiviral cytokines that mitigate the effects of invading viruses early on during the infection process. SARS-CoV and MERS induce weak IFN responses; hence, the clinical trials which included recombinant IFN accompanied with other antiviral drugs exhibited improved results in terms of shortening the duration of illness. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the type I IFN response in COVID-19 patients to determine whether it is sufficient to eliminate or reduce the severity of the infection, and whether it can be recommended as a potential therapy. Total RNA samples were converted to cDNA and used as templates to evaluate the gene expression levels of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IFN-ß in COVID-19 patients or control. The results showed that IRF3 gene expression was upregulated ~250-fold compared with the negative samples. In contrast, IFN-ß expression increased slightly in COVID-19 patients. Consistent with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS, COVID-19 infection does not induce an efficient IFN response to reduce the severity of the virus. This may be attributed to an incomplete response of IRF3 in activating the IFN-ß promoter in the infected patients.

METHODS: Retrospective observational study that included hospitalized adults with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 from 15/03 to 15/05/2020. We excluded immunocompromised patients, nursing home residents and those admitted in the previous 14 days for another reasons. Analysis of ROC curves was performed, calculating the area under the curve for the different scales, as well as sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were enrolled, aged 63±17 years, 57,7% were men; 38 patients were admitted to ICU (23,5%), of these patients 33 required invasive mechanical ventilation (86,8%), with an overall mortality of 12,5%. Area under the ROC curves for mortality of the scores were: PSI 0,82 (95% CI: 0,73-0,91), CURB-65 0,82 (0,73-0,91), MuLBSTA 0,72 (0,62-0,81) and COVID-GRAM 0,86 (0,70-1). Area under the curve for needing invasive mechanical ventilation was: PSI 0,73 (95% CI: 0,64-0,82), CURB-65 0,66 (0,55-0,77), MuLBSTA 0,78 (0,69-0,86) and COVID-GRAM 0,76 (0,67-0,85), respectively. Patients with bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract were 20 (9,6%), the most frequent strains being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the COVID-GRAM score was the most accurate to identify patients with higher mortality with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2; however, none of these scores accurately predicts the need for invasive mechanical ventilation with ICU admission. The 10% of patients admitted presented bacterial respiratory co-infection.","Esteban Ronda, Violeta; Ruiz Alcaraz, Sandra; Ruiz Torregrosa, Paloma; Giménez Suau, Mario; Nofuentes Pérez, Ester; León Ramírez, José Manuel; Andrés, Mariano; Moreno-Pérez, Óscar; Candela Blanes, Alfredo; Gil Carbonell, Joan; Merino de Lucas, Esperanza",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,471

332429,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections in two large academic health systems in Wisconsin,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Blood and imaging biomarkers show promise in prognosticating outcomes after paediatric cardiac arrest in pilot studies. We describe the methods and early recruitment challenges and solutions for an ongoing multicentre (n=14) observational trial, Personalising Outcomes following Child Cardiac Arrest to validate clinical, blood and imaging biomarkers individually and together in a clinically relevant panel. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Children (n=164) between 48 hours and 17 years of age who receive chest compressions irrespective of provider, duration, or event location and are admitted to an intensive care unit are eligible. Blood samples will be taken on days 1-3 for the measurement of brain-focused biomarkers analysed to predict the outcome. Clinically indicated and timed brain MRI and spectroscopy biomarkers will be analysed to predict the outcome. The primary outcome for the trial is survival with favourable (Vineland Adaptive Behavioural Scale score >70) outcome at 1 year. Secondary outcomes include mortality and pre-event and postdischarge measures of emotional, cognitive, physical and family functioning and health-related quality of life. Early enrollment targets were not met due to prolonged regulatory and subcontract processes. Multiple, simultaneous interventions including modification to inclusion criteria, additional sites and site visits were implemented with successful improvement in recruitment. Study procedures including outcomes and biomarker analysis are ongoing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Twelve of 14 sites will use the centralised Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pittsburgh (PRO14030712). Two sites will use individual IRBs: Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Institutional Review Board and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin IRB. Parents and/or guardians are consented and children assented (when possible) by the site Primary investigator (PI) or research coordinator for enrollment. Study findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, peer-reviewed journal publications, public study website materials and invited lectures.

On the first day of restrictions, our major problem was to learn and find the best communication tool. The first experiences for online meetings were boring, we were not feeling our emotions but as days past we got used to it. We all understand the importance of having alternatives and have to be ready for second choices. During those challenging days, all had more time to work on our completed data, time to write, complete the proofreading of written materials. Other vital scientific activities for career development and profile building such as reading (every meeting with new articles/reviews), publishing and preparing oral presentation were fully completed during the online meetings as a part of lab meeting activities.

The video is aimed at presenting the surgical management of persistent groin pain and inability to walk after transobturator sling placement and subsequent partial removal. METHODS: The featured patient is a 31-year-old woman unable to walk after transobturator sling implantation 2 years before. She reported left thigh pain immediately after surgery that was not responsive to postoperative medication. Six months later, suburethral portion excision was performed but no pain relief was obtained. She was unable to walk, and needed a wheelchair. Electromyography showed axonal injury of the left obturator nerve. After providing proper informed consent, the patient was admitted for combined transvaginal and transcutaneous transobturator tape arm removal. RESULTS: The featured procedure was completed in 120 min and blood loss was <100 ml. No surgical complications were observed. The patient is currently doing left leg rehabilitation, has regained the ability to walk with the aid of a crutch, and the need for chronic pain control medication is greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: This represents a valid surgical approach for the late management of this mesh-related complication.","Milani, Rodolfo; Barba, Marta; Manodoro, Stefano; Locatelli, Luca; Palmieri, Stefania; Frigerio, Matteo",Int Urogynecol J,,471

They work in essential industries but are often invisible. The disparities illuminated by COVID-19 are not new. Instead, they are the result of years of inequities built into practices, policies, and systems that reinforce societal power structures. As a society, we are now at an antagonizing moment where we can change our collective trajectory to focus forward and promote equity and justice for workers in agriculture and food-related industries. To that end, we describe our experience and approach in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in meat processing facilities, which included three pillars of action based on public health ethics and international human rights: (1) worksite prevention and control, (2) community-based prevention and control, and (3) treatment. Our approach can be translated to promote the health, safety, and well-being of the broader agricultural workforce.","Ramos, Athena K; Lowe, Abigail E; Herstein, Jocelyn J; Schwedhelm, Shelly; Dineen, Kelly K; Lowe, John J",J Agromedicine,,471

We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe. RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present. CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.","Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Kuntzen, Christian; Qiu, He; Jiang, Yu; Bodenheimer, Henry C; Roth, Nitzan C; Lee, Tai-Ping; Hirsch, Jamie S; Trindade, Arvind J; Bernstein, David E",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,471
364958,Conserved interactions required for inhibition of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"This paper analyzes the epidemiological and economic effects of quarantines. We use a basic epidemiological model, a SEIR-model, that is calibrated to roughly resemble the COVID-19 pandemic, and we assume that individuals that become infected or are isolated on average lose a share of their productivity. An early quarantine postpones but does not alter the course of the pandemic at a cost that increases in the duration and the extent of the quarantine. For quarantines at later stages of the pandemic there is a trade-off between lowering the peak level of infectious people on the one hand and minimizing fatalities and economic losses on the other hand. A longer quarantine dampens the peak level of infectious people and also reduces the total number of infected persons but increases economic losses. Both the peak level of infectious individuals and the total share of the population that will have been infected are U-shaped in relation to the share of the population in quarantine, while economic costs increase in this share. In particular, a quarantine covering a moderate share of the population leads to a lower peak, fewer deaths and lower economic costs, but it implies that the peak of the pandemic occurs earlier.","Forslid, Rikard; Herzing, Mathias",Eur J Health Econ,,471
381200,Identifying and repurposing antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with in silico and in vitro approaches,2020,"Last December 2019, a cluster of viral pneumonia cases identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss of smell and taste, as well as their presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their association with the severity of COVID-19. In this retrospective study, 1206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed up by telephone one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up. From patients (n=1172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. 20.6% COVID-19 patients had loss of taste (median score=6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score=5). Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels were positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks. In this cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out of 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.","Song, Jia; Deng, Yi-Ke; Wang, Hai; Wang, Zhi-Chao; Liao, Bo; Ma, Jin; He, Chao; Pan, Li; Liu, Yang; Alobid, Isam; Wang, De-Yun; Zeng, Ming; Mullol, Joaquim; Liu, Zheng",Curr Med Sci,,471

This review discusses recent literature regarding the global burden of HTN and emerging concepts in prevalence, treatment, and control in different regions around the globe. RECENT FINDINGS: Community-based interventions and telemedicine may be useful in increasing access to care and identifying/assisting patients with HTN, especially in populations with geographical and economic barriers to healthcare. Home blood pressure monitoring is beneficial for HTN control in diverse regions. Polypills have proven benefits to decrease HTN and CVD risk. Continuation of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in high risk COVID-19 patients appears appropriate. SUMMARY: Extensive research demonstrates that early screening/treatment, lifestyle modification, and pharmacotherapy are essential to control HTN worldwide. This review highlights recent research and novel concepts on effective interventions being used globally.","Ferdinand, Keith C; Reddy, Tina K; Vo, Thanh N",Curr Opin Cardiol,,471

Unprecedented worldwide efforts were made to identify and repurpose antiviral therapeutics from collections of approved drugs and known bioactive compounds. Typical pitfalls of this approach (promiscuous/cytotoxic compounds leading to false positives), combined with bypassing antiviral drug development parameters due to urgency have resulted in often disappointing outcomes. A flood of publications, press-releases, and media posts, created confusion in the general public and sometime mobilized precious resources for clinical trials with minimal prospect of success. Breakthroughs have been made, not in the laboratory but in the clinic, resulting from the empiric identification of mitigators of clinical signs such as the discovery of improved disease management through immunomodulators. This opinion piece will aim to capture some of the lessons that we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has taught about drug repurposing screens.","Sourimant, Julien; Aggarwal, Megha; Plemper, Richard K",Curr Opin Virol,,471
395429,Smoking and the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,2021,"Plants are repository of important constituents with proven efficacy against many human diseases including viral diseases. The antiviral activity of many plants including Azadirachta indica, Xylopia aethiopica and Allium cepa has been reported. The novel coronavirus disease is no exception among viral diseases in which plant compounds could serve as potent antagonist. Therefore, our study investigated the inhibitory potentials of Azadirachta indica and Xylopia aethiopica isolates against SARS-CoV-2 viral accessory proteins and the host serine protease. The protein data (SARS-CoV-2 Papain like protease (PLpro) (PDB: 6wx4), Chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) (PDB:6YB7), SARS-CoV nsp 12 (PDB: 6nus), Host cell protease (TMPRSS1) (PDB:5ce1) were obtained from the protein data bank (PDB), while the SDS format of each Ligands were obtained from Pubchem database. Molecular docking analysis was performed with Auto Dock Vina 1.5.6 and visualization of the interaction between the ligands and protein was done with discovery studio 2019. The ADMET prediction of pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties of the ligands was obtained using vNN Web Server. Our result showed that all the plant isolates demonstrated negative Gibb's free energy, indicating good binding affinity for both the viral and host protein. Overall, twenty-three of the forty-seven isolates showed good binding affinity comparable with dexamethasone that was used as reference drug. Although many of the compounds have good binding affinity for the viral and host proteins, based on the ADMET prediction, only Azadironic acid, Nimbionone, Nimbionol and Nimocinol all from A. indica could serve as potential drug candidate with good pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. This study provides an insight into potential inhibitors and novel drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Further studies will look forward into the wet laboratory validation of Azadironic acid, Nimbionone, Nimbionol and Nimocinol against corona virus disease.

Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia. METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23-37). Among them, 198 (71.7%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8%) of participants. In this study, 83% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8-18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14; P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia. Further clinical trials, which take these covariates into account, will need to be undertaken.

At present, no proper therapy and vaccinations are available for the disease, and it is increasing day by day with a high mortality rate. Pharmacophore based virtual screening of the selected natural product databases followed by Glide molecular docking and dynamics studies against SARS-CoV-2 main protease was investigated to identify potential ligands that may act as inhibitors. The molecules SN00293542 and SN00382835 revealed the highest docking score of -14.57 and -12.42 kcal/mol, respectively, when compared with the co-crystal ligands of PDB-6Y2F (O6K) and 6W63 (X77) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. To further validate the interactions of top scored molecules SN00293542 and SN00382835, molecular dynamics study of 100 ns was carried out. This indicated that the protein-ligand complex was stable throughout the simulation period, and minimal backbone fluctuations have ensued in the system. Post-MM-GBSA analysis of molecular dynamics data showed free binding energy-71.7004 +/- 7.98, -56.81+/- 7.54 kcal/mol, respectively. The computational study identified several ligands that may act as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The top-ranked molecules SN00293542, and SN00382835 occupied the active site of the target, the main protease like that of the co-crystal ligand. These molecules may emerge as a promising ligands against SARS-CoV-2 and thus needs further detailed investigations. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of interferon (IFN)-Î³, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-8, Il-9, IL-17, TGF-ß and IFN-Î³ in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study was conducted between 63 adult patients with COVID-19 and compared with 33 age and gender-matched healthy subjects as controls. The age range in both groups was 50-70 years. The patients were classified into mild group (33 patients) and severe group (30 patients). Serum samples were collected from all participants and tested for the cytokine levels by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way ANOVA. The mean serum levels of IFN-Î³, TGF-ß, IL-17 and IL-8 in the COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those observed in the control group. A comparison of between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in TGF-ß levels. The mean concentration of serum IL-5 and IL-9 in patients with COVID-19 did not differ from those in the control group. Systemic IL-17 levels correlated positively and significantly with TGF-ß in patients with COVID-19. Th1 (IFN-Î³), Treg (TGF-ß), and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines concentration were increased in COVID-19 patients. Interferon-Î³ and IL-17 are involved in inducing and mediating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that TGF-ß can be used as a predictive factor of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Ghazavi, Ali; Ganji, Ali; Keshavarzian, Nafiseh; Rabiemajd, Somayeh; Mosayebi, Ghasem",Cytokine,,471

Increasing employment of physicians, changing practice models, new regulatory requirements, and market dynamics all affect medical practice; some changes may also place greater emphasis on the business of medicine. Fundamental ethical principles and professional values about the patient-physician relationship, the primacy of patient welfare over self-interest, and the role of medicine as a moral community and learned profession need to be applied to the changing environment, and physicians must consider the effect the practice environment has on their ethical and professional responsibilities. Recognizing that all health care delivery arrangements come with advantages, disadvantages, and salient questions for ethics and professionalism, this American College of Physicians policy paper examines the ethical implications of issues that are particularly relevant today, including incentives in the shift to value-based care, physician contract clauses that affect care, private equity ownership, clinical priority setting, and physician leadership. Physicians should take the lead in helping to ensure that relationships and practices are structured to explicitly recognize and support the commitments of the physician and the profession of medicine to patients and patient care.","DeCamp, Matthew; Snyder Sulmasy, Lois",Ann. intern. med,,471
412292,Potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the gastrointestinal tract and liver,2021,"Contactless fingerprint identification has emerged as an reliable and user friendly alternative for the personal identification in a range of e-business and law-enforcement applications. It is however quite known from the literature that the contactless fingerprint images deliver remarkably low matching accuracies as compared with those obtained from the contact-based fingerprint sensors. This paper develops a new approach to significantly improve contactless fingerprint matching capabilities available today. We systematically analyze the extent of complimentary ridge-valley information and introduce new approaches to achieve significantly higher matching accuracy over state-of-art fingerprint matchers commonly employed today. We also investigate least explored options for the fingerprint color-space conversions, which can play a key-role for more accurate contactless fingerprint matching. This paper presents experimental results from different publicly available contactless fingerprint databases using NBIS, MCC and COTS matchers. Our consistently outperforming results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for more accurate contactless fingerprint identification.","Vyas, Ritesh; Kumar, Ajay",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06045v2.pdf,471
412991,Whole-genome Sequencing to Track Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmission in Nosocomial Outbreaks,2021,"CONTEXT.­: This study represents the largest compilation to date of clinical and postmortem data from decedents with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It will augment previously published small series of autopsy case reports, refine clinicopathologic considerations, and improve the accuracy of future vital statistical reporting. OBJECTIVE.­: To accurately reflect the preexisting diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection through autopsy. DESIGN.­: Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple-choice and open-ended survey responses. RESULTS.­: Patients dying of or with COVID-19 had an average of 8.89 pathologic conditions documented at autopsy, spanning a combination of prior chronic disease and acute conditions acquired during hospitalization. Virtually all decedents were cited as having more than 1 preexisting condition, encompassing an average of 2.88 such diseases each. Clinical conditions during terminal hospitalization were cited 395 times for the 135 autopsied decedents and predominantly encompassed acute failure of multiple organ systems and/or impaired coagulation. Myocarditis was rarely cited. CONCLUSIONS.­: Cause-of-death statements in both autopsy reports and death certificates may not encompass the severity or spectrum of comorbid conditions in those dying of or with COVID-19. If supported by additional research, this finding may have implications for public health decisions and reporting moving forward through the pandemic.","Hooper, Jody E; Padera, Robert F; Dolhnikoff, Marisa; da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz; Duarte-Neto, Amaro Nunes; Kapp, Meghan E; Lacy, J Matthew; Mauad, Thais; Saldiva, Paulo Hilario Nascimento; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Wolf, Dwayne A; Felix, Juan C; Benson, Paul; Shanes, Elisheva; Gawelek, Kara L; Marshall, Desiree A; McDonald, Michelle M; Muller, William; Priemer, David S; Solomon, Isaac H; Zak, Taylor; Bhattacharjee, Meenakshi B; Fu, Lucy; Gilbert, Andrea R; Harper, Holly L; Litovsky, Silvio; Lomasney, Jon; Mount, Sharon L; Reilly, Stephanie; Sekulic, Miroslav; Steffensen, Thora S; Threlkeld, Kirsten J; Zhao, Bihong; Williamson, Alex K",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,471
420680,A concern regarding estimated sensitivities and specificities of nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of the international organ donation and transplantation (ODT) system. Multiple organizations have developed guidance, but to date, no comparative summary has emerged to understand differences in existing recommendations. METHODS: We developed and applied a comparative methodology to a convenience sample of recommendations available on The Transplantation Society website. Document types were classified according to characteristics such as type of organization (e.g. governing body or professional society) and geographic region. Recommendations were grouped according to content and summaries were posted on a public website. This process is ongoing and will be updated as new recommendations become available. RESULTS: 18 documents were extracted in the initial review. All documents were based on expert opinion, and none described a formal literature review or adherence with clinical guideline development processes. Recommendation categories included screening of potential donors, risk assessment of potential recipients, post-transplant risk, living/paired donation, protection of ODT professionals, and ethics/logistics. While many documents included similar recommendations, such as the need to screen and test patients who are potential donors, there was variation on some topics. Type of recommended laboratory testing varied with 64% recommending nasopharyngeal swabs, 43% oropharyngeal, and 24% bronchial aspirates. Updated results are available at https://cdtrp.ca/en/covid-19-international-recommendations-for-odt/ CONCLUSION:: The current state of COVID-19 ODT recommendations are limited to expert opinion. Substantial variation exists regarding recommendations, which are based on emerging, but currently low-quality evidence. This summary of existing recommendations will serve to inform priorities for evidence-based recommendations.","Weiss, Matthew J; Lalani, Jehan; Patriquin-Stoner, Chelsea; Dieudé, Mélanie; Hartell, David; Hornby, Laura; Shemie, Sam D; Wilson, Lindsay; Mah, Allison",Transplantation,,471

Herein, to identify potential antiviral agents, 97 natural amide-like compounds known as alkamides and piperamides were tested against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The docking results showed that alkamides and dimeric piperamides from Piper species have a high binding affinity and potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile and Lipinski's rule of five showed that dimeric piperamides have druglikeness potential. The molecular dynamics results showed that pipercyclobutanamide B forms a complex with Mpro at a similar level of stability than N3-I. Our overall results indicate that alkamides and piperamides, and specifically pipercyclobutanamide B, should be further studied as compounds with SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties.","Gutierrez-Villagomez, Juan Manuel; Campos-García, Tonatiu; Molina-Torres, Jorge; López, Mercedes G; Vázquez-Martínez, Juan",J Phys Chem Lett,,471
449422,A meta-analysis on the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters,2020,"In this paper, we propose a continuous-time stochastic intensity model, namely, two-phase dynamic contagion process (2P-DCP), for modelling the epidemic contagion of COVID-19 and investigating the lockdown effect based on the dynamic contagion model introduced by Dassios and Zhao [24]. It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","Chen, Zezhun; Dassios, Angelos; Kuan, Valerie; Lim, Jia Wei; Qu, Yan; Surya, Budhi; Zhao, Hongbiao",Results Phys,,471

Five adult patients (three men and two women, age 39.6 ± 6.9 years) with a positive COVID-19 test result, breathing difficulties, and SpO2 &#8804;95%, who were free from other pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions, were recruited for this study. Participants were assigned to receive a multi-component nutritional formula (containing 1200 mg of potassium nitrate, 200 mg of magnesium, 50 mg of zinc, and 1000 mg of citric acid) every 4 hours during the 48-hour monitoring period. In all participants, SpO2 improved immediately after administration of the nutritional formula, from 1 to 7 percentage points (mean increase 3.6 ± 2.7 points; 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 7.0). SpO2 remained above baseline values throughout the monitoring interval, with values persisting over threshold values (>92%) for all patients and at each time point during the 48 hours. No patients reported any side effects of the intervention. These promising and rather unexpected results call for immediate, well-sampled, mechanistic randomized controlled trials to validate our findings.","Ostojic, Sergej M; Milovancev, Aleksandra; Drid, Patrik; Nikolaidis, Alexandros",J Int Med Res,,471

One important aspect, highlighted by many global health organizations, is that this novel coronavirus outbreak may be especially hazardous to healthcare personnel, including laboratory professionals. Therefore, the aim of this document, prepared by the COVID-19 taskforce of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), is to provide a set of recommendations, adapted from official documents of international and national health agencies, on biosafety measures for routine clinical chemistry laboratories that operate at biosafety levels 1 (BSL-1; work with agents posing minimal threat to laboratory workers) and 2 (BSL-2; work with agents associated with human disease which pose moderate hazard).

METHODS: We searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Maternity and Infant Care database (MIDIRS) and ClinicalTrials.gov up to February 2021 for relevant studies which reported on the circulating lipid profile during pregnancy, in women with and without GDM. Publications describing original data with at least one raw lipid [triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)] measurement were retained. Data extraction was performed using a piloted data extraction form. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019139696). FINDINGS: A total of 292 studies, comprising of 97,880 pregnant women (28232 GDM and 69,648 controls) were included. Using random-effects meta-analysis models to pool study estimates, women with GDM had significantly higher (by 20%) TG levels, with a pooled weighted mean difference between GDM and non-GDM pregnancies of 0.388 mM (0.336, 0.439, p &lt; 0.001). Further analyses revealed elevated TG levels occur in the first trimester and persist afterwards. Meta-regression analyses showed that differences in TG levels between women with GDM and healthy controls were significantly associated with age, BMI, study continent, OGTT procedure, and GDM diagnosis criteria. INTERPRETATION: Elevated lipids, particularly, TG, are associated with GDM.","Hu, J.; Gillies, C. L.; Lin, S.; Stewart, Z. A.; Melford, S. E.; Abrams, K. R.; Baker, P. N.; Khunti, K.; Tan, B.

A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents. Therefore, the lockdown led to a reported improved adherence to the GFD in one-third of the respondents, in particular in those with previous worse disease control, offering the opportunity to avoid sources of contamination/transgression and increase the use of naturally gluten-free products.","Monzani, Alice; Lionetti, Elena; Felici, Enrico; Fransos, Lucia; Azzolina, Danila; Rabbone, Ivana; Catassi, Carlo",Nutrients,,471

However, the evolving science of COVID-19, the need for quick action, and the disruption of conventional knowledge networks pose challenges to existing CPD practices. To meet these emergent and rapidly evolving needs, what is required is an approach to CPD that draws insights from the domain of knowledge mobilization (KMb). METHODS: This short report describes a research protocol for exploring rapid KMb responses to COVID-19 at one Canadian academic teaching hospital. The proposed research will proceed as a case study using a mixed methods design collecting quantitative (surveys and Web site use metrics) and qualitative data (interviews) from individuals involved in developing, using, and supporting the KMb resources. Analysis will proceed in two phases: descriptive analysis of data to share insights and integrative analysis of data to build theory. RESULTS: Results from this study will inform the immediate KMb and CPD contribution to the COVID-19 response. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will also make a broader contribution to the field of CPD, theoretically informing intersections between KMb and CPD and therefore contributing to an integrated science of CPD.","Rowland, Paula; Tavares, Walter; Lowe, Mandy; Tripp, Tim; Richardson, Juanita; Anderson, Melanie; Oja, Lori Anne; Paton, Morag; Wiljer, David; Woods, Nicole; Ng, Stella",J. contin. educ. health prof,,471

Prevention remains the only feasible option to stop the pandemic; without population-level vaccination, we are unlikely to regain the quality of social life and the unrestricted economy/commerce we enjoyed before. Anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists are seemingly oblivious to the detrimental effect of COVID-19 both at an individual and societal level. These groups have (and probably will) continue to attempt to undermine efforts to eradicate the virus despite the fact that the major reduction in morbidity/and mortality of infectious diseases of the past century was achieved through the development of vaccines and improved hygiene. Conspiracy theories are directly associated with reduced vaccine uptake and unfortunately neither anti-vaxxers nor vaccine hesitants cannot be persuaded (debunked) with logical arguments; hence, prescribers must not only be aware of the truth underlying the dense web of misinformation but must fully understand the psychological aspects as well to be able to efficiently counsel about the potential benefits and harms. Such knowledge is pivotal to help the lay public to make informed decisions about SARS CoV-2 in general and vaccination in particular; as the COVID-19 situation can probably be best controlled with mass inoculation and novel immune therapies.

However, in view of the fact that a short discontinuation (once or twice) of the weekly MTX treatment in patients with a stable disease situation is probably associated with a comparatively low risk of inducing a flare of the underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease, such a short discontinuation of treatment can be considered according to the individual decision involving the patient and the treating rheumatologist. Nevertheless, discontinuation of MTX treatment does not appear to be absolutely necessary-especially since discontinuation would have to occur twice within a short period of time for most COVID-19 vaccines. Under no circumstances should longer periods of discontinuation of treatment be considered as this could result in a flare of the underlying disease. A more detailed assessment of the data situation and the resulting consequences (also with respect to DMARD) will follow soon in the updated recommendations for action of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) on the management of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in the context of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, especially COVID-19.","Krüger, Klaus",Z Rheumatol,,471

There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified; those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice. Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can bind to U, hence, our scoring. To validate our results, we confirmed the discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the publicly available genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2 orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.","Boroojeny, Ali Ebrahimpour; Chitsaz, Hamidreza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05859v1.pdf,471

They call for a team-based approach and efficient communication at all levels in addition to effective command, control and oversight. While consolidation of care into major trauma centres has led to improved outcomes for patients, it also means that clinicians may miss out on real-life experience of major incident or severe trauma casualties. It is therefore important to factor training, exercises and planning into individual and organizational preparedness. While several recent major incidents have occurred and provided further experience and lessons, such as the Grenfell Fire, Manchester Arena bombings and London Bridge stabbings, the global COVID-19 pandemic has required clinicians and organizations around the world to re-examine major incidents and the extent of their impacts. This has reinforced the importance of all members of the clinical team possessing an appropriate level of awareness and understanding of major incidents.","Porthouse, Alexander; Clancy, Hannah; Lax, Peter",Surgery (Oxford),,471

As an acute respiratory disease, COVID-19 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the same receptor used by its predecessor, SARS-CoV, to enter and spread through the respiratory tract. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue and in a small population of patients, SARS-CoV-2 can cause several neurological symptoms. Neurological malaise may include severe manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular disease and meningitis/encephalitis. Although there is evidence showing that coronaviruses can invade the central nervous system (CNS), studies are needed to address the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS and to decipher the underlying neurotropic mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes current reports on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and addresses potential routes used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS.","Rodriguez, Myosotys; Soler, Yemmy; Perry, Marissa; Reynolds, Jessica L; El-Hage, Nazira",Front Neurol,,471

This outbreak spread rapidly to the community through high-risk groups. This study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 cases based on S religious group membership and summarizes the Daegu municipal government's processes and responses to control the outbreak. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases were obtained through basic and in-depth epidemiological surveys. General characteristics, the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the case-fatality rate, and the time-to-event within each group were presented after stratifying confirmed cases according to S religious group membership. RESULTS: Overall, 7,008 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Daegu from February 18, 2020 to June 30, 2020, and 61.5% (n= 4,309) were S religious group members. Compared with non-members, members had a higher proportion of female (p< 0.001) and younger age (p< 0.001), as well as lower disease prevalence. At the time of the investigation, 38.4% of cases in members were asymptomatic versus 23.7% of cases in non-members (p< 0.001). The case-fatality rate of non-members aged &#8805; 60 years was significantly higher than that of members (p< 0.001). Compared with non-members, members had longer intervals from symptom onset to diagnosis (p< 0.001) and from diagnosis to admission (p< 0.001), and a shorter interval from admission to discharge (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological features of S religious group members, including the proportion of asymptomatic cases, case-fatality rate, and time-to-event, differed from non-members. The Daegu authorities prevented further COVID-19 spread through immediate isolation and active screening tests of all S religious group members.","Kim, Jong-Yeon; Lee, Yu-Mi; Lee, Hwajin; Kim, Jung-Whan; Kim, Shin-Woo",Epidemiol Health,,471

However, research examining the mental health effects of maternity harassment is lacking. We aimed to examine the association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy in Japan. METHODS: A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted on 359 pregnant employees (including women who were working at the time their pregnancy was confirmed) from May 22 to May 31, 2020, during which time a COVID-19 state of emergency was declared. Maternity harassment was defined as being subjected to any of the 16 adverse treatments prohibited by national guidelines. Depression was defined as a score of &#8805;9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Japanese version). Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% of the pregnant employees had experienced maternity harassment by supervisors and/or colleagues. After adjusting for demographics, pregnancy status, work status, and fear of COVID-19, pregnant employees who experienced maternity harassment were more likely to have depression than those who did not (odds ratio 2.48, 95% confidential interval 1.34-4.60). This association was not influenced by whether they were teleworking or not as a COVID-19 measure.

As a result, the public health and clinical community are hindered in their ability to monitor and contain the spread of COVID‐19. Despite broad consensus that more testing is needed, pragmatic guidance toward realizing this objective has been limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource‐efficient, and achievable efforts toward enhanced testing capacity. The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing to benefit public health. Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework has the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision‐making in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks.","Pettit, Syril D; Jerome, Keith R; Rouquié, David; Mari, Bernard; Barbry, Pascal; Kanda, Yasunari; Matsumoto, Mineo; Hester, Susan; Wehmas, Leah; Botten, Jason W; Bruce, Emily A",EMBO Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375201/; https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202012634,471

METHODS: We collected antibiotic prescriptions and physician office visits from January 1, 2016 to July 21, 2020. We calculated monthly prescription rates stratified by sex, age group, profession, diagnosis type and antibiotic class. We looked at monthly prescription rate as a moving average over time. Using interrupted time series analysis method we estimated the changes in prescription rates after March 2020. RESULTS: The moving average of overall monthly prescription rates during January to June of 2020 were below the minimum of the historical years’ moving averages (2016-2019). We observed >30% reduction in overall monthly prescription rates in April, May and July of 2020 compared to the same months of 2019. We observed overall monthly prescription rates experienced a significant level change of -12.79 (p < 0.001) after COVID-19 after March 2020, with the greatest level change of -18.02 among 1-4 years (p<0.001). We estimated an average -5.94 (p<0.001) change in RTI-associated monthly prescription rates after March 2020. Overall prescription rates comparing January – July 2019 and their 2020 counterparts showed a decrease in monthly prescribing ranging from -1 to -5 for: amoxicillin, amoxicillin and enzyme inhibitors, azithromycin, clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: In BC, Canada, overall and RTI-specific monthly antibiotic prescription rates declined significantly during April to July 2020 compared to the same months in pre-pandemic years.","Mamun, Abdullah A; Saatchi, Ariana; Xie, Max; Lishman, Hannah; Blondel-Hill, Edith; Marra, Fawziah; Patrick, David M",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183981/,471

Differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis and cecal diverticulitis is crucial because of the different treatment methods. Our aim is to reveal the importance of distinguishing acute appendicitis from cecal diverticulitis. Methods: The data of patients who were admitted to the hospital between 2015 and 2019 with the complaint of abdominal pain and then finally diagnosed with colon diverticular disease, colon diverticulitis, or acute appendicitis, analyzed retrospectively. Results: A total of 19 cecum diverticulitis patients were detected during surgery for acute appendicitis or during clinical and radiological evaluation. 1247 appendectomies were evaluated; the final diagnosis was observed as cecal diverticulitis in 5 patients (0,4%). One hundred nineteen patients diagnosed with colonic diverticulitis at admission were evaluated, while 105 (88,2%) of them had left-sided diverticulitis, 14 (11,7%) of them had solitary cecal diverticulitis. All of the solitary cecal diverticulitis patients were treated conservatively, except one patient who has Hinchey 3 diverticulitis. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis of cecum diverticulitis with acute appendicitis is important because cecum diverticulitis can be managed as conservatively in most cases.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the availability of telehealth services at outpatient mental health treatment facilities in the United States at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify facility-level characteristics and state-level policies associated with the availability. RESEARCH DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: All outpatient mental health treatment facilities (N=8860) listed in the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on April 16, 2020. MEASURES: Primary outcome is whether an outpatient mental health treatment facility reported offering telehealth services. RESULTS: Approximately 43% of outpatient mental health facilities in the United States reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Facilities located in the United States South and nonmetropolitan counties were more likely to offer services, as were facilities with public sector ownership, those providing care for both children and adults, and those accepting Medicaid as a form of payment. Outpatient mental health treatment facilities located in states with state-wide shelter-in-place laws were less likely to offer telehealth, as well as facilities in counties with more COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than half of outpatient mental health treatment facilities were providing telehealth services.

600792,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - What Every Otolaryngologist Should Know: A Review.,2020,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is known to be a factor in morbidity and mortality associated with acute viral infections including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus and coronavirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity and important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with CRS. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (-IL-6R mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an -IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of -IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.","Rubsamen, Reid Martin; Burkholz, Scott; Massey, Shane; Brasel, Trevor; Hodge, Tom; Wang, Lu; Herst, Charles; Carback, Richard Thomas; Harris, Paul",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162826,471
600840,"Modeling the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on skin, currency, and clothing",2020-11-09,"Fever is one of the leading causes for pediatric medical consultation and the most common symptom at clinical presentation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Most febrile episodes are due to self-limited infections, but a small proportion of children will develop life-threatening infections. The early recognition of children who have or are progressing to a critical illness among all febrile cases is challenging, and there are currently no objective and quantitative tools to do so. This results in increased morbidity and mortality among children with impending life-threatening infections, whilst contributing to the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, overwhelming health care facilities, and harm to patients receiving avoidable antimicrobial treatment. Specific fever origin is difficult to ascertain and co-infections in LMICs are common. However, many severe infections share common pathways of host injury irrespective of etiology, including immune and endothelial activation that contribute to the pathobiology of sepsis (i.e., pathogen “agnostic” mechanisms of disease). Importantly, mediators of these pathways are independent markers of disease severity and outcome. We propose that measuring circulating levels of these factors can provide quantitative and objective evidence to: enable early recognition of severe infection; guide patient triage and management; enhance post-discharge risk stratification and follow up; and mitigate potential gender bias in clinical decisions. Here, we review the clinical and biological evidence supporting the clinical utility of host immune and endothelial activation biomarkers as components of novel rapid triage tests, and discuss the challenges and needs for developing and implementing such tools.","Balanza, Núria; Erice, Clara; Ngai, Michelle; Varo, Rosauro; Kain, Kevin C.; Bassat, Quique",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072673/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.552083,471

An inflammatory immune response targeting children appeared during the pandemic, which was associated with COVID-19 named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Characteristics of MIS-C include the classic inflammation findings, multi-organ dysfunction, and fever as the cardinal feature. Up to now, no specific therapy has been identified for MIS-C. Currently, considerable progress has been obtained in the MIS-C treatment by cell therapy, specially Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Unique properties have been reported for MSCs, such as various resources for purification of cell, high proliferation, self-renewal, non-invasive procedure, tissue regenerator, multidirectional differentiation, and immunosuppression. As indicated by a recent clinical research, MSCs have the ability of reducing disease inflammation and severity in children with MIS-C.

We aimed to quantify the effect (if any) of the presence as opposed to absence of cancer on important clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, medRxiv, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), and references of relevant articles up to April 27, 2020, to identify observational studies comparing patients with versus without cancer infected with COVID-19 and to report on mortality and/or need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181531). RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 46,499 patients (1,776 patients with cancer) with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe, and the United States were included. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with versus those without cancer (2,034 deaths; RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.07; P < .0001; 8 studies with 37,807 patients). The need for ICU admission was also more likely in patients with versus without cancer (3,220 events; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.87; P < .0001; 26 studies with 15,375 patients). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients > 65 years of age, all-cause mortality was comparable between those with versus without cancer (915 deaths; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.41; P = .71; 8 studies with 5,438 patients). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer is associated with worse clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. However, elderly patients with cancer may not be at increased risk of death when infected with COVID-19. These findings may inform discussions of clinicians with patients about prognosis and may guide health policies.","Giannakoulis, Vassilis G.; Papoutsi, Eleni; Siempos, Ilias I.",JCO Glob Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511066/; https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00225,471

STUDY DESIGN: prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover trial. ANIMALS: Six adult horses weighing 494 ± 33 kg. METHODS: Treatments included meperidine 1 mg/kg IM with saline 6 mL subcutaneously, meperidine 1 mg/kg subcutaneously with saline 6 mL IM, and saline 6 mL subcutaneously and 6 mL IM, with a 7-day washout between treatments. Plasma meperidine concentrations and pharmacodynamic values (thermal and mechanical thresholds, physiological variables, fecal production) were collected at various time points for 24 hours. Accelerometry data were obtained for 8 hours to measure locomotor activity. Data were analyzed with a mixed effects model, and α was set at .05. RESULTS: Meperidine terminal half-life (T1/2 ), maximal plasma concentrations, and time to maximal concentration were 186 ± 59 and 164 ± 56 minutes, 265.7 ± 47.2 and 243.1 ± 80.1 ng/mL at 17 ± 6, and 24 ± 13 minutes for IM at subcutaneous administration, respectively. No effect of treatment or time was observed on thermal or mechanical thresholds, heart rate, respiratory rate, locomotor activity, frequency of defecations, or fecal weight (P > .2 for all). CONCLUSION: Maximum meperidine concentrations were achieved quickly with a short T1/2 in both treatment groups. Neither IM nor subcutaneous meperidine influenced thermal or mechanical threshold or physiological variables. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The short half-life and lack of detectable antinociceptive effect do not support IM or subcutaneous administration meperidine at 1 mg/kg for analgesia in horses.","Hanafi, Amanda L; Reed, Rachel A; Trenholme, Heather N; Sakai, Daniel M; Ryan, Clare A; Barletta, Michele; Quandt, Jane E; Knych, Heather K",Vet Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242227/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13545,471

Our recent in vitro, and in vivo coronaviral pathogenesis studies involving Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) suggest a crucial role for a small host membrane-virus contact initiator region of the Spike protein, called the fusion peptide that enhances the virus fusogenicity and infectivity. Here we study the Spike from five human β-coronaviruses (HCoV) including the SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 for comparison. The structural and dynamics analyses of the Spike show that its fusion loop spatially organizes three fusion peptides contiguous to each other to synergistically trigger the virus-host membrane fusion process. We propose a Contact Initiation Model based on the architecture of the Spike quaternary structure that explains the obligatory participation of the fusion loop in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. Among all the HCoV Spikes in this study, SARS-CoV-2 has the most hydrophobic surface and the extent of hydrophobicity correlates with the reproductive number and infectivity of the other HCoV. Comparison between results from standard and replica exchange molecular dynamics reveal the unique physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The importance of the fusion loop makes it an apt target for anti-virals and vaccine candidates.","Pal, Debnath",J Struct Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847721000186?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2021.107713; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847721000186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662570/,471

In particular, it converts androgen into estrogens being therefore responsible for the correct sex steroids balance. Due to its capacity in producing estrogens it has also been considered as a promising target for breast cancer therapy. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (R264C and R264H) have been shown to alter aromatase activity and they have been associated to an increased or decreased risk for estrogen-dependent pathologies. Here, the effect of these mutations on the protein dynamics is investigated by UV/FTIR and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. H/D exchange rates were measured by FTIR for the three proteins in the ligand-free, substrate- and inhibitor-bound forms and the data indicate that the wild-type enzyme undergoes a conformational change leading to a more compact tertiary structure upon substrate or inhibitor binding. Indeed, the H/D exchange rates are decreased when a ligand is present. In the variants, the exchange rates in the ligand-free and –bound forms are similar, indicating that a structural change is lacking, despite the single amino acid substitution is located in the peripheral shell of the protein molecule. Moreover, the fluorescence lifetimes data show that the quenching effect on tryptophan-224 observed upon ligand binding in the wild-type, is absent in both variants. Since this residue is located in the catalytic pocket, these findings suggest that substrate entrance and/or retention in the active site is partially compromised in both mutants. A contact network analysis demonstrates that the protein structure is organized in two main clusters, whose connectivity is altered by ligand binding, especially in correspondence of helix-G, where the amino acid substitutions occur. Our findings demonstrate that SNPs resulting in mutations on aromatase surface modify the protein flexibility that is required for substrate binding and catalysis. The cluster analysis provides a rationale for such effect, suggesting helix G as a possible target for aromatase inhibition.","Di Nardo, Giovanna; Di Venere, Almerinda; Zhang, Chao; Nicolai, Eleonora; Castrignanò, Silvia; Di Paola, Luisa; Gilardi, Gianfranco; Mei, Giampiero",Biol Direct,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-021-00292-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902660/,471

A systematic search of eight electronic databases and grey literature sources was conducted up to October 2020. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and controlled trials, designed to encourage the selection and purchase of healthier products and/or discourage the selection and purchase of less-healthy products using strategies delivered via real-world online food ordering systems.

However, the cellular and molecular cues regulating the development of IL-10-producing effector CD8(+) T cells are not completely defined. Here we show that type I interferons (IFNs) are required for the development of IL-10-producing effector CD8(+) T cells during influenza virus infection. We find that type I IFNs can enhance IL-27 production by lung antigen presenting cells, thereby facilitating IL-10-producing CD8(+) T cell development through a CD8(+) T cell non-autonomous way. Surprisingly, we also demonstrate that direct type I IFN signaling in CD8(+) T cells is required for the maximal generation of IL-10-producing CD8(+) T cells. Type I IFN signaling in CD8(+) T cells, in cooperation with IL-27 and IL-2 signaling, promotes and sustains the expression of IRF4 and Blimp-1, two transcription factors required for the production of IL-10 by effector CD8(+) T cells. Our data have revealed a critical role of the innate antiviral effector cytokines in regulating the production of a regulatory cytokine by effector CD8(+) T cells during respiratory virus infection.

The high catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for the generation of angiotensin (ANG)-1-7 from ANG II suggests an important role of ACE2 in preventing ANG II accumulation, while at the same time enhancing ANG-1-7 formation. ACE and ACE2 may have counterbalancing functions and a regulatory role in fine-tuning the rate at which ANG peptides are formed and degraded. By counterregulating the actions of ACE on ANG II formation, ACE2 may play a role in maintaining a balanced status of the renninangiotensin system. This review focuses on the function of ACE2 and its possible roles in kidney disease and hypertension. Studies using models of ACE2 ablation and the pharmacologic administration of an ACE2 inhibitor suggest that decreased ACE2 activity alone or in combination with increased ACE activity may play a role in both diseases.","Wysocki, Jan; González-Pacheco, Francisco R.; Batlle, Daniel",Curr Hypertens Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18367030/,471

However, recurring antimalarial drug resistance necessitates the continual generation of new antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action. In order to shift the focus from only controlling this disease towards elimination and eradication, next-generation antimalarial agents need to address the gaps in the malaria drug arsenal. This includes developing drugs for chemoprotection, treating severe malaria and blocking transmission. Plasmodial kinases are promising targets for next-generation antimalarial drug development as they mediate critical cellular processes and some are active across multiple stages of the parasite’s life cycle. This review gives an update on the progress made thus far with regards to plasmodial kinase small-molecule inhibitor development.","Moolman, Chantalle; van der Sluis, Rencia; Beteck, Richard M.; Legoabe, Lesetja J.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25215182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171706/,471

Design: A convenience sample of 201 older adults aged 65 and over was interviewed. Using bootstrapping, we tested the strength and significance of the indirect effect of depressive symptoms and malnutrition (mediators) on the relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age. Results: The relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age during the COVID-19 pandemic was mediated by malnutrition, but not by depressive symptoms. In addition, the participants felt older during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding period. Conclusions: An association was found among feelings of loneliness, malnutrition, and subjective age. To overcome these feelings in times of crisis like the pandemic, it is essential to develop new communication methods (technologies for managing and addressing the needs of the older population; technologies to encourage social engagement, and technologies for managing and providing remote medical services) for and with older adults that are effective in reducing loneliness, and to promote good nutrition. Possible practical solutions include new social network technologies for reducing loneliness combined with continued reliance on phone communication as an intervention of psychological support to promote a healthy lifestyle and prevent malnutrition.","Vitman Schorr, Adi; Yehuda, Itamar; Tamir, Snait",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375219/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010106,471

The COVID-19 pandemic sheds a bright light on this very issue impressing upon the need for more research regarding healthcare in disparate populations. Although kidney transplantation remains the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease management and longevity of life, access to transplantation remains a critical barrier in minority populations. The literature on disparity in access abounds but remains limited with regards to posttransplantation outcomes. The purpose of this review is to draw attention to existing research and literature in posttransplant outcomes and highlight the overall knowledge gap that persists in postkidney transplant care among disparate populations. RECENT FINDINGS The current review focuses on important paradigm shifts in the determinants of outcomes in posttransplantation care in minority populations. It emphasizes a departure from immune mediated causes to more salient health inequities and socioeconomic factors contributing to patient and graft survival which require further investigation. SUMMARY Despite increased awareness of health disparity in minority populations, outcomes data postkidney transplantation remains sparse. Critical to the future of kidney transplantation and improved healthcare coordination in minority populations will be a deeper understanding of contributing socio-economic variables in disparate outcomes.","Desai, Amishi; Sodhi, Rupinder K; Akkina, Sanjeev",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375318/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000910,471
629453,"Safety and immunogenicity of an anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus DNA vaccine: a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation trial",2019-07-24,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged as an unprecedented challenge to discover effective drugs for its prevention and cure. Hyperinflammation-induced lung damage is one of the poor prognostic indicators causing a higher rate of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug, is being used for COVID-19 treatment, and we currently have limited information regarding its efficacy and safety. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the WHO pharmacovigilance database. METHODS: This study analyzed all suspected ADEs related to favipiravir reported from 2015. The reports were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. RESULTS: This study is based on 194 ADEs reported from 93 patients. Most frequent ADEs suspected to be caused by the favipiravir included increased hepatic enzymes, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, and diarrhea. Severe and fatal ADEs occurred more frequently in men and those over the age of 64 years. Blood and lymphatic disorders, cardiac disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, injury poisoning, and procedural complications were more common manifestations of severe ADEs. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that favipiravir appears to be a relatively safe drug. An undiscovered anti-inflammatory activity of favipiravir may explain the improvement in critically ill patients and reduce inflammatory markers. Currently, the data is based on very few patients. A more detailed assessment of the uncommon ADEs needs to be analyzed when more information will be available.","Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Charan, Jaykaran; Dutta, Siddhartha; Sharma, Paras; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Sharma, Praveen; Lugova, Halyna; Krishnapillai, Ambigga; Islam, Salequl; Haque, Mainul; Misra, Sanjeev",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s287934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364790/,471

METHODS: We designed an online, semi-structured stakeholder questionnaire to collect information on global outbreak surveillance sources and limitations from participants who use epidemic intelligence and outbreak alert services in their work in government and nongovernment organizations in the Asia–Pacific region. RESULTS: All respondents agreed that it was important to remain up to date with global outbreaks. The main reason cited for following global outbreak news was as an early warning for serious epidemics. Mainstream media and specialist Internet sources such as the World Health Organization (n = 54/91; 59%), the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED)-mail (n = 45/91; 49%) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n = 31/91; 34%) were the most common sources for global outbreak news; rapid intelligence services such as HealthMap were less common (n = 9/91; 10%). Only 51% (n = 46/91) of respondents thought that their sources of outbreak news were timely and sufficient for their needs. CONCLUSION: For those who work in epidemic response, epidemic intelligence is important and widely used. Stakeholders are less aware of and less frequently use rapid sources such as HealthMap and rely more on validated but less timely traditional sources of disease surveillance. Users identified a need for more timely and reliable epidemic intelligence.","Hii, Aurysia; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Housen, Tambri; Saketa, Salanieta; Kunasekaran, Mohana Priya; Sulaiman, Feroza; Yanti, NK Semara; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",Western Pac Surveill Response J,https://doi.org/10.5365/wpsar.2018.9.2.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30766745/,471

635707,"Correction to: Simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and related bat coronaviruses by real-time reverse transcription PCR",2017-12-22,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have caused significant disruptions across society, including changes in the number of emergency department (ED) visits. This study aims to investigate the impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients’ beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C). METHODS: We collected overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) during 01/04/2017–31/05/2020. We then performed three different analyses, considering three different timeframes. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017–31/12–2019 to calculate changes over a period of 6 months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020–31/05/2020). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p < 0.001 for A and C; an 9%, p = 0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within 4 h of arrival (6.6,7.4,6.2% respectively A-C,p < 0.001). In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%; p < 0.001), and the number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival was increased (6%,p < 0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (p < 0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p < 0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within 4 h, together with a larger (12.5%,p < 0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p < 0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to indirect impacts of these interventions, where increasing pressure on one part of the ED system affected other parts. This underlines the need for multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary. During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding. Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.","Panovska-Griffiths, J.; Ross, J.; Elkhodair, S.; Baxter-Derrington, C.; Laing, C.; Raine, R.",BMC Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-021-00438-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823807/,471

In this review, we discuss and describe novel RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapies in clinical trials and on the market. RECENT FINDINGS: The first RNAi-based therapies have entered clinical use for the control of atherosclerosis risk factors, i.e., blood cholesterol levels. The most advanced treatment is silencing of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) with a drug called inclisiran, which has been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in late 2020, and results in a robust decrease in plasma cholesterol levels.

In the long run, there is no evidence that health human capital can help the Sahara out of the poverty trap. While health human capital has a significant effect on poverty reduction in the short term. There is a threshold effect in the poverty reduction model of healthy human capital. When the economic development level reaches the threshold, the effect of poverty reduction is more obvious and deeper. The extended Solow economic growth model also proved that if the external human capital breaks through the threshold, it can make developing countries get rid of the poverty trap. Therefore, the economic development brought about by health care expenditure must benefit the poor in Sub-Saharan Africa and allow them to enjoy the welfare of social security.","Wang, Qiu-Su; Hua, Yu-Fei; Tao, Ran; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.697826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178934/,471
638270,Identification of a novel protein 3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2004-05-07,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been found in the faeces of infected patients in numerous studies. Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The viral load in the faeces of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at between 5·103 to 107.6 copies/mL, depending on the infection course. In the sewerage, faeces undergo dilution and viral load decreases considerably in the wastewater entering a WWTP with a range from 2 copies/100 mL to 3·103 copies/mL, depending on the level of the epidemic. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, although no evidence of COVID-19 transmission has been found via this route, could be advantageously exploited as an early warning of outbreaks. Preliminary studies on WBE seem promising; but high uncertainty of viral loads in wastewater and faeces remains, and further research is needed. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, based on RNA sequences and RT-PCR, requires a shared approach on sample pre-treatment and on-site collection to ensure comparable results. The finding of viral RNA in stools does not imply that the virus is viable and infectious. Viability of CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 decreases in wastewater - due to temperature, pH, solids, micropollutants - but high inactivation in WWTPs can be obtained only by using disinfection (free chlorine, UVC light). A reduction in the quantity of disinfectants can be obtained by implementing Membrane-Bioreactors with ultrafiltration to separate SARS-CoV-2 virions with a size of 60–140 nm. In sludge treatment, thermophilic digestion is effective, based on the general consensus that CoVs are highly sensitive to increased temperatures.","Foladori, Paola; Cutrupi, Francesca; Segata, Nicola; Manara, Serena; Pinto, Federica; Malpei, Francesca; Bruni, Laura; La Rosa, Giuseppina",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649988/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140444; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720339668?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720339668,471

Group formation, growth of the network, information propagation, and rumour blocking are some of the many network behavioural traits that are influenced by the interaction patterns of the users in the network. Network motifs capture one such interaction pattern between users in online social networks (OSNs). For this work, four second-order (two-edged) network motifs have been considered, namely, message receiving pattern, message broadcasting pattern, message passing pattern, and reciprocal message pattern, to analyse user behaviour in online social networks. This work provides and utilizes a node interaction pattern-finding algorithm to identify the frequency of aforementioned second-order network motifs in six real-life online social networks (Facebook, GPlus, GNU, Twitter, Enron Email, and Wiki-vote). The frequency of network motifs participated in by a node is considered for the relative ranking of all nodes in the online social networks. The highest-rated nodes are considered seeds for information propagation. The performance of using network motifs for ranking nodes as seeds for information propagation is validated using statistical metrics Z-score, concentration, and significance profile and compared with baseline ranking methods in-degree centrality, out-degree centrality, closeness centrality, and PageRank. The comparative study shows the performance of centrality measures to be similar or better than second-order network motifs as seed nodes in information diffusion. The experimental results on finding frequencies and importance of different interaction patterns provide insights on the significance and representation of each such interaction pattern and how it varies from network to network.","Sinha, Sankhamita; Bhattacharya, Subhayan; Roy, Sarbani",J Supercomput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-04079-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584343/,471
642580,Do Animals Play a Role in the Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)? A Commentary,2020-12-24,"Objective and background: Pathological changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggest that SARS sequelae are associated with dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production. To improve understanding of the immuno‐pathological processes involved in lung injury associated with SARS, the temporal changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles in the sera of SARS patients were compared with those of patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP), according to the degree of lung involvement. Methods: Serum levels of 11 cytokines and chemokines, in 14 patients with SARS and 24 patients with CAP, were serially checked using a bead‐based multiassay system. Sera from 12 healthy subjects were used as normal controls. Results: The serum levels of interferon‐γ‐inducible protein‐10 (IP‐10), IL‐2 and IL‐6 were significantly elevated during SARS infection. In patients with CAP, but not in those with SARS, the levels of interferon‐γ, IL‐10, IL‐8 and monokine induced by interferon‐γ (MIG) were significantly elevated compared with the levels in healthy controls. Among the chemokines/cytokines, IL‐6 levels correlated most strongly with radiographic scores (r = 0.62). The elevation of IP‐10 and IL‐2 antedated the development of chest involvement and reached peak levels earlier than the radiographic scores. In contrast, the dynamic changes in IL‐6, C‐reactive protein and neutrophils occurred synchronously with the changes in radiographic scores. The mean ratio of IL‐6 to IL‐10 in SARS patients (4.84; range 0.41–21) was significantly higher than that in CAP patients (2.95; range 0.02–10.57) (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The early induction of IP‐10 and IL‐2, as well as the subsequent over‐production of IL‐6 and lack of IL‐10 production, probably contribute to the main immuno‐pathological processes involved in lung injury in SARS. These changes in cytokine/chemokine profile are remarkably different from those observed in CAP patients.","CHIEN, Jung‐Yien; HSUEH, Po‐Ren; CHENG, Wern‐Cherng; YU, Chong‐Jen; YANG, Pan‐Chyr",Respirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17052299/,471

648690,Antigenicity Analysis of Different Regions of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein,2004-06-01,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has pushed medical providers to trial telemedicine on a scale that lacks precedent. In genetic medicine, nearly overnight genetics providers were asked to transition to telemedicine platforms, irrespective of their previous experience with these modalities. This push to telegenetics prompted a reappraisal of the practice, as genetics providers learned firsthand about the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of telegenetics and telesupervision, all of which raise questions about the potential incorporation of these platforms beyond the pandemic. Adding to nascent literature on the transition to telegenetics amidst the COVID‐19 pandemic, we aimed to evaluate provider experiences and preferences with respect to telegenetics through qualitative semi‐structured interviews with genetics providers. Nineteen providers from seven institutions participated in a semi‐structured interview focused on the rapid shift to telegenetics, the benefits and drawbacks of the practice, experiences supervising students on virtual platforms, and providers’ preferences. We employed a qualitative methodology so that providers working across diverse subspecialties could expand upon previously reported benefits and drawbacks. Qualitative data revealed the nuanced benefits of telegenetics which included overcoming geographic, spatial, and temporal barriers to care as well as greater involvement of patients’ family members in sessions. In addition, the data indicated drawbacks related to additional tasks such as completing paperwork electronically and facilitating the collection of specimens from patients’ homes. Interviews with providers from different subspecialties revealed how telegenetics may be uniquely useful for particular subspecialties, patient populations, or clinics for whom the aforementioned barriers are more significant. Providers reported that telesupervision made the provision of feedback to students more cumbersome and identified a number of methods for enriching the telesupervision experience. In keeping with previous research, most genetics providers appraised telegenetics as a valuable addition to patient care (68%, N = 13) and hoped to offer it as an option beyond the pandemic (63%, N = 12).","Mueller, Rebecca; Schindewolf, Erica; Williams, Samantha; Jay Kessler, Lisa",J Genet Couns,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355459/,471

Increasing evidence has emerged that host miRNAs serve in animal cells to restrict viral infections. In turn, many viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (RSS) which are employed to moderate the potency of the cell’s miRNA selection against viral replication. Some viruses also encode viral miRNAs. In this review, we summarize findings from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that illustrate examples of host cell miRNAs that target the viruses, of RSS encoded by viruses, and of host cell miRNA profile changes that are seen in infected cells.","Houzet, Laurent; Jeang, Kuan-Teh",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3177989?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21640212/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939911000769; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874939911000769,471

In approximately half of the cases no other enteropathogens were detected. However, only 73% of 30 laboratories participating in a questionnaire survey routinely tested for this parasite, and the majority of researchers considered cryptosporidiosis to be of minor importance. In a placebo-controlled field study 152 suckling calves were treated daily against cryptosporidiosis either with sulfadimidine or with halofuginone (Halocur(®), Intervet) over 1 week. Treatment by oral drench started at the onset of diarrhoea in the herd. Oocyst excretion, faecal consistency and health status were recorded five times for a 3-week period. Oocyst excretion peaked 7–14 days in the placebo group after the onset of diarrhoea, and during that period prevalence and intensity of excretion were significantly lower in the halofuginone-treated group compared to the sulfadimidine and the placebo control groups. The health status (diarrhoea, dehydration) declined in all groups but was significantly (P<0.05–0.001) better in the halofuginone group in the first 2 weeks. Halofuginone effectively (P<0.05–0.001) reduced oocyst excretion and improved the health status of the treated animals, while sulfadimidine had no effect against Cryptosporidium.","Joachim, A; Krull, T; Schwarzkopf, J; Daugschies, A",Vet Parasitol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401703000062; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401703000062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12623207/,471

Appropriate use of serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies requires estimation of their accuracy over large populations and an understanding of the variance in performance over time and across demographic groups. In this manuscript we focus on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody tests approved under emergency use authorizations and determine the recall of the serological tests compared to RT-PCR tests by Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINCs). Variability in test performance was further examined over time and by demographics. The recall of the most common IgG assay (LOINC 94563-4) was 91.2% (95% CI: 90.5%, 91.9%). IgA (LOINC 94562-6) and IgM (94564-2) assays performed significantly worse than IgG assays with estimated recall rates of 20.6% and 27.3%, respectively. A statistically significant difference in recall (p = 0.019) was observed across sex with a higher recall in males than females, 92.1% and 90.4%, respectively. Recall also differed significantly by age group, with higher recall in those over 45 compared to those under 45, 92.9% and 88.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). While race was unavailable for the majority of the individuals, a significant difference was observed between recall in White individuals and Black individuals (p = 0.007) and White individuals and Hispanic individuals (p=0.001).

The pandemic spread of the disease caused an imbalance between demand and supply of materials and reagents needed for diagnostic purposes including swab sets. In a comparative effectiveness study, we conducted serial follow-up swabs in hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We assessed the diagnostic performance of an in-house system developed according to recommendations by the US CDC. In a total of 96 serial swabs, we found significant differences in the accuracy of the different swab systems to generate a positive result in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ranging from around 50 to 80%. Of note, an in-house swab system was superior to most commercially available sets as reflected by significantly lower Ct values of viral genes.

However, it is unclear which viral gene causes these effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein on PK-15 cells. We found that TGEV N protein suppressed cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis. Characterization of various cellular proteins that are involved in regulating cell cycle progression demonstrated that the expression of N gene resulted in an accumulation of p53 and p21, which suppressed cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdk2 expression. Moreover, the expression of TGEV N gene promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c, followed by activation of caspase-3, resulting in cell apoptosis in the transfected PK-15 cells following cell cycle arrest. Further studies showed that p53 inhibitor attenuated TGEV N protein induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases and apoptosis through reversing the expression changes of cdc2, cdk2 and cyclin B1 and the translocation changes of Bax and cytochrome c induced by TGEV N protein. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV infection-induced p53 activation and cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis occurrence.","Ding, Li; Huang, Yong; Du, Qian; Dong, Feng; Zhao, Xiaomin; Zhang, Wenlong; Xu, Xingang; Tong, Dewen",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548406/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X14002915; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X14002915,471

659342,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity: When is it Safe to Discontinue Isolation?,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic the Dutch government implemented its so-called ‘intelligent lockdown’ in which people were urged to leave their homes as little as possible and work from home. This life changing event may have caused changes in lifestyle behaviour, an important factor in the onset and course of diseases. The overarching aim of this study is to determine life-style related changes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. METHODS: Life-style related changes were studied among a random representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands using an online survey conducted from 22 to 27 May 2020. Differences in COVID-19-related lifestyle changes between Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) users and non-CAM users were determined. The survey included a modified version of the I-CAM-Q and 26 questions on lifestyle related measures, anxiety, and need for support to maintain lifestyle changes. RESULTS: 1004 respondents were included in the study, aged between 18 and 88 years (50.7% females). Changes to a healthier lifestyle were observed in 19.3% of the population, mainly due to a change in diet habits, physical activity and relaxation, of whom 56.2% reported to be motivated to maintain this behaviour change in a post-COVID-19 era. Fewer respondents (12.3%) changed into an unhealthier lifestyle. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that changing into a healthier lifestyle was positively associated with the variables ‘Worried/Anxious getting COVID-19’ (OR: 1.56, 95% C.I. 1.26–1.93), ‘CAM use’ (OR: 2.04, 95% C.I. 1.38–3.02) and ‘stress in relation to financial situation’ (OR: 1.89, 95% C.I. 1.30–2.74). ‘Age’ (OR 18–25: 1.00, OR 25–40: 0.55, 95% C.I. 0.31–0.96, OR 40–55:0.50 95% C.I. 0.28–0.87 OR 55+: 0.1095% C.I. 0.10–0.33), ‘stress in relation to health’ (OR: 2.52, 95% C.I. 1.64–3.86) and ‘stress in relation to the balance work and home’ (OR: 1.69, 95% C.I. 1.11–2.57) were found predicting the change into an unhealthier direction. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the coronavirus crisis resulted in a healthier lifestyle in one part and, to a lesser extent, in an unhealthier lifestyle in another part of the Dutch population. Further studies are warranted to see whether this behavioural change is maintained over time, and how different lifestyle factors can affect the susceptibility for and the course of COVID-19.

Present review focused on the application of the convalescent plasma (CP) therapy as a quick remediation of the disease severity. RECENT FINDINGS: While several drugs have been repurposed based on a number of completed clinical trials together with a huge ongoing effort to develop appropriate vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the therapeutic approach of the CP therapy appears to be one of the effective methods to rescue the severely affected COVID-19 patients. Such a therapy based on passive immunity evolved from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19; and hence these individuals are quite likely to possess high titers of the SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing immunoglobulins (antibodies). However, there are some risks such therapy, and its effectivity also appeared doubtful in some cases. Thus, the current review discussed the issues raised by the administration of such plasma into the SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. SUMMARY: Application of CP therapy has been conducted since long time; and for the mitigation of COVID-19 severity, such pharmaceutical strategy is also being employed in spite of several risks which actually can be monitored as well as optimized in order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Noor, Rashed; Tasnim, Nishat; Saha, Chandrika",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249604/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-021-00174-8,471

Misophonia is a complex neurophysiological and behavioral disorder of multifactorial origin, characterized by an intense physiological and emotional response produced by intolerance to auditory stimuli of the same pattern, regardless of physical properties. The present work studied the secondary impact that strict confinement caused in 342 adults (224 women: 118 men) regularly attending a medical psychological center in Barcelona. Misophonia, usually underdiagnosed, showed a prevalence of 35%, the same for women (37%) than men (31%). A retrospective analysis using a physical-psychological-social inventory of 10 variables evaluated the number of individuals that during confinement and self-confinement (March 11 - June 29, 2020) canceled (mostly M-) and/or requested a therapeutic intervention, the reasons for their request, and the strategies they used to self-manage the situation. Ten main variables indicated that the confinement exponentially increased the effects of misophonia compared with results from the same individuals during the last quarter of 2019. Most people diagnosed with misophonia continued with tele-assistance during the confinement because of this impact's self-concern. Besides the impacts as part of the general population, M+ also developed different symptoms causing significant personal, social, and job/occupational imbalance, as compared to M-. Health, fears, conflicts with neighbors, study-related difficulties were outstanding reasons for consultations. The LSB-50 test for ‘Psychological and Psychosomatic Symptoms’ applied to M+ revealed the increase of 8 of 9 items of this psychopathological test. Sleep disorders (coronasomnia), hostility, depression, and somatization were more severe than in previous assessments. Women presented the worst psychological and psychosomatic states (eight out of nine, as compared to one out of nine in males). The study unveiled the complex physical-psychological-social burden, the need for dissemination and a gender perspective to understand the secondary impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the population with misophonia. The results also show that in this new COVID era people suffering from misophonia need to develop coping strategies addressing modifiable risk and protective factors.

Although PEDV vaccines based on classical PEDV strains have been widely used in China in recent years, the morbidity and mortality in piglets remain high. Therefore, virulent genotype GII PEDV strains that are prevalent in the field should be isolated and used to develop next-generation vaccines. In the present study, a Chinese virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain, CH/HNPJ/2017, was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 90 passages. The S genes contained typical insertions and deletions that were also found in other recently isolated highly virulent PEDV strains from China and other countries and had two neighboring unique insertion mutations, which resulted in four amino acid changes in the S1 region of passages P10 and P60. Pig infection studies revealed that the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain was highly virulent in piglets, and the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD(50)) was 7.68 log(10)PDD(50)/3 mL. Furthermore, the cell-adapted CH/HNPJ/2017 strain elicited potent serum IgG and neutralizing antibody responses in immunized pigs when it was used as an inactivated vaccine candidate. In addition, the pigs that received the experimental inactivated vaccines were partially protected (3/5) against subsequent viral challenge. In brief, these data indicate that the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain is a promising candidate for developing a safe and effective PEDV vaccine in the future.","Liu, Xinsheng; Zhang, Qiaoling; Zhang, Liping; Zhou, Peng; Yang, Jun; Fang, Yuzhen; Dong, Zhaoliang; Zhao, Donghong; Li, Weiyan; Feng, Jiaxin; Cui, Baofeng; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.10.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218305434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342075/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218305434,471

In the first study, 96 newborn calves were allocated to four different groups immediately after birth. Calves of group H and of group HN were treated orally with 120 μg/kg body weight (BW) of halofuginone lactate daily during the first seven days of life. Calves of group C and of group CN were treated with a same volume of tap water. As an additional measure, the pens of groups HN and CN were disinfected with 3% Neopredisan 135-1(®)(p-chloro-m-cresol), the pens of groups C and H remained non-disinfected. Faeces were examined semi-quantitatively for oocyst excretion using carbolfuchsin-staining and the clinical course was recorded. While disinfection alone (group CN) had no effect on oocyst shedding and diarrhoea, treatment with halofuginone lactate (groups H and HN) reduced oocyst shedding and diarrhoea significantly. Combination of treatment and disinfection (group HN) controlled cryptosporidiosis completely during the first two weeks after birth. However, prevalence of diarrhoea and oocyst shedding was higher in the third week of life in group HN than in any of the other groups. This delayed occurrence of cryptosporidiosis was not seen in study 2 when all calves were similarly protected by treatment and specific disinfection. Oocyst shedding was not observed in peripartal cows either by carbolfuchsin staining, ELISA or PCR.","Keidel, Judith; Daugschies, Arwid",Vet Parasitol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401713001441; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23561324/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401713001441,471

It contains the classes of susceptible individuals, exposed, infected symptomatic and asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized and recovered. The basic reproduction number and the final size of epidemic are determined. The model is used to fit available data for some European countries. A more detailed model with two different subclasses of susceptible individuals is introduced in order to study the influence of social interaction on the disease progression. The coefficient of social interaction $K$ characterizes the level of social contacts in comparison with complete lockdown (K=0) and the absence of lockdown (K=1). The fitting of data shows that the actual level of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.","Sharma, S.; Volpert, V.; Banerjee, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20171439v1?rss=1,471

However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of viral load and host immune response throughout the disease course depending on disease severity. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed viral load, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, and cytokines/chemokines during the disease course, and identified the factors related to severity. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and plasma specimens were obtained from 31 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Viral RNA in NP specimens was quantified by reverse transcription–PCR. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokines/chemokines in plasma specimens were analyzed by ELISA and cytometric bead array. The viral load in patients with COVID-19 peaked at the early stage of the disease and continuously decreased. Severe and critical cases showed higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding than asymptomatic and mild cases. Whereas plasma IgG was gradually increased and maintained during hospitalization, plasma IgM peaked at 3 weeks after symptom onset and dissipated. The antibody response in severe and critical cases was slightly delayed but stronger than those in others. High levels of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-γ–induced protein-10, monokine induced by IFN-γ, and interleukin-6 at 5–10 days from symptom onset were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our data indicate that high viral load in the respiratory tract and excessive production of cytokines and chemokines between 1 and 2 weeks from the symptom onset were significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Kwon, Ji-Soo; Kim, Ji Yeun; Kim, Min-Chul; Park, Se Yoon; Kim, Baek-Nam; Bae, Seongman; Cha, Hye Hee; Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Min-Jae; Lee, Myung Jin; Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Kim, Sung-Han",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124544/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1110,471

However, research has found the Dark Triad can also be related to forms of organizational commitment which underpin positive work behaviors, including engaging in tasks and duties beyond those required (i.e., “going above and beyond”). Professional commitment is a broader form of commitment that has been found to be significantly related to organizational commitment, sharing antecedents, and having similar outcomes. Professional commitment, the affective, normative, and continuance commitment toward one's profession or occupation, has the benefit of applying to individuals employed by organizations as well as those working for themselves or between jobs. In this research, we explore relationships between professional commitment, using previous research on the relationship between the dark triad traits of Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism and organizational commitment, as a basis for predictions. We also explored two forms of precarious employment (career interruptions and part-time or casual work) as possible moderators of the dark triad-professional commitment relationship. Participants were 184 Australian professionals (52.2% men), a slight majority of whom had experienced a career interruption (69.6%) or a year or more of part-time or casual employment (70.7%). The results showed that psychopathy had a negative association with affective commitment, whereas Machiavellianism was positively related to normative commitment, and narcissism was positively related to normative and continuance commitment. Using regression analysis, we found that among individuals who have worked in part-time/casual employment longer, Machiavellianism and psychopathy had significantly stronger negative associations with affective commitment. In contrast, among individuals who have had a significant career interruption, Machiavellianism had significantly stronger positive association with continuance commitment. These findings help expand our understanding of both the dark triad and its contingent impact on workers' attachment to their profession.","Kaufmann, Leah M.; Wheeler, Melissa A.; Sojo, Victor E.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354634/,471

The disease is highly contagious and transmitted mainly by droplets or close contact. As the global incidence of COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, health systems worldwide started to suffer in terms of its capability to manage affected people and the ability to provide standard treatment for critically ill patients in a safe environment. As Medical staff has extensive contact with patients, families as well as other health care providers, they are very likely to cause cross-infection.

However, how the S1 subunit undergoes conformational changes for receptor recognition has not been elucidated in Alphacoronavirus. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HCoV-229E S trimer in prefusion state with two conformations. The activated conformation may pose the potential exposure of the S1-RBDs by decreasing of the interaction area between the S1-RBDs and the surrounding S1-NTDs and S1-RBDs compared to the closed conformation. Furthermore, structural comparison of our structures with the previously reported HCoV-229E S structure showed that the S trimers trended to open the S2 subunit from the closed conformation to open conformation, which could promote the transition from pre- to postfusion. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in S glycoprotein-mediated Alphacoronavirus entry and have implications for vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.","Song, Xiyong; Shi, Yuejun; Ding, Wei; Niu, Tongxin; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Chen, Yong; Shi, Jiale; Xiong, Qiqi; Huang, Xiaojun; Xiao, Shaobo; Zhu, Yanping; Cheng, Chongyun; Fu, Zhen F.; Liu, Zhi-Jie; Peng, Guiqing",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420048/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20401-y,471

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed for a five-week period from 20 March 2020 and the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 infection, perioperative pulmonary complications, time to theatre, type of anaesthesia, operation, grade of surgeon, fracture type, postoperative intensive care admission, venous thromboembolism, dislocation, infection rates, and length of stay. RESULTS: In all, 76 patients with hip fractures were identified in each group. All patients had 30-day follow-up. There was no difference in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification or residence at time of injury. However, three in each group were not fit for surgery. No significant difference was found in 30-day mortality; ten patients (13%) in 2019 and 11 patients (14%) in 2020 (p = 0.341). In the 2020 cohort, ten patients tested positive for COVID-19, two (20%) of whom died. There was no significant increase in postoperative pulmonary complications. Median time to theatre was 20 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 16 to 25) in 2019 versus 23 hours (IQR 18 to 30) in 2020 (p = 0.130). Regional anaesthesia increased from 24 (33%) cases in 2019 to 46 (63%) cases in 2020, but ten (14%) required conversion to general anaesthesia. In both groups, 53 (70%) operations were done by trainees. Hemiarthroplasty for 31 B type fractures was the most common operation.

The epidemic quickly spread, causing a worldwide pandemic. Scientists and clinicians across the globe have shifted their research efforts towards understanding the virus itself and its epidemiology. CASE SUMMARY: In mid-January 2020, a Chinese family made a visit to a local city, and within the next 2 wk one after another fell ill with COVID-19. At the beginning of their first illness onset, the family had eaten in a restaurant, which led to the subsequent illness onset in another two families. All cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 by real-time fluorescent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Epidemiological investigation showed that the transmission chain was complete. CONCLUSION: This chain of social exposure highlights the danger of group aggregative behavior for spread of COVID-19.","Zuo, Hui; Hu, Zhi-Bing; Zhu, Feng",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i1.170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511181/,471
682879,Medical residents’ attitudes and emotions related to Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study,2017-08-11,"(1) Background: The scientific development in the field of industrialization demands the automization of electronic shelf labels (ESLs). COVID-19 has limited the manpower responsible for the frequent updating of the ESL system. The current ESL uses QR (quick response) codes, NFC (near-field communication), and RFID (radio-frequency identification). These technologies have a short range or need more manpower. LoRa is one of the prominent contenders in this category as it provides long-range connectivity with less energy harvesting and location tracking. It uses many gateways (GWs) to transmit the same data packet to a node, which causes collision at the receiver side. The restriction of the duty cycle (DC) and dependency of acknowledgment makes it unsuitable for use by the common person. The maximum efficiency of pure ALOHA is 18.4%, while that of slotted ALOHA is 36.8%, which makes LoRa unsuitable for industrial use. It can be used for applications that need a low data rate, i.e., up to approximately 27 Kbps. The ALOHA mechanism can cause inefficiency by not eliminating fast saturation even with the increasing number of gateways. The increasing number of gateways can only improve the global performance for generating packets with Poisson law having a uniform distribution of payload of 1~51 bytes. The maximum expected channel capacity usage is similar to the pure ALOHA throughput. (2) Methods: In this paper, the improved ALOHA mechanism is used, which is based on the orthogonal combination of spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth (BW), to maximize the throughput of LoRa for ESL. The varying distances (D) of the end nodes (ENs) are arranged based on the K-means machine learning algorithm (MLA) using the parameter selection principle of ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) regulation with a 1% DC for transmission to minimize the saturation. (3) Results: The performance of the improved ALOHA degraded with the increasing number of SFs and as well ENs. However, after using K-mapping, the network changes and the different number of gateways had a greater impact on the probability of successful transmission. The saturation decreased from 57% to 1~2% by using MLA. The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) plays a key role in determining the exact position of the ENs, which helps to improve the possibility of successful transmission and synchronization at higher BW (250 kHz). In addition, a high BW has lower energy consumption than a low BW at the same DC with a double-bit rate and almost half the ToA (time on-air).","Khan, Malak Abid Ali; Ma, Hongbin; Aamir, Syed Muhammad; Jin, Ying",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21155060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372295/,471

The aim of the study was the identification of psychological predictors on COVID-19 prevention behavior in women, across four generations. In addition, the predictive role of the psychological variables was explored through the lens of negative and positive information processing perspective on total and domain-specific COVID-19 prevention behavior. METHODS: A cross-sectional research was conducted. The sample included 834 Hungarian speaking women. The assessed variables were: COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, COVID-19 health anxiety, negative automatic thoughts, psychological flexibility, and four domains of COVID-19 prevention behavior (social distancing, general hygiene, information seeking, health behavior). A three-level hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the predictors of preventive behavior in each generation. RESULTS: A diversity across generations was found. In case of baby boomer generation, the final model explained 32.4% of the variance for total prevention behavior [F(14,215) = 8.847, p < 0.001], and only perceived risk made a significant contribution. For Gen X the final model accounted for 21.1% of variance of total prevention behavior [F(14,341) = 7.788, p < 0.001], marital status, perceived risk, COVID-19 health anxiety, and negative automatic thoughts made significant contributions. In case of Gen Y the final model accounted for 6.2% of variance on total prevention behavior [F(14,147) = 1.761, p = 0.05], only perceived risk had a contribution to the final model. For Gen Z the final model accounted for 23.4% of variance on total preventive behavior [F(13,71) = 2.979, p = 0.002], and only psychological flexibility made a contribution to the model. The results on the distinct domains of COVID-19 prevention behavior emphasized details in the dissimilarity among generations. CONCLUSION: The role of generational identity on COVID-19 prevention behavior is relevant. The coexistence of negative and positive information processing may have its beneficial role in certain areas of prevention.","Marschalko, Eszter Eniko; Kotta, Ibolya; Kalcza-Janosi, Kinga; Szabo, Kinga; Jancso-Farcas, Susana",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574787/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.596543,471

688264,Association of human leukocyte antigen class II alleles with severe Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus infection,2016,"Current diagnostics are insufficient for diagnosis and prognosis of acute infections and sepsis. Clinical decisions including prescription and timing of antibiotics, ordering of additional diagnostics and level-of-care decisions rely on understanding etiology and implications of a clinical presentation. Host mRNA signatures can differentiate infectious from noninfectious etiologies, bacterial from viral infections, and predict 30-day mortality. The 29-host-mRNA blood-based InSep(TM) test (Inflammatix, Burlingame, CA, formerly known as HostDx(TM) Sepsis) combines machine learning algorithms with a rapid point-of-care platform with less than 30 min turnaround time to enable rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis, as well as prediction of disease severity. A scientific advisory panel including emergency medicine, infectious disease, intensive care and clinical pathology physicians discussed technical and clinical requirements in preparation of successful introduction of InSep into the market. Topics included intended use; patient populations of greatest need; patient journey and sample flow in the emergency department (ED) and beyond; clinical and biomarker-based decision algorithms; performance characteristics for clinical utility; assay and instrument requirements; and result readouts. The panel identified clear demand for a solution like InSep, requirements regarding test performance and interpretability, and a need for focused medical education due to the innovative but complex nature of the result readout.

690319,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: A Case-Control Study of Hospitalized Patients,2014-07-15,"After the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in China in late 2019, a pandemic evolved that has claimed millions of lives so far. While about 80 % of infections cause mild or moderate COVID-19 disease, some individuals show a severe progression or even die. Most countries are far from achieving herd-immunity, however, the first approved vaccines offer hope for containment of the virus. Although much is known about the virus, there is a lack of information on the immunity of convalescent individuals. We here evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in 41 COVID-19 convalescents. As previous studies mostly included younger individuals, one advantage of our study is the comparatively high mean age of the convalescents included in the cohort considered (54 {+/-} 8.4 years). While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still detectable in 95 % of convalescents up to 8 months post infection, an antibody-decay over time was generally observed in most donors. Using a multiplex assay, our data additionally reveal that most convalescents exhibit a broad humoral immunity against different viral epitopes. We demonstrate by flow cytometry that convalescent donors show a significantly elevated number of natural killer cells when compared to healthy controls, while no differences were found concerning other leucocyte subpopulations. We detected a specific long-lasting cellular immune response in convalescents by stimulating immune cells with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, membrane and nucleocapsid protein, and measuring interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) release thereafter. We modified a commercially available ELISA assay for IFN-{gamma} determination in whole-blood specimens of COVID-19 convalescents. One advantage of this assay is that it does not require special equipment and can, thus, be performed in any standard laboratory. In conclusion, our study adds knowledge regarding the persistence of immunity of convalescents suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19. Moreover, our study provides a set of simple methods to characterize and confirm experienced COVID-19.","Fischer, B.; Lindenkamp, C.; Lichtenberg, C.; Birschmann, I.
