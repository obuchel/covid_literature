Hospitalized patients with CAP were grouped according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI), as non-severe (PSI < 91 points) or severe (PSI ≥ 91 points). Blood and sputum samples were collected upon admission. Compared to non-severe CAP patients, the severe CAP group showed higher plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines but in contrast, lower sputum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Blood neutrophil functional responses were elevated in CAP patients compared to healthy controls. However, neutrophils from severe CAP patients showed reduced respiratory burst activity compared to the non-severe group. Results indicate that patients with severe CAP fail to mount a robust local pro-inflammatory response but exhibit instead a more substantial systemic inflammatory response, suggesting that a key driver of CAP severity may be the ability of the patient to generate an optimal local inflammatory response.

The combination therapy of methotrexate (MTX) and Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) is commonly used. Patients with RA are at increased risk of malignancy, however, it remains unclear whether the combination therapy is associated with a higher risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the malignancy risk among patients with RA receiving combination therapy of JAKi and MTX compared to MTX alone. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane and Embase were thoroughly searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with RA receiving JAKi and MTX, from inception to July 2020. Primary endpoints were malignancy events, Non melanomatous skin cancer (NMSC) and malignancy excluding NMSC and secondary endpoints were serious adverse events (SAE), deaths. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect method. RESULTS: 659 publications were screened and 13 RCTs with a total of 6911 patients were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in malignancy [RR = 1.42; 95% CI (0.59, 3.41)], neither NMSC [RR = 1.44 (0.36, 5.76)] nor malignancies excluding NMSC [RR = 1.12 (0.40, 3.13)]. No statistically significant difference between the two groups for SAE [RR = 1.15 (0.90, 1.47)] and deaths [RR = 1.99 (0.75, 5.27)] was found. CONCLUSION: The adjunction of JAKi to MTX is not associated with an increased risk of malignancy when compared to MTX alone. There is no increased risk of SAE and deaths when compared to MTX alone in patients with RA.

Numerous studies have linked severe early childhood infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to the development of wheezing and asthma, although the underlying mechanisms connecting these observations remain unclear. Here, we examine airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that develops in wild-type mice after recovery from symptomatic but sublethal infection with the natural rodent pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). We found that BALB/c mice respond to a limited inoculum of PVM with significant but reversible weight loss accompanied by virus replication, acute inflammation, and neutrophil recruitment to the airways. At day 21 post-inoculation, virus was no longer detected in the airways and the acute inflammatory response had largely resolved. However, and in contrast to most earlier studies using the PVM infection model, all mice survived the initial infection and all went on to develop serum anti-PVM IgG antibodies. Furthermore, using both invasive plethysmography and precision-cut lung slices, we found that these mice exhibited significant airway hyperresponsiveness at day 21 post-inoculation that persisted through day 45. Taken together, our findings extend an important and versatile respiratory virus infection model that can now be used to explore the role of virions and virion clearance as well as virus-induced inflammatory mediators and their signaling pathways in the development and persistence of post-viral AHR and lung dysfunction.","Limkar, Ajinkya R.; Percopo, Caroline M.; Redes, Jamie L.; Druey, Kirk M.; Rosenberg, Helene F.",Viruses,463,1

Several studies have linked DNAmAA to morbidity and mortality, yet its relationship with kidney function has not been assessed. We evaluated the associations between seven DNAm aging and lifespan predictors (as well as GrimAge components) and five kidney traits (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [uACR], serum urate, microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease [CKD]) in up to 9688 European, African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals from seven population-based studies. RESULTS: We identified 23 significant associations in our large trans-ethnic meta-analysis (p < 1.43E−03 and consistent direction of effect across studies). Age acceleration measured by the Extrinsic and PhenoAge estimators, as well as Zhang’s 10-CpG epigenetic mortality risk score (MRS), were associated with all parameters of poor kidney health (lower eGFR, prevalent CKD, higher uACR, microalbuminuria and higher serum urate). Six of these associations were independently observed in European and African American populations. MRS in particular was consistently associated with eGFR (β = − 0.12, 95% CI = [− 0.16, − 0.08] change in log-transformed eGFR per unit increase in MRS, p = 4.39E−08), prevalent CKD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 [1.47, 2.16], p = 2.71E-09) and higher serum urate levels (β = 0.12 [0.07, 0.16], p = 2.08E−06). The “first-generation” clocks (Hannum, Horvath) and GrimAge showed different patterns of association with the kidney traits. Three of the DNAm-estimated components of GrimAge, namely adrenomedullin, plasminogen-activation inhibition 1 and pack years, were positively associated with higher uACR, serum urate and microalbuminuria. CONCLUSION: DNAmAge acceleration and DNAm mortality predictors estimated in whole blood were associated with multiple kidney traits, including eGFR and CKD, in this multi-ethnic study. Epigenetic biomarkers which reflect the systemic effects of age-related mechanisms such as immunosenescence, inflammaging and oxidative stress may have important mechanistic or prognostic roles in kidney disease. Our study highlights new findings linking kidney disease to biological aging, and opportunities warranting future investigation into DNA methylation biomarkers for prognostic or risk stratification in kidney disease.

Moreover, little is known about the relationship between health and the types of DIT use in older ethnic minority and migrant populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the associations among depressive symptoms and self-rated health (SRH) with different dimensions of DIT use in older migrants. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Care, Health and Ageing of Russian-speaking Minority (CHARM) study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling, Russian-speaking adults aged 50 years or older residing permanently in Finland (men: 616/1082, 56.93%; age: mean 63.2 years, SD 8.4 years; response rate: 1082/3000, 36.07%). Data were collected in 2019 using a postal survey. Health was measured using depressive symptoms (measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and SRH. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the two health indicators and the following six outcomes: daily internet use, smartphone ownership, the use of the internet for messages and calls, social media use, the use of the internet for personal health data, and obtaining health information from the internet. A number of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the logistic regression regression analysis. Analyses were performed with weights accounting for the survey design and nonresponse. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.37-5.24; P=.004) and poor SRH (OR 7.90, 95% CI 1.88-33.11; P=.005) were associated with a higher likelihood of not using the internet daily. Depressive symptoms (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35; P=.03) and poor SRH (OR 5.05, 95% CI 1.58-16.19; P=.006) also increased the likelihood of smartphone nonuse. Depressive symptoms were additionally associated with a lower likelihood of social media use, and poor SRH was associated with a lower likelihood of using the internet for messaging and calling. CONCLUSIONS: Poor SRH and depressive symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of DIT use in older adults.

Switzerland started a national mandatory control programme in 2008 aiming to eradicate BVD from the Swiss cattle population. The peculiar biology of pestiviruses with the birth of persistently infected (PI) animals upon in utero infection in addition to transient infection of naïve animals requires vertical and horizontal transmission to be taken into account. Initially, every animal was tested for PI within the first year, followed by testing for the presence of virus in all newborn calves for the next four years. Prevalence of calves being born PI thus diminished substantially from around 1.4% to <0.02%, which enabled broad testing for the virus to be abandoned and switching to economically more favourable serological surveillance with vaccination being prohibited. By the end of 2020, more than 99.5% of all cattle farms in Switzerland were free of BVDV but eliminating the last remaining PI animals turned out to be a tougher nut to crack. In this review, we describe the Swiss BVD eradication scheme and the hurdles that were encountered and still remain during the implementation of the programme. The main challenge is to rapidly identify the source of infection in case of a positive result during antibody surveillance, and to efficiently protect the cattle population from re-infection, particularly in light of the endemic presence of the related pestivirus border disease virus (BDV) in sheep. As a consequence of these measures, complete eradication will (hopefully) soon be achieved, and the final step will then be the continuous documentation of freedom of disease.","Schweizer, Matthias; Stalder, Hanspeter; Haslebacher, Anja; Grisiger, Martin; Schwermer, Heinzpeter; Di Labio, Elena",Front Vet Sci,463,1

The decision to perform bronchoscopy and BAL should be guided by clinical presentation and the patient’s status as well as local technical expertise, both in performing the procedure and in interpreting the results. An important problem with interpreting BAL results is the variability between centers, which highlights the importance of following standard protocols. There is a need for a consensus statement among experts to provide guidelines for the utility of BAL cellular analyses in clinical practice. A number of specific conditions, such as some rare diseases, malignancy, and infections, can be diagnosed by BAL analyses. In such cases, more invasive procedures can be avoided. Even when nondiagnostic, BAL cellular analysis usually adds valuable information to the clinical and radiological data and helps to narrow the differential diagnosis. On the other hand, the diagnostic usefulness of BAL in interstitial lung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is limited. An important issue of BAL in this setting is exclusion of other diseases as sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. BAL is an invaluable research tool for ILD, providing information regarding immune effector cells that accumulate in the alveoli and their noncellular products. With the increasing availability of proteomics, the importance of biomarkers of ILD will hopefully become clear in the near future. It is essential that BAL findings be interpreted by experts in the context of clinical and radiological data.","Stanzel, Franz",Principles and Practice of Interventional Pulmonology,463,1

However, many variables need to be considered in performing a reliable PCR assay, ranging from nucleic acid extraction, storage, composition of the PCR reaction mix used, to the dynamics of the amplification reaction. To control for these variables, there is an obvious need for standardised reagents and quality assurance programmes to obtain reproducible and clinically significant results. The diagnostic potential of the PCR technology has been greatly enhanced with the development of multiplex, real-time, and quantitative PCR methods, and these are now routinely performed in many diagnostic laboratories. More recently, PCR has been applied to bacterial typing, and a reasonable prediction is that in the near future, bacterial typing will be performed by either some variant of next-generation sequencing, or by HRM analysis of selected markers, depending on the amount of information required.","Carter, Ian; Halliday, Catriona; Sloots, Theo P.; Pryce, Todd M.; Kay, Ian D.; Harnett, Gerald B.; Chidlow, Glenys R.; Giffard, Philip M.",PCR for Clinical Microbiology,463,1
32106,32106,32106,Verhaltener Optimismus,11.508658,1.9626433,2020-05-06,"The use of nucleic acid tests (NAT) has dramatically enhanced the detection and management of blood-borne viruses. Some of the very first applications of NAT using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were in the identification of HIV in blood. The recognition of other blood-borne viruses, in particular hepatitis B and hepatitis C, further prompted the application of molecular tests to clinical medicine. It was the ease of transmission of viruses through blood and blood products that was one of the main stimuli for the development of nucleic acid testing (NAT) in virology. The improvements in technology leading to automation, reduction in contamination, quantitation and increased sensitivity have enhanced this development and are likely to continue and expand, and so further improve patient management – hopefully with reductions in cost. The introduction of these more sensitive NAT assays has further reduced the likelihood of the acquisition of blood-borne viruses during transfusion or transplantation. The development of commercial viral load assays, or quantitative NAT, has revolutionised for example the clinical management of HIV infection and of other systemic diseases (e.g. cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV-6, BK polyomavirus) that are a particular clinical issue in immunocompromised individuals (Table 6.1). Also, resistance genotyping tests can now be performed by sequencing the relevant drug targets e.g. HIV – most commonly the reverse transcriptase and protease regions, but now including integrase and envelope gp 41. Infections in immunocompromised patients may occur in the absence of classical symptoms and the use of PCR to diagnose, in a targeted fashion, the most common infections has revolutionised treatment of these infections in the immunocompromised patient. Knowledge of the most likely agents – for example, CMV in the first 3 months following bone marrow transplant, is often used because such reactivation infection is extremely common (and often fatal) in this population. The availability of polyoma virus PCR means a clinical transplant service is able to monitor their patients for polyoma virus and adjust the level of immunosuppression appropriately. The availability of rapid diagnosis for fungi or Pneumocystis means transplant clinical services can often reduce the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for these agents. Therefore, as a result of these rapid diagnostic nucleic acid testing services, clinical services can directly improve patient therapy, thereby reducing side effects and improving outcomes as well as saving money.","Dwyer, Dominic; Rawlinson, William",PCR for Clinical Microbiology,463,1

We define runway scenarios using the Scenic probabilistic programming language, and use them to drive tests in the X-Plane flight simulator. We first perform falsification, automatically finding environment conditions causing the system to violate its specification by deviating significantly from the centerline (or even leaving the runway entirely). Next, we use counterexample analysis to identify distinct failure cases, and confirm their root causes with specialized testing. Finally, we use the results of falsification and debugging to retrain the network, eliminating several failure cases and improving the overall performance of the closed-loop system.","Fremont, Daniel J.; Chiu, Johnathan; Margineantu, Dragos D.; Osipychev, Denis; Seshia, Sanjit A.",Computer Aided Verification,463,22

I argue that as we think about how education should be reimagined, it is paramount to continue efforts to make education more inclusive, fairer and equitable for all. I take some early examples from two distinct education systems, Australia and Finland, to highlight how disrupted teaching caused by school closures has had different impacts on schools and teachers.

KoRV is present as both an endogenous and exogenous infection in all koalas in northern Australia. KoRV has been linked to koala pathologies including neoplasia and increased susceptibility to Chlamydia. A KoRV vaccine recently trialled in 10 northern koalas improved antibody response and reduced viral load. This communication reports the expression of key immune genes underlining the innate and adaptive immune response to vaccination in these northern koalas. The results showed that prior to vaccination, IL-8 was expressed at the highest levels, with at least 200-fold greater expression compared to other cytokines, while CD8 mRNA expression was significantly higher than CD4 mRNA expression level. Interferon-γ was up-regulated at both 4- and 8-weeks post-vaccination while IL-8 was down-regulated at 8-weeks post-vaccination.","Olagoke, Olusola; Quigley, Bonnie L.; Timms, Peter",Virol J,463,30

These benefits have not been characterized in pediatric models and the effect of this ventilation mode on regional distribution of lung inflammation also remains controversial. Here, we compare structural, molecular and functional outcomes reflecting regional inflammation between PVV and conventional pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in a pediatric model of healthy lungs and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: New-Zealand White rabbit pups (n = 36, 670 ± 20 g [half-width 95% confidence interval]), with healthy lungs or after induction of ARDS, were randomized to five hours of mechanical ventilation with PCV or PVV. Regional lung aeration, inflammation and perfusion were assessed using x-ray computed tomography, positron-emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Ventilation parameters, blood gases and respiratory tissue elastance were recorded hourly. RESULTS: Mechanical ventilation worsened respiratory elastance in healthy and ARDS animals ventilated with PCV (11 ± 8%, 6 ± 3%, p < 0.04), however, this trend was improved by PVV (1 ± 4%, − 6 ± 2%). Animals receiving PVV presented reduced inflammation as assessed by lung normalized [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in healthy (1.49 ± 0.62 standardized uptake value, SUV) and ARDS animals (1.86 ± 0.47 SUV) compared to PCV (2.33 ± 0.775 and 2.28 ± 0.3 SUV, respectively, p < 0.05), particularly in the well and poorly aerated lung zones. No benefit of PVV could be detected on regional blood perfusion or blood gas parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Variable ventilation based on a physiological respiratory pattern, compared to conventional pressure-controlled ventilation, reduced global and regional inflammation in both healthy and injured lungs of juvenile rabbits.","Dos Santos Rocha, Andre; Fodor, Gergely H.; Kassai, Miklos; Degrugilliers, Loic; Bayat, Sam; Petak, Ferenc; Habre, Walid",Respir Res,463,1

Administration of enteral nutrition may be associated with signs of intolerance, such as high gastric residual volumes, diarrhea, and vomiting. Clinical trials regarding the effects of the mode of administration of enteral nutrition on the occurrence of these complications have yielded conflicting results. This trial aims to investigate whether the mode of administration of enteral nutrition affects the time to reach nutritional targets, intolerance, and complications. METHODS: COINN is a randomized, monocentric study for critically ill adult patients receiving enteral nutrition. Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups receiving (1) continuous or (2) intermittent administration of enteral nutrition. Enhancement of enteral nutrition will depend on signs of tolerance, mainly the gastric residual volume. The primary outcome will be the time to reach the energetic target. Secondary outcomes will be the time to reach the protein target, tolerance, complications, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, and 28-day mortality. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to evaluate whether the mode of application of enteral nutrition affects the time to reach nutritional targets, signs of intolerance, and complications.

Defective viral particles (DPs) can interfere with the replication of infectious viruses and stimulate the innate immune response of host cells. However, DPs arising from mast cells during HPAIV replication and their potent antiviral actions has not been reported. Here, we showed that the human mastocytoma cell line, HMC-1, allowed for the productive replication of the H5N1-HPAIV. Compared with alveolar cell line A549, DPs were propagated preferentially and abundantly in mast cells following IAV infection, which can be attributed to the wide existence of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) in HMC-1 cells. In addition, DPs generated in H5N1-infected cells could provide great therapeutic protection on mice to fight against various influenza A viruses, which included not only homologous H5N1-HPAIV, but also heterologous H1N1, H3N2, H7N2, and H9N2. Importantly, DPs generated in H5N1-infected HMC-1 cells could diminish viral virulence in vivo and in vitro by triggering a robust antiviral response through type II interferon signaling pathways. This study is the first to illustrate the arising of DPs in H5N1-HPAIV infected mast cells and explore their favorable ability to protect mice from influenza A viruses infection, which provides a novel insight and valuable information for the progress of new strategies to fight influenza A viruses infection, especially highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection by focusing on the DPs generated in mast cells.","Huo, Caiyun; Cheng, Jinlong; Xiao, Jin; Chen, Mingyong; Zou, Shumei; Tian, Haiyan; Wang, Ming; Sun, Lunquan; Hao, Zhihui; Hu, Yanxin",Front Microbiol,463,1

Scientific knowledge about the effect of behavior and welfare on animals' production augmented and made clear the need of improving their living conditions. Among the variables to monitor in dairy cattle farming, lying time represents a signal for health and welfare status as well as for milk production. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship among the lying behavior of dairy cows and milk production, body condition score (BCS), weather variables, and the temperature–humidity index (THI) in the barn from a dairy farm located in Northern Italy. One-year data were collected on this farm with sensors that allowed monitoring of the environmental conditions in the barn and the activity of primiparous lactating cows. Principal components analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), generalized linear model select (GLMSelect), and logistic analysis (LA) were carried out to get the relationships among variables. Among the main results, it emerges that the effect of weather parameters is quite restrained, except for THI > 70, which negatively affects the lying time. In addition, the most productive cows are found to lie down more than the less productive ones, and the parameters of milk production, lying time, and BCS are found to be linked by a similar trend.","Lovarelli, Daniela; Tamburini, Alberto; Mattachini, Gabriele; Zucali, Maddalena; Riva, Elisabetta; Provolo, Giorgio; Guarino, Marcella",Front Vet Sci,463,1

Specifically, we examine what varieties of ethnographic research methods offer, as well as what limitations these methods bring if adopted within migrant entrepreneurship research. We argue that specific ethnographic practice-based methods have the capacity to reveal the rich social context of migrant entrepreneurship, which can supplement the theoretical perspectives. We adopt two illustrations to highlight the relevance of ethnographic methodologies to studying migrant entrepreneurship. The contribution this study offers is in suggesting new methods that allow fresh understanding of the complex narratives of migration dynamics to emerge. This study shows how narratives intertwine with migrants’ stories of entrepreneurship and offers guidance for future research.","Vershinina, Natalia; Cruz, Allan Discua",Int Entrep Manag J,463,1

We seek to measure these deficits against a set of core normative principles rooted in ILO standards which we believe underpin labour law as a discipline of worker protection. We look first at the exploitation of critical workers; second at the failure generally to make adequate provision for income security; and third at issues relating to health and safety at work. Our consideration of these issues addresses both the substantive law and the means for its enforcement. Having considered the systemic failures and lack of resilience of British labour law in this article, we intend to return to the theme in Part II at a later date to address the lessons learned and the overhaul which the pandemic has revealed to be necessary.","Ewing, K D; Hendy, Lord",,463,1

The aim of the study, which was conducted in low fidelity simulation conditions, was to assess the performance and the efficiency of a hand-rubbing disinfection technique among nursing students on the last day of their course. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in a group of 190 nursing students studying at the Jagiellonian University and it focused on the performed hand-rubbing disinfection procedure. The accuracy of the task performance was assessed by measuring the percentage of the amount of Fluo-Rub (B. Braun) fluorescent alcohol-based gel remaining on students’ hands after disinfection. The gel was rubbed into particular hand parts including four surfaces (left palm, right palm, left back and right back) divided into thirteen areas (I–XIII) and each surface was examined separately. The results were then dichotomized based on the cut-off point of 10% and two categories: “clean” and “dirty” were established. Additionally, the range of negligence in the disinfection procedure was assessed by counting the total number of the areas classified as “dirty”. The comparison of continuous and categorical variables was conducted by means of Friedman’s and Cochrane’s tests, respectively. Results: It was found out that the palm surfaces that were commonly missed during hand disinfection included the whole thumb (I and VI), the fingertip of the little finger (V) and the midpalm (XIII), whereas in the case of back surfaces (on both right and left hand) the most commonly missed areas were the fingertips and the whole thumb I–VI. Only 30 students (13%) had all 52 areas of both hands completely clean, whereas more than one third—66 students (33%)—failed to disinfect properly more than 10 areas out of all assessed ones on the surfaces of both hands. Conclusions: In the examined group of nursing students, a significant lack of compliance with hand disinfection procedures was observed and it was related mainly to thumbs and back parts of both hands. Therefore, it is essential to conduct systematic training sessions and assessment of hand hygiene procedures for nursing students at the end of every educational stage as it can lead to their developing these skills properly.","Gniadek, Agnieszka; Ogórek-Tęcza, Beata; Inglot, Anna; Nowacka, Anna; Micek, Agnieszka",Int J Environ Res Public Health,463,13

The chapter begins with a description of the research methodology. Then we discuss our findings in the Greek context by appealing to socio-economic analyses. The element that stands out is that family matters. However, the economic crisis of the past decade has undeniably impacted the employability of young adults, their school-to-work transition and the role of the family. Our findings suggest that young adults in Greece may already be reacting to the changes imposed by the current crises by inducing them to explore possibilities and shape new ways of economic production and social reproduction. The question is whether these new ways can ensure young people’s employability, economic self-sufficiency and well-being at the individual and collective levels, or merely reproduce past “visions and divisions” of society, leading to social unrest and political instability.

The information presented focuses mainly on CROs in North America where it is estimated that around 100 different CROs have existed over time, but many of these have either terminated operations or have been acquired by other organizations, primarily larger CROs. In addition, with the passing of so many key players from those organizations over time, it was almost impossible to gather information for many CROs. Furthermore, some larger CROs declined the opportunity of sharing the requested historical information about their organizations due to confidential issues which the author found to be disappointing. Nevertheless, the author believes that in the absence of any previously published history of the CRO industry, the information presented in this chapter is useful and portrays a meaningful history of this industry.

Historically, economic systems have been assessed by the products and techniques of production and how they are distributed, today with capitalism predominant and with mounting inequality within every society. Under global capitalism, ownership of land and productive capital is chiefly in private hands, with the role of the state fiercely debated with continual attempts seeking to restrain its oversight. Social justice in more liberal advanced societies has been championed over time, but the rise of finance capital and its presence in corporate-dominated economies has emerged with a massive concentration of ownership in almost every sector of the American economy. With its tendency toward managerial and administrative quantifications to fix existing flaws in the system, neoclassical economics has prevailed; few alternative or opposing perspectives rarely get debated. Thus, the overall structure is taken as a given and immutable. Global efforts toward privatization and monopolization mark the current stage of development. The institutional structure of American health care became elaborated under this system of capitalism and reflects much of the larger political economy. As seen in the medical-industrial complex, we are now witnessing a corporate takeover of the supply industries, insurance sector, and provider segments for their profit-making possibilities.

It outlines a range of developments which mean that public policy and practice urgently require a richer knowledge base and suggests that a fuller understanding of co-production must embrace its key characteristics, namely that it is holistic, contextual, multi-faceted, bridge-building, creative, dynamic, complex, emergent, behaviour-influencing and tacitly understood. It summarises key research recommendations from each chapter of the Handbook, highlighting the potential for a long-term systematic research programme into weakly-evidenced aspects of co-production. It then outlines how co-production might be evaluated, focusing on the whole causal chain from co-production inputs to outcomes. Finally, it explores a more creative approach to this research agenda, incorporating action research and tapping of tacit knowledge.","Bovaird, Tony; Loeffler, Elke",The Palgrave Handbook of Co-Production of Public Services and Outcomes,463,1

Analysing the 2008 wave of the European Social Survey, we find that most European populations share a preference for applying the equality principle to unemployment benefits. But they are divided over applying equity and equality for pension schemes. Individual determinants of preferences confirm that the ‘haves’ generally prefer equity over equality, while the ‘have-nots’ prefer the need principle more. At the country level, cross-national variation in redistribution preferences is low for unemployment benefits and cannot be explained by relevant context factors; preferences for pension redistribution depends upon its institutional design and social expenditure: welfare generosity curbs the preference for equity.","Reeskens, Tim; van Oorschot, Wim",Equality,463,1

First, the upsurge in consolidation is revealed through the merger and acquisition activity of each segment of the industry: pharmaceutical firms, insurers, hospitals and health systems, and the more recent intensely pharmacy benefit managers. Ongoing federal subsidizations are examined to show the attractiveness for investment in health care for mighty lucrative returns. This incentive structure remains even while Republican efforts to restrain spending are chiefly targeting the indigent, seniors, and seriously ill rather than the connected, powerfully entrenched vested interests in health care. Employer reactions to persistent cost escalation are also examined with implications to workers’ benefits and further rationalization of medicine and health care. Lastly, the huge recent incursions by information technology firms suggest that the American healthcare system may be on the verge of a further corporate takeover, instead of resolving issues of access, quality, cost, and accountability through a progressive public health approach.","Salmon, J.

Reforms of the 1990s and 2000s in England and Scotland tilted the balance of power away from local authority officers and professionals, justifying this shift through the rhetoric of parental empowerment. Research at the time showed that the major beneficiaries were families who could mobilise sufficient economic, social and cultural resources to navigate the system successfully (Weedon and Riddell, Additional support needs and approaches to dispute resolution: The perspectives of Scottish parents. Scottish Educational Review, 41, 62–81, 2009; Riddell et al., Dispute resolution in additional and special educational needs: Local authority perspectives. Journal of Education Policy, 25(1), 55–73, 2010). Until recently, little attention has been paid to the rights of children and young people, who have been largely excluded from educational decision-making (Harris, Playing catch-up in the schoolyard? Children and young people’s ‘voice’ and education rights in the UK. International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family, 23(3), 331–366, 2009). However, over the last few years, the independent rights of children and young people have been boosted significantly by international treaties and domestic legislation, particularly the Children and Families Act 2014 and the Education (Scotland) Act 2016. These measures have ostensibly empowered young people and children as independent actors, with rights to participate in all aspects of their education in accordance with their age and maturity. Attempts to advance the children’s human rights agenda over the past decade have coincided with significant cuts to education budgets. Despite evidence of the ongoing dissatisfaction of a significant minority of parents in both jurisdictions, parliamentary inquiries tend to exonerate the SEN/ASN systems, while blaming local authorities for mal-administration. Finally, the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath pose significant challenges for children’s human rights. In both England and Scotland, emergency legislation passed in March 2020 effectively suspended local authority duties to educate children and parents’ responsibility to ensure that their children are educated. The full impact of school closures on children’s educational development and wider wellbeing is likely to be severe and enduring, and debates around the epidemic have paid little attention to children’s rights. In the months and years ahead, it will be vital to ensure that attention to children’s rights is not occluded by wider social and economic concerns.","Riddell, Sheila","Autonomy, Rights and Children with Special Educational Needs",463,1

The key transcription factors (TFs) and co-expression networks during rose’s response to drought stress and recovery after drought stress are still limited. In this study, the transcriptomes of leaves of 2-year-old cutting seedlings of Rosa chinensis ‘Old Blush’ from three continuous droughted stages (30, 60, 90 days after full watering) and rewatering were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct a co-expression network, which was associated with the physiological traits of drought response to discovering the hub TFs involved in drought response. More than 45 million high-quality clean reads were generated from the sample and used for comparison with the rose reference genome. A total of 46433 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that drought stress caused significant changes in signal transduction, plant hormones including ABA, auxin, brassinosteroid (BR), cytokinin, ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), primary and secondary metabolism, and a certain degree of recovery after rewatering. Gene co-expression analysis identified 18 modules, in which four modules showed a high degree of correlation with physiological traits. In addition, 42 TFs including members of NACs, WRKYs, MYBs, AP2/ERFs, ARFs, and bHLHs with high connectivity in navajowhite1 and blue modules were screened. This study provides the transcriptome sequencing report of R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’ during drought stress and rewatering process. The study also identifies the response of candidate TFs to drought stress, providing guidelines for improving the drought tolerance of the rose through molecular breeding in the future.","Jia, Xin; Feng, Hui; Bu, Yanhua; Ji, Naizhe; Lyu, Yingmin; Zhao, Shiwei",Front Genet,463,1

Teil 2: Lösungsansätze und Schlussfolgerungen,11.259271,1.9207536,2021-09-02,"STUDY QUESTION: Is there any indication for presence of viral RNA in FF, CC, immature oocytes or endometrial biopsy (EB) of SARS-CoV–2 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Viral RNA is undetectable in FF, CC and EB with RT-PCR. However, S-protein expression on corona radiata cells suggests susceptibility to SARS-CoV–2 infection. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The effects of a SARS-CoV–2 infection on the female reproductive system are still poorly understood. Theoretically, co-localisation of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) on human blastocysts implies susceptibility to viral infection, mediated by the coronavirus spike (S) protein. To date, SARS-CoV–2 RNA was undetectable in mature oocytes from COVID–19 patients, despite the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The presence of viral RNA in endometrial tissue, immature oocytes, CC or FF has not yet been investigated in samples from patients with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV–2 test. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a prospective, single-centre, observational study including ten patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV–2, performed 48 hours before oocyte retrieval (OR), from September 2020 to January 2021. A patient was eligible if she preferred to continue treatment following adequate counselling of the unknown but presumably low risk for vertical transmission. Since a freeze-all strategy was applied, an EB was performed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: During OR, all protective measures were taken. Pooled FF, CC and EB from each patient were tested for viral RNA presence with RealStar® SARS-CoV–2 RT-PCR-Kit1.0 (Altona-Diagnostics). Ct values <40 were considered positive. EB was collected for pathological evaluation and cultured to obtain endometrial stromal cells (EnSC). Immature oocytes and EnSC were tested for S-protein expression by immunohistochemistry with anti-S antibody (MA5–35958, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) followed by Alexa Fluor™ 488-donkey-anti-mouse (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and visualized with confocal microscopy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: SARS-CoV–2 RNA was undetectable in the pooled FF, CC and EB from all patients included in the study. Histological analysis of the EB showed no pathological modifications, including inflammatory reaction, as compared to biopsies collected from swab negative patients. After staining with anti-S antibody, cultured EnSC and immature oocytes tested negative for the S-protein. However, the binding of anti-S antibody was demonstrated on the corona radiata cells remaining on the zona pellucida after oocyte denudation for intra-cytoplasmatic sperm injection, indicating presence of SARS-CoV–2. In that case, the explanation for the undetectable viral RNA in CC could be that the viral RNA concentration remained under the detection limit of the currently used RT-PCR test. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was conducted in a small population (ten patients included) with different viral load, with mild or without symptoms of COVID–19. Another important limitation is the absence of validation of the RT-PCR protocol for the investigation of other types of samples than nasopharyngeal swabs. Wider implications of the findings: The absence of SARS-CoV–2 RNA in all samples analysed represents a step further in reassuring a safe ART program for COVID–19 patients. However, the presence of S-protein on corona radiata cells warrants further investigation, since the theoretical possibility to infect human oocytes and/or embryos cannot be ruled out.

The lateral OCH(3)group was inserted in the central ring in ortho position with respect to the azomethine linkage. FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analyses were used to elucidate their molecular structures. Their mesomorphic behaviors were characterized by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). These examinations indicated that all the designed series were monomorphic and possessed nematic (N) mesophase enantiotropically, except A12 derivative which exhibited monotropic N phase. A comparative study was made between the present investigated series (An) and their corresponding isomers (Bn). The results revealed that the kind and stability of the mesophase as well as its temperature range are affected by the location and special orientation of the lateral methoxy group electric-resistance, conductance, energy-gap, and Urbach-energy were also reported for the present investigated An series. These results revealed that all electrodes exhibit Ohmic properties and electric-resistances in the GΩ range, whereas the electric resistance was decreased from 221.04 to 44.83 GΩ by lengthening the terminal alkoxy-chain to n = 12. The band gap of the An series was reduced from 3.43 to 2.89 eV by increasing the terminal chain length from n = 6 to n = 12 carbons. Therefore, controlling the length of the terminal chain can be used to improve the An series’ electric conductivity and optical absorption, making it suitable for solar energy applications.","Alamro, Fowzia S.; Ahmed, Hoda A.; Gomha, Sobhi M.; Shaban, Mohamed",Front Chem,463,17

However, exposure to constant stress stimuli can result in chronically elevated CORT levels, possibly leading to inhibition of reproductive and immune activity. Reproduction and immune responses are energetically expensive, so when an animal is immunologically challenged, a tradeoff might be expressed, with CORT potentially mediating it. Our aim was to test how episodic and chronic CORT treatments, alongside wound healing, would affect reproduction in American bullfrog males (Lithobates catesbeianus). Forty animals were divided in four groups: Episodic CORT (daily transdermic application of CORT), placebo (daily transdermic application of sesame oil), chronic CORT (subcutaneous CORT silastic implants), and sham control (subcutaneous empty silastic implants). One week after treatments began, animals were punctured in the leg with a biopsy needle and the wound was photographed after 45 days to determine wound healing status (WS). Blood samples were collected throughout the experiment to measure CORT and T plasma levels. After animal euthanasia, testes were dissected, fixed, and analyzed histologically to determine spermatogenic activity (germinative cyst [GmC] morphometrics). As expected, the episodic CORT treatment had no effect on T plasma levels or spermatogenic activity. On the other hand, chronic CORT treatment reduced GmC morphometric traits, indicating suppression of reproduction, although T levels were not altered. In addition, animals from sham control and chronic CORT treatments with higher T levels presented higher WS, which indicates an immune-enhancing T effect.","Prado, Débora M A; Gomes, Fernando R; Madelaire, Carla B","Journal of experimental zoology.

The introduction of the miniaturized Reveal LINQ ICM has led to simplified and less invasive procedures, affording hospitals flexibility in planning where these procedures occur without compromising patient safety or outcomes. METHODS The present analysis of the ongoing, prospective, observational, multicenter Reveal LINQ Registry sought to provide real-world feasibility and safety data regarding the ICM procedure performed in the CATH/EP lab or operating room and to compare it with insertions performed outside of these traditional hospital settings. Patients included had at least a 30-day period after the procedure to account for any adverse events. RESULTS We analyzed 1222 patients (58.1% male, age 61.0 ± 17.1 years) enrolled at 18 centers in the US, 17 centers in Middle East/Asia, and 15 centers in Europe. Patients were categorized into 2 cohorts according to the location of the procedure: in-lab (CATH lab, EP lab, or operating room) (n = 820, 67.1%) and out-of-lab (n = 402, 32.9%). Several differences were observed regarding baseline and procedure characteristics. However, no significant differences in the occurrence of procedure-related adverse events (AEs) were found; of 19 ICM/procedure-related AEs reported in 17 patients (1.4%), 11 occurred in the in-lab group (1.3%) and 6 in the out-of-lab group (1.5%) (P = .80). CONCLUSIONS This real-world analysis demonstrates the feasibility of performing Reveal LINQ ICM insertion procedures outside of the traditional hospital settings without increasing the risk of infection or other adverse events.","Beinart, Sean C; Natale, Andrea; Verma, Atul; Amin, Alpesh; Kasner, Scott; Diener, Hans-Cristoph; Del Greco, Maurizio; Wilkoff, Bruce L; Pouliot, Erika; Franco, Noreli; Mittal, Suneet",American heart journal,463,1

Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of 4 mg and 2 mg of baricitinib in combination with background topical corticosteroid (TCS) therapy in adults with moderate to severe AD who previously had an inadequate response to TCS therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomized clinical trial, BREEZE-AD7 (Study of Baricitinib [LY3009104] in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Adults With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis) was conducted from November 16, 2018, to August 22, 2019, at 68 centers across 10 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Patients 18 years or older with moderate to severe AD and an inadequate response to TCSs were included. After completing the study, patients were followed up for up to 4 weeks or enrolled in a long-term extension study. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 2 mg of baricitinib once daily (n = 109), 4 mg of baricitinib once daily (n = 111), or placebo (n = 109) for 16 weeks.

Despite the widespread availability of attenuated vaccines, safer, more stable, and more effective CPV2 vaccine candidates are still under exploration. Vaccinia virus (VV) has already been proved to be a safe, stable, and effective vaccine vector. In this study, we generated a VV-based CPV2 vaccine candidate (VV-CPV-VP2) and then evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and dogs. The exogenous vp2 gene of CPV2, which replaced the major virulence gene hemagglutinin (ha) of VV, expressed efficiently and stably in vitro. Subsequently, intramuscular immunization of mice induced robust and lasting systemic immune responses, including neutralizing antibody against both CPV2a and CPV2b, and CPV2-VP2-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ) secreting T cell. In addition, administration with a high-dose of VV-CPV-VP2 did not cause significant side effects for mice, thus indicating marked safety of this vaccine candidate. Most importantly, a single-dose vaccination of VV-CPV2-VP2 elicited substantial antibody responses and provided comparable protection for dogs with attenuated CPV2 vaccine. Collectively, this study demonstrated that VV-CPV2-VP2 could be used as a promising vaccine candidate preventing CPV2 from infection for dogs.","Zhao, Wanbo; Wang, Xiaomei; Li, Yi; Li, Yaoming",Viral immunology,463,16

Methodology: Clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic data of 68 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, analyzed and compared by gender-wise. Results: Dry cough (78% of male, 80% females) and fever (62% of male, 75% females) were the most common symptoms. Out of these 97% of them needed O2 supplementation. O2 saturation in patients with O2 therapy was 85%;31% of men and 11% of women experienced intubation. The most common laboratory abnormalities, were neutrophilia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased hemoglobin level, increased creatinine and urea, in men and women. Troponin level was different between male and female. Pneumonia was found in 86-87% patients. Approximately, Males and female, respectively53.10 and 52.8%, shown sinus tachycardia (ST arrythmia). PVC arrythmia was found in 2.9% of total patients. BBB arrythmia was found in 31.20% of males vs. 11.10% of females. The mean systole/diastole blood pressures respectively were 130±4/79.7 ±2 in males and 134±4/81±3 in females. Heart axis changes was identified in 43.8% and 27.8% of males and females respectively.

This paper argues that the abyss created from the lack of governance-led leadership in COVID-19 responses has exacerbated power asymmetries reliant upon technology sector led solutions that reflect current political dynamics and governance structures. In relation to these power asymmetries favoring technology companies, we are potentially creating opportunities for technocratic future visions to be further embedded into concepts of smart cities under the guise of public health. These visions and circumstances are dubbed as 'imaginaries of health' in the analyses. The analysis is primarily focusing on COVID-19 contact tracing apps and US context, but also references other countries' findings, such as Australia and Singapore, as examples of contact tracing app's technological limitations. The conclusion of the paper incorporates an examination of sociotechnical effects, calls for the incorporation of alternative imaginaries, and includes suggestions for where these technologies may be better served with creative implementations, along with considerations for the development of further apps. This commentary serves as an examination of sociotechnical implications of technosolutionism under COVID-19 based technical solutions, such as contact tracing apps, with a predominant US-focus. © 2020 IEEE.","Hajric, E.","2020 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, ISTAS 2020",463,13

It is precisely this that renders the justice of triage in question here so tragic, belying the positive semantics of justice. This is exactly what happens in medical triage, which, although it may be deemed fair, leaves one harm uneliminated, even if it is the lesser of the two. Decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic must therefore take measures in order to avoid the need for triage. In this discussion, Protestant criticisms of justice undermine resolute attestations of justice by pointing them towards their mediocre moral structures. As shown problems can be avoided that arise when judgments of justice are evaluated in established ethical deliberation without consideration of their unsavory effects and by overestimating iustitia hominis. © 2021 Guetersloher Verlagshaus.

Online survey conducted from 10/4/2020 till 25/4/2020. Test battery included the scales of constructive and defensive optimism (each of 3 items) and measure of dispositional optimism (LOT-R, Scheier et al., 1994). Part of the sample (N=306) completed anxiety in a pandemic questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020).ResultsCFA indicated a good fit for the two-factor model (χ2=27.11, df=8, p<.001, CFI =.985, TLI=.971, RMSEA = .041, p[RMSEA≤.05] = .78) with negative correlations between factors (–.28). Cronbach’s alpha for defensive optimism and constructive optimism were α=.75 and α=.70 respectively. As expected constructive and defensive optimism correlated with dispositional optimism (r=.24;p < .001 and r=–.06;p<.05 respectively) and anxiety (fear of infection, r=.08;n.s and r= –.23;p < .001).ConclusionsThe results show that DCO-C is a reliable measure of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic.

This study investigated the etiologic agents of adult CAP in Taiwan and the susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from these patients. METHODS A collaborative group was established in the emergency department to conduct a prospective study of the etiology of adult CAP. The etiologic agent was determined by a combination of microscopic, culture, serologic and antigen detection methods. Pneumococcal susceptibility testing was performed to determine the extent of penicillin resistance. RESULTS A total of 100 consecutive cases of mild to moderate adult CAP prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic were enrolled. The etiologic agent was determined in 72% of cases. The 5 most common causative pathogens were S. pneumoniae (26%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (20%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (13%), Haemophilus influenzae (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). Atypical pathogens accounted for 40% of CAP. Bacteremic pneumonia was diagnosed in 6.2% of cases. Co-infections with 2 or more pathogens were found in 16% of the cases. Among the 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 85% (17/20) were susceptible to penicillin, 3 (15%) were intermediate, and none were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were the 3 leading causes of mild to moderate CAP in Taiwan. This study indicates that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae play a very limited role in this condition in adults.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Hu, Bor-Shen; Chen, Yao-Shen; Lee, Susan Shin-Jung; Lin, Yu-Sen E; Wann, Shue-Ren; Tsai, Hung-Chin; Lin, Hsi-Hsun; Huang, Chun-Kai; Liu, Yung-Ching",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,463,17

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alterations in programs have caused a need to develop new models of online assessments for students. While novel alterations in the curriculum have been made, clear learning outcomes and strategies must still teach the best practices. At the California University of Science and Medicine, School of Medicine (CUSM-SOM), we aim to adapt training and assessment tools that include SonoSim LiveScan experiences. Sonosim, Inc. has developed a tool that students can use remotely to mimic the clinical applications traditionally done in person. This would allow students to familiarize themselves with normal and pathologic scans remotely and hone their diagnostic abilities without requiring in-person faculty-led sessions. There have already been multiple medical schools that have added SonoSim to supplement their curriculum and assess students? competencies. This study aims to develop an online system of reliable competency-based assessments for medical students in the teaching of POCUS. Methods After completing each ultrasound module on SonoSim LiveScan alongside the schools? corresponding system-based courses, students will be assessed for achievement of competencies and learning outcomes. Students will take an online quiz and submit sonographic images that they obtained on their own time using provided standardized patients. The students will submit the images taken according to the guidelines mapped by the courses? learning outcomes. Submissions will be through a secured online system. Quizzes will be graded with a predetermined grading system. Using a standardized rubric, three faculty members/instructors will assess scans for competency and quality. Results Assessment will be completed in two steps. The first step will include an assessment of medical knowledge and concepts via an online quiz. The quiz will have still images and short video clips from SonoSim LiveScan to gauge the mastery of knowledge. The second step of the assessment will include a review of the ultrasound images obtained by the student. They will complete this part of the assessment on their own, asynchronously, and within a defined period of time. Then, three faculty members will score the images independently. To maintain the quality of the assessment, all instructors must agree that the required competencies have been achieved. All major discrepancies between the instructors regarding the results and assessment will be addressed according to the predetermined guidelines. Conclusion This competency-based assessment and training identifies students? areas of weakness and makes review and remediation easy and straightforward. Clear objectives, teaching modalities, and assessments set the foundation for a successful ultrasound program. Competency-based assessment as outlined above could be the best possible method to ensure students are involved and learning accurately during primarily remote learning times. By outlining a program that is easily implementable and accessible, ultrasound education will be made more available and widespread to medical students who would otherwise not be exposed.","Young, Corey Tan Shirley Kim Jane Park Claire Nausheen Fauzia",The FASEB Journal,463,16

This was done to enhance the practice of real estate agency in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Data were elicited from eight real estate experts. These experts were heads of the agency department of firms that had been in existence for a minimum of five years in the Lagos property market. The data analysed in this study were collected with the aid of a questionnaire. Findings The result revealed that use intention was influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value and UB. Also, facilitating conditions, habit and use intention did not influence use behaviour. Overall, six constructs, which include price value (R-i - C-j value = 0.1284), use behaviour (R-i - C-j value = 0.0666), social influence (R-i - C-j value = 0.0583), facilitating conditions (R-i - C-j value = 0.0323), performance expectancy (R-i - C-j value = 0.0196) and effort expectancy (R-i - C-j value = 0.0116), were significant predictors of the factors influencing the decision of REFs to adopt VR. Of these constructs, the R-i - C-j values indicated that price value had the highest causative influence. Practical implications The result of this study will bring REFs to the consciousness of the factors that could affect their adoption of VR technology. This study will also assist the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers in appropriately enlightening REFs on the integration of VR technology into the agency practice especially at this time when all health protocols and guidelines need to be observed to help flatten the curve of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Thus, early predictors of clinical outcome are highly needed. We investigated markers of neural tissue damage as a possible early sign of multisystem involvement to assess their clinical prognostic value on survival or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We collected blood from 104 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 the day of admission to the emergency room and measured blood neurofilament light chair (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and total tau protein levels. RESULTS: We found that NfL, GFAP, and tau were significantly increased in patients with fatal outcome, while NfL and UCH-L1 in those needing ICU transfer. ROC and Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that total tau levels at admission accurately predict mortality.

Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care - with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in IBD. In this Viewpoint, we share our experiences from a clinical and academic perspective in the United Kingdom, highlighting the early challenges encountered and consider implications for patients and staff at research sites, sponsors, research ethics committees, funders and regulators.

A current therapeutic strategy attempting to circumvent this issue aims to enhance drug delivery to reduce the duration of the antibiotic regimen or dosage of first-line antibiotics. One such agent that may help is cyclic peptide [R4W4], as it has been shown to have antibacterial properties (in combination with tetracycline) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the past. The objective of this study is to test cyclic peptide [R4W4] both alone and in combination with current first-line antibiotics (either isoniazid or pyrazinamide) to study the effects of inhibition of M. tb inside in vitro human granulomas.

This observational study compares the outcome in COVID-19 patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and without prior use of AC. We collected the baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presented to the emergency department of Bernhoven Hospital, the Netherlands. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days and analyzed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, symptom duration, home medication, and comorbidities. We included 497 patients, including 57 patients with DOAC (11%) and 53 patients with VKA (11%). Patients with AC had a lower body temperature and lower C-reactive protein levels. Comparing the primary outcome in patients with AC (DOAC or VKA) and no AC, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.64 (95% CI 0.42-0.96, P = 0.03). Comparing DOAC and no AC, the aHR was 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.89, P = 0.02) and comparing VKA and no AC, the aHR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.47-1.27, P = 0.30). In a subgroup analysis of DOAC, all nine patients with prior use of dabigatran survived within 30 days. In this observational study, the prior use of AC is associated with a better survival of COVID-19.

We investigated pain, catastrophizing, and psychological status in UCPP patients during SARS-CoV-2 by means of Skype telephone calls. METHODS: A total of 28 UCPP patients underwent Skype video consultations. Pain intensity was assessed with Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) were used to assess catastrophizing and psychological status. RESULTS: During SARS-CoV-2, UCPP patients showed higher intensity of pain than before (mean ± SD PNRS score: 7.25 ± 0.9 vs. 5.4 ± 0.7; p < .0001), with pain exacerbation in 75%; they showed higher PCS and DASS-21 scores as compared to before the pandemic (mean ± SD PCS total score: 32.4 ± 1.2 vs. 23.7 ± 3.5; mean ± SD DASS-21 total score: 42.03 ± 4.5 vs. 34.4 ± 2.2; p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: During SARS-CoV-2 pandemic UCPP patients presented with high intensity of pain, marked catastrophizing thoughts and severe alteration of the psychological status. These observations impose the need not to postpone assessment and treatment of these patients during the pandemic. Remote visits with video telephone calls are a simple way of continuing care in UCPP patients.","Giannantoni, Antonella; Rubilotta, Emanuele; Balzarro, Matteo; Gubbiotti, Marilena",Neurourol. urodyn,463,21

We aimed to describe the characteristics of infants under 1 year of age (excluding newborns) with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data of 36 infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 26 to March 22, 2020. Clinical features, chest imaging findings, laboratory tests results, treatments and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the infected infants was 6.43 months, with a range of 2-12 months. 61.11% of the patients were males and 38.89% females. 86.11% of the infants were infected due to family clustering. Cough (77.78%) and fever (47.22%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Chest CT scan revealed 61.11% bilateral pneumonia and 36.11% unilateral pneumonia. 47.22% of the infants developed complications. Increased leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes were observed in 11.11, 8.33, 36.11 and 44.44% of infants, respectively. Decreased leucocytes, neutrophils, thrombocyte and hemoglobin were observed in 8.33, 19.44, 2.78 and 36.11% of infants, respectively. Increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were observed in 19.44, 67.74, 47.22, 19.44, 22.22 and 20.69% of infants, respectively. Only one infant had a high level of creatinine. Co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were observed in 62.86% of infants. CD3 (20.69%), CD4 (68.97%), CD19 (31.03%) and Th/Ts (44.83%) were elevated; CD8 (6.9%) and CD16+CD56 (48.28%) was reduced. IL-4 (7.69%), IL-6 (19.23%), IL-10 (50%), TNF-&#945; (11.54%) and IFN-Î³ (19.23%) were elevated. Up to March 22, 97.22% of infants recovered, while a critical ill infant died. When the infant's condition deteriorates rapidly, lymphocytopenia was discovered. Meanwhile, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, IL-6 and IL-10 increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In the cohort, we discovered that lymphocytosis, elevated CD4 and IL-10, and co-infections were common in infants with COVID-19, which were different from adults with COVID-19.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2, either in its natural reservoir or in the human population, is still unclear, but this knowledge is essential for effective prevention and control. We propose a new framework to systematically identify recombination events, excluding those due to noise and convergent evolution. We found that several recombination events occurred for SARS-CoV-2 before its transfer to humans, including a more recent recombination event in the receptor-binding domain. We also constructed a probabilistic mutation network to explore the diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after human infection. Clustering results show that the novel coronavirus has diverged into several clusters that cocirculate over time in various regions and that several mutations across the genome are fixed during transmission throughout the human population, including D614G in the S gene and two accompanied mutations in ORF1ab. Together, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 experienced a complicated evolution process in the natural environment and point to its continuous adaptation to humans. The new framework proposed in this study can help our understanding of and response to other emerging pathogens.","Wang, Yinghan; Zeng, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chi; Chen, Cai; Qiu, Zekai; Pang, Jiali; Xu, Yutian; Dong, Zhiqi; Song, Yanxin; Liu, Weiying; Dong, Peipei; Sun, Litao; Chen, Yao-Qing; Shu, Yuelong; Du, Xiangjun",Brief. bioinform,463,16

[German],11.30774,1.7846158,2020,"The transmission behaviour of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being defined. It is likely that it is transmitted predominantly by droplets and direct contact and it is possible that there is at least opportunistic airborne transmission. In order to protect healthcare staff adequately it is necessary that we establish whether aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Where we do not have evidence relating to SARS-CoV-2, guidelines for safely conducting these procedures should consider the risk of transmitting related pathogens. Currently there is very little evidence detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with any specific procedures. Regarding AGPs and respiratory pathogens in general, there is still a large knowledge gap that will leave clinicians unsure of the risk to themselves when offering these procedures. This review aimed to summarize the evidence (and gaps in evidence) around AGPs and SARS-CoV-2.","Harding, H; Broom, A; Broom, J",J Hosp Infect,463,16

An equal area breaks classification aims to obtain a coloring for the map such that the area associated with each of the colors is approximately equal. This is meant to be an alternative to an approach that assigns an equal number of regions with a particular range of property values to each color, called quantiles, which could result in the mapped area being dominated by one or a few colors. Moreover, it is possible that the other colors are barely discernible. This is the case when some regions are much larger than others (e.g., compare Switzerland with Russia). A number of algorithms of varying computational complexity are presented to achieve an equal area assignment to regions. They include a pair of greedy algorithms, as well as an optimal algorithm that is based on dynamic programming. The classification obtained from the optimal equal area algorithm is compared with the quantiles and Jenks natural breaks algorithms and found to be superior from a visual standpoint by a user study. Finally, a modified approach is presented which enables users to vary the extent to which the coloring algorithm satisfies the conflicting goals of equal area for each color with that of assigning an equal number of regions to each color.","Abboud, Anis; Kastner, John; Samet, Hanan",,463,1

METHODS: Parent satisfaction was longitudinally evaluated through questionnaires. The survey was developed with Google Questionnaire forms and sent via WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of 13 items concerning the management of KDTs using telemedicine in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our population of patients has limited financial resources and low levels of education. Given that many families did not have either computers or WIFI, or any other access to information or communication technology, WhatsApp was chosen as a tool as it was available on the cell phones of all families and the professionals. RESULTS: Our survey showed that 96.3% of the parents were satisfied with the management of KDTs through telemedicine. The main benefits observed were the possibility of continuing treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ease of accessing the professional team from the comfort of their home. Overall, 72.2% of the families would recommend using telemedicine for KDTs in any situation regardless of the pandemic. None of the families reported that they would recommend against treatment by telemedicine. The availability of a social support network (parents WhatsApp group) coordinated by professionals from the KDT team was considered to be useful by most respondents (90%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that management of children with DRE on KDTs through telemedicine is feasible, well accepted by the families, and probably as safe as conventional medicine. WhatsApp may be an interesting telemedicine tool to start and maintain KDTs.","Semprino, Marcos; Fasulo, Lorena; Fortini, Sebastian; Martorell Molina, Catalina Isabel; González, Lara; Ramos, Paola Alejandra; Martínez, Carolina; Caraballo, Roberto",Epilepsy Behav,463,22

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is recognized as a key mediator of hyperinflammation previously mentioned in cytokine release syndrome. This leads to implementing IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19. This review aimed to explore the clinical evidences of using IL-6 antagonists in COVID-19 infection based on most recent available data. Relevant studies were searched through PubMed, scopus, and ISI databases focusing on interleukin-6 antagonists in cytokine release syndrome and prospective data on COVID-19 infection. Only papers in English were included in the search. There were several studies conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of IL-6 antagonists and mostly with tocilizumab. After the search, we found that studies recruited patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, or ferritin to receive tocilizumab, situximab or sarilumab in combination with other medications. Result showed that these agents may provide a clinical advantage as patients were able to refrain from invasive ventilation support after initiating IL-6 antagonists. In summary, IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19 may be an emerging candidate to subside pulmonary complication. These agents may carry benefits in COVID-19 infection as well as safety risks such as bone marrow suppression. Current pharmacists' role is to provide most recent update information as well as intensive monitoring plan in patients who receive IL-6 inhibitor.

The major cause of fatality in infected patients, now referred to as the ""Cytokine Storm Syndrome"" (CSS), is a direct result of aberrant immune activation following SARS-CoV2 infection and results in excess release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), and IL-6, by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Single cell analysis has also shown significantly elevated levels of galectin 3 (Gal-3) in macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to mild disease. Inhibition of Gal-3 reduces the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; from macrophages in vitro, and as such may hold promise in reducing the incidence of CSS. In addition, Gal-3 inhibition shows promise in reducing transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) mediated pulmonary fibrosis, likely to be a major consequence in survivors of severe COVID-19. Finally, a key domain in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 has been shown to bind N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a process that may be essential to cell entry by the virus. This Neu5Ac-binding domain shares striking morphological, sequence, and functional similarities with human Gal-3. Here we provide an updated review of the literature linking Gal-3 to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dually targeting galectins and the Neu5Ac-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 shows tentative promise in several stages of the disease: preventing viral entry, modulating the host immune response, and reducing the post-infectious incidence of pulmonary fibrosis.","Caniglia, John L; Asuthkar, Swapna; Tsung, Andrew J; Guda, Maheedhara R; Velpula, Kiran K",F1000Res,463,16

The concept of inclusive health focuses on good health and well-being for everyone, and this entails health services that are equitable, affordable, and efficacious. Creating equitable access to mainstream health and healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses remain a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive responses to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example. Africa's response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important to strategize to address their particular needs in such a way to surmount any barrier to the right to health. For Africa's public health response to be more inclusive, we therefore need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups and to identify and address their needs. Strengthening the healthcare systems of African countries through increased political will, increased funding to health care, collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders, and effective leadership remains essential in ensuring inclusive responses to health emergencies.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Ekpenyong, Aniekan; Ntacyabukura, Blaise; Lowe, Mat; Jimoh, Nafisat Dasola; Abdulkareem, Toyyib Oladimeji; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,463,20

These proteins are encoded by different genes present on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The expression pattern of these genes in the host cells needs to be assessed. This study was undertaken to understand the transcription pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 genes in the Vero CCL-81 cells during the course of infection. Methods: Vero CCL-81 cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus inoculum having a 0.1 multiplicity of infection. The supernatants and cell pellets were harvested after centrifugation at different time points, post-infection. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)and cycle threshold (Ct) values of the E and the RdRp-2 genes were calculated. Next-generation sequencing of the harvested sample was carried out to observe the expression pattern of the virus by mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan HU-1 reference sequence. The expressions were in terms of the reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values. Results: In the inital six hours post-infection, the copy numbers of E and RdRp-2 genes were approximately constant, which raised 10 log-fold and continued to increase till the 12 h post-infection (hpi). The TCID50 was observed in the supernatant after 7 hpi, indicating the release of the viral progeny. ORF8 and ORF7a, along with the nucleocapsid transcript, were found to express at higher levels. Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the growth kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. The findings indicated that ORF8 and ORF7b gene transcripts were expressed in higher amounts indicating their essential role in viral replication.

In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS: 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS: The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","Mittel, Aaron M; Panzer, Oliver; Wang, David S; Miller, Steven E; Schaff, Jacob E; Hastie, Maya Jalbout; Sutherland, Lauren; Brentjens, Tricia E; Sobol, Julia B; Cabredo, Almarie; Hastie, Jonathan",Anesth Analg,463,26

RESULTS: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first, and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination. Vaccine firm refusers were more likely than vaccine hesitants to distrust pharmaceutical companies and to prefer developing a natural immunity by getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy exists among HCWs. Our findings provide useful information to plan future interventions and improve acceptance.","Dzieciolowska, Stefania; Hamel, Denis; Gadio, Souleymane; Dionne, Maude; Gagnon, Dominique; Robitaille, Lucie; Cook, Erin; Caron, Isabelle; Talib, Amina; Parkes, Leighanne; Dubé, Ève; Longtin, Yves",Am. j. infect. control,463,20

The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic implications of WBC and cell population data (CPD) abnormalities related to COVID-19 at disease onset. METHODS: Baseline WBC counts and CPD data were analyzed in one hundred COVID-19 patients presenting to emergency department and subsequently discharged (n = 49), admitted (n = 51) or deceased (n = 22), and in 47 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were observed in all COVID-19 patients, with more intensity in the admitted and deceased groups, that also presented increased WBC and neutrophil counts. On CPD analysis, COVID-19 was associated with increased volume of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, whereas conductivity was decreased for neutrophils and increased for lymphocytes. The ROC curve analysis showed good performance for lymphocyte counts in predicting COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.858), for neutrophil counts in predicting admission for COVID-19 (AUC = 0.744) and for monocytes volume in predicting COVID-19 diagnosis (AUC = 0.837). CONCLUSION: WBC counts and CPD parameters at disease onset in COVID-19 patients can improve diagnostic characterization and aid in the discrimination between severe and nonsevere presentations.","Naoum, Flávio Augusto; Ruiz, Adriana Laridondo Zucareli; Martin, Fernando Henrique de Oliveira; Brito, Tayra Hostalacio Gomes; Hassem, Vitoria; Oliveira, Maria Gabriela de Lucca",Int. j. lab. hematol,463,16

This article presents the results of a study analyses digital‐competence levels in the area of communication of Spanish basic‐education students (aged 12–16) and establishes whether online communication with friends and the use of social media impact it. A quantitative methodology with a descriptive and cross‐sectional design was used. The sample comprised 807 students, and data collection was based on a problem‐solving test. Findings show that students who use online communication with their friends very often and that those who use social networks a lot have lower levels of digital competence.

Although several factors of this infection and its consequences are not completely clear, the presence and involvement of specific chemokines is undoubtedly crucial for the development and progression of COVID-19. Cytokine storm and the often-resulting cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are pathophysiological hallmarks in COVID-19 infections related to its most severe and fatal cases. In this hyperinflammatory event, chemokines and other cytokines are highly upregulated and are therefore not fulfilling their beneficial function in the host response anymore but causing harmful effects.

For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the strategies of the body against oxygen imbalance-especially oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of oxygen homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. These responses are greatly influenced by perioperative patient management including factors such as perioperative drugs. Herein, the influence of perioperative patient management on the body's response to oxygen imbalance was reviewed with a special emphasis on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors whose activity are regulated by the perturbation of oxygen metabolism. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three researchers who made outstanding achievements in this field. While previous studies have reported the effect of perioperatively used drugs on hypoxia-induced gene expression mediated by HIFs, this review focused on effects of subacute or chronic hypoxia changes in gene expression that are mediated by the transcriptional regulator HIFs. The clinical implications and perspectives of these findings also will be discussed. Understanding the basic biology of the transcription factor HIF can be informative for us since anesthesiologists manage patients during the perioperative period facing the imbalances the oxygen metabolism in organ and tissue. The clinical implications of hypoxia-dependent signaling in critical illness, including Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which disturbances in oxygen metabolism play a major role in its pathogenesis will also be discussed.","Hirota, Kiichi",J. anesth,463,1

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The retrospective cohort study included adult HCWs in a single healthcare system from March 9 to June 3, 2020. METHODS: Participants' SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results and demographics were de-identified and extracted from an established occupational health, COVID-19 database at the healthcare system. HCWs from each particular job grouping had been categorized into frontline/non-frontline workers. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and odds ratio were used to compare subgroups after excluding HCWs involved in early infection clusters before universal masking. A sensitivity analysis was performed comparing jobs with the greatest potential occupational risks with others. RESULTS: 152 out of 5177 (2.94%) HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19. Affected HCWs resided in areas with higher community attack rates (median: 1755.2 vs. 1412.4 cases per 100,000, P<0.001)(multivariate-adjusted IRR: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.03-3.44 comparing 5th to 1st quintile of community rates).

Thus, this study was aimed to compare the admission and outcome variables such as number of patient and its severity, acute recanalisation therapy given pre-post COVID-19 at a primary stroke centre located in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included adult ischaemic stroke patients. Variables of the study included the number of ischaemic stroke patients, the proportions of recanalisation therapies, stroke severity during admission based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, functional outcome at discharge based on the modified Rankin Scale, and relevant workflow metrics. We compared the outcome between two six-month periods, namely the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019 to September 2019) and the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020). Results: There were 131 and 156 patients, respectively, from the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period. The median door-to-scan time and the median door-to-reperfusion time were both significantly shorter in the COVID-19 period (24.5 min versus 12.0 min, p = 0.047) and (93.5 min versus 60.0 min, p = 0.015), respectively.

Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may not have caused disruptions of acute stroke care in our primary stroke centre. Our data indicated that the number of ischaemic stroke events remained stable, with a significant increase of recanalisation therapies and better in-hospital workflow metrics during the COVID-19 pandemic period. However, we would like to highlight that the burden of COVID-19 cases in the study area was very low. Therefore, the study may not have captured the true burden (and relevant delays in stroke patient management) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic crisis is ongoing and both pre-hospital and in-hospital care systems must continue to provide optimal, highly time-dependent stroke care services.","Loh, Hong Chuan; Neoh, Kar Keong; Tang, Angelina Siing Ngi; Chin, Chen Joo; Suppiah, Purnima Devi; Looi, Irene; Goh, Khang Wen; Tan, Ching Siang; Ming, Long Chiau",Medicina (Kaunas),463,16

Recently, more than 50 cases have been reported presenting a combination of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and remarkably high levels of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/polyanion antibodies post-AZD1222 vaccination. Now linked to the vaccine, the condition is referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. The European Medicines Agency still recommends vaccination with AZD1222, but several European countries have temporally paused and/or restricted its use because of the perceived risk of this severe side effect. Because there is no description of PF4/polyanion antibody testing in the clinical trials, knowledge about the prevalence of such antibodies in a vaccinated cohort is needed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate prevalence of thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies in a population recently vaccinated with AZD1222. PATIENTS/METHODS: Four hundred and ninety-two health care workers recently vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Study individuals were screened for thrombocytopenia and the presence of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies with a PF4/PVS immunoassay. Side effects after vaccination were registered. RESULTS: The majority of study participants had normal platelet counts and negative immunoassay. Anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies without platelet activating properties were only detected in six individuals (optical density &#8805;0.4, range 0.58-1.16), all with normal platelet counts. No subjects had severe thrombocytopenia.

This study examined the possible association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ABO phenotype in Black Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report is from a single centre where both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were quarantined. At the time of this report, Oyo State, Nigeria had carried out 15 733 tests of which 3119 were positive for the virus with 1952 recoveries and 37 deaths. The ABO distribution of patients was compared with that of a blood donor population. RESULTS: Of the 302 participants, 297 (98%) had their blood group determined, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals were 123 (40·7%) and 179 (59·3%) respectively. Blood group O was significantly less represented among the patients (P < 0·01) while blood groups B and AB were significantly more represented (P < 0·01, P = 0·03 respectively). Patients with anti-B (groups A and O) were significantly less represented than those without anti-B (B and/or AB): B and AB (P < 0·001), B (P = 0·002), AB (P = 0·01). There was no difference in the blood group distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (&#967;2 (3, N = 302) = 2·29; P = 0·51), but symptomatic patients with anti-A (groups B and O) were more represented than asymptomatic patients with anti-A (&#967;2 4·89; P = 0·03).

Therefore, this work focus on detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images because it is widely available, faster, and cheaper than CT scan. Many machine learning approaches such as Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine; have used X-ray for detecting the COVID-19. Although the performance of those approaches is acceptable in terms of accuracy, however, they require high computational time and more memory space. Therefore, this work employs an Optimised Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (OGA-ELM) with three selection criteria (i.e., random, K-tournament, and roulette wheel) to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The most crucial strength factors of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are: (i) high capability of the ELM in avoiding overfitting; (ii) its usability on binary and multi-type classifiers; and (iii) ELM could work as a kernel-based support vector machine with a structure of a neural network. These advantages make the ELM efficient in achieving an excellent learning performance. ELMs have successfully been applied in many domains, including medical domains such as breast cancer detection, pathological brain detection, and ductal carcinoma in situ detection, but not yet tested on detecting COVID-19. Hence, this work aims to identify the effectiveness of employing OGA-ELM in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In order to reduce the dimensionality of a histogram oriented gradient features, we use principal component analysis. The performance of OGA-ELM is evaluated on a benchmark dataset containing 188 chest X-ray images with two classes: a healthy and a COVID-19 infected. The experimental result shows that the OGA-ELM achieves 100.00% accuracy with fast computation time. This demonstrates that OGA-ELM is an efficient method for COVID-19 detecting using chest X-ray images.","Albadr, Musatafa Abbas Abbood; Tiun, Sabrina; Ayob, Masri; Al-Dhief, Fahad Taha; Omar, Khairuddin; Hamzah, Faizal Amri",PLoS One,463,8

Here, we investigated the aphid diet of two common aphid predators in Central European agroecosystems, the native Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus) and the invasive Harmonia axyridis (Pallas; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by means of high throughput sequencing (HTS). For acquiring insights into diets of mobile flying insects at landscape scale minimizing trapping bias is important, which imposes methodological challenges for HTS. We therefore assessed the suitability of three field sampling methods (sticky traps, pan traps and hand-collection) as well as new aphid primers for identifying aphid prey consumption by coccinellids through HTS. The new aphid primers facilitate identification to species level in 75% of the European aphid genera investigated. Aphid primer specificity was high in silico and in vitro but low in environmental samples with the methods used, although this could be improved in future studies. For insect trapping we conclude that sticky traps are a suitable method in terms of minimizing sampling bias, contamination risk and trapping success, but compromise on DNA-recovery rate. The aphid diets of both field-captured ladybird species were dominated by Microlophium carnosum, the common nettle aphid. Another common prey was Sitobion avenae (cereal aphid), which got more often detected in C. septempunctata compared to H. axyridis. Around one third of the recovered aphid taxa were common crop pests. We conclude that sampling methodologies need constant revision but that our improved aphid primers offer currently one of the best solutions for broad screenings of coccinellid predation on aphids.","Ammann, Lolita; Moorhouse-Gann, Rosemary; Cuff, Jordan; Bertrand, Colette; Mestre, Laia; Hidalgo, Nicolás Pérez; Ellison, Amy; Herzog, Felix; Entling, Martin H; Albrecht, Matthias; Symondson, William O C",PLoS One,463,16
486456,486456,486456,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Medical Students and Plastic Surgery Residency Applicants,11.233247,1.7612091,2021,"Introduction SARS-CoV-2 has struck as a major global pandemic causing COVID19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other respiratory diseases gradually affecting multiple organs. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is affecting over 85.1 million global cases of SARS-CoV-2 (20.7 millions in US) infections with 1.84 million (0.352 million in US) deaths globally. SARS-CoV-2 genome is 30kb in size and makes 29 proteins including key Spike protein (SP) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The SP facilitates the entry of the virus into human host cells. Interactions of potential drugs with the SP can prevent or inhibit the entry of the virus into the host cells by blocking the interaction. Similarly, the non-structural proteins (nsp) 7 and 8 facilitate the function of the RdRp/nsp12 that is essential for the replication of viral genome leading to multiply and spread of the virus within and from the host. In this study, we have selected 26 known phytochemicals (TC1 - TC26) from medicinally important Ayurvedic plant, Tinospora cordifolia (TC), to study the interactions of these phytochemicals with key SARS-CoV-2 proteins using in silico methods. We have identified promising interactions between TC phytochemicals, and the key SARS-CoV2 proteins that can potentially block the viral entry and/or replication of SARS-CoV-2 thereby preventing and treating COVID19. Methods A molecular docking algorithm, PatchDock, was used to study the interactions between target proteins and phytochemicals of TC. To filter out the redundant docking predictions resulting from the patch matching system, a RMSD clustering calculation is used. The molecular display program, Chimera, was used to display the interactions between the phytochemicals and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Results Of the 26 compounds tested (TC1 - TC26), 11 showed effective binding to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, SP or nsp7/8/12 complex including RdRp. The effectiveness of the docking compounds was measured in terms of atomic contact energy (ACE) Scores and rankings based on clusters. The compounds TC1, TC4, TC10 and TC14 achieved lower scores (of binding) less than -100 showing potential binding to all three viral proteins/complexes, SP, RdRp and nsp7/8/12. Further, analysis indicates that TC4 and TC10 are binding remarkably close to the active site of the SP that binds to the ACE2 receptor of host cells, providing evidence for effective inhibition of the SP. TC1 and TC14 binds between the N-terminal, palm domain, and thumb domain of the RdRp, creating an interaction inside the active site, substantially inhibiting its critical replication function. Conclusion For the first time, we present in silico evidence that TC4 and TC10, and TC1 and TC14 potentially impair the entry and replication of SARS-COV-2 proteins respectively by inhibiting the functions of Spike and RdRp/nsp7-8/12 proteins respectively.","Badri, Kameswara Aramgam Sreelatha Muppuru Kesavulu Kona Abhishek Kona Abhinav",The FASEB Journal,463,15

They don't find the traditional introductory topics - kinematics and Newton's laws to be relevant to their interests. That, combined with the well-known student misconceptions concerning describing motion mathematically, suggests that there's a need for a new starting point for the introductory physics sequence for life-science students. This presentation outlines a new active-learning approach that starts with the ?marble game?, which simulates diffusion - a topic that students already know is fundamental to the life sciences. Students first learn how to play the game using a hands-on activity. They then implement the game in Excel producing a live graph of diffusion that leads them to discover that Fick's law of diffusion can be explained by unbiased random jumping between two boxes. In a guided-inquiry environment, students then apply the modeling techniques they learned from the marble game to drug elimination;radioactive decay;osmosis;ligand binding;enzyme kinetics;the Boltzmann factor;thermodynamics, phase equilibrium and entropy;random walks;membrane voltage, RC circuits and the action potential;models of the spread of COVID-19;Newtonian mechanics and biomechanics. The materials focus on engaging students in computational activities using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference methods. These Excel activities allow them to discover for themselves the consequences and significance of model assumptions by reading and interpreting graphs, and by comparing model predictions with real data using linear regression and non-linear least-squares fits. A central theme of the materials is ?thermodynamics from kinetics.? I've been successfully using this active-learning approach with undergraduate students for over 15 years. It provides a guided-inquiry environment that allows students to discover for themselves that science is an evidence-based endeavor with testable hypotheses that are supported by experiment.

The scientific basis for our inquiry is the well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the""degree of convexity""reflected in the predicted path of the disease is significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with the WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government's actions. A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.","Banerjee, Ritwik; Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Majumdar, Priyama",,463,15

We aimed to investigate the association of longitudinal changes in early nasal microbiota with the risk of developing asthma. METHODS: In this prospective, population-based birth cohort study, we followed children from birth to age 7 years. The nasal microbiota was tested by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing at ages 2, 13, and 24 months. We applied an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles during age 2 to 13 months (the primary exposure) and during age 2 to 24 months (the secondary exposure) and examined the association of these profiles with the risk of physician-diagnosed asthma at age 7 years. RESULTS: Of the analytic cohort of 704 children, 57 (8%) later developed asthma. We identified 4 distinct longitudinal nasal microbiota profiles during age 2 to 13 months. In the multivariable analysis, compared with the persistent Moraxella dominance profile during age 2 to 13 months, the persistent Moraxella sparsity profile was associated with a significantly higher risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-6.27). Similar associations were observed between the longitudinal changes in nasal microbiota during age 2 to 24 months and risk of asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an altered longitudinal pattern in the nasal microbiota during early childhood had a high risk of developing asthma. Our data guide the development of primary prevention strategies (eg, early identification of children at high risk and modification of microbiota) for childhood asthma. These observations present a new avenue for risk modification for asthma (eg, microbiota modification).","Toivonen, Laura; Karppinen, Sinikka; Schuez-Havupalo, Linnea; Waris, Matti; He, Qiushui; Hoffman, Kristi L; Petrosino, Joseph F; Dumas, Orianne; Camargo, Carlos A; Hasegawa, Kohei; Peltola, Ville",Pediatrics,463,16

All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations. METHOD: Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020. RESULTS: Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.","Gupta, Alpana Kumar; Nethan, Suzanne Tanya; Mehrotra, Ravi",Respir Med,463,26

The role of multi-organ failure during ICU admission as driver for outcome remains to be investigated yet. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: 94 participants of the MaastrICCht cohort (21% women) had a median length of stay of 16 days (maximum of 77). After division into survivors (n = 59) and non-survivors (n = 35), we analysed 1555 serial SOFA scores using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Survivors improved one SOFA score point more per 5 days (95% CI: 4-8) than non-survivors. Adjustment for age, sex, and chronic lung, renal and liver disease, body-mass index, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk factors, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score did not change this result. This association was stronger for women than men (P-interaction = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in SOFA score associated with survival suggests multi-organ failure involvement during mechanical ventilation in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Surviving women appeared to improve faster than surviving men. Serial SOFA scores may unravel an unfavourable trajectory and guide decisions in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Bels, Julia L M; van Kuijk, Sander M J; Ghossein-Doha, Chahinda; Tijssen, Fabian H; van Gassel, Rob J J; Tas, Jeanette; Collaborators, MaastrICCht; Schnabel, Ronny M; Aries, Marcel J H; van de Poll, Marcel C G; Bergmans, Dennis C J J; Meex, Steven J R; van Mook, Walther N K A; van der Horst, Iwan C C; van Bussel, Bas C T",J Crit Care,463,20

Little is known about the prognostic value of obesity that has been associated with an increased risk for several cancer types and worsened prognosis after diagnosis. This study aims to examine effects of obesity on outcome in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma. METHODS: Prospectively recorded data of patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 1995 and 2018 at the University Medical Center of Groningen were collected from medical files and retrospectively analyzed. Cox-regression analyses were used to determine associations between obesity (body mass index> 30), tumor (location, histology, Breslow-thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, SLN-status) and patient-related variables (gender, age, and social-economic-status [SES]) and disease-free interval (DFI), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 715 patients, 355 (49.7%) were women, median age was 55 (range 18.6-89) years, 149 (20.8%) were obese. Obesity did not significantly affect DFI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-2.00; p = 0.06), MSS (adjusted HR = 1.48;95%CI = 0.97-2.25; p = 0.07), and OS (adjusted HR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.85-1.85; p = 0.25). Increased age, arm location, increased Breslow-thickness, ulceration, increased mitotic rate, and positive SLN-status were significantly associated with decreased DFI, MSS, and OS. Histology, sex, and SES were not associated. CONCLUSION: Obesity was not associated with DFI, MSS, or OS in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma who underwent SLNB.","Deckers, Eric A; Kruijff, Schelto; Bastiaannet, Esther; van Ginkel, Robert J; Hoekstra-Weebers, Josette E H M; Hoekstra, Harald J",J Surg Oncol,463,16

Participants aged 60-78 years were randomized to either a control group (n = 15) or a tai chi group (n = 15) for a 10-week period. The tai chi group received two, 8-form tai chi classes of 60 min duration per week. Changes in psychoemotional state, cognition, and the learning of fast and accurate reaching movements were assessed. In addition, the potential roles of the autonomic nervous system and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. Tai chi practice decreased (P < 0.05) perceived stress, whereas no change in autonomic nervous system activity was observed. Improvements in mental switching correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased BDNF levels (P < 0.05), whereas improvements in inhibitory control tended to correlate with BDNF levels (P = 0.08). Improvements in visuospatial processing tended to correlate with decreased depressive symptoms (P = 0.07) while improved visuospatial processing correlated with improved motor planning during learning tasks (P < 0.05). This study suggests that tai chi is an effective intervention that can be delivered under pandemic conditions to improve mental and physical function in older adults.","Solianik, Rima; Mickeviciene, Dalia; Zlibinaite, Laura; Cekanauskaite, Agne",Exp Gerontol,463,27

Older adults were disproportionally affected by routine care disruption. To our knowledge, no data has been published so far on the impact of service disruption on 30-day readmission. Methods We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted to a single east London hospital with laboratory-confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 between 16th March and 6th April 2020. Older patients were defined as aged 80 years and over. Readmission was captured within 30 days of discharge. Comparator defined as the same period in 2019. Descriptive statistics were used. Results Three hundred and ninety-three patients were included. The majority survived to discharge (69.7%). Positive laboratory testing was similar between older and younger patients (85.7% vs 84.7%, p = NS). Mortality was significantly higher for older patients on index presentation (60.2% vs 20.3%, p &lt; 0.001). Length of stay was also significantly longer for these patients (median 9 vs 7 days, p = 0.00694). The readmission rate for the 274 individuals discharged after index admission was 11.3% (n = 31). Amongst older patients, readmission rate during the study period was slightly higher than the same period in 2019 (17.9% vs 14.8%, p = 0.36). The median time interval between discharge and re-attendance was 8 [1–29]days. All re-attending older patients were re-admitted, whereas 54.2% of younger patients were sent home directly from the emergency department. Only 1 of the 31 patients re-attended because of insufficient social care. Conclusions Our data shows that readmission rates in the older population of East London during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were largely similar to non-pandemic periods. During this period, readmission rates appear to have been driven by clinical rather than social imperatives. This suggests that adapted social care services performed well and should be reinforced for future surges.","Mooney, C. J.; Hone, L.; Majid, M.; Cai, J.; Mieiro, L.; Fink, D.

Herein, we applied qPCR, high-throughput sequencing of the genes encoding 16S and ITS rRNA to render the bacterial/fungal dynamics of ambient PM2.5 filters maintained at constant conditions of temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%). The incubation experiments which lasted for 50 days aim to simulate a metabolic process of microbe in two types PM2.5 (polluted and non-polluted). The results show that microbial community species in polluted PM2.5 had faster decay rates, more bacterial diversity and less fungal community compared to the non-polluted ones. For bacteria, the proportion of anaerobic species is higher than aerobic ones, and their performance of contain mobile elements, form-biofilms, and pathogenic risks declined rapidly as times went by. Whereas for fungi, saprotroph species occupied about 70% of the population, resulting in a specified peak of abundance due to the adequacy nutrients supplied by the apoptosis cells. Combining the classified microbial species, we found stable community structure and the volatile ones related to the various metabolic survival strategies during different time. Without the input of peripheral environment, the health risks of airborne microbe descend to a healthy level after 20 days, implying their biologic effectiveness was about 20 days no matter the air is polluted or not. This study provided new insights into the different metabolic survival of airborne microorganisms in ideal and stable conditions.","Xu, Caihong; Chen, Hui; Liu, Zhe; Sui, Guodong; Li, Dan; Kan, Haidong; Zhao, Zhuohui; Hu, Wei; Chen, Jianmin",Environ Int,463,16

As of November 11th, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 189 countries/regions around the world, with a total of 51,510,611 confirmed cases and more than 1,275,211 deaths, with a global fatality rate of 2.48% (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Therefore, countries are facing lockdown crises and their populations face daily lives full of chaos, anxiety, and reorganization. The characteristics of this epidemic are most often described as ""unprecedented"" and replete with ""uncertainty"" (Davidson et al., 2020). In order to prevent the spread of this virus, health measures such as quarantine, wearing protective masks, and enforced lockdowns have been adopted by governments around the world, producing psychosocial (emotional distress, anxiety, suicide) and economic side-effects (Lima et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020). Despite its close geographical proximity to China, Taiwan's number of confirmed infections has been relatively small (584 people diagnosed as of November 11th, with 7 total COVID-19-related fatalities; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Taiwan's tragic experience 17 years ago with the SARS epidemic helped prepare the government to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 threat, make thorough preparations and advanced deployments, and formulate relevant anti-epidemic border control measures, quarantine and isolation measures, mask-wearing requirements, and public education strategies. Actions such as mask wearing, washing hands frequently, and practicing proper social distancing by the public and the government maintaining a master travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster (TOCC) database have proven effective in detecting and diagnosing cases early (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, providing first-line personnel with appropriate protective equipment, education, and training as well as timely and transparent information and epidemic prevention guidelines have kept nurses supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment, infection-prevention and control education, training and exercises, and sufficient professional knowledge and skills to provide care safely to patients (Chen et al., 2020; Huang & Chen, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Concurrently, it has been a challenge to nursing educators regarding how to suspend classes while not stopping academic education and to plan meaningful, alternative clinical experiences during the pandemic (Morin, 2020) and how to redefine and evaluate student performance to maintain teaching quality and learning effectiveness. In addition, ""disaster nursing"" is a critical area of professional knowledge for nurses in the 21st century, and all nurses should have an appropriate level of competence in professional disaster nursing. Therefore, core concepts related to infection control, disasters, and disaster preparedness should be incorporated into the curriculum and objectives. Finally, although we in Taiwan have faced the COVID-19 challenge in an environment in which the pandemic risk has been relatively well controlled, our daily lives are no longer taken for granted. When we look back on this experience, what will we learn from these experiences and how will this experience change how we approach healthcare and pandemic threats in the future? These changes will bring us more thoughts and challenges in nursing.","Chen, Shu-Ling",Hu Li Za Zhi,463,16

Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs per se, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.","Verheije, Monique H.; Raaben, Matthijs; Mari, Muriel; te Lintelo, Eddie G.; Reggiori, Fulvio; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

Thiol-modified GF–CTP electrodes were prepared using amine crosslinking chemistry and AuNPs were self-assembled obtaining highly conductive nanoelectrodes, GF–CTP–ATP–Au. All steps of electrode modifications were characterized using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic methods. GF–CTP–ATP–Au electrode was then modified with a capture DNA probe (C-ssDNA) and optimized with a target DNA probe in terms of hybridization time and temperature between 30 and 180 min and 20–50 °C, respectively. Finally, the analytic performance of the developed ssDNA biosensor was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The calibration of the sensor was obtained between 0.1 pM and 10 nM analyte working range. The limit of detection was calculated using signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) as 13 fM. Moreover, interference results for two noncomplementary DNA probes were also tested to demonstrate non-specific ssDNA interactions. An electrochemical label-free DNA impedimetric sensor was successfully developed using a novel GF–CTP–ATP–Au electrode.

Coronaviruses Spike proteins are responsible for their ability to interact with host membrane receptors and different proteins have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 interactors, among which Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Basigin2/EMMPRIN/CD147 (CD147). CD147 plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In particular, SARS-CoV recognizes the CD147 receptor expressed on the surface of host cells by its nucleocapsid protein binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ligand for CD147. However, the involvement of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still debated. Interference with both the function (blocking antibody) and the expression (knock down) of CD147 showed that this receptor partakes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided additional clues on the underlying mechanism: CD147 binding to CyPA does not play a role; CD147 regulates ACE2 levels and both receptors are affected by virus infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that CD147 is involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and represents a possible therapeutic target to challenge COVID-19.","Fenizia, Claudio; Galbiati, Silvia; Vanetti, Claudia; Vago, Riccardo; Clerici, Mario; Tacchetti, Carlo; Daniele, Tiziana",Cells,463,27

METHODS: In silico analysis was conducted to compare the blood expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes between age and gender matched cohort of hypertensive patients versus control, and to determine the effect of common cardiovascular medications on the expression of COVID-19 receptors in vitro using primary human hepatocytes. RESULTS: The transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant increase of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the blood of patients with hypertension. Treatment of primary human hepatocytes with captopril, but not enalapril, significantly increased ACE2 expression. A similar pattern of ACE2 expression was found following the in vitro treatments of rat primary cells with captopril and enalapril. Telmisartan, a second class RAAS inhibitors, did not affect ACE2 levels. We have also tested other cardiovascular medications that may be used alone, or in combination with RAAS inhibitors. Some of these medications increased TMPRSS2, while others, like furosemide, significantly reduced COVID-19 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in ACE2 expression levels could be due to chronic use of RAAS inhibitors or alternatively caused by other hypertension-related factors or presence of other comorbidities. Treatment of common co-morbidities often require chronic use of multiple medications, which may result in an additive increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our data suggest that more research is needed to determine the effect of different medications, as well as medication combinations, on COVID-19 receptors.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamoudi, Rifat; Kashour, Tarek; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Int J Cardiol Hypertens,463,29

However, concerns have been raised regarding the pandemic´s impact and associated containment measures (e.g. curfew, lockdown) on non‐COVID‐19‐related acute medical diseases. OBJECTIVES: To investigate changes in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) during the COVID‐19 pandemic compared to the period prior to the pandemic and reference periods in previous years. METHODS: In this single‐center study, we explored all diagnostic imaging tests performed for suspected PE between week 1‐17 of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Incidence of PE (i.e. primary outcome) was analyzed. Secondary outcomes included number of imaging tests for suspected PE. RESULTS: Compared to week 1‐11, 2020, an abrupt decline in PE diagnosis (mean weekly rate: 5.2 [95%CI: 3.8‐6.6] vs. 1.8 [0.0‐3.6]) and imaging tests (32.5 [27.5‐37.6] vs. 17.3 [11.6‐23.1]) was observed from week 12, with beginning of the containment measures and public lockdown in Austria. Compared to week 12‐17 of 2018 and 2019, PE incidence and imaging tests were similarly decreased from 5.3 [3.6‐7.1] to 1.8 [0.0‐3.6] and 31.5 [27.1‐35.9] to 17.3 [11.6‐23.1]), respectively. The median (IQR) sPESI score of PE patients during the pandemic was higher than in all other PE patients (3 [1‐3] vs. 1 [0‐2]; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the Covid‐19 pandemic has an impact on non‐COVID‐19‐related acute diseases as shown by the decline in incidence of PE and imaging procedures for diagnostic work‐up.

The advice of stay-at-home changed the pattern of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions within the community. To examine how CO(2) emissions responded to the COVID-19 measures at neighborhood scale, anonymized mobility data released by Google and Apple, and traffic congestion information from TomTom were used to track daily and diurnal changes in emissions related to driving, cooking and metabolic breathing in a residential neighborhood of Singapore, in which the anthropogenic and biogenic fluxes of CO(2) have been widely characterized. During the lockdown, traffic emissions dropped 41%, but emissions from cooking and metabolic breathing increased 21% and 20%, respectively. The uptake of CO(2) by vegetation was not able to offset these emissions, and after adding the biogenic contribution from soil and plants, a net reduction of 24% was found. During the following six months the city got its pace back, with the rate of CO(2) emissions reaching similar or slightly higher levels than those predicted before the pandemic crisis. Unfortunately, the stark drop in emissions was just a temporary relief, which reduced only 3.5% the annual CO(2) flux over the studied neighborhood.","Velasco, Erik",Urban Clim,463,16

Endoscopic nasal polypectomy under local anaesthesia offers instant relief in selected patients with obstructive chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We aimed to analyse patient tolerability during the procedure while measuring its effectiveness. METHODS: A prospective study of patients who underwent in-office microdebrider-assisted polypectomy under local anaesthetic from September 2018 to November 2019 in a Spanish tertiary hospital was performed. The tolerability was measured by monitoring vital signs during the procedure and using a visual analogue scale posteriorly. The effectiveness was calculated through patient-reported outcomes (SNOT-22) and endoscopic evaluation 1 and 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included, with a mean age of 60.7 years. The mean visual analogue scale score was 2.76 out of 10 points. Vital signs were steady overall, with a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001) in systolic pressure during the procedure. Presyncope and epistaxis were among the few mild complications. However, we registered one major complication that required intensive care admission. There was a 64% reduction in the SNOT-22 score in the first month, with a maintained effect after 6 months. Patients with asthma and a higher polyp load were the subgroups that required more time to achieve significant improvement.

Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Lu, Mijia; Zhang, Yuexiu; Dravid, Piyush; Li, Anzhong; Zeng, Cong; KC, Mahesh; Trivedi, Sheetal; Sharma, Himanshu; Chaiwatpongsakorn, Supranee; Zani, Ashley; Kenney, Adam; Cai, Chuanxi; Ye, Chengjin; Liang, Xueya; Qiu, Jianming; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Yount, Jacob S.; Boyaka, Prosper N.; Liu, Shan-Lu; Peeples, Mark E.; Kapoor, Amit; Li, Jianrong",J Virol,463,17

The plant traditional medical application indicates great antimicrobial properties, so E. camaldulensis essential oils and plant extracts have been widely examined. Essential oil of E. camaldulensis is active against many Gram positive (0.07–1.1%) and Gram negative bacteria (0.01–3.2%). The antibacterial effect is confirmed for bark and leaf extracts (conc. from 0.08 μg/mL to 200 mg/mL), with significant variations depending on extraction procedure. Eucalyptus camaldulensis essential oil and extracts are among the most active against bacteria when compared with those from other species of genus Eucalyptus. The most fungal model organisms are sensitive to 0.125–1.0% of E. camaldulensis essential oil. The extracts are active against C. albicans (0.2–200 mg/mL leaf extracts and 0.5 mg/mL bark extracts), and against various dermatophytes. Of particular importance is considerable the extracts’ antiviral activity against animal and human viruses (0.1–50 μg/mL). Although the antiprotozoal activity of E. camaldulensis essential oil and extracts is in the order of magnitude of concentration several hundred mg/mL, it is considerable when taking into account current therapy cost, toxicity, and protozoal growing resistance. Some studies show that essential oils’ and extracts’ antimicrobial activity can be further potentiated in combinations with antibiotics (beta-lactams, fluorochinolones, aminoglycosides, polymyxins), antivirals (acyclovir), and extracts of other plants (e.g. Annona senegalensis; Psidium guajava). The present data confirm the river red gum considerable antimicrobial properties, which should be further examined with particular attention to the mechanisms of antimicrobial activity.","Aleksic Sabo, Verica; Knezevic, Petar",Ind Crops Prod,463,5

Indeed, severe infection increases the risk of heart failure among patients with COVID-19. In most patients, heart failure arises from complex interactions between pre-existing conditions, cardiac injury, renin-angiotensin system activation, and the effects of systemic inflammation on the cardiovascular system. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding pathogen-driven heart failure occurring during treatment for COVID-19, the potential effects of commonly used cardiovascular and anti-infective drugs in these patients, and possible directions for establishing a theoretical basis for clinical treatment.","Yi, Yang; Xu, Yanan; Jiang, Haibing; Wang, Jun",Front Cardiovasc Med,463,1

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between the severity of COVID‐19 and oxidative stress parameters. Clinical data of 77 patients with COVID‐19 admitted to the hospital were analyzed and divided into moderate (n = 44) and severe (n = 33) groups based on their clinical condition. Production of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and defense antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione s-transferase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and sulfhydryl) were assessed using the serum samples. The results revealed that severe patients who presented high serum leukocyte count and CRP level stayed for a longer period in the hospital. However, there was no correlation observed between the oxidative stress parameters and degree of COVID-19 severity in the present study. In conclusion, these results indicate that the disease severity may not be a detrimental factor contributing to the changes in the redox profile of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Gadotti, Ana C.; Lipinski, Anna L.; Vasconcellos, Franciane TF.; Marqueze, Luis F.; Cunha, Eduardo BB.; Campos, Amanda C.; Oliveira, Camila F.; Amaral, Andréa NM.; Baena, Cristina P.; Telles, João P.; Tuon, Felipe F.; Pinho, Ricardo A.",Free Radic Biol Med,463,1

These attributes are complementary to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing, which may be used to inform community seroprevalence rates. METHODS: The Luminex xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen assay utilizes magnetic beads labeled with three viral antigens (nucleocapsid [NC], receptor binding domain [RBD], spike S1 subunit) to detect anti-viral IgG-class antibodies, and has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in serum and plasma. This assay was modified for use with DBS and validated against paired sera tested by one of two reference assays: the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA or the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. RESULTS: 159 paired DBS and serum specimens analyzed using the modified Luminex xMAP assay on DBS and the reference methods on serum showed an overall concordance of 96.9% (154/159). Use of multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR) for post-analytical interpretation of the Luminex xMAP DBS assay results, instead of manufacturer provided interpretive thresholds, increased overall qualitative result concordance to 99.4% (158/159) between the modified Luminex xMAP DBS and reference results. CONCLUSIONS: Use of DBS for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provides comparable results to those obtained using serum. DBS concordance was improved with multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR). We demonstrate that DBS are a reliable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using the modified Luminex xMAP assay.","Turgeon, Coleman T.; Sanders, Karen A.; Rinaldo, Piero; Granger, Dane; Hilgart, Heather; Matern, Dietrich; Theel, Elitza S.",PLoS One,463,9

The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular and the humoral sides, with neutralizing antibodies fundamentally directed against the S antigen. Although the seroprevalence data are frequently assumed as protection markers, no necessarily they are. In Spain, it is estimated that, to assure the herd immunity, at least four-fifths of the population should be immunoprotected.

While such waivers are mandated to include evaluations of their impact, randomization – the gold standard for assessing causality – has not typically been a consideration. In a critical departure, the Commonwealth of Kentucky opted to pursue a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) for their controversial 2018 Medicaid Demonstration waiver, which included work requirements as a condition for the subset of beneficiaries deemed able-bodied to maintain eligibility for benefits. Beneficiaries were randomized 9:1 to the new waiver program or a control group who would retain their current benefits as part of the existing Medicaid expansion program. To address potential bias from differential attrition from the Medicaid program that would accrue from solely analyzing administrative data, our team designed a rich, prospective, longitudinal survey to collect primary and secondary outcomes from six categories of interest to policymakers: insurance coverage, health care utilization and quality, health behaviors, socioeconomic measures, personal finances, and health outcomes. At baseline, a subset of survey participants was invited to participate in the collection of biometric samples via in-person follow-up visits, and a cross-section were also invited to participate in qualitative interviews. While the demonstration waiver was terminated before the program began, our study design illustrates that it is possible for other researchers and state agencies seeking to evaluate Medicaid demonstration waivers and other demonstration policies to work together to implement high quality randomized trials – even for controversial policies.","Linn, Kristin A.; Underhill, Kristen; Dixon, Erica L.; Bair, Elizabeth F.; Ferrell, William J.; Montgomery, Margrethe E.; Volpp, Kevin G.; Venkataramani, Atheendar S.",Contemp Clin Trials,463,16

The detection of pathogenic RNA viruses is based on modern molecular methods, of which the most widely used methods are the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All steps of RT-PCR and qRT-PCR should be strictly controlled to ensure the validity of obtained results. False-negative results may be caused not only by inhibition of RT or/and PCR steps but also by failure of the nucleic acid extraction step, particularly in the case of viral RNA extraction. The control of nucleic acid extraction generally involves the utilization of a non-pathogenic virus (process control virus) of similar structural properties to those of the target virus. Although in clinical samples the use of such process control virus is only recommended, in other kinds of settings such as food matrices its use is necessary. Currently, several different process control viruses are used for these purposes. Process control viruses can also be constructed artificially using technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles, which have many advantages in comparison with other used controls and are especially suited for controlling the detection and quantification of certain types of RNA viruses. The technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles is theoretically well established, uses the knowledge gained from the study of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 and utilizes many different approaches for the construction of the various process control viruses. Nevertheless, the practical use of MS2 phage-like particles in routine diagnostics is relatively uncommon. The current situation with regard to the use of MS2 phage-like particles as process control viruses in detection of RNA viruses and different methods of their construction, purification and use are summarized and discussed in this review.","Mikel, P.; Vasickova, P.; Kralik, P.",Food Environ Virol,463,13

It specifically engages rural women's interpretations of rural distance as a multifaceted dimension of accessing health care, which includes but is not limited to women's health services and maternity care. Presenting qualitative research with 51 women in a rural region of the U.S., thematic findings reveal an interpretation of barriers to rural health care as moral failings rather than as purely spatial or operational challenges, along with wide communication of negative health care experiences owing to spatially-disparate but trusted social networks. Amid or owing to the rural crisis context, medical mistrust here emerges as a meaningful but largely unrecognized barrier to rural women's ability—and willingness—to obtain health care. This underscores how a novel interpretation of distance may inform policy efforts to address rural medical deserts.","Statz, Michele; Evers, Kaylie",Health Place,463,1

Body position is an important technique that effectively restores and increases lung functions. We aimed to address the possible changes in spirometric parameters in asymptomatic overweight individuals with central obesity with a change in posture from sitting to supine in comparison to normal weight non-obese ones. METHODS: Enrolled subjects were healthy Egyptian males, aged between 20–45 years old, asymptomatic and nonsmokers. They underwent spirometry. The following parameters were measured; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV(1)/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75%. They were classified into overweight with central obesity (n=40) and healthy control (n=40) groups based on their body mass index (BMI), weight-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC). Spirometric parameters were compared between the 2 groups and in both setting and supine positions. RESULTS: The central obesity group showed significantly lower all spirometric parameters in comparison to the control one. All measured spirometric parameters had a significant reduction with supine position. There were negative correlations between both the WC and WHR and spirometric parameters. CONCLUSION: In this study of young Egyptian males, individuals with central obesity had reduced spirometric parameters in comparison to healthy ones. Change in position from sitting to supine has significant effects on spirometric parameters in both healthy middle age males with normal weight and those with overweight and central obesity. These results could have important clinical implications.","Abd-Elaleem, Nermeen A.; Mohamed, Sherif A.

After describing our theoretical framework and qualitative methods, we discuss the economic history of the addressed areas and show how non-climatic factors, such as colonialism, influence these communities’ experiences. This context allows us to better understand indigenous people’s experience of seasonal variations, precipitations and climatic events, its effect on their livelihoods, and their adaptive strategies in response to challenges imposed by climate unpredictability and broader transformations in their territories.

While clinicians seek for a vaccine to reduce the epidemic outbreak, environmental engineers need to understand consequence of virus entity in sewage given the reported persistency of viruses in human feces and sewage environments for more than days. Herein, we discuss about concerns associated with virus occurrence in human feces and sewage, with attention to the possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, based on the review of recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 as well as the previous pandemic events. Given the reported environmental stability of coronavirus, the feces- and sewage-derived transmission routes may be of importance to prevent unprecedented spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) particularly in developing countries. However, so far, limited number of studies detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 even in human feces, whereas a number of virus RNA copies were identified in both feces and sewage specimens. Therefore, uncertainty remains in the possibility of this transmission pathway, and further investigation is warranted in future studies, for example, by increasing the number of specimens, examining the effectiveness of methods for viral viability test, considering the patient medical history, and so forth.","Elsamadony, Mohamed; Fujii, Manabu; Miura, Takayuki; Watanabe, Toru",Sci Total Environ,463,6

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of household index cases reported from February 7-27, 2021. A propensity-score matched cohort was derived to calculate adjusted estimates. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort of all private households with index cases. We excluded cases in congregate settings, as well as households with one individual or with >1 case with the same earliest symptom onset date. EXPOSURE: VOC status, defined as either individuals confirmed as B.1.1.7 using whole genome sequencing or those that screened positive for the N501Y mutation using real-time PCR. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Household secondary attack rate, defined as the number of household secondary cases that occurred 1-14 days after the index case divided by the total number of household secondary contacts. RESULTS: We included 1,259 index VOC and non-VOC cases in the propensity score-matched analysis. The secondary attack rate for VOC index cases in this matched cohort was 1.31 times higher than non-VOC index cases (RR=1.31, 95%CI 1.14-1.49), similar to the unadjusted estimate. In stratified analyses, the higher secondary attack rate for VOC compared to non-VOC index cases was accentuated for asymptomatic index cases (RR=1.91, 95% CI 0.96-3.80) and presymptomatic cases (RR=3.41, 95%CI 1.13-10.26) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides strong evidence of increased transmissibility in households due to VOCs and suggests that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission may be of particular importance for VOCs. Our study suggests that more aggressive public health measures will be needed to control VOCs and that ongoing research is needed to understand mechanisms of VOC transmissibility to curb their associated morbidity and mortality.","Buchan, S.

Here we inspected sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity, hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), sera immune profiling, and two single-cell RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) profiles from nasal tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Our propensity score-matching observations revealed that male individuals have a 29% increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with a hazard ration (HR) 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.48) for hospitalization and HR 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.84) for admission to ICU. Sera from male patients at hospital admission had decreased lymphocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and neutrophils). We found that SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN and NRP1, have elevated expression in nasal squamous cells from males with moderate and severe COVID-19. Cell-cell network proximity analysis suggests possible epithelium-immune cell interactions and immune vulnerability underlying a higher mortality in males with COVID-19. Monocyte-elevated expression of Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is associated with severe outcomes in males with COVID-19. These findings provide basis for understanding immune responses underlying sex differences, and designing sex-specific targeted treatments and patient care for COVID-19.","Hou, Yuan; Zhou, Yadi; Gack, Michaela U.; Lathia, Justin D.; Kallianpur, Asha; Mehra, Reena; Chan, Timothy; Jung, Jae U.; Jehi, Lara; Eng, Charis; Cheng, Feixiong",bioRxiv,463,29

Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor‐mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV‐1 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV‐1 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high‐affinity rhodamine‐dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA‐AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome‐resident two‐pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium‐mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. TPCs might represent a novel therapeutic target against HIV‐1 infection and HIV‐associated neurological complications.","Khan, Nabab; Halcrow, Peter W.; Lakpa, Koffi L.; Afghah, Zahra; Miller, Nicole M.; Dowdy, Steven F.; Geiger, Jonathan D.; Chen, Xuesong",FASEB J,463,3

In Bhutan, the index case was a 76-year-old immunocompromised man who had traveled from the United States and entered Bhutan as a tourist. He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and later a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All contacts were traced and quarantined. The patient’s respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals, antibiotics, and intensive supportive care. He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to modulate his likely aberrant immune response. Subsequently, the patient’s clinical status improved, and after 8 days of hospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered. This was a learning experience for the treating medical staff, the government, and the people of Bhutan.","LeVine, Shankar; Dhakal, Guru Prasad; Penjor, Tshering; Chuki, Pem; Namgyal, Kesang; Tshokey,; Watts, Melanie",Am J Trop Med Hyg,463,20

She describes three ways that she has found to be effective in pushing beyond boundaries: international collaborations, interactions with global social movements, and anti-racist work.

It causes more 3.8 millions deaths. Based on a previous symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE) and the clinic data of the first COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, this paper determines the parameters of SARDDE. Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 95.5% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Shanghai. The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Shanghai government is not only very effective but also completely necessary. The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the day after about 19 days at the turning point can estimate well the following outcomes of the COVID-19 academic. It is expected that the research can provide better understanding, explaining, and dominating for epidemic spreads, prevention and control measures.","Min, L.",,463,1
