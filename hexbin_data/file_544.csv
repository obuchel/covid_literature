7599,Avian flu: What the otolaryngologist needs to know,2006-10-27,"BACKGROUND: Lung recruitment at birth has been advocated as an effective method of improving the respiratory transition at birth. Sustained inflations (SI) and dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were assessed in clinical and animal studies to define the optimal level. Our working hypothesis was that very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) < 32 weeks’ gestation require an individualized lung recruitment based on combining both manoeuvers. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 91 and 72 inborn VLGAI, requiring a respiratory support beyond a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) = 5 cmH2O, were enrolled before and after introducing these manoeuvers based on progressive increase in SI up to 15 s, with simultaneous gradual increase in PEEP up to 15 cmH2O, according to the cardiorespiratory response. Retrospective comparisons of the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) < 72 h of life, short-term and before discharge morbidity were then performed. RESULTS: Among extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) < 29 weeks’ gestation, the following outcomes decreased significantly: intubation (90 to 55%) and surfactant administration (54 to 12%) in the delivery room, MV (92 to 71%) and its mean duration < 72 h of life (45 h to 13 h), administration of a 2nd dose of surfactant (35 to 12%) and postnatal corticosteroids (52 to 19%), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 to 5%). Among VLGAI, all of these results were also significant. Neonatal mortality and morbidity were not different. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, combining two individualized lung recruitment maneuvers at birth was feasible and may be beneficial on short-term and before discharge pulmonary outcomes. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these results.","Kanaan, Zalfa; Bloch-Queyrat, Coralie; Boubaya, Marouane; Lévy, Vincent; Bolot, Pascal; Waszak, Paul",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114798/,544
20872,Letter to the Editor Regarding “Research Equity in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery”,2021-09-03,"Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) remains the major parameter for diagnosis, phenotyping, prognosis and treatment decisions in heart failure. The 2016 ESC heart failure guidelines introduced a third EF category for an EF of 40–49%, defined as heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF). This category has been largely unexplored compared with heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF; defined as EF <40% in this Review) and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF; defined as EF ≥50%). The prevalence of HFmrEF within the overall population of patients with HF is 10–25%. HFmrEF seems to be an intermediate clinical entity between HFrEF and HFpEF in some respects, but more similar to HFrEF in others, in particular with regard to the high prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in these patients. HFmrEF is milder than HFrEF, and the risk of cardiovascular events is lower in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF than in those with HFrEF. By contrast, the risk of non-cardiovascular adverse events is similar or greater in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF than in those with HFrEF. Evidence from post hoc and subgroup analyses of randomized clinical trials and a trial of an SGLT1–SGLT2 inhibitor suggests that drugs that are effective in patients with HFrEF might also be effective in patients with HFmrEF. Although the EF is a continuous measure with considerable variability, in this comprehensive Review we suggest that HFmrEF is a useful categorization of patients with HF and shares the most important clinical features with HFrEF, which supports the renaming of HFmrEF to HF with mildly reduced EF.","Savarese, Gianluigi; Stolfo, Davide; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Lund, Lars H.",Nat Rev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420965/,544

36991,Fine Governance of Difficult Tracheostomy in Difficult Airway with Stridor and Respiratory Distress,2020-07-21,"Linearizability is the de facto correctness criterion for concurrent data type implementations. Violation of linearizability is witnessed by an error trace in which the outputs of individual operations do not match those of a sequential execution of the same operations. Extensive work has been done in discovering linearizability violations, but little work has been done in trying to provide useful hints to the programmer when a violation is discovered by a tester tool. In this paper, we propose an approach that identifies the root causes of linearizability errors in the form of code blocks whose atomicity is required to restore linearizability. The key insight of this paper is that the problem can be reduced to a simpler algorithmic problem of identifying minimal root causes of conflict serializability violation in an error trace combined with a heuristic for identifying which of these are more likely to be the true root cause of non-linearizability. We propose theoretical results outlining this reduction, and an algorithm to solve the simpler problem. We have implemented our approach and carried out several experiments on realistic concurrent data types demonstrating its efficiency.","Çirisci, Berk; Enea, Constantin; Farzan, Azadeh; Mutluergil, Suha Orhun",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363227/,544
38384,Pediatric Tracheostomy at a Tertiary Healthcare Institution: A Retrospective Study Focused on Outcomes,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines emphasize prompt antiviral treatment in severe influenza patients. Although nearly a 50% of severe influenza present with pneumonia, the effect of early (≤ 2 days after illness onset) neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) use on the clinical outcomes of influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) has rarely been assessed. Furthermore, data about the administration of NAIs in the real-world management of Flu-p in China are limited. METHODS: Data of patients hospitalised with FluA-p from five teaching hospitals in China from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. The impact of early NAI therapy on the outcomes in FluA-p patients, and the indications of early NAI administration by clinicians were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 693 FluA-p patients were included. Of these patients, 33.5% (232/693) were treated early. After adjusting for weighted propensity scores for treatment, systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use, a multivariate logistic regression model showed that early NAI therapy was associated with decreased risk for invasive ventilation [odds ratio (OR) 0.511, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.312–0.835, p = 0.007) and 30-day mortality (OR 0.533, 95% CI 0.210–0.807, p < 0.001) in FluA-p patients. A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed early NAI use (OR 0.415, 95% CI 0.195–0.858, p = 0.001) was a predictor for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients and a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test was the only indication (OR 3.586, 95% CI 1.259–10.219, p < 0.001) related to the prescription of early NAI by clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Early NAI therapy is associated with better outcomes in FluA-p patients. Improved education and training of clinicians on the guidelines of influenza are needed.","Chen, Liang; Han, Xiudi; Li, Yan Li; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xing, Xiqian",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7447583/,544
52521,Bacterial Biofilms on Tracheostomy Tubes,2021-05-06,"Introduction: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring urgent treatment. Euglycemic DKA may occur in patients with both type 1 and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), as well as pregnancy. The absence of marked hyperglycemia can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, resulting in potential adverse outcomes. Diabetes is a major comorbidity associated with severe hospital course and high fatality rate among patients with COVID-19 infection. We report our experience in a patient with gestational diabetes mellitus who developed euglycemic DKA and COVID-19 infection in her third trimester of pregnancy. Clinical Case: A 30-year-old lady at 29weeks gestation presented with two-day history of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. She reported good fetal movements. She had been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) at 20 weeks gestational age, receiving treatment with multiple daily injections of insulin. 5 days earlier, she had tested positive for COVID-19 infection. She was asymptomatic; testing was performed as she had been in contact with a confirmed case. On examination she was afebrile and vitally stable, but dehydrated. Her initial laboratory investigations showed ketonemia with normal glucose level and normal anion gap. She was treated as a case of starvation ketosis and dehydration, with intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement. However, 3 days later, the patient complained of worsening nausea and vomiting with dry cough and she developed hypotension. Chest X-ray showed bilateral mid and lower zone pulmonary infiltrates. She was treated as COVID-19 pneumonia, received 2 units of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Repeated investigations showed worsening ketosis with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, consistent with a diagnosis of euglycemic DKA. Insulin infusion was initiated, isotonic saline with electrolyte replacement was also continued. She symptomatically improved over the next two days, with resolution of ketonemia and acidosis. The patient was discharged and she was well at her outpatient follow up visit. She underwent emergency Cesarean Section at 37 weeks gestational age, due to non-reassuring electronic fetal monitoring. She delivered a healthy female infant weighing 2445grams. Conclusion: Pregnancy is a high-risk period for DKA particularly when associated with other stressors that were identified in our patient – GDM, restricted calorie intake and COVID-19 infection. Diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe forms of COVID-19 and on the other hand, COVID-19 infection is associated with poor glycemic control and higher risk of hyperglycemic emergencies including ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. Prompt recognition of euglycemic DKA is critical in pregnancy, as this condition is associated with high fetal mortality rates.","Karuppasamy, Gowri; Saud, Arwa Al; Abuhaliqa, Wajeeha Mousa",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089780/,544
54419,A Study of JCIH (Joint Commission on Infant Hearing) Risk Factors for Hearing Loss in Babies of NICU and Well Baby Nursery at a Tertiary Care Center,2021-06-15,"School disengagement is a critical factor that will likely exacerbate long-standing racial inequities in educational outcomes during the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Due to their training and contact with at-risk students, school social workers and other school-based mental health professionals (SMHP) are in an ideal position to understand the impact of COVID-19 and virtual learning on K–12 students. To that end, this study reports on findings from a survey of SMHP about the differential impact that the COVID-19 outbreak is having on students and their families. The findings suggest that COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on families overall, especially among populations who were experiencing hardships before the current outbreak. In addition, several barriers were noted for student learning, with many students—particularly students of color—completely disengaging from school during spring 2020. However, SMHP reported several important insights on how to support students and their families—some requiring immediate action on the part of school districts and others requiring greater community-level investment into the economic, social, emotional, and overall health of families. Findings are discussed in light of addressing disengagement and educational inequities for students of color.","Jones, Tiffany M; Williford, Anne; Spencer, Michael S; Riggs, Nathaniel R; Toll, Rebecca; George, Melissa; Becker, Kaylee; Bruick, Samantha",Child Sch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194900/,544

Whether SAT represents a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still unclear. Our aim was to systematically review the literature to 1) explore the size of the literature about SAT in COVID-19 and 2) evaluate the clinical characteristics of SAT. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were searched until April 20, 2021. Original papers, case reports, and case series reporting SAT in COVID-19 patients were included. Authors and their country, journal, year of publication, COVID-19 and SAT clinical presentation, thyroid function, therapy, and follow-up data were extracted. Nineteen papers (17 case reports and 2 case series) were included, describing 27 patients, 74.1% females, aged 18 to 69 years. COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in 66.7% cases and required hospitalization in 11.1%. In 83.3% cases, SAT occurred after COVID-19. Neck pain was present in 92.6% cases and fever in 74.1%. Median TSH, fT3, and fT4 were 0.01 mU/l, 10.79 pmol/l, and 27.2 pmol/l, respectively. C-reactive-protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated in 96% of cases. Typical ultrasonographic characteristics of SAT were observed in 83.3% of cases. Steroids were the most frequent SAT therapy. Complete remission of SAT was recorded in most cases. In conclusion, the size and quality of published data of SAT in COVID-19 patients are poor, with only case reports and case series being available. SAT clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients seems to be similar to what is generally expected.","Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Cappelli, Carlo; Croce, Laura; Scappaticcio, Lorenzo; Chiovato, Luca; Rotondi, Mario",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511511/,544

While a lot more studies were done using in vitro and in vivo research platforms, much fewer investigations were conducted according to evidence-based requirements in clinical settings. The Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has had the opportunity to collaborate with clinicians over the years to initiate and conduct dozens of clinical trials investigating and verifying the therapeutic values of Chinese herbs in selected disease conditions. Of the many disorders, we chose to focus on those that are known for their difficulties achieving perfect results with conventional treatment methods. Examples include non-healing ulcers, allergic conditions, degenerative diseases and cancer. Protective effects of the herbs in such chronic diseases as coronary artery disease and osteoporosis were also part of our focus. Even in healthy individuals and those recovering from chemotherapy, Chinese herbs could help with the immune system and were studied in our clinical trials as well. This paper aims to highlight the important findings from these clinical studies while at the same time, stressing the indispensable value of clinical trials in modernizing the use of Chinese herbs in present-day medicine.","Liang, Willmann; Yew, David T; Hon, Kam Lun; Wong, Chun Kwok; Kwok, Timothy C Y; Leung, Ping Chung",The American journal of Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0192415x14500384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871653/,544

The objective of the study was to determine blood levels of BAC under maximal use conditions. Subjects were enlisted to wash their hands 60 seconds with soap containing 0.13% BAC 30 times per day over an 8-9 hour time period for 5 consecutive days. The test product with the highest absorption potential was selected based on market share and results from in vitro permeation testing. Blood plasma was collected from subjects on 32 occasions over the 6-day study period. Plasma samples were analyzed for the C12 and C14 homologs of BAC using LC-MS/MS with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 106.9 and 32.6 ng/L, respectively. For the 32 subjects, C12 homolog was detected above the LLOQ in only four of 1,024 plasma samples at 117.8-191.7 ng/L, and C14 homolog was detected in only one sample at 59.5 ng/L.

61706,Olfactory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: Prevalence and Prognosis for Recovering Sense of Smell.,2020-07-14,"Cordyceps guangdongensis T. H. Li, Q. Y. Lin & B. Song (Cordycipitaceae) is a novel food approved by the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2013. Preliminary studies revealed that this novel food has multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-fatigue effect, antioxidant ability, prolonging life, anti-avian influenza virus activity, and therapeutic effect on chronic renal failure. However, the anti-inflammatory effect on chronic bronchitis and the effective constituent are still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate both the anti-inflammatory effect of the edible fungus on experimental rats with chronic bronchitis induced by tobacco smoking, and the pilot effective constituent. Test rats were intragastrically administered with 3 doses of hot-water extract from C. guangdongensis (0.325, 0.65 and 1.30 g kg(-1) bw daily for low, middle and high dose, respectively) for 26 days. Biochemical indices and histological examinations in rats with chronic bronchitis induced by tobacco smoking were determined. The content and molecular weights of the polysaccharide from the hot-water extract were detected by the phenol-sulfuric acid method and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. Biochemical indices in the low, middle and high-dose groups with the hot-water extract of C. guangdongensis were only 53.4%, 46.0% and 40.4% of those in the model control group (total leukocytes), respectively; 70.7%, 60.3% and 58.1% (macrophages); 33.0%, 26.8% and 16.1% (neutrophils); and 22.2%, 23.5% and 13.6% (lymphocytes) of those in the model control group. The bronchial lesions and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly alleviated in all groups with hot-water extract of C. guangdongensis. This study indicates that the hot-water extract from C. guangdongensis has a significant anti-inflammatory effect on chronic bronchitis. The content of the polysaccharide was 6.92%; the molecular weights of the 3 polysaccharide components were respectively 1.28 × 10(6), 2.36 × 10(4) and 5.21 × 10(3) Da.","Yan, Wenjuan; Li, Taihui; Zhong, Zhiyong",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00294f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135295/,544
62395,Shared Decision-making and Stakeholder Engagement in COVID-19 Tracheostomy.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive techniques have become an integral part of general surgery, with recent investigation into single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). This study presents a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial of SILC compared with four-port cholecystectomy (4PLC) with the goal of assessing safety, feasibility, and factors predicting outcomes. METHODS Patients with biliary colic and documented gallstones or polyps or with biliary dyskinesia were randomized to SILC or 4PLC. Data measures included operative details, adverse events, and conversion to 4PLC or laparotomy. Pain, cosmesis, and quality-of-life scores were documented. Patients were followed for 12 months. RESULTS Two hundred patients were randomized to SILC (n = 117) or 4PLC (n = 80) (3 patients chose not to participate after randomization). Patients were similar except for body mass index (BMI), which was lower in the SILC patients (28.9 vs. 31.0, p = 0.011). One SILC patient required conversion to 4PLC. Operative time was longer for SILC (57 vs. 45 min, p < 0.0001), but outcomes, including total adverse events, were similar (34% vs. 38%, p = 0.55). Cosmesis scores favored SILC (p < 0.002), but pain scores were lower for 4PLC (1 point difference in 10-point scale, p < 0.028) despite equal analgesia use. Wound complications were greater after SILC (10% vs. 3%, p = 0.047), but hernia recurrence was equivalent for both procedures (1.3% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.65). Univariate analysis showed female gender, SILC, and younger age to be predictors for increased pain scores, while SILC was associated with improved cosmesis scores. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter randomized controlled trial of SILC versus 4PLC, SILC appears to be safe with a similar biliary complication profile. Pain scores and wound complication rates are higher for SILC; however, cosmesis scores favored SILC. For patients preferring a better cosmetic outcome and willing to accept possible increased postoperative pain, SILC offers a safe alternative to the standard 4PLC. Further follow-up is needed to detail the long-term risk of wound morbidities, including hernia recurrence.","Phillips, Melissa S; Marks, Jeffrey M; Roberts, Kurt; Tacchino, Roberto; Onders, Raymond; DeNoto, George; Rivas, Homero; Islam, Arsalla; Soper, Nathaniel; Gecelter, Gary; Rubach, Eugene; Paraskeva, Paraskevas; Shah, Sajani",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2028-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083331/,544

Amputation of a toe led to healing in three patients (4%) and one patient required a below-knee amputation. Six patients died and three withdrew. Adding a skilled IPDFUT that is trained to work together resulted in improved healing outcomes. The rate of healing, proportion of wounds closed and complication rate were similar if not better than the results published previously in Canada and around the world.

66224,COVID-19 and the Widening Gap in Health Inequity.,2020-05-05,"Emerging vector-borne diseases are an important issue in global health. Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, while many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and emergence of endemic pathogens are often considered to be distinct processes, many endemic pathogens are actually spreading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We draw attention to key differences between dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission after habitat change and after introduction into new regions. Local emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles, whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel where and when conditions (eg, hosts, vectors, and climate) are suitable for a pathogen. Once a pathogen is established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics can shape the evolutionary selective pressure and result in increased use of people as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that could be effective in the long term.","Kilpatrick, A Marm; Randolph, Sarah E",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(12)61151-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200503/,544

METHODS A transversal prospective study was conducted to analyze the seasonality of CRS using real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect respiratory virus genomes in secretions and tissue samples from patients with CRS with and without nasal polyps. RESULTS The frequency of viral detection was 41% (31/75). The respiratory virus most frequently detected was human rhinovirus, found in 18 patients (24%), followed by human metapneumovirus, human enterovirus, human respiratory sincicial virus, human adenovirus, human bocavirus, human coronavirus, and human influenza virus, detected in 12 (16%), five (6.6%), four (5.3%), four (5.3%), two (2.6%), two (2.6%), and one (1.3%) patient(s), respectively. Although none of the patients presented symptoms when the samples were collected, there was a peak in detection of the most prevalent virus in the autumn and winter seasons of both years, similar to the pattern that occurs in acute conditions. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of respiratory virus seasonality found in nasal mucosa, polyps, and paranasal sinus samples in patients with CRS reinforces the possibility of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections.","Lima, Jesse T; Paula, Flavia E; Proença-Modena, José L; Demarco, Ricardo C; Buzatto, Guilherme P; Saturno, Tamara H; Delcaro, Luana S; Tamashiro, Edwin; Valera, Fabiana C P; Arruda, Eurico; Anselmo-Lima, Wilma T",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2015.29.4129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590310/,544
67368,An Integrated Care Strategy for the Follow-up of Patients With COVID-19-Associated Chemosensory Dysfunction.,2020-08-18,"Infant emotion regulation has long-term implications for human development, highlighting the need for preventive interventions that support emotion regulation early in life. Such interventions may be especially important for infants higher in emotional reactivity who need to regulate their emotions more frequently and intensely than infants lower in emotional reactivity. The current randomized trial examined main and moderated effects of an attachment-based intervention on (a) infants' use of mother-oriented and self-soothing emotion regulation strategies and (b) infant emotion dysregulation in 186 low-income, predominantly Latino infants. We tested the brief (10-session) Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention in the context of home-based federal Early Head Start (EHS) services. Control participants received home-based EHS plus 10 weekly books. Intent-to-treat analyses with covariates revealed main effects of the intervention on infants' use of mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies during a brief (40-s) novel and potentially fear-inducing procedure (d = 0.31). Infant emotional reactivity moderated intervention impacts on mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies and on infant emotion dysregulation: We found stronger effects of the intervention for infants relatively higher in emotional reactivity. Findings are discussed in terms of the preventive value of attachment-based interventions for supporting early emotion regulation.","Hepworth, Allison D; Berlin, Lisa J; Martoccio, Tiffany L; Cannon, Erin N; Berger, Rebecca H; Harden, Brenda Jones",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-020-01127-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388694/,544
67620,Tracheostomy During COVID-19 Pandemic-In Search of Lost Timing-Reply.,2020-09-03,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether radiologically defined sarcopenia at the C3 or L3 level as measured by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is prognostic of overall survival (OS) in head and neck cancers (HNCs). METHODS Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on July 12, 2019, to include articles written in the English language with no constraints on publication date. To be included in the analysis, articles had to report the prognostic impact of skeletal muscle mass measured radiologically at the C3 or L3 vertebral level in HNC patients; hazard ratios (HRs) for OS; 95% confidence intervals (CIs); be from a clinical trial, cohort, or case-control study; and have English full-text availability. Articles were reviewed in consensus by two reviewers, with disagreements reviewed by a third reviewer. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Checklist guidelines were used for reporting. Study quality assessment was performed using Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. The random-effects DerSimonian and Laird method was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS Ten articles, nine retrospective and one prospective, were included in this meta-analysis (n = 2,181 patients). Significant differences were found in OS for HNC patients with sarcopenia (HR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.64-2.39; P < .00001). No heterogeneity was detected in either the overall or subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS Radiologically defined sarcopenia is a negative predictor of OS in patients with HNC. Early detection of sarcopenia in cancer patients may help guide nutritional and adjuvant support to improve treatment outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional descriptive study using an app-based survey. METHODS A link to the survey was sent via email to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app on May 20, 2020 and was open for 1 week. Participants were asked to complete the survey as it applied to their pregnancy, breastfeeding, and maternity care received during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning approximately February 2020 through the time of the survey. There were 258 respondents who completed the survey. RESULTS The majority (96.4%; n = 251) of pregnant women felt they received safe prenatal care during this time period. Slightly less 86.3% (n = 215) felt they received adequate prenatal care during this time period. 14.2% (n = 33) reported changing or considering changing the location where they planned to give birth due to COVID-19. Of those who reported they had begun purchasing items for their baby, 52.7% reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their ability to get items they need for their baby. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Although it is imperative to implement policies that reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19 to pregnant women and health care providers, it is necessary for healthcare providers and policy makers to listen to the collective voices of women during pregnancy about how COVID-19 has affected their birth and infant feeding plans and their perception of changes in prenatal care.","Burgess, Adriane; Breman, Rachel Blankstein; Bradley, Dani; Dada, Sophia; Burcher, Paul",MCN.

71369,Olfactory Loss of Function as a Possible Symptom of COVID-19.,2020-07-16,"COVID-19 is a newly emerging pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus. After its first report in China in December 2019, the disease already spread and affected more than 200 countries worldwide. It correlates with different phenotypes ranging from an acute febrile illness to severe respiratory problems. Often, patients with COVID-19 suffer from metabolic disorders, and this can result in a more severe clinical course. COVID-19 might also co-occur with other common diseases in different settings. In tropical countries, COVID-19 has already affected thousands of local populations. Tropical diseases such as dengue and tuberculosis can modify the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and result in difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients. The complexity of concurrence between COVID-19 and tropical diseases is, thus, a matter of concern in tropical medicine. This chapter is devoted to discussing problems surrounding the management of COVID-19 in tropical countries. To exemplify the effects of COVID-19 on tropical countries, the authors would show how COVID-19 has affected Indochina, a large tropical area.","Sookaromdee, Pathum; Wiwanitkit, Viroj",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973187/,544

METHODS Clinicopathological characteristics and perioperative complications were retrospectively analysed in 440 patients with stages IB1 to IIB cervical cancer. The patients were assigned to two of the following groups: LRH by our method of using anatomical landmarks (anatomical space group, n = 217) and the traditional method (traditional group, n = 223). RESULTS The mean operative duration and time of vesicouterine ligament (VUL) dissection were significantly shorter (173.87 ± 30.39 vs. 210.83 ± 44.55 minutes; 32.75 ± 7.23 vs. 43.48 ± 11.22 minutes), and blood loss was less in the anatomical space group compared with the traditional group. The rate of the intraoperative complication of ureteral injury was also significantly lower in the anatomical space group compared with the traditional group (0 vs. 5). CONCLUSIONS LRH by the anatomical method, using the axillary space and other potential spaces as anatomical landmarks, results in less blood loss and reduced ureteral injury compared with the traditional method. This method is safe and practical for separating the ureter from the VUL in patients with cervical cancer.","Wang, Jing; Sun, Lulu; Ni, Ting; Huang, Yong; Wang, Lihua; Yuan, Jiangjing; Fan, Qiong; Li, Yuhong; Wang, Yudong",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520926857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600083/,544
72274,Understanding COVID-19-Related Olfactory Dysfunction.,2020-11-19,"Ethyl carbamate (EC), a potential human dietary carcinogen, is found in fermented foods including the fermented soybean-based condiments, the major part of the Korean diet. Therefore, it is expected that their EC contents might pose health risks. Herein, we collected 111 condiments and estimated their EC contents via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Further, dietary intake of EC was evaluated, and the risk levels were assessed via the margin of exposure (MOE) approach and excess cancer risk assessment. EC contents of the condiments ranged from not detectable to 39.47 μg/kg, and the daily EC exposure ranged from 1.4 to 2.0 ng/kg BW per day, depending on gender and age groups in Korea. Of the condiments, soy sauce was the largest contributor to EC exposure. MOE and excess cancer risks for the average consumer were 166,300 and 9.0 × 10-8, respectively, and those for the consumers in the 95th percentiles (P95) were 53,504 and 2.8 × 10-7, respectively, indicating that the risk of exposure to EC is of lower concern in average consumers than heavy consumers. However, the EC exposure from condiments was higher than that in other Asian countries.Abbreviations: EC: ethyl carbamate; GC-MS: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MOE: margin of exposure; MRL: maximum residue level; IDL: instrumental detection level; IQL: instrumental quantification level; MDL: method detection level; MQL: method quantification level; EDI: estimated daily intakes; BMDL10: benchmark dose lower confidence limit.","Kim, Seungmin; Jung, Sunghyeon; Kim, Inhwan; Chung, MyungSub; Shin, Sangah; Lee, Jihyun","Food additives & contaminants.

We evaluated the safety and effectiveness data from five participating US centers. METHODS Records of patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms who underwent PED treatment between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS 26 patients with ruptured aneurysms underwent PED treatment (mean age 51.4 ± 13.2 years;16 women). At presentation, 8 patients (30.8%) had a Hunt-Hess grade of IV or above; 11 required extraventricular drain placement. Aneurysm morphologies were: 8 dissecting, 8 blister-like, 6 fusiform, and 4 saccular. There were 22 anterior circulation and 4 posterior circulation aneurysms. PED deployment was successful in all patients, with adjunctive coiling utilized in 12. Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 (19.2%), including 3 inhospital deaths. 23 patients (88.5%) had postoperative angiography at a mean of 5.9 months: 18 aneurysms (78.3%) were completely occluded, 3 (13.0%) had residual neck filling, and 2 (8.7%) had residual dome filling. All blister-type aneurysms were completely occluded at follow-up. Clinical follow-up was available for an average of 10.1 months (range 2-21 months), with one asymptomatic in-stent stenosis and one asymptomatic thromboembolic stroke noted. Good outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2) was achieved in 20 patients (76.9%), fair (mRS 3-4) in 3 (11.5%), and 3 died (11.5%). CONCLUSIONS The PED can be utilized for ruptured aneurysms and is a good option for blister-type aneurysms. However, due to periprocedural complications, it should be reserved for lesions that are difficult to treat by conventional clipping or coiling.","Lin, Ning; Brouillard, Adam M; Keigher, Kiffon M; Lopes, Demetrius K; Binning, Mandy J; Liebman, Kenneth M; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Magarik, Jordan A; Mocco, J; Duckworth, Edward A; Arthur, Adam S; Ringer, Andrew J; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230839/,544

Coronavirus research is of significance to overcome the epidemic. Our study aims to investigate the global status and trends of coronavirus research. METHOD Publications related to the studies of coronavirus research from January 1, 2003 to February 6, 2020 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) of the Web of Science database. A total of 9294 publications were included. The data source was studied and indexed by bibliometric methodology. For visualized study, bibliographic coupling analysis, co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis and the analysis of publication trends in coronavirus research were conducted by VOS (visualization of similarities) viewer and GraphPadPrism 6 software. RESULTS The number of publications about coronavirus research increased sharply in 2004 for SARS outbreak and increased again in 2012 for MERS outbreak. The USA made the highest contributions to the global research with the most total number of publications, total citation frequency, and the highest H-index, while Netherlands had the highest average citation per item. Journal of Virology had the largest publication numbers. The University of Hong Kong is the most contributive institution with the most publications. The main research orientation and funding agency were virology and United States Department of Health Human Services. Keywords of all related studies could be divided into 4 clusters: ""Pathological research,"" ""Epidemiology research,"" ""Clinical research,"" and ""Mechanism research."" CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of the epidemic could promote coronavirus research, meanwhile, coronavirus research contributes to overcoming the epidemic. Attention should be drawn to the latest popular research, including ""Spike protein,"" ""Receptor binding domain,"" and ""Vaccine."" Therefore, more and more efforts will be put into mechanism research and vaccine research and development, which can be helpful to deal with the epidemic.","Mao, Xingjia; Guo, Lu; Fu, Panfeng; Xiang, Chuan",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32481379/,544

For shortening door-to-ECG time, a chief complaint-based ""cardiac triage"" protocol comprising (1) raising alert among medical staff with bedside triage tags, and (2) immediate bedside ECG after focused history-taking was implemented at the emergency department (ED) in a single tertiary referral center. All patients diagnosed with STEMI visiting the ED between November 2017 and January 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to investigate the effectiveness of strategy before and after implantation. Analysis of a total of 117 ED patients with STEMI (pre-intervention group, n = 57; post-intervention group, n = 60) showed significant overall improvements in median door-to-ECG time from 5 to 4 min (p = 0.02), achievement rate of door-to-ECG time < 10 min from 45 to 57% (p = 0.01), median door-to-balloon time from 81 to 70 min (p < 0.01). Significant trends of increase in achievement rates for door-to-ECG and door-to-balloon times (p = 0.032 and p = 0.002, respectively) was noted after strategy implementation. The incidences of door-to-ECG time > 10 min for those with initially underestimated disease severity (from 90 to 10%, p < 0.01) and walk-in (from 29.2 to 8.8%, p = 0.04) were both reduced. In conclusion, a chief complaint-based ""cardiac triage"" strategy successfully improved the quality of emergency care for STEMI patients through reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment.","Su, Hung-Yuan; Tsai, Jen-Long; Hsu, Yin-Chou; Lee, Kuo-Hsin; Chang, Chao-Sheng; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan; Wang, Yu-Han; Chi, Shu-Ching; Hsu, Chih-Wei",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86013-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737723/,544

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) derived microvascular permeability is related to bevacizumab treatment outcome in rGB. Twenty-two patients with rGB underwent DCE-MRI at a median of 2.6 weeks prior initializing bevacizumab therapy. Follow-up MRI-scans (DCE-MRI available for 19/22 patients) were obtained after a median of 9.9 weeks. The volume transfer constant (K(trans))--an estimate related to microvascular permeability--at baseline and voxel-wise-reduction (VWR) in K(trans) at first follow-up were measured from the entire contrast-enhancing tumor (CET) and correlated with progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS) using uni- and multivariate cox-regression (significance-level p < 0.05). Baseline K(trans) ranged from 0.050 to 0.205 min(-1) (median, 0.109 min(-1)). The VWR in K(trans) ranged from 19.9 to 97.2 % (median, 89.4 %). Patients with lower baseline K(trans) and higher VWR in K(trans) showed significantly longer PFS and OS. Given the strong correlation of VWR in K(trans) and CET-volume changes (Spearman's ρ = -0.73, p < 0.01) both variables were included in a multivariate model. Thereby, neither VWR in K(trans) nor CET-volume changes retained independent significance for PFS or OS. Pre-treatment K(trans) stratifies PFS and OS in patients with bevacizumab-treated rGB. Although early pharmacodynamics changes in K(trans) were not assessed, the VWR in K(trans) at first follow-up had no additional benefit over assessment of CET-volume changes. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the potential role of pre-treatment K(trans) as a predictive and/or prognostic biomarker.","Kickingereder, Philipp; Wiestler, Benedikt; Graf, Markus; Heiland, Sabine; Schlemmer, Heinz Peter; Wick, Wolfgang; Wick, Antje; Bendszus, Martin; Radbruch, Alexander",Journal of neuro-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-014-1644-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25359396/,544

87773,Evaluation of the Incidence and Potential Mechanisms of Tracheal Complications in Patients With COVID-19.,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a cancer therapy that causes an increase in tumor perfusion, a phenomenon termed the super-enhanced permeability and retention effect. Currently, in vivo treatment efficacy of NIR-PIT is observable days after treatment, but monitoring would be improved by more acute detection of intratumor change. Fluorescence imaging may detect increased tumor perfusion immediately after treatment. METHODS In the first experiment, athymic nude mouse models bearing unilateral subcutaneous flank tumors were treated with either NIR-PIT or laser therapy only. In the second experiment, mice bearing bilateral flank tumors were treated with NIR-PIT only on the left-sided tumor. In both groups, immediately after treatment, indocyanine green was injected at different doses intravenously, and mice were monitored with the Shimadzu LIGHTVISION fluorescence imaging system for 1 hour. RESULTS Tumor-to-background ratio of fluorescence intensity increased over the 60 minutes of monitoring in treated mice but did not vary significantly in control mice. Tumor-to-background ratio was highest in the 1 mg kg-1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 doses. In mice with bilateral tumors, tumor-to-untreated tumor ratio increased similarly. CONCLUSIONS Acute changes in tumor perfusion after NIR-PIT can be detected by real-time fluorescence imaging.","Rosenberg, Adrian; Fujimura, Daiki; Okada, Ryuhei; Furusawa, Aki; Inagaki, Fuyuki; Wakiyama, Hiroaki; Kato, Takuya; Choyke, Peter L; Kobayashi, Hisataka",Molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1177/1536012120934965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609570/,544
88554,"Corrigendum to ""Factors Associated With Intubation and Prolonged Intubation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19"".",2020-07-01,"This living systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The review was reported per the PRISMA checklist, and the literature search was conducted in 6 databases and in gray literature. Studies published in any language mentioning oral symptoms and signs in patients with COVID-19 were included. The risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The certainty of evidence was evaluated through GRADE assessment. After a 2-step selection, 40 studies were included: 33 cross-sectional and 7 case reports. Overall, 10,228 patients (4,288 males, 5,770 females, and 170 unknown) from 19 countries were assessed. Gustatory impairment was the most common oral manifestation, with a prevalence of 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%; I2 = 99%). The pooled eligible data for different taste disorders were 38% for dysgeusia and 35% for hypogeusia, while ageusia had a prevalence of 24%. Taste disorders were associated with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 12.68; 95% CI, 6.41 to 25.10; I2 = 63%; P < 0.00001), mild/moderate severity (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.49; I2 = 66%; P = 0.005), and female patients (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.17; I2 = 70%; P = 0.0007). Oral mucosal lesions presented multiple clinical aspects, including white and erythematous plaques, irregular ulcers, small blisters, petechiae, and desquamative gingivitis. Tongue, palate, lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa were affected. In mild cases, oral mucosal lesions developed before or at the same time as the initial respiratory symptoms; however, in those who required medication and hospitalization, the lesions developed approximately 7 to 24 d after onset symptoms. Therefore, taste disorders may be common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and should be considered in the scope of the disease's onset and progression. Oral mucosal lesions are more likely to present as coinfections and secondary manifestations with multiple clinical aspects (PROSPERO CRD42020184468).","Amorim Dos Santos, J; Normando, A G C; Carvalho da Silva, R L; Acevedo, A C; De Luca Canto, G; Sugaya, N; Santos-Silva, A R; Guerra, E N S",Journal of dental research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034520957289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914677/,544

In May 2020, BSGAR and SCoR issued guidelines outlining steps for conduct of CTC in the early recovery phase. We evaluated the implementation of these in four English hospital trusts. METHODS Ethical permission was not required for this multicentre service evaluation. We identified patients undergoing CTC over a 2-month period from May to July 2020 at four Trusts. We recorded demographics, scan indications, colonic findings, and incidental lung base changes compatible with COVID-19. A subset of patients were contacted via telephone to document new symptoms 2 weeks following their scan. Staff were contacted to determine if any acquired COVID-19 during the period. RESULTS 224 patients (118 male, 52.7%) were scanned during the period. In 55 patients (24.6%), CTC showed a ≥6 mm polyp. 33 of 224 (14.7%) scans showed incidental lung base changes felt unrelated to COVID-19, and only one patient had changes indeterminate for COVID-19; no classic COVID-19 pulmonary changes were found. Of 169 patients with telephone follow-up, none reported any new symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia) within 14 days of CTC. None of the 86 staff contacted developed COVID-19. CONCLUSION We found no cases of patients or staff acquiring COVID-19 infection following CTC; and no evidence of significant asymptomatic COVID-19 patients attending for CTC appointments based on lung base changes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Our findings suggest that current practice is unlikely to contribute significantly to spread of SARS-nCOV2. Cancer and significant polyp detection rates were high, underlining the importance of maintaining service provision.","Peprah, David; Plumb, Andrew; Corr, Alison; Muckian, Janice; Smith, Kathryn; Sergot, Antoni; Kuah, Jia Ying; Stephenson, James",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20201316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835838/,544
94979,Shared Decision Making for Surgical Care in the Era of COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Human placenta is a convenient resource for biomedical research, and has not yet been used for neurointerventional surgery research. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to explore the feasibility of using human placenta to test various endovascular interventions and for training. DESIGN 18 placentas soon after delivery were prepared for six pilot studies. (1) Study on anatomical similarity to human cerebral vessel. (2) Simulation of stent assisted coiling and flow diversion on an aneurysm model. (3) Simulation of intra-arterial thrombolysis. (4) Simulation of embolization of arteriovenous malformation with glues. (5) Simulation of mechanical thrombolysis and comparison of different devices. (6) Vascular model for training of neurointerventionalists. RESULTS When the chorionic plate vessels were compared with the cerebral cortical vessels, similarities were found in vascular branch patterns, histological cross sections, and angiographic appearances. Due to the semitransparency of its vessel wall, performance of flow diverter and stent assisted coiling of an aneurysm could be visualized under direct microscopic observation. Similarly, timing of clot lysis and glue polymerization could be estimated. Endothelial change after thrombectomy could be assessed by histological methods. From these pilot studies, the placenta model could be adopted to simulate various clinical situations. It is also ideal for interventional radiology training. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to adopt the human placenta as an ex vivo vascular model in neurointerventional surgery research due to the fact that its vessels resemble the brain vasculature.","Kwok, John Ching Kwong; Huang, Wei; Leung, Wing-Cheong; Chan, Siu-Ki; Chan, Kwong-Yau; Leung, Kar-Ming; Chu, Alberto Chi Ho; Lam, Alexander Kar Ngai",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23904450/,544

96322,COVID-19: reflections on providing dysphagia care in a Boston hospital.,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulation therapy was the mainstay of deep vein thrombosis treatment but recently, catheter-directed thrombolysis has emerged as an alternative. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of the two strategies. METHODS Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were reviewed. Outcomes of interest included post-thrombotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, mortality, bleeding risk and iliofemoral patency. A random effects model meta-analysis was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed with I square. RESULTS Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1005 patients met the inclusion criteria. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was more likely to prevent overall post-thrombotic syndrome compared to anticoagulation only (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12-0.85; I2=87.2%), and to lead to iliofemoral vein patency (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.08-6.75; I2=55.3%) but no difference was noted in thromboembolic events (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.08-3.02, I2=55.1%), bleeding and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS Catheter-directed thrombolysis can decrease post-thrombotic syndrome rates and improve iliofemoral vein patency compared to anticoagulation when used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.","Mastoris, Ioannis; Kokkinidis, Damianos G; Bikakis, Iosif; Archontakis-Barakakis, Paraschos; Papanastasiou, Christos A; Jonnalagadda, Anil Kumar; Schizas, Dimitrios; Bakoyiannis, Christos; Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Faillace, Robert T",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355519835618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871438/,544

Possible sources of BVDV introduction considered were imported animals, including the calves of pregnant imports, and fenceline contact with infected herds, including stocker cattle raised in adjacent pastures. Spread of BVDV through the herd was modeled with a stochastic SIR model. Financial consequences of BVDV, including lost income, treatment costs, and the cost of biosecurity strategies, were calculated for 10 years, based on the risks of a herd with a user-defined import profile. Results indicate that importing pregnant animals and stockers increased the financial risk of BVDV. Strategic testing in combination with vaccination most decreased the risk of high-cost outbreaks in most herds. The choice of a biosecurity strategy was specific to the risks of a particular herd.","Smith, Rebecca L; Sanderson, Michael W; Jones, Rodney; N'Guessan, Yapo; Renter, David; Larson, Robert; White, Brad J",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24360189/,544
100066,Back to the Future: Principles on Resuming Outpatient Services in the COVID-19 Era.,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND Peritendinous adhesion is among the common complications after tendon injury. Numerous studies have been carried out to prevent its formation, including modifications of surgical procedures, postoperative cares, application of medicines, etc. This study dynamically monitored fluctuations of inflammation, state of oxidative stress, and histopathologic changes around injured tendon to provide theoretical basis for further exploration in mechanisms of peritendinous adhesion formation. METHODS Eighteen mature Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly allocated into 6 equal groups. Compared with control and sham group, every rat's right hind Achilles tendon in experimental groups was cut and repaired by the modified Kessler technique. Besides control and sham group, samples of tendon margin and serum were collected at different time points after the surgery. Content of TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β were assayed in harvested serum. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected, expression levels of related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, SOD1, SOD2, COL1, HIF1A) were quantified by qPCR, and various histopathological evaluations were performed. RESULTS Indicators (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, ROS) were noticed to have a similar trend of significant rising 24 h after the surgery except TGF-β which was rising 72 h later. So were the expression trends of IL-1β, IL-6, SOD1, SOD2, and COL1. HIF1A, inversely correlated with SOD2, showed the progressive relief of regional tissue hypoxia. Histological evaluation showed the same tendency that fibrosis and inflammation were getting serious 48 h later after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS Inflammation, oxidative stress in injured tendon resulted from acute trauma, would be getting intense in 24 h. Peritendinous adhesion emerges and aggravates after 48 h. Thus, prompt efficient measures are advised to be taken after the injury as soon as possible.","Li, Pengfei; Zhou, Haiying; Tu, Tian; Lu, Hui",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02445-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952274/,544
100420,Otolaryngology Residency Match During the COVID-19 Pandemic: What Happens Next?,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND Hydration therapy is essential in the care of the older patient. Subcutaneous (SC) hydration is a relevant method for parenteral hydration, but clinical trials on the subject have methodological shortcomings compared to updated standards. DESIGN Assessor-blinded, non-inferiority RCT to explore if SC is a safe alternative to intravenous (IV) hydration. PARTICIPANTS Eligible patients were: Admitted patients 65 years or older with a need for parenteral hydration. The targeted sample size was 67 patients in each group. INTERVENTION Patients were randomised to parenteral hydration via an IV or SC catheter during a 24 hours observation period. The non-randomised catheter (inactive) was placed as a sham on the patient, thereby blinding the caregivers and outcome assessors. MEASUREMENT Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients reporting at least one adverse effect with a non-inferiority calculation using a 20% margin. RESULTS We included 51 patients, with 24 randomised to SC and 27 to IV. We were unable to reach our target sample size due to challenges in recruitment, time limitation, and COVID-19. For the outcome of adverse effects, SC was non-inferior to IV (p = 0.012). Time spent on inserting the catheters was shorter with SC (p = 0.001). The groups did not differ by pain of insertion, discomfort during infusion, or the risk of developing delirium. CONCLUSION SC is a safe alternative to IV hydration, is faster to place and should be an available method for parenteral hydration wherever older adults are cared for.

Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels may have a predictive role in the identification and prevention of hypoxic disorders, as they increase in cases of ischemia of the liver, heart, brain, bowel, and kidney. PURPOSE This study aimed to assess the value of IMA levels as a diagnostic marker for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). METHODS Sixty newborns who fulfilled 3 or more of the clinical and biochemical criteria and developed HIE as defined by Levene staging were included in our study as the asphyxia group. Neonates with congenital malformation, systemic infection, intrauterine growth retardation, low-birth weight, cardiac or hemolytic disease, family history of neurological diseases, congenital or perinatal infections, preeclampsia, diabetes, and renal diseases were excluded from the study. Sixty healthy neonates matched for gestational age and with no maternal history of illness, established respiration at birth, and an Apgar score ≥7 at 1 and 5 minutes were included as the control group. IMA was determined by double-antibody enzymelinked immunosorbent assay of a cord blood sample collected within 30 minutes after birth. RESULTS Cord blood IMA levels were higher in asphyxiated newborns than in controls (250.83±36.07 pmol/mL vs. 120.24±38.9 pmol/mL). Comparison of IMA levels by HIE stage revealed a highly significant difference among them (207.3±26.65, 259.28±11.68, 294.99±4.41 pmol/mL for mild, moderate, and severe, respectively). At a cutoff of 197.6 pmol/mL, the sensitivity was 84.5%, specificity was 86%, positive predictive value was 82.8%, negative predictive value was 88.3%, and area under the curve was 0.963 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION IMA levels can be a reliable marker for the early diagnosis of neonatal HIE and can be a predictor of injury severity.","Talat, Mohamed A; Saleh, Rabab M; Shehab, Mohammed M; Khalifa, Naglaa A; Sakr, Maha Mahmoud Hamed; Elmesalamy, Walaa M",Clinical and experimental pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2019.01410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746533/,544

METHODOLOGY This cross-sectional study was conducted among the health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital technicians and technologists) providing services at seven hospitals of Punjab province of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. RESULTS All of the participants (N = 429) reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source (65%) of this information. Mean knowledge score was 12 ± 2.1, with 75.5% of participants having satisfactory knowledge. Doctors were found to have significantly better knowledge scores than the other health professionals (p = 0.001). Mean attitude score was 8.0 ± 1.2, with a wide majority of health professionals (86.5%) having positive attitudes. Regarding preventive practices, around 64% reported of always covering nose and mouth with a tissue paper during sneezing or coughing and nearly 65% disposed of the dirty tissue paper in trash bin. Only 40% of the participants reported that 'if they do not have tissue, they cough or sneeze into upper sleeves'. Around 45% reported that they used face mask during their working hours in hospitals nowadays. Mean practice score was 23.3 ± 3.6, with 73.4% of health professionals having satisfactory practices. CONCLUSIONS The overall COVID-19 related KAP of Pakistani health professionals are satisfactory, however some misperceptions and malpractices uncovered in the present study must be addressed to effectively combat COVID-19.","Salman, Muhammad; Mustafa, Zia; Asif, Noman; Zaidi, Haider Abbas; Shehzadi, Naureen; Khan, Tahir Mehmood; Saleem, Zikria; Hussain, Khalid",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794458/,544

Studies adressing the clinical-functional presentation of viral infection and physiotherapy management in children are scarce. The purpose statement was to provide current perspectives on the physiotherapy interventions for managing children based on COVID-19 evidences. METHODS In this review, databases were searched between 1th January and 26 th March 2020. The following descriptors were considered: (novel coronavirus); (novel corona virus); Coronavirus; (corona vírus); 2019-nCoV; nCovor; COVID-19; SARSCoV-2; in the electronic databases National Library of Medicine (PubMed/Medline), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The results were described through the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. RESULTS 16 papers were included in this review. COVID-19 seems to lead to restriction of participation and interfere in tasks, such as recreation and leisure activities, respiratory muscle function and exercise tolerance. Personal protective equipments and contact precautions are important part of treatment. Effective oxygen therapy should be given immediately in presence of hypoxia. Nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, lung-protective ventilation strategies and prone position, should be undertaken when necessary under appropriate conditions. Airway clearance techniques should be administered only strictly needed and early activities must be encouraged.

Innovative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe to perform TTE for such patients has been described; but reproducibility and correlation of the TTE measurements by this technique with those obtained by the standard supine TTE study are still unknown. METHODS We enrolled 30 non-COVID-19 individuals, with a mean (SD) age 35 (10.9) years and 11 females, to study the agreement between the transthoracic measurements of the left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), aortic dimensions, and ejection fraction (EF) obtained in prone position using an external TEE probe versus the standard supine position using the conventional TTE probe. RESULTS There were no significant differences between LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and aortic root dimensions in the prone versus the supine positions, while the mean EF (60.3% vs 63.1%, P = .014) and mean LA dimensions (1.8 vs 1.9 cm/m2 , P < .001) were significantly lower in the prone position. The mean time of scans was significantly longer in the prone as compared to the supine position (12.5 vs 4.5 minutes, P < .001). All supine studies had good quality while in the prone position four studies were of poor quality, and one was nondiagnostic. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of cardiac dimensions and systolic function in the prone position using transthoracic TEE probe was feasible. LV and aortic dimensions agreed well with the standard TTE in supine position; however, LA dimensions and EF were lower in the prone position.","Taha, Hesham S; Mohamed, Ahmed M; Mahrous, Hossam A; Shaker, Mirna M; Alsayed, Osama S; Sayed, Hadeer G; Rizk, Hussien H; Abdelwahab, Mohamed A",Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.15072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973666/,544

CONCLUSION Nicotine replacement therapy, behavioral counseling and brief advice appear to be effective in aiding smoking cessation in low- and middle-income countries. There is limited rigorous research on other smoking cessation interventions in these regions.","Akanbi, Maxwell Oluwole; Carroll, Allison Jane; Achenbach, Chad; O'Dwyer, Linda Catherine; Jordan, Neil; Hitsman, Brian; Bilaver, Lucy Ann; McHugh, Megan Colleen; Murphy, Robert",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506845/,544
113642,High-Risk Aerosol-Generating Procedures in COVID-19: Respiratory Protective Equipment Considerations.,2020-05-12,"OBJECTIVE To analyse a 'socioecological' health promotion discourse and its relationship to orthodox 'economistic' discourse in Australia. METHOD In research on health promotion addressing equity and environmental sustainability, we identified a socioecological discourse, based on an ethic of care for people and ecosystems. Using Foucault's concept of discourse as a regime that produces and legitimises certain kinds of knowledge, and ecofeminist historical analysis, we analysed this discourse and its relationship to economism. RESULTS The socioecological discourse takes social and ecological wellbeing as primary values, while economism takes production and trade of goods and services, measured by money, as primary. Following British invasion, property-owning white men in Australia had the right to control and profit from land, trade, and the work of women and subordinate peoples. A knowledge regime using money as a primary measure reflects this history. In contrast, a First Nations' primary value expressed in the study was 'look after the land and the children'. Conclusion and implications for public health: Public health often attempts to express value through economism, using monetary measures. However, socioecological discourse, expressed for example through direct measures of social and ecological wellbeing, appears more fit for purpose in promoting a fair and sustainable society.","Kay, Valerie; Livingstone, Charles",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559962/,544
114520,Recruitment and Networking With Social Media for the Otolaryngology Match in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE Behaviour change techniques are fundamental to the development of any behaviour change intervention, but surprisingly little is known about their properties. Key questions include when, why, how, in which contexts, for which behaviours, in what combinations, compared with what, and for whom behaviour change techniques are typically effective. The aims of the present paper are to: (1) articulate the scope of the challenge in understanding the properties of behaviour change techniques, (2) propose means by which to tackle this problem, and (3) call scientists to action. METHODS Iterative consensus (O'Connor et al., 2020, Br. J. Psychol., e12468) was used to elicit and distil the judgements of experts on how best to tackle the problem of understanding the nature and operation of behaviour change techniques. RESULTS We propose a worldwide network of 'Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change' (CUBiC) simultaneously undertaking research to establish what are the single and combined properties of behaviour change techniques across multiple behaviours and populations. We additionally provide a first attempt to systematize an approach that CUBiC could use to understand behaviour change techniques and to begin to harness the efforts of researchers worldwide. CONCLUSION Better understanding of behaviour change techniques is vital for improving behaviour change interventions to tackle global problems such as obesity and recovery from COVID-19. The CUBiC proposal is just one of many possible solutions to the problems that the world faces and is a call to action for scientists to work collaboratively to gain deeper understanding of the underpinnings of behaviour change interventions.","Armitage, Christopher J; Conner, Mark; Prestwich, Andrew; de Bruin, Marijn; Johnston, Marie; Sniehotta, Falko; Epton, Tracy",British journal of health psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080120/,544

116144,"Reply to ""An Approach to Manage Epistaxis in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Resource-Constrained Settings"".",2020-08-04,"Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to detect and characterize infectious agents in diagnostic pathology. The principal advantage of immunohistochemistry over other antigen detection techniques is the ability to identify antigen within the context of histologic lesions. Although epitope masking attributed to formalin fixation, especially prolonged fixation, has been considered a limiting factor in diagnostic immunohistochemistry, only a few studies have evaluated the immunohistochemical detection of infectious agents following prolonged formalin fixation. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged formalin fixation on the immunohistochemical detection of 21 infectious agents. Tissue slices about 5 mm thick were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, processed, and paraffin embedded at day 1 or 2 and then at approximately weekly intervals. Three pathologists graded immunoreactivity according to a four-tier grading system: negative, weak, moderate, strong. Canine parvoviral immunoreactivity was markedly decreased following 2, 7, and 10 weeks of fixation in myocardium, small intestine, and spleen, respectively. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus immunoreactivity was markedly decreased following 7 weeks of fixation. Bartonella henselae had an abrupt loss of immunoreactivity following 9 weeks of fixation. Despite variation among time points, immunoreactivity remained moderate to strong throughout the study period for the other 18 antigens. These results suggest that prolonged formalin fixation of up to 7 weeks generally does not limit immunohistochemical detection of infectious agents. However, the effects of prolonged fixation depend on the targeted antigen and the selected antibody. The results of this study further validate the utility and reliability of immunohistochemistry in diagnostic pathology.","Webster, J D; Miller, M A; DuSold, D; Ramos-Vara, J",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985809359607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332424/,544
116549,Challenges in the Delivery of Rural Otolaryngology Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-16,"Patients with NSCLC in East Asia, including Japan, frequently contain EGFR mutations. In 2018, we published the latest full clinical practice guidelines on the basis of those provided by the Japanese Lung Cancer Society Guidelines Committee. The purpose of this study was to update those recommendations, especially for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent EGFR-mutated NSCLC. We conducted a literature search of systematic reviews of randomized controlled and nonrandomized trials published between 2018 and 2019 that multiple physicians had reviewed independently. On the basis of those studies and the advice from the Japanese Society of Lung Cancer Expert Panel, we developed updated guidelines according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. We also evaluated the benefits of overall and progression-free survival, end points, toxicities, and patients' reported outcomes. For patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations, the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), especially osimertinib, had the best recommendation as to first-line treatment. We also recommended the combination of EGFR TKI with other agents (platinum-based chemotherapy or antiangiogenic agents); however, it can lead to toxicity. In the presence of EGFR uncommon mutations, except for an exon 20 insertion, we also recommended the EGFR TKI treatment. However, we could not provide recommendations for the treatment of EGFR mutations with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including monotherapy, and its combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, because of the limited evidence present in the literature. The 2020 Japanese Lung Cancer Society Guidelines can help community-based physicians to determine the most appropriate treatments and adequately provide medical care to their patients.","Ninomiya, Kiichiro; Teraoka, Shunsuke; Zenke, Yoshitaka; Kenmotsu, Hirotsugu; Nakamura, Yukiko; Okuma, Yusuke; Tamiya, Akihiro; Nosaki, Kaname; Morise, Masahiro; Aokage, Keiju; Oya, Yuko; Kozuki, Toshiyuki; Sakamoto, Tomohiro; Tanaka, Kentaro; Tanaka, Hisashi; Tanizaki, Junko; Miura, Satoru; Mizutani, Hideaki; Miyauchi, Eisaku; Yamaguchi, Ou; Ebi, Noriyuki; Goto, Yasushi; Sasaki, Takaaki; Daga, Haruko; Morita, Satoshi; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Amano, Shinsuke; Hasegawa, Kazuo; Imamura, Chiyo K; Suzuki, Kenichi; Nakajima, Kazuko; Nishimoto, Hitomi; Oizumi, Satoshi; Hida, Toyoaki; Hotta, Katsuyuki; Takiguchi, Yuichi",JTO clinical and research reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtocrr.2020.100107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589972/,544

Quercetin (Q), a bioflavonoid, at 0.3% concentration has showed some wound healing potential in our preliminary studies. The present study was aimed to explore the wound healing potential of 0.3% quercetin formulated in 3 different vehicles, that is, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10%), ointment base, and corn oil. Ninety experimentally wounded rats were grouped in 6 groups. The 0.3% quercetin mixed with DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil was topically applied once daily for 21 days on the wounds of groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil alone was applied similarly in groups 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Gross evaluation and wound contraction results revealed accelerated wound closure in all quercetin-treated groups. The mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-β1, and interluekin-10 were markedly upregulated in healing tissues of quercetin-treated groups. Tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression and protein levels were lowered by quercetin treatment. Quercetin-treated groups also showed increased activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and catalase, and levels of total thiols in wound tissues on day 7. Levels of superoxide anion radicals and malondialdehyde were markedly lower in quercetin-treated groups. Histologically, wound sections of quercetin-treated groups showed early dominance of fibroblasts, increased blood vessels, marked collagen deposition, and regenerated epithelial layer. The significant effects were more pronounced in ointment + Q group among all the quercetin-treated groups. In conclusion, 0.3% quercetin mixed in ointment base produced the fastest and better wound healing in rats.","Kant, Vinay; Kumar, Manish; Jangir, Babu Lal; Kumar, Vinod",The international journal of lower extremity wounds,https://doi.org/10.1177/1534734620977582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305630/,544

The aim of this study was to explore associations between severe respiratory infections and atopy in early childhood with wheeze and asthma persisting into later childhood. 147 children at high atopic risk were followed from birth to age 10 yrs. Data on all respiratory infections occurring in infancy were collected prospectively and viral aetiology ascertained. Atopy was measured by skin prick tests at 6 months, and 2 and 5 yrs. History of wheeze and doctor-diagnosed eczema and asthma was collected regularly until 10 yrs of age. At 10 yrs, 60% of the cohort was atopic, 25.9% had current eczema, 18.4% current asthma and 20.4% persistent wheeze. 35.8% experienced at least one lower respiratory infection (LRI) associated with fever and/or wheeze in first year of life. Children who had wheezy or, in particular, febrile LRI in infancy and were atopic by 2 yrs, were significantly more likely to have persistent wheeze (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.83-6.70; p<0.001) and current asthma (RR 4.92, 95% CI 2.59-9.36; p<0.001) at 10 yrs. Severe viral respiratory infections in infancy and early atopy are risk factors for persistent wheeze and asthma. The strongest marker of the asthmatogenic potential of early life infections was concurrent fever. The occurrence of fever during respiratory illnesses is an important marker of risk for wheeze and asthma later in childhood, suggesting it should be measured in prospective studies of asthma aetiology.","Kusel, M M H; Kebadze, T; Johnston, S L; Holt, P G; Sly, P D",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00193310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920891/,544

Once fatal in most infantile-onset cases, pre-symptomatic diagnosis through newborn screening (NBS) protocols, dietary management, and pharmacotherapy with nitisinone have improved outcomes. Succinylacetone provides a sensitive and specific marker for the detection of TT1 but is not universally utilized in screening protocols for the disease. Here, we report an infant transferred to our facility for evaluation and management of hyperinsulinism who subsequently developed acute-onset liver, respiratory, and renal failure around one month of life. She was found to have TT1 caused by novel pathogenic variant in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (c.1014 delC, p.Cys 338 Ter). Her NBS, which utilized tyrosine as a primary marker, had been reported as normal, with a tyrosine level of 151 μmol/L (reference: < 280 μmol/L). Retrospective analysis of dried blood spot samples via tandem mass spectrometry showed detectable succinylacetone ranging 4.65-10.34 μmol/L. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with TT1 whose initial presenting symptom was hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The case highlights the importance of maintaining a high suspicion for metabolic disease in critically ill children, despite normal NBS. We also use the case to advocate for NBS for TT1 using succinylacetone quantitation.","Priestley, Jessica R C; Alharbi, Hana; Callahan, Katharine Press; Guzman, Herodes; Payan-Walters, Irma; Smith, Ligia; Ficicioglu, Can; Ganetzky, Rebecca D; Ahrens-Nicklas, Rebecca C",International journal of neonatal screening,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijns6020039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832707/,544
127974,Exoscope and Personal Protective Equipment Use for Otologic Surgery in the Era of COVID-19.,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND Cerebrovascular reactivity monitoring has been used to identify the lower limit of pressure autoregulation in adult patients with brain injury. We hypothesise that impaired cerebrovascular reactivity and time spent below the lower limit of autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass will result in hypoperfusion injuries to the brain detectable by elevation in serum glial fibrillary acidic protein level. METHODS We designed a multicentre observational pilot study combining concurrent cerebrovascular reactivity and biomarker monitoring during cardiopulmonary bypass. All children undergoing bypass for CHD were eligible. Autoregulation was monitored with the haemoglobin volume index, a moving correlation coefficient between the mean arterial blood pressure and the near-infrared spectroscopy-based trend of cerebral blood volume. Both haemoglobin volume index and glial fibrillary acidic protein data were analysed by phases of bypass. Each patient's autoregulation curve was analysed to identify the lower limit of autoregulation and optimal arterial blood pressure. RESULTS A total of 57 children had autoregulation and biomarker data for all phases of bypass. The mean baseline haemoglobin volume index was 0.084. Haemoglobin volume index increased with lowering of pressure with 82% demonstrating a lower limit of autoregulation (41±9 mmHg), whereas 100% demonstrated optimal blood pressure (48±11 mmHg). There was a significant association between an individual's peak autoregulation and biomarker values (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Individual, dynamic non-invasive cerebrovascular reactivity monitoring demonstrated transient periods of impairment related to possible silent brain injury. The association between an impaired autoregulation burden and elevation in the serum brain biomarker may identify brain perfusion risk that could result in injury.","Easley, Ronald B; Marino, Bradley S; Jennings, Jacky; Cassedy, Amy E; Kibler, Kathleen K; Brady, Ken M; Andropoulos, Dean B; Brunetti, Marissa; Hogue, Charles W; Heitmiller, Eugenie S; Lee, Jennifer K; Spaeth, James; Everett, Allen D",Cardiology in the young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951117001573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835309/,544

Participants rated the arousal, valence, and dominance of expressions paired with labels. Isolated faces and isolated labels were also rated. As predicted, the label presented influenced participants' judgments of the expressions. Across both studies, higher arousal labels were associated with: 1) higher ratings of arousal for sad, angry, and scared expressions, and 2) higher ratings of dominance for angry, proud, and disgust expressions.

We evaluated the relationship between prostate specific antigen and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer developing in men of various ages. MATERIALS AND METHODS This longitudinal cohort study consisted of 849 men (122 with and 727 without prostate cancer) with serial prostate specific antigen measurements participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of men by prostate specific antigen and age who died of prostate cancer or in whom aggressive prostate cancer developed (death from prostate cancer, a prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater, or Gleason score 8 or greater). RESULTS No participants between 75 and 80 years old with a prostate specific antigen less than 3.0 ng/ml died of prostate cancer. In contrast, men of all ages with a prostate specific antigen of 3.0 ng/ml or greater had a continually increasing probability of death from prostate cancer (Fisher's exact test p <0.001). The time to death or diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer after age 75 years was not significantly different between the prostate specific antigen categories of 3 to 3.9 and 4 to 9.9 ng/ml (p = 0.634), whereas the time to death or diagnosis of high risk prostate cancer was significantly longer for the prostate specific antigen category of less than 3 vs 3 ng/ml or greater (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Men 75 to 80 years old with a prostate specific antigen less than 3 ng/ml are unlikely to die of or experience aggressive prostate cancer during their remaining life, suggesting that prostate specific antigen testing might be safely discontinued for these men.","Schaeffer, Edward M; Carter, H Ballentine; Kettermann, Anna; Loeb, Stacy; Ferrucci, Luigi; Landis, Patricia; Trock, Bruce J; Metter, E Jeffrey",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2008.11.117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246059/,544

These fluctuations usually result from internal dynamics, and many studies have linked them to internal climate modes in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Here, we show that variations in volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have caused in-phase, multidecadal SST variations since 1920 across all ocean basins. These forced variations resemble the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in time. Unlike the North Atlantic, where indirect and direct aerosol effects on surface solar radiation drive the multidecadal SST variations, over the tropical central and western Pacific atmospheric circulation response to aerosol forcing plays an important role, whereas aerosol-induced radiation change is small. Our new finding implies that AMO-like climate variations in Eurasia, North America, and other regions may be partly caused by the aerosol forcing, rather than being originated from the North Atlantic SST variations as previously thought.","Qin, Minhua; Dai, Aiguo; Hua, Wenjian",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb0425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832635/,544

The underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. Emerging evidence suggests that CFTR dysfunction may directly or indirectly impact β-cell function, offering the potential for improvement with CFTR modulator therapy. In small pilot studies, treatment with ivacaftor improved insulin secretion in patients with the G551D CFTR mutation. In the current study, we examined the impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. METHODS 39 subjects from the PROSPECT Part B study who had been prescribed lumacaftor/ivacaftor by their CF care team at a CF Foundation's Therapeutic Development Network center were recruited. Subjects underwent 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at baseline prior to first dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and at 3, 6 and 12 months on therapy. OGTT glucose, insulin and c-peptide parameters were compared. RESULTS Compared to baseline, OGTT fasting and 2 hour glucose levels, glucose area under the curve, insulin area under the curve and time to peak insulin level were not significantly different at 3, 6 and 12 months on lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy.

RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION As well as diagnostic confirmation by previously described methods of virus isolation from skin lesions, and demonstration of pox virions in skin samples using electron microscopy and inclusion bodies in histological preparations, this is the first report of diagnosis by virus isolation from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or pleural fluid, and demonstration of inclusion bodies in cytological preparations. This is also the first series to report treatment with interferon omega (IFN-ω). Two cats survived, both of which had been treated with IFN-ω. As CPxV represents a serious zoonotic risk it is an important differential diagnosis of pneumonia in cats.","McInerney, Jennie; Papasouliotis, Kostas; Simpson, Kerry; English, Kate; Cook, Simon; Milne, Elspeth; Gunn-Moore, Danièlle A",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15583344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972246/,544
141065,Resumption of Otolaryngology Surgical Practice in the Setting of Regionally Receding COVID-19.,2020-09-22,"Objectives Radical surgery for rectal tumours has high morbidity. Local excision of such tumours can be achieved without compromising oncologic safety. However tumours that are not accessible to local excision can be approached using Transanal Minimal Invasive Surgery (TAMIS). The aim of our study was to assess feasibility of TAMIS procedure in terms of complications, operating time, resection margin positivity, hospital stay and local recurrence rate. Material and Methods Forty eight patients with benign adenomas or early stage adenocarcinoma, within 4 to 12 cm from anal verge who were subjected to TAMIS over a period of 3 years were included in the study. Short and long term outcomes were assessed. Results TAMIS was performed for 36 benign adenomas and 12 adenocarcinomas, which were located at an average distance of 6.2 cm from anal verge. The mean operating time was 72 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications.1 (2.08%) patient suffered post operative bleeding, which was managed conservatively. 2 (4.16%) patients developed acute urinary retention who required indwelling catheterisation. Resection margin was positive in 3 (6.25%) benign cases. Average hospital stay was 2.7 days. Local recurrence occurred in 2 (4.16%) villous adenoma patients (after 11 and 13 months), whereas in malignant patients there was no recurrence at a follow up period ranging between 12 to 36 months. Conclusion TAMIS is a safe and feasible procedure for benign tumours and early rectal cancers, located in low and middle rectum.","Mehraj, Asif; Saqib, Najmus; Wani, Rauf; Chowdri, Nisar; Parray, Fazl; Khan, Mudassir",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.47717/turkjsurg.2021.5057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585088/,544

A common outcome for viral infections, persistence is a widespread phenomenon through all kingdoms. With a clear benefit for the virus and/or the host at the population level, persistent infections act as modulators of the ecosystem. The origin of persistence being long time elusive, here we explore the concept of 'endogenization' of viral sequences with concomitant activation of the host immune pathways, as a main way to establish and maintain viral persistent infections.

142783,Otolaryngology Providers Must Be Alert for Patients with Mild and Asymptomatic COVID-19.,2020-04-14,"Surfactants are widely used in the industry of detergents, household products, and cosmetics. SAPDMA is a cationic surfactant that is used mostly in cosmetics, conditioning agents and has recently gained attention as a corrosion inhibitor in the sea pipelines industry. In this regard, literature concerning the ecotoxicological classification of SAPDMA on aquatic animals is lacking. This study aims to evaluate the potential ecotoxicity of SAPDMA using the aquatic zebrafish embryo model. The potential toxic effects of SAPDMA were assessed by different assays. This includes (i) mortality/survival assay to assess the median lethal concentration (LC50); (ii) teratogenicity assay to assess the no observed effect concentration (NOEC); (iii) organ-specific toxicity assays including cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity (using locomotion assay), hematopoietic toxicity (hemoglobin synthesis using o-dianisidine staining), hepatotoxicity (liver steatosis and yolk retention using Oil Red O (ORO) stain); (iv) cellular cytotoxicity (mitochondrial membrane potential) by measuring the accumulation of JC-1 dye into mitochondria. Exposure of embryos to SAPDMA caused mortality in a dose-dependent manner with a calculated LC50 of 2.3 mg/L. Thus, based on the LC50 value and according to the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Acute Toxicity Rating Scale, SAPDMA is classified as ""moderately toxic"". The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) concerning a set of parameters including scoliosis, changes in body length, yolk, and eye sizes was 0.1 mg/L. At the same NOEC concentration (0.1 mg/L), no organ-specific toxicity was detected in fish treated with SAPDMA, except hepatomegaly with no associated liver dysfunctions. However, higher SAPDMA concentrations (0.8 mg/L) have dramatic effects on zebrafish organ development (eye, heart, and liver development). Our data recommend a re-evaluation of the SAPDMA employment in the industry setting and its strictly monitoring by environmental and public health agencies.","Al-Jamal, Ola; Al-Jighefee, Hadeel; Younes, Nadin; Abdin, Roba; Al-Asmakh, Maha A; Radwan, A Bahgat; Sliem, Mostafa H; Majdalawieh, Amin F; Pintus, Gianfranco; Yassine, Hadi M; Abdullah, Aboubakr M; Da'as, Sahar I; Nasrallah, Gheyath K",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886985/,544

Egypt has assigned certain hospitals specifically for the quarantine of COVID-19 patients, where operational medical teams work continuously for 14 days, after which they are released for self-isolation at home for a similar period. Aims The study aimed to evaluate and compare perceived adverse psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression), and insomnia by health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, and to explore associated factors with adverse psychological symptoms and insomnia. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020, using a snowball sampling method. Sociodemographic information perceived general health, healthy lifestyle, insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), adverse psychological symptoms (using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), worries and concerns about COVID-19, future perspective about COVID-19, and coping strategies were collected. Results Five hundred and forty health-care professionals participated; 10.2% (n=55) worked in quarantine hospitals.

Marginalization in the South Asian polity, unequal power relations, and poor policy responses deter Adivasi populations' rights and opportunities for health gains and dignity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in a disproportionate share of infections and deaths among the Adivasis, given poor social conditions and exclusions. Poor health of indigenous people, inequalities between indigenous and non-indigenous groups, and failures in enforcing constitutional and legal provisions to reclaim indigenous land and cultural identity herald deeper structural and political fractures. This article unravels health inequalities between the Adivasis and non-Adivasi populations in their social context based on a critical review of secondary sources.

147582,Preoperative testing for radial forearm free flaps to reduce donor site morbidity.,2013,"Importance Chronic nasal congestion often persists in children despite empirical treatment using intranasal corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Symptoms are often reported even with negative results of skin or blood allergy testing. Inferior turbinoplasty has been effective in adults and children, but outfracture of inferior turbinates in children is rarely reported, as is use of validated quality-of-life measures to quantify improvements after intervention. Effective use of these 2 procedures for treating chronic nasal congestion may reduce the need for medication and improve sinonasal quality of life. Objective To quantify changes in sinonasal quality of life for children after outfracture of inferior turbinates and concomitant submucous microdebrider inferior turbinoplasty for chronic nasal congestion. Design, Setting, and Participants A case series with planned data collection was conducted in an ambulatory pediatric otolaryngology clinic among 43 patients with chronic nasal congestion who underwent surgical intervention between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2015. Exposures Microdebrider submucous inferior turbinoplasty (without bony resection) and outfracture of inferior turbinates. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographics and medication use before and after the procedure were reviewed. Scores on the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5) and quality-of-life scores were collected at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure, and more than 6 months after the procedure. Results Among the 43 patients (14 girls and 29 boys; mean age, 11.2 years [range, 4.8-17.6 years]), every domain showed significant improvements in scores on the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey and quality-of-life scores 1 to 2 months after the proecdure: sinus infection (-2.55; 95% CI, 1.85-3.26), nasal obstruction (-3.51; 95% CI, 2.88-4.14), allergy symptoms (-2.14; 95% CI, 1.43-2.86), emotional distress (-2.37; 95% CI, 1.68-3.06), activity limitation (-1.70; 95% CI, 1.14-2.25), and overall quality of life (3.72; 95% CI, 2.95-4.48). At long-term follow-up, improvement was maintained in all categories. Significant improvements in SN-5 and quality-of-life scores correlated with proportional decreased reporting of snoring after the procedure (33 [77%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 75%; 95% CI, 62%-88%), as well as nasal congestion (41 [95%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 93% ; 95% CI, 85%-100%), and rhinorrhea (44 [41%] vs 1 [2%]; absolute reduction, 42%; 95% CI, 27%-57%).

The aim of this multicentre study was to review the outcome of a Swedish cohort of children who underwent STEP. METHODS All children who had a STEP procedure at one of the four centres of paediatric surgery in Sweden between September 2005 and January 2013 were included in this observational cohort study. Demographic details, and data from the time of STEP and at follow-up were collected from the case records and analysed. RESULTS Twelve patients had a total of 16 STEP procedures; four children underwent a second STEP. The first STEP was performed at a median age of 5·8 (range 0·9-19·0) months. There was no death at a median follow-up of 37·2 (range 3·0-87·5) months and no child had small bowel transplantation. Seven of the 12 children were weaned from parenteral nutrition at a median of 19·5 (range 2·3-42·9) months after STEP. CONCLUSION STEP is a useful procedure for selected patients with short bowel syndrome and seems to facilitate weaning from parenteral nutrition. At mid-term follow-up a majority of the children had achieved enteral autonomy. The study is limited by the small sample size and lack of a control group.","Wester, T; Borg, H; Naji, H; Stenström, P; Westbacke, G; Lilja, H E",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043139/,544

151553,Unique Challenges for Otolaryngology Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-15,"Despite the recent introduction of many improved immunosuppressive agents for use in transplantation, acute rejection affects up to 55% of lung transplant recipients within the first year after transplant. Acute lung allograft rejection is defined as perivascular or peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation. Although histopathologic signs of rejection often resolve with treatment, the frequency and severity of acute rejections represent the most important risk factor for the subsequent development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a condition of progressive airflow obstruction that limits survival to only 50% at 5 years after lung transplantation. Recent evidence demonstrates that peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation (also known as lymphocytic bronchiolitis) or even a single episode of minimal perivascular inflammation significantly increase the risk for BOS. We comprehensively review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, histopathologic features, and mechanisms of acute cellular lung rejection. In addition, we consider emerging evidence that humoral rejection occurs in lung transplantation, characterized by local complement activation or the presence of antibody to donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA). We discuss in detail methods for HLA antibody detection as well as the clinical relevance, the mechanisms, and the pathologic hallmarks of humoral injury. Treatment options for cellular rejection include high-dose methylprednisolone, antithymocyte globulin, or alemtuzumab. Treatment options for humoral rejection include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, or rituximab. A greater mechanistic understanding of cellular and humoral forms of rejection and their role in the pathogenesis of BOS is critical in developing therapies that extend long-term survival after lung transplantation.","Martinu, Tereza; Chen, Dong-Feng; Palmer, Scott M",Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/pats.200808-080go; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131531/,544

In previous studies, we observed that social defeat (SD) induced a long-lasting increase in ethanol intake and neuroinflammation in male mice. We also know that OXT blocks the increase in cocaine reward induced by SD. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the effect of 1 mg/kg of OXT administered 30 min before each episode of SD on ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory response in adult male mice. Three weeks after the last SD, mice underwent oral ethanol self-administration (SA) procedure, and striatal levels of the two chemokines CX3CL1 and CXCL12 were measured after the last SD and at the end of the ethanol SA. OXT administration blocked the increase in voluntary ethanol consumption observed in defeated mice, although it did not affect motivation for ethanol. An increase in the striatal levels of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 was observed in defeated animals immediately after the last defeat and after the ethanol SA. However, defeated mice treated with OXT did not show this increase in the neuroinflammatory response. In conclusion, OXT treatment can be a powerful therapeutic target to reduce the negative effects of social stress on ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory process.","Reguilón, M D; Ferrer-Pérez, C; Miñarro, J; Rodríguez-Arias, M",Hormones and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2020.104875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069753/,544

Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is considered the operation of choice on elective basis for managing patients with certain hematological disorders. Hemostatic control of the splenic pedicle is one of the crucial steps in LS. This study compares the safety and efficacy of using endoscopic staplers and vessel sealing devices to control the splenic pedicle in patients with nonsevere splenomegaly. Methods. Fifty-one consecutive patients with different blood disorders including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hypersplenism, and lymphoma were randomized for elective LS. Traditional steps of LS, via lateral approach, were followed, and pedicle control was done with either endovascular gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler (n = 26) or vessel sealing device (Ligasure) (n = 25). Results. No difference was noted with different splenic spans when using either methods of pedicle control (P = .145). The volume of blood loss was higher in the Ligasure group compared to the staplers group (182 mL vs 131 mL, respectively), but was not statistically significant (P = .249). Conversion to open was notably higher in the Ligasure group (P = .034), but the intraoperative complications were comparable in both groups (P = .357). Conclusion. The use of vessel sealing devices for splenic pedicle control has comparable surgical outcomes compared with the use of endoscopic staplers for LS, but with higher rate of conversion to open surgery.","Fathi, Adel; Elmoatasembellah, Mansour; Senbel, Ahmed; Shahatto, Fayez; Eldamshety, Osama; Shetiwy, Mosab; Abdel Wahab, Khaled; Abouzid, Amr; Setit, Ahmed",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350620953023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845223/,544

In addition, extractable chemical additives from microplastics have been identified as an important toxicity pathway in the aquatic environment. However, currently, little is known about the effects of such additives on the soil environment. In this study on nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), we adopted an ecotoxicological approach to assess the potential effects of 13 different microplastics (0.001-1% of soil dry weight) with different characteristics and extractable additives. We found that poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fragments and polyacrylicnitrile (PAN) fibers show the highest toxicity, while high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) fragments induced relatively less adverse effects on nematodes. In addition, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) induced no toxicity within our test concentration range for the acute period. Acute toxicity was mainly attributed to the extractable additives: when the additives were extracted, the toxic effects of each microplastic disappeared in the acute soil toxicity test. The harmful effects of the LDPE films and PAN fibers increased when the microplastics were maintained in the soil for a long-term period with frequent wet-dry cycles. We here provide clear evidence that microplastic toxicity in the soil is highly related to extractable additives. Our results suggest that future experiments consider extractable additives as key explanatory variables.","Kim, Shin Woong; Waldman, Walter R; Kim, Tae-Young; Rillig, Matthias C",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c04641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052669/,544

161011,Effect of Powered Air-Purifying Respirators on Speech Recognition Among Health Care Workers.,2020-07-21,"Coronaviruses (CoV) have recently emerged as potentially serious pathogens that can cause significant human morbidity and death. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV was identified as the etiologic agent of the 2002-2003 international SARS outbreak. Yet, how SARS evades innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that a protein encoded by SARS-CoV designated as open reading frame-9b (ORF-9b) localizes to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial elongation by triggering ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of dynamin-like protein 1, a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Also, acting on mitochondria, ORF-9b targets the mitochondrial-associated adaptor molecule MAVS signalosome by usurping PCBP2 and the HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF 6. This severely limits host cell IFN responses. Reducing either PCBP2 or AIP4 expression substantially reversed the ORF-9b-mediated reduction of MAVS and the suppression of antiviral transcriptional responses. Finally, transient ORF-9b expression led to a strong induction of autophagy in cells. The induction of autophagy depended upon ATG5, a critical autophagy regulator, but the inhibition of MAVS signaling did not. These results indicate that SARS-CoV ORF-9b manipulates host cell mitochondria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity. This study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and illustrates the havoc that a small ORF can cause in cells.","Shi, Chong-Shan; Qi, Hai-Yan; Boularan, Cedric; Huang, Ning-Na; Abu-Asab, Mones; Shelhamer, James H; Kehrl, John H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1303196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135833/,544

202129,Ambient Noise Levels and Wireless Headsets for Communication in Aerosolizing Otolaryngology Surgery During COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION Even with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine, masks and social distancing are recommended as a precautionary measure to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In Israel, as in many other countries, despite official regulations and widespread availability and accessibility to affordable effective masks, the use of face masks is not consistent or universal. Physicians and other medical and health professionals have a vital role to play in communicating to the public about the importance of masking and encouraging people to wear face masks correctly and consistently. This review underscores the importance of masking as a protective public health mitigation measure. It describes types of face masks mainly used by the public and their effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing barriers (e.g., physical, social, economic) to encourage widespread and sustained appropriate use of masks. The article also proposes strategies to enhance masking, such as changing social norms through targeted local interventions and governmental control of mask quality and price.","Bord, Shiran; Epstein, Yoram; Guttman, Nurit; Dunchin, Milka; Jakobovich, Ronit; Cohen, Ohad; Neumark, Yehuda; Keidar, Osnat; Schenker, Inon",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749173/,544

A growing number of victims suffer from a remarkable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), but there are no satisfactory treatments. Various gas therapies including nitric oxide, ozone, hyperbaric oxygen, hydrogen, and heliox have been employed in the fight against the pandemic and have improved clinical outcomes. However, the potential roles of these gases in COVID-19 treatment need to be verified in well-designed randomized controlled trials.

209117,Shared Decision-making and Stakeholder Engagement in COVID-19 Tracheostomy,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the disease itself, including economic, social, political, religious, and psychological implications. This novel coronavirus has been shown to have cardiovascular manifestations in the form of arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial injury and myocardial ischemia or infarction from increased microvascular and/or macrovascular coagulopathy. However, in addition to these direct effects, we are now starting to recognize indirect cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 in the form of increased incidence of Takutsobo cardiomyopathy in patients without any evidence of coronavirus infection presumably due to the increased psychological stress of social isolation and societal turbulence. In this case series, we present two post-menopausal women, presenting with chest pain and acute coronary syndrome, who are finally diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy, triggered by increased emotional stress-related to the pandemic. There is data from a retrospective cohort analysis showing a fourfold increase in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome resulting from stress cardiomyopathy during the pandemic period compared to similar times periods before the pandemic. Hence, health care providers need to be cognizant of the emotional ramifications of the ongoing pandemic in the form of increased risk of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Moreover, urgent measures need to be taken to help the at-risk population cope with the ongoing stressors to help decrease the incidence of this cardiomyopathy.","Kir, Devika; Beer, Nusen; De Marchena, Eduardo J",J Card Surg,,544

212449,Information Overload: A Method to Share Updates among Frontline Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"A grammar compression algorithm, called GCIS, is introduced in this work. GCIS is based on the induced suffix sorting algorithm SAIS, presented by Nong et al. in 2009. The proposed solution builds on the factorization performed by SAIS during suffix sorting. A context-free grammar is used to replace factors by non-terminals. The algorithm is then recursively applied on the shorter sequence of non-terminals. The resulting grammar is encoded by exploiting some redundancies, such as common prefixes between right-hands of rules, sorted according to SAIS. GCIS excels for its low space and time required for compression while obtaining competitive compression ratios. Our experiments on regular and repetitive, moderate and very large texts, show that GCIS stands as a very convenient choice compared to well-known compressors such as Gzip, 7-Zip, and RePair, the gold standard in grammar compression. In exchange, GCIS is slow at decompressing. Yet, grammar compressors are more convenient than Lempel-Ziv compressors in that one can access text substrings directly in compressed form, without ever decompressing the text. We demonstrate that GCIS is an excellent candidate for this scenario because it shows to be competitive among its RePair based alternatives. We also show, how GCIS relation with SAIS makes it a good intermediate structure to build the suffix array and the LCP array during decompression of the text.","Nunes, Daniel S.

213604,"The ""New"" PTAs-Practical Telehealth Applications",2020,"Healthcare waste comprises the waste generated by healthcare facilities, medical laboratories and biomedical research facilities. Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes. This review discusses the different healthcare solid waste management strategies practiced in different countries, the challenges faced during this management, and the possible solutions for overcoming these challenges. It also provides useful insights into healthcare solid waste management scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic and a possible way forward.","Das, Atanu Kumar; Islam, Md Nazrul; Billah, Md Morsaline; Sarker, Asim",Sci Total Environ,,544

The patients who have received rituximab treatment in the previous 5 years with the diagnosis of pemphigus group of diseases at CerrahpaSa Medical Faculty were questioned for COVID-19 infection. A total of 48 patients were included in this study; only one male patient had COVID-19 infection which had a mild course. There is no significant difference in the total number of lymphocytes between patients who have received rituximab within the previous 5 years or last year. The number of lymphocytes is independent of the number of courses of rituximab treatment received. Therefore, we suggest that all pemphigus patients who have received rituximab treatment within the previous 5 years should be careful of the preventive measures against the COVID-19 infection irrespective of the number of treatment courses or the number of years which has passed since the treatment. The disease course was mild in the only infected patient. Thus, rituximab may be used in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris during the COVID-19 pandemic if its use is necessary.

224174,Does Mask Usage Worsen Symptoms in Patients With Rhinosinusitis Balloon Sinuplasty Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2021,"We have developed a single-tube assay for SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This assay combined advantages of reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzyme Cas12a. Our assay is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single tube within 40 min, requiring only a single temperature control (62 °C). The RT-LAMP reagents were added to the sample vial, while CRISPR Cas12a reagents were deposited onto the lid of the vial. After a half-hour RT-LAMP amplification, the tube was inverted and flicked to mix the detection reagents with the amplicon. The sequence-specific recognition of the amplicon by the CRISPR guide RNA and Cas12a enzyme improved specificity. Visible green fluorescence generated by the CRISPR Cas12a system was recorded using a smartphone camera. Analysis of 100 human respiratory swab samples for the N and/or E gene of SARS-CoV-2 produced 100% clinical specificity and no false positive. Analysis of 50 samples that were detected positive using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulted in an overall clinical sensitivity of 94%. Importantly, this included 20 samples that required 30-39 threshold cycles of RT-qPCR to achieve a positive detection. Integration of the exponential amplification ability of RT-LAMP and the sequence-specific processing by the CRISPR-Cas system into a molecular assay resulted in improvements in both analytical sensitivity and specificity. The single-tube assay is beneficial for future point-of-care applications.","Pang, Bo; Xu, Jingyang; Liu, Yanming; Peng, Hanyong; Feng, Wei; Cao, Yiren; Wu, Jinjun; Xiao, Huyan; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Tipples, Graham; Joyce, Michael A; Saffran, Holly A; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Zhang, Hongquan; Le, X Chris",Anal. chem,,544

The current study purposed to investigate depression, anxiety, and stress levels of pregnant mothers in the initial stage of the COVID-19 infection in the southwest of Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during March and April, 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. Pregnant mothers registered in maternity clinics affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were included. An online self-administered checklist was used. It included socio-demographic, obstetric and medical histories, and the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In total, 540 pregnant mothers answered the questionnaire. 83.5% had no comorbidity. Abnormal depression scores were significantly higher in those who had no insurance (OR = 2.5) and in those with poor self-rated health (SRH) (OR = 27.8). Pregnant mothers with lower SRH and two or more comorbidities had a higher chance of having an abnormal level of anxiety subscale (6.9, 3.7 times, retrospectively). CONCLUSION: The results revealed that an abnormal level of depression was associated with SRH and medical insurance status. Moreover, the number of comorbidities and poor SRH significantly increased the chance of achieving abnormal anxiety levels in pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maharlouei, Najmeh; Keshavarz, Pedram; Salemi, Niloufar; Lankarani, Kamran B",Reprod Health,,544

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online survey disseminated among families with kindergarten and primary school-aged children during the lockdown of March and April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 361 respondents completed the survey. Most respondents adapted well to the changes imposed by lockdown and reported that they and their children had low anxiety levels and high mental resilience. Family functioning and behavior were positively correlated with nutrition habits and hygiene. General hygiene was positively correlated with oral hygiene. Respondents who reported requiring dental care had difficulties gaining access to it. Most respondents perceived that it is important to improve patients' digital access to pediatricians and dentists during crises. CONCLUSION: The study showed that better family functioning was associated with better family hygiene and nutrition, parental resilience and lower mental stress among children.","Blumer, Sigalit; Dagon, Nurit; Peretz, Benjamin; Ratson, Tal; Kharouba, Johnny",J Clin Pediatr Dent,,544
232031,Head and neck surgery during COVID-19,2021,"Critically ill (ICU) patients are characterized organ failure, intense inflammatory response, insulin resistance, and altered metabolic response. The sicker the patient, the higher the threat to the nutritional and micronutrient status will be. In addition many patients start the ICU stay with an altered nutritional status, which requires assessment upon admission. The nutritional needs vary among patients as well as during hospitalization, as the metabolic response changes over time. The shock and acute organ failure result in a metabolic shift towards intense catabolism: the endogenous glucose production aiming at ensuring the basal ATP production starts immediately, and occurs at the expense of the lean body mass using amino acids for neoglucogenesis. Later, the stabilization and recovery phases are characterized by higher energy and substrate needs. Indirect calorimetry is the only tool enabling determination of the metabolic level. When and how should feeding be started? Recent research shows that the route does not matter much with equipoise between enteral and parenteral nutrition as long as overfeeding is avoided. As micronutrients are an integral part of metabolism and antioxidant defenses, their delivery must be ensured: while needs are well defined for healthy subjects, needs in illness remain poorly defined. Parenteral nutrition, that contains only macro-substrates, requires the daily prescription of multi-micronutrient complements to qualify as total PN. Achievement of goals requires a minimal monitoring, consisting in the daily verification of energy and protein goal delivery achievement, and daily follow up of blood glucose and phosphate levels determination and insulin requirements.

The results showed that the carnauba powder treated with bentonite (CPTB) showed a better percentage of removal of Cu(II) ions when compared to natural carnauba powder (NCP). The best results for both adsorbents were obtained with pH 5. The adsorption kinetics was governed by the pseudo-second-order model for both bioadsorbents studied. While the isothermal behavior was governed by the Langmuir model and showed that the adsorption capacity of the CPTB for Cu(II) was 21.98 mg·g-1. The interaction of the metal and CPTB was also investigated by means of thermodynamic parameters showing that the adsorption process is not spontaneous, although the values of &#916;G° decrease with the increase in temperature from 20 to 40 °C and endothermic causing an increase in the degree of disorder at the solid/liquid interface.

239169,Olfactory Loss of Function as a Possible Symptom of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak which developed into a public health crisis has raised concerns regarding infection control among health care workers particularly dentists all over the world. The aim of this survey was to assess awareness, fear and compliance with practice modification according to CDC guidelines during COVID-19 pandemic among Pakistani dentists. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed on Google Forms and was distributed among all seven regions of Pakistan through social media and WhatsApp after carrying out the reliability analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0. Question wise analysis using frequencies and percentages was done. Pearson correlation and Kruskal Wallis test was applied to check association of awareness level with qualification and workplace setting. RESULTS: A total of 313 dentists participated and submitted the form online from all regions of Pakistan. The response rate was quite satisfactory as Pakistan was under an official lockdown and most of the hospitals/clinics were either closed or operating with minimum staff. Most of the dentists were well aware of the CDC guidelines. However, 75% of the dentists were afraid of getting infected and 88% of them were anxious while providing treatment. Sixty-eight percent of them were avoiding aerosol generating procedures and only 28% were using rubber dam isolation. Regional analysis was also done and areas of poor compliance were identified. Only 38.5% dentists in Balochistan were using N95 masks and none of the dentists (0%) were using rubber dam isolation. A large number of dentists (80.9%) were afraid and wanted to close their dental practice in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Furthermore, a positive correlation was seen between the designation and awareness level (p = 0.01). Similarly, significant correlation (p = 0.03) was seen between qualification and workplace setting. CONCLUSION: The results of the study can help devise strategies to ensure adherence with infection control guidelines in regions with poor compliance. Initiation of awareness programs to help overcome fear and train the faculty and staff in the targeted areas would greatly contribute towards reducing the spread of infection and thus lowering the healthcare burden in a third world country like Pakistan.","Kamran, Ramsha; Saba, Kiran; Azam, Saima",BMC Oral Health,,544

A sample of 1025 amateurs, 534 males and 491 females with an average age of 35 years old were interviewed using an online survey that collected their motives for practising sport and their commitment to physical activity. A cluster analysis combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods was performed, identifying three groups of amateurs: High Commitment (n = 650), Moderate Commitment (n = 324), and Low Commitment (n = 81). The main motives shown by the different groups were psychological motives related to an improved or managed general or emotional well-being. Regarding commitment, all the groups showed higher scores in enthusiasm for physical activity than affliction from sport. The variables referring to gender, educational level and sports habits showed differences that enabled the identification of the different groups. These findings highlight the importance of conducting segmentation studies that provide specific population profiles to improve the action strategies of governments and specialists.","Angosto, Salvador; Berengüí, Rosendo; Vegara-Ferri, José Miguel; López-Gullón, José María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,544

254524,Eye Protection in ENT Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic makes it difficult to obtain physical therapy in rehabilitation centres, particularly for persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), who are a population at high risk, since viral infections may contribute to MS exacerbations and relapses. Active video games could be a way to maintain physical therapy at home as part of the rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS: We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this systematic review. We found significant improvements in balance; results were mixed concerning mobility, physical activity and gait. Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3 ± 2). CONCLUSION: Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS. Future studies should follow more rigorous methodological standards (larger sample sizes, more randomised controlled trials) to improve the quality of evidence and include cost-effectiveness in the analysis.","Dalmazane, Marion; Gallou-Guyot, Matthieu; Compagnat, Maxence; Magy, Laurent; Montcuquet, Alexis; Billot, Maxime; Daviet, Jean-Christophe; Perrochon, Anaick",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,544

Most institutions supporting people with ID switched to remote work. This required some major adaptation to these individuals' new realities, their immediate families, and facility staff. Supporting and monitoring the quality of life of individuals with disabilities and their family members during a crisis is an essential topic of current research. This research project aimed to explore the experiences of parents of adults with ID in relation to remote support provided by public support agencies. In a qualitative study, the authors used semistructured individual interviews with caregivers of people with ID. Data analysis distinguished the following categories: parents as therapists, organization difficulties, material problems, lack of social contacts, positive solutions, and difficult behavior. The results show the difficulties of parents in balancing professional, domestic, and supporting tasks. The study was the first in Poland to report on the qualitative assessment of remote support for people with ID during COVID-19. Further, more extensive research is needed to search for solutions that respect the rights of people with disabilities to professional support.","Wos, Klaudia Kamecka-Antczak Celina Szafrański Mateusz",Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities,,544

264624,"Creation of a New Educational Podcast: ""Headmirror's ENT in a Nutshell""",2020,"Observation of gravitational waves (GWs) in two different frequency bands is referred to as {\it multiband GW astronomy}. With the planned Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) operating in the $10^{-4}-0.1$ Hz range, and third generation (3G) ground-based detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), operating in the $1$--$10^4$ Hz range, multiband GW astronomy could be a reality in about a decade. In this paper we present the potential of multiband observations of intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) of component masses ${\sim}10^2$--$10^3M_{\odot}$ to test general relativity (GR). We show that mutiband observations of IMBBHs would permit multiparameter tests of GR---tests where more than one post-Newtonian (PN) coefficient is simultaneously measured yielding more rigorous constraints on possible modifications to GR. We also find that the improvement due to multibanding can often be much larger than the best of the bounds from either of the two observatories. The origin of this result, as we shall demonstrate, can be traced to the lifting of degeneracies among the various parameters when the information from LISA and 3G are taken together. We obtain the best multiband bounds for an IMBBH with a total redshifted mass of $200M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2. For single-parameter tests, this system at 1 Gpc would allow us to constrain the deviations on all the PN coefficients to below 10\% and derive simultaneous bounds on the first seven PN coefficients to below 50\% (with low spins).","Datta, Sayantani; Gupta, Anuradha; Kastha, Shilpa; Arun, K.

267108,Guidelines of the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (SFORL) and the French Society of Audiology (SFA) for Speech-in-Noise Testing in Adults,2021,"AIMS: The risk to patients and healthcare workers of resuming elective orthopaedic surgery following the peak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been difficult to quantify. This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION: Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.

We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new agents having higher antiviral potentials than the drug candidates such as Remdesivir and Chroloquine in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells: the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine and HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir. Cepharanthine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry through the blocking of viral binding to target cells, whilst Nelfinavir suppressed viral replication partly by protease inhibition. Consistent with their different modes of action, synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation was highlighted. Mathematical modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the calculated total drug concentrations in the lung predicts that Nelfinavir will shorten the period until viral clearance by 4.9-days and the combining Cepharanthine/Nelfinavir enhanced their predicted efficacy. These results warrant further evaluation of the potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Cepharanthine and Nelfinavir.","Ohashi, Hirofumi; Watashi, Koichi; Saso, Wakana; Shionoya, Kaho; Iwanami, Shoya; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Shirai, Tsuyoshi; Kanaya, Shigehiko; Ito, Yusuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Nomura, Takao; Suzuki, Tateki; Nishioka, Kazane; Ando, Shuji; Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Tanaka, Tomohiro; Aoki, Shin; Kuramochi, Kouji; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hashiguchi, Takao; Maenaka, Katsumi; Matano, Tetsuro; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Saijo, Masayuki; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Iwami, Shingo; Takeda, Makoto; McKeating, Jane A; Wakita, Takaji",iScience,,544

The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in a SNF that occurred after all residents and health care personnel (HCP) had been offered vaccination. Among 83 residents and 116 HCP, 75 (90.4%) and 61 (52.6%), respectively, received 2 vaccine doses. Twenty-six residents and 20 HCP received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including 18 residents and four HCP who had received their second vaccine dose >14 days before the outbreak began. An R.1 lineage variant was detected with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although the R.1 variant has multiple spike protein mutations, vaccinated residents and HCP were 87% less likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Vaccination of SNF populations, including HCP, is critical to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission, and severe outcomes in SNFs. An ongoing focus on infection prevention and control practices is also essential.","Cavanaugh, Alyson M; Fortier, Sarah; Lewis, Patricia; Arora, Vaneet; Johnson, Matt; George, Karim; Tobias, Joshua; Lunn, Stephanie; Miller, Taylor; Thoroughman, Douglas; Spicer, Kevin B",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,544

It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and the outbreak still keeps its impacts worldwide. Behçet disease (BD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis involving the skin, mucosa, eyes, joints, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. The precise etiopathogenesis of the disorder is unknown but autoimmunity is believed to play a key role. A considerable part of patients with BD are susceptible to immunosuppression and are more predisposed to infections than healthy individuals. Hence, the protection and control measures for patients with BD against the COVID-19 are of the utmost significance. Given the requirement to balance proper treatment of BD with the smallest risk of COVID-19 associated mortality and morbidity, we aimed to review the management of BD in the era of the pandemic with a special focus on treatment considerations. According to current expert recommendations, there is no reason to discontinue topical treatments, colchicine, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Systemic steroids can be used at the lowest possible dose if needed. Ongoing treatments can be continued unchanged in patients with no suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In cases with COVID-19 symptoms, immunosuppressive and biological agents can be temporarily stopped but the decision should be made on a case by case basis. Considering their potential beneficial effects on the course of COVID-19, colchicine, pentoxifylline, and dapsone can be considered as safe treatment options in BD.","Elmas, Ömer Faruk; Demirbas, Abdullah; Bagcier, Fatih; Türsen, Ümit; Atasoy, Mustafa; Dursun, Recep; Lotti, Torello",Dermatol Ther,,544
290727,Laryngeal Evaluation during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Transcervical Laryngeal Ultrasonography,2020,"Introduction: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the pandemic caused by a new coronavirus. There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation. In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. Material and methods: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET/CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET/CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET/CT studies.","Mucientes Rasilla, J; Jimeno Pernett, R; Cardona Arboniés, J",Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol,,544

294778,Evaluation of the Incidence and Potential Mechanisms of Tracheal Complications in Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: A simple and self-administered 'scratch & sniff' test kit like the TIBSIT smell kit based on the Taiwan Smell Identification Test (TWSIT), provides a safe and quick assessment of olfaction. The original TIBSIT has been validated for use in Taiwan with age specific scores for different age groups and diagnosis. The main aim of this study is to examine if TIBSIT can be applicable for the Malaysian population and perform cultural adaptation as necessary to allow a more accurate assessment using this tool. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A preliminary study of the original TIBSIT (Phase 1) followed by cultural adaption (Phase 2) were carried out on volunteers from various neighbourhoods in Klang Valley, Malaysia comprising of age group 16-80 years. A total of 150 test subjects and 50 test subjects were recruited for Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively. Cultural adaptation was done with changes to the distractors that were found to be confusing. In addition, modifications included added language translation and visual reinforcement with images of the odour's substance of origin. RESULTS: 109 out of the 150 responses were accepted for Phase 1. A detection rate of less than 75% was found in three of the odours with the remaining showing an average rate of 87.2% to 97.7%. These three odours were culturally adapted for Phase 2. All 50 responses for Phase 2 were accepted;two of the odours' detection rates improved to 98% but the plum odour was only detected 53% of the time. CONCLUSION: TIBSIT provides a quick office-based olfaction testing. The culturally adapted test kit is a potentially useful screening test for the Malaysian population. It is also safe and excludes the need of the clinician to carry out the test. This becomes especially useful in testing any dysosmia (hyposmia/anosmia) cases suspected of SARS-COV-2 virus infection (COVID-19).","Kevin, S. D.; Govindaraju, R.; Danaee, M.; Shahrizal, T.

298720,Conventional Naso-Oropharyngeal Sampling Versus Self-Collected Saliva Samples in COVID-19 Testing,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner. With this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened parents' and children's psychological well-being. We also examine the extent of crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being. METHODS: Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (N = 8222 person-days from 645 individuals). A subsample completed a one-time survey about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample n = 561). RESULTS: Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of the crisis. Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness. Both parents' and children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and children's mental health is worse. As the crisis continues to unfold, pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects of the crisis.","Gassman-Pines, Anna; Ananat, Elizabeth Oltmans; Fitz-Henley, John",Pediatrics,,544

This report describes a COVID-19 patient treated with nafamostat and heparin to prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO support. Case presentation: A 63-year-old man was transferred to our hospital with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was provided venous-venous ECMO to maintain oxygenation. During ECMO support, occlusive circuit thrombosis developed despite systemic anticoagulation therapy with heparin. He was subsequently administered combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin. Although the combination therapy could prevent circuit thrombosis, it was converted to heparin monotherapy because of hyperkalemia and hemothorax. After tracheostomy and a gradual improvement in oxygenation, ECMO was discontinued. He was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Conclusion: Combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin can prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO. However, bleeding can still develop with this combination therapy during ECMO.","Doi, Shunichi; Akashi, Yoshihiro J; Takita, Mumon; Yoshida, Hideki; Morikawa, Daiki; Ishibashi, Yuki; Higuma, Takumi; Fujitani, Shigeki",Acute medicine &amp; surgery,,544

319519,"Incidence of Bell Palsy in Patients With COVID-19 (vol 147, pg 767, 2021)",2021,"Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a ß-galactoside-binding lectin capable of promoting or suppressing the progression of infectious diseases. This protein is susceptible to cleavage of its linker-peptides by several proteases, and the resulting cleaved forms, N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and C-terminal CRD, bind to various glycans. It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities. We propose that FL-Gal-9 regulates the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, HIV co-infected with opportunistic infection (HIV/OI), dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis (TB). We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB. The protease cleavage of FL-Gal-9 may lead to uncontrolled hyper-immune activation, including a cytokine storm. In summary, Gal-9 has potential to reflect the disease severity for the acute and chronic infectious diseases.","Iwasaki-Hozumi, Hiroko; Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile; Ashino, Yugo; Hattori, Toshio",Biomolecules,,544

(Special issue on COVID-19.),2020,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has posed a serious impact on human life and health. Facing this unknown, unexpected, and devastating disease, China launched a resolute battle to prevent and control its spread. This study focused on assessing the recovery of city activity of 17 administrative regions in China around the COVID-19 pandemic period in early 2020. The night-time light (NTL) satellite remote sensing data, NPP-VIIRS dataset, was applied to evaluate the NTL changes during the coronavirus epidemic to understand the impact of the epidemic on city activity and the economy of China. A series of median composites was firstly constructed to analyze short-term NTL changes. Based on these median composites, the ratio map, difference map, wave index (WI), and recovery ratio (RR) were defined to indicate the NTL recovery pattern and its spatial distribution characteristics. The results show that: 1) the adopted median composites are able to describe the NTL changes in the short-term;2) the recovery of city activity could not be exactly described by RR of a single year but could be evaluated by the comparison of RR between two adjacent years;3) a partial and spatially heterogeneous recovery of city activity is observed after the 2020 holiday compared to 2019, 4) a better degree of recovery is observed after China announced its fully work resumption.

Within 10 days of identification of the first healthcare worker infection, both hospitals had closed, and all patients were discharged or decanted to other facilities within the state. The entire hospital staff (approximately 1300 people) and their households (approximately 3000-4000 people) were furloughed for 14 days to halt the spread of infection. During the furlough period, a decommissioning, terminal clean and recommissioning process was undertaken alongside recovery and reorientation of the workforce to personal protective equipment. Within 4 days of closure, an Australian Defence Force and Australian Medical Assistance Team team opened the prioritised emergency department to provide emergency care for the local community, supported by modified diagnostic services. The decommissioning and cleaning rolled on over the ensuing month, in a predetermined priority order. As staff returned from quarantine, they recommissioned their clinical areas. The final ward, a modified medical isolation wing, reopened on day 29. ISSUE: Disaster management activities may be grouped under four main headings: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. There are many opportunities for improvement and learning, and this article focuses on the local response and recovery, describing the process undertaken from the perspective of a small management group. Authors CC, HE, TB and MW were on the ground during the decommissioning process, then managed aspects of the cleaning and recommissioning remotely from furlough.

We also sampled patients' surroundings and healthcare workers' personal protection equipment (PPE) in a non-ICU ward. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR. RESULTS: Eighty-eight samples were collected from high-touch surfaces and floors in patient rooms and toilets, with only the bedsheets of two patients and one toilet positive for SARS-CoV-2. All air samples (n = 34) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Fifty-five samples collected from PPE were all negative. CONCLUSION: Contamination of near-patient surroundings was uncommon for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status if environmental cleaning/disinfection were performed rigorously.

This paper comprehensively investigates state of art in renewable resources and cross-border electric interconnection in South America. Based on the raw data collected from typical countries, a long-term scenario forecast methodology is applied to estimate key indicators of electric sector in target years, comparing the prospects of active promoting cross-border Interconnections Towards Renewables (ITR) scenario with Business as Usual (BAU) scenario in South America region. Key indicators including peak load, installed capacity, investment, and generation cost are forecasted and comparative analyzed by year 2035 and 2050. The comparative data analysis shows that by promoting cross-border interconnection towards renewables in South America, renewable resources can be highly utilized for energy supply, energy matrix can be optimized balanced, economics can be obviously driven and generation cost can be greatly reduced.","Wang, Wenhao; Meng, Jing; Chen, Duan; Cong, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05194v1.pdf,544

339472,"Pediatric, Family-Centered, ""At-Home"" Otologic Physical Examination in the COVID-19 Era",2020,"Lockdowns can be an effective pandemic response strategy that can buy much needed time to slow disease transmission and adequately scale up preventative, diagnostic, and treatment capacities. However, the broad restrictive measures typically associated with lockdowns, though effective, also comes at a cost - imposing significant social and economic burdens on individuals and societies, especially for those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Like most high-income countries (HICs), many LMICs initially adopted broad lockdown strategies for COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic. While many HICs experiencing subsequent waves have returned to employing lockdown strategies until they can receive the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine, many LMICs will likely have to wait much longer to get comparable access for their own citizens. In leaving LMICs vulnerable to subsequent waves for a longer period of time without vaccines, there is a risk LMICs will be tempted to re-impose lockdown measures in the meantime. In response to the urgent need for more policy development around the contextual challenges involved in employing such measures, we propose some strategies LMICs could adopt for safe and responsible lockdown entrance/exit or to avoid re-imposing coercive restrictive lockdown measures altogether.","Eyawo, Oghenowede; Viens, A M; Ugoji, Uchechukwu Chidiebere",Global Health,,544

359436,A multidisciplinary approach for managing the infraglottic difficult airway in the setting of the Coronavirus pandemic,2020,"There is strong evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, originated from an animal reservoir. However, the exact mechanisms of emergence, the host species involved, and the risk to domestic and agricultural animals are largely unknown. Some domestic animal species, including cats, ferrets, and minks, have been demonstrated to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others, such as pigs and chickens, are not. Importantly, the susceptibility of ruminants to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, even though they often live in close proximity to humans. We investigated the replication and tissue tropism of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the respiratory tract of three farm animal species - cattle, sheep, and pigs - using respiratory ex vivo organ cultures (EVOCs). We demonstrate that the respiratory tissues of cattle and sheep, but not of pigs, sustain viral replication in vitro of both isolates and that SARS-CoV-2 is associated to ACE2-expressing cells of the respiratory tract of both ruminant species. Intriguingly, a SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing an amino acid substitution at site 614 of the spike protein (mutation D614G) replicated at higher magnitude in ex vivo tissues of both ruminant species, supporting previous results obtained using human cells. These results suggest that additional in vivo experiments involving several ruminant species are warranted to determine their potential role in the epidemiology of this virus.","Di Teodoro, Giovanni; Valleriani, Fabrizia; Puglia, Ilaria; Monaco, Federica; Di Pancrazio, Chiara; Luciani, Mirella; Krasteva, Ivanka; Petrini, Antonio; Marcacci, Maurilia; D039,; Alterio, Nicola; Curini, Valentina; Iorio, Mariangela; Migliorati, Giacomo; Di Domenico, Marco; Morelli, Daniela; Calistri, Paolo; Savini, Giovanni; Decaro, Nicola; Holmes, Edward C; Lorusso, Alessio",Vet Microbiol,,544

Pediatric patient anxiety in theaters, aspects of communication, and optimizing vision during surgery during the pandemic have also been addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the creation of pathways in the surgical management of patients. As the pandemic progressed, hospitals developed pathways to offer increased protection to staff during procedures. This narrative review provides a clear perspective in the management of pediatric patients in operating theaters. Guidelines received from National Health Authorities and Societies affiliated with surgery, endoscopic surgery, anesthesiology, and endoscopy were carefully reviewed regarding their recommendations and data emerging from reports on COVID-19 were selected to compile the pathways specific for pediatric patients and staff. The workflow pathways have been successfully implemented during the pandemic and include a section on patients for endoscopy as well as approach to endoscopic surgery and open procedures. Theater room ergonomics that were successful during the pandemic have been outlined along with identification of areas specific to the pediatric patient anxiety, interteam communication/identification, and visor-related vision. The guidelines used successfully during the pandemic for pediatric theater teams can be used or adapted for formulating local hospital guidelines in other centers that could be valuable in patient management beyond the pandemic.","Iacona, Roberta; Chima, Kiran; Kotecha, Ami; Saxena, Amulya",Eur J Pediatr Surg,,544

385191,Recruitment and Networking With Social Media for the Otolaryngology Match in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"In this study, we evaluated 3444 Latin American natural products using cheminformatic tools. We also characterized 196 compounds for the first time from the flora of El Salvador that were compared with the databases of secondary metabolites from Brazil, Mexico, and Panama, and 42 969 compounds (natural, semi-synthetic, synthetic) from different regions of the world. The overall analysis was performed using drug-likeness properties, molecular fingerprints of different designs, two parameters similarity, molecular scaffolds, and molecular complexity metrics. It was found that, in general, Salvadoran natural products have a large diversity based on fingerprints. Simultaneously, those belonging to Mexico and Panama present the greatest diversity of scaffolds compared to the other databases. This study provided evidence of the high structural complexity that Latin America's natural products have as a benchmark. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on a global level. Thus, in the search for substances that may influence the coronavirus life cycle, the secondary metabolites from El Salvador and Panama were evaluated by docking against the endoribonuclease NSP-15, an enzyme involved in the SARS CoV-2 viral replication.

METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to pediatric intensivists in North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand for the main study. We compared the Brazilian cohort with cohorts in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, and India. RESULTS: Overall, 501 physicians responded, 127 of which were in Brazil. Only 63.8% of respondents in Brazil had a high-flow nasal cannula available, in contrast to 100% of respondents in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The attending physician was responsible for the decision to start a high-flow nasal cannula according to 61.2% respondents in Brazil, 95.5% in the United Kingdom, 96.6% in the United States, 96.8% in Canada, and 84.7% in India. A total of 62% of respondents in Brazil, 96.3% in the United Kingdom, 96.6% in the United States, 96.8% in Canada, and 84.7% in India reported that the attending physician was responsible for the decision to wean or modify the high-flow nasal cannula settings. When high-flow nasal cannula therapy failed due to respiratory distress/failure, 82% of respondents in Brazil would consider a trial of noninvasive ventilation before endotracheal intubation, compared to 93% in the United Kingdom, 88% in the United States, 91.5% in Canada, and 76.8% in India. More Brazilian intensivists (6.5%) than intensivists in the United Kingdom, United States, and India (1.6% for all) affirmed using sedatives frequently with high-flow nasal cannulas. CONCLUSION: The availability of high-flow nasal cannulas in Brazil is still not widespread.

390701,"Reply to ""An Approach to Manage Epistaxis in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Resource-Constrained Settings""",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 8, 2020 and was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 uses the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry route, associated with the transmembrane serine protease protein (TMPRSS2), which makes the testis and particularly spermatogenesis potentially vulnerable, since this tissue has high expression of ACE2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review by electronic bibliographic databases in Pubmed, Scopus and ScienceDirect up to August 2020 about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on male sexual function and its transmission, to assess possible repercussions on sex organs and the existence of a sexual transmission path. RESULTS: Although SARS-CoV-2 presence has not been found in testicle samples, it has been demonstrated that it causes histological changes compatible with orchitis, and sex hormone disturbances. TMPRSS2 is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression, thus these patients may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. No viral material has been found in blood or semen, however it has been proven to be present in stool and saliva. CONCLUSION: The male reproductive system would be highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in somatic and germ cells. The seminal fluid would remain free of viral presence in patients with COVID-19. Regardless, non-genital sex could be an important source of viral transmission. In assisted reproduction techniques all necessary tests must be carried out to ensure the donor is free of the virus at the time of collection and handling of the seminal sample.","Rodriguez Bustos, Héctor; Bravo Maturana, Gonzalo; Cortés-Chau, Felipe; Defaur Torres, Joelle; Cortés-Pino, Felipe; Aguirre, Pablo; Arriaza Onel, Camilo",Arch Ital Urol Androl,,544
392110,Challenges in the Delivery of Rural Otolaryngology Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BackgroundThe highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols. Consequently, people are required to wear masks and maintain a social distance to avoid spreading of the virus. Despite the success of the commercially available vaccines, the virus is still uncontained globally. Given the tropism of SARS-CoV-2, a mucosal immune reaction would help to reduce viral shedding and transmission locally. Only seven out of hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are testing the intranasal delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsIn the current study, we tested in murine model the immunogenicity of a conventional vaccine platform based on virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for intranasal vaccination. The candidate vaccine, CuMVTT-RBD, has been immunologically optimized to incorporate tetanus-toxin and is self-adjuvanted with TLR7/8 ligands. ResultsCuMVTT-RBD elicited strong RBD- and spike- specific systemic IgG and IgA antibody responses of high avidity. Local immune responses were assessed and results demonstrate strong mucosal antibody and plasma cell production in lung tissue. The induced systemic antibodies could efficiently recognize and neutralize different Variants of Concerns of mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. ConclusionIn summary, intranasal vaccination with CuMVTT-RBD shows high immunogenicity and induces protective systemic and local specific antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

We sought to examine cancer care providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the care for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages through social media. RESULTS: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4% had access to written guidelines that specifically address the management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status. Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-, healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3%) that decision making about Do Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays, healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for family and self.

397063,Shared Decision-making and Stakeholder Engagement in COVID-19 Tracheostomy-Reply,2021,"The UK's COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world's largest and unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. Here we reveal the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country's first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses, combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantify the size, spatio-temporal origins and persistence of genetically-distinct UK transmission lineages.

397340,Early Intervention for the Treatment of Acute Laryngeal Injury After Intubation,2021,"PURPOSE: Masking has been employed as a strategy for reducing transmission of a variety of communicable diseases. With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, many countries have implemented mandatory public masking. However, the perceived impact of mask use on pulmonary function has been a deterrent to public compliance with recommendations. COVID-19 has shed light on the impact that comorbid cardiac and pulmonary conditions may have on disease severity. This knowledge has led to increased primary and secondary prevention efforts for which exercise and rehabilitation are central. The importance of safe methods of exercise while mitigating risk of viral transmission is paramount to global recovery from the pandemic and prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: We constructed a focused literature review of the impact of various masks on pulmonary function at rest and with exercise. This was then incorporated into recommendations for the integration of masks with exercise and rehabilitation in the COVID-19 era. RESULTS: While there is a paucity of evidence, we identified the physiological effects of masking at rest and during exercise to be negligible. The perceived impact appears to be far greater than the measured impact, and increased frequency of mask use leads to a physiological and psychological adaptive response. CONCLUSIONS: Masking during daily activities, exercise, and rehabilitation is safe in both healthy individuals and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Rehabilitation participants should be reassured that the benefits of masking during COVID-19 far outweigh the risks, and increased frequency of mask use invokes adaptive responses that make long-term masking tolerable.","Haraf, Rebecca H; Faghy, Mark A; Carlin, Brian; Josephson, Richard A",J Cardiopulm Rehabil Prev,,544

403898,Tele Otology in India: Last 10 Years-A Scopic Review,2021,"INTRODUCTION: One important concern during the management of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is early anticipation of the need for intubation. ROX is an index that can help in identification of patients with low and those with high risk of intubation. So, this study was planned to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the ROX index for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia outcome (the need for intubation) and, in addition, to underline the significant association of the ROX index with clinical, radiological, demographic data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The following data were collected: medical history, clinical classification of COVID-19 infection, the ROX index measured daily and the outcome assessment. RESULTS: All patients with severe COVID-19 infection (100%) were intubated (50% of them on the 3rd day of admission), but only 38% of patients with moderate COVID-19 infection required intubation (all of them on the 3rd day of admission). The ROX index on the 1st day of admission was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 clinical classification, CT findings and intubation (p &#8804; 0.001 for each of them). Regression analysis showed that sex and ROX.1 are the only significant independent predictors of intubation [AOR (95% CI): 16.9 (2.4- 117), 0.77 (0.69-0.86)], respectively. Cut-off point of the ROX index on the 1st day of admission was &#8804; 25.26 (90.2% of sensitivity and 75% of specificity). CONCLUSIONS: ROX is a simple noninvasive promising tool for predicting discontinuation of high-flow oxygen therapy and could be used in the assessment of progress and the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.","Suliman, Lucy Abdelmabood; Abdelgawad, Taha Taha; Farrag, Nesrine Saad; Abdelwahab, Heba Wagih",Adv. respir. med.

The aim of this work was the evaluation of deaths associated with SARS-CoV­2 of persons of younger or middle age (up to 50 years) at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, with presentation of frequency, comorbidities and disease courses. Material and methods: A total of 735 SARS-CoV-2-associated cases of decedents with registered addresses in Hamburg were evaluated in 2020 at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, using various examination methods. The selection and performance of the respective methods was based on the consent given by the relatives. In addition, more autopsies of decedents with a registered address outside Hamburg and positive SARS-CoV­2 detection were performed. Results and conclusion: Of the 735 decedents 9 with a registered Hamburg address and 3 of the deaths studied with an external registered address (nâ¯= 12; 7 men and 5 women) were aged 50 years or younger, with an average age of 39.8 years. Essentially, there were cardiovascular, neurological, and malignant pre-existing diseases, as well as obesity. The SARS-CoV­2 was detected post-mortem for the first time in two cases; these were found to have a virus-independent cause of death. Of the individuals 7 died from COVID-19 pneumonia, 3 individuals from the consequences of the necessary intensive medical treatment.Several studies have demonstrated an association between obesity and severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease progression, particularly in younger patients and this was confirmed in the legal medicine study population.","Lohner, L; Fröb, D; Edler, C; Schröder, A S; Dietz, E; Ondruschka, B",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,544

413946,Olfactory Cleft Measurements and COVID-19-Related Anosmia,2020,"Pulmonary thromboembolism and deep venous thrombosis occur frequently in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, the prevalence increases on the intensive care unit (ICU) and is very high in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We undertook a literature review to assess the usefulness of screening for peripheral venous thrombosis or pulmonary thrombosis in patients admitted with COVID-19. Outside of the ICU setting, D-dimer elevation on presentation or marked increase from baseline should alert the need for doppler ultrasound scan of the lower limbs. In the ICU setting, consideration should be given to routine screening with doppler ultrasound, given the high prevalence of thrombosis in this cohort despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. However, absence of lower limb thrombosis on ultrasound does not exclude pulmonary venous thrombosis. Screening with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not justified in patients on the general wards, unless there are clinical features and/or marked elevations in markers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the risk of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary thrombosis in ICU patients is very high, especially in patients on ECMO, where studies that employed routine screening for thrombosis with CT scanning have uncovered up to 100% incidence of pulmonary thrombosis despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, in patients at low bleeding risk and high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism, therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered even before screening, Our review highlights the need for increased vigilance for VTE, with a low threshold for doppler ultrasound and CTPA in high risk in-patient cohorts, where clinical features and D-dimer levels may not accurately reflect the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism.","Vandenbriele, Christophe; Gorog, Diana A",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,544

Conventional coagulation assays do not always actively reflect these derangements and might fail to detect this coagulopathy. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA) provide a possible tool that adds to conventional coagulation assays in identifying this hypercoagulable state. VHA has been mostly used in surgery and trauma but it's still not well defined in sepsis patients with lack of large randomized trials. Few studies described VHA findings in patients with COVID-19 showing significant hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown. Clinicians taking care of these patients might have little experience interpreting VHA results. By reviewing the available literature on the use of VHA in sepsis, and the current knowledge on COVID-19-associated coagulopathy we provide clinicians with a practical guide on VHA utilization in patients with COVID-19.","Gergi, Mansour; Goodwin, Andrew; Freeman, Kalev; Colovos, Christos; Volod, Oksana",Blood coagul. fibrinolysis,,544

418968,Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Otitis Media With Effusion in Children: Future Therapeutic Implications,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a main cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophage therapy has experienced resurgence to compensate for the limited development of novel antibiotics. However, phage therapy is limited to a compassionate use so far, resulting from lack of adequate studies in relevant pharmacological models. We used a pig model of pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa that recapitulates essential features of human disease to study the antimicrobial efficacy of nebulized-phage therapy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: (i) Lysis kinetic assays were performed to evaluate in vitro phage antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and select relevant combinations of lytic phages. (ii) The efficacy of the phage combinations was investigated in vivo (murine model of P. aeruginosa lung infection). (iii) We determined the optimal conditions to ensure efficient phage delivery by aerosol during mechanical ventilation. (iv) Lung antimicrobial efficacy of inhaled-phage therapy was evaluated in pigs, which were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and infected with P. aeruginosa. KEY RESULTS: By selecting an active phage cocktail and optimizing aerosol delivery conditions, we were able to deliver high phage concentrations in the lungs, which resulted in a rapid and marked reduction in P. aeruginosa density (1.5 Log reduction, p<0.001). No infective phage was detected in the sera and urines throughout the experiment. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings demonstrated: (i) the feasibility of delivering large amounts of active phages by nebulization during mechanical ventilation, (ii) rapid control of in situ infection by inhaled bacteriophage in an experimental model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia with high translational value.","Guillon, Antoine; Pardessus, Jeoffrey; L039,; Hostis, Guillaume; Fevre, Cindy; Barc, Celine; Dalloneau, Emilie; Jouan, Youenn; Bodier-Montagutelli, Elsa; Perez, Yonatan; Thorey, Camille; Mereghetti, Laurent; Cabrera, Maria; Riou, Mickaël; Vecellio, Laurent; Le Guellec, Sandrine; Heuzé-Vourc039,; h, Nathalie",Br. j. pharmacol,,544

In the present study, the sediment removal from double bottom ballast tanks due to flow-through ballast water exchange is investigated by simplified experimental and numerical models. Two flow rates and two sediment densities were considered to verify their influence on the process. Besides, the effectiveness of two tank configuration modifications to improve the sediments removal was investigated. The first is the introduction of a flow deflector inside the tank and the second is the water inflow from the bottom. A fully Lagrangian particle-based method is adopted to simulate the sediment removal process with complex tank geometry. A new boundary condition is proposed to model the mesh of the bottom inlet in the bottom inflow configuration. Despite the simplifications of the numerical model, the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The results show that the flow-through ballast water exchange method might not be effective to remove the sediments entrapped between the bottom stiffeners, and the proposed modifications, despite challenging implementation, improve the sediment removal.","Pereira, Lucas Soares; Cheng, Liang-Yee; Ribeiro, Gabriel Henrique de Souza; Osello, Pedro Henrique Saggioratto; Motezuki, Fabio Kenji; Pereira, Newton Narciso",Mar Pollut Bull,,544

In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. METHODS: Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the 'lockdown' period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. RESULTS: Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. DISCUSSION: Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.","Olding, James; Zisman, Sophia; Olding, Carole; Fan, Kathleen",Surg.

445560,Recommendations from the CSO-HNS taskforce on performance of tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Importance: Children of all ages appear susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. To support pediatric clinical studies for investigational treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pediatric-specific dosing is required. Objective: To define pediatric-specific dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were used to extrapolate investigated adult dosages toward children (March 2020-April 2020). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform pediatric dosing for hydroxychloroquine. For remdesivir, pediatric dosages were derived using allometric-scaling with age-dependent exponents. Dosing simulations were conducted using simulated pediatric and adult participants based on the demographics of a white US population. Interventions: Simulated drug exposures following a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours × 2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours × 8 doses) and a single 200-mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants. A simulation-based dose-ranging study was conducted in simulated children exploring different absolute and weight-normalized dosing strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome for hydroxychloroquine was average unbound plasma concentrations for 5 treatment days. Additionally, unbound interstitial lung concentrations were simulated. For remdesivir, the primary outcome was plasma exposure (area under the curve, 0 to infinity) following single-dose administration. Results: For hydroxychloroquine, the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model analysis included 500 and 600 simulated white adult and pediatric participants, respectively, and supported weight-normalized dosing for children weighing less than 50 kg. Geometric mean-simulated average unbound plasma concentration values among children within different developmental age groups (32-35 ng/mL) were congruent to adults (32 ng/mL). Simulated unbound hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung interstitial fluid mirrored those in unbound plasma and were notably lower than in vitro concentrations needed to mediate antiviral activity. For remdesivir, the analysis included 1000 and 6000 simulated adult and pediatric participants, respectively. The proposed pediatric dosing strategy supported weight-normalized dosing for participants weighing less than 60 kg. Geometric mean-simulated plasma area under the time curve 0 to infinity values among children within different developmental age-groups (4315-5027 ng × h/mL) were similar to adults (4398 ng × h/mL). Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis provides pediatric-specific dosing suggestions for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir and raises concerns regarding hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 treatment because concentrations were less than those needed to mediate an antiviral effect.","Maharaj, Anil R; Wu, Huali; Hornik, Christoph P; Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Chi D; Smith, P Brian; Gonzalez, Daniel; Zimmerman, Kanecia O; Benjamin, Daniel K; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",JAMA Pediatr,,544
445752,A Novel Cough Simulation Device for Education of Risk Mitigation Techniques During Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a precipitous increase in the need for molecular diagnostics. Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an ""unextracted modification"" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.","Adams, Nicholas M; Leelawong, Mindy; Benton, Alison; Quinn, Criziel; Haselton, Frederick R; Schmitz, Jonathan E",J. med. virol,,544

The case study for India has been considered for statistical modeling and evaluation of the air quality amid pandemic. According to World Economic Forum, India had 6 out of 10 world's most polluted cities. The highest pollution level used to be around 900 in the extreme cases and sometimes beyond the measurable scale. According to WHO, anything above 25 is marked unsafe. When all the commotion was put to halt during lockdown, the AQI surprisingly fell below 20. On 3rd April 2020, i.e., just after a week of lockdown, the AQI at one of the stations in Delhi was measured 19 and that was a huge positive impact on environment. Spatial graph, bar-charts, time-series plots and boxplots have been incorporated for the analysis. Hypothesis testing proves that the lockdown has resulted in significant improvement in the level of polluting elements. This validates that tweaking daily activities can help maintaining the air-quality. © 2021 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

463500,Missing Funding Information,2020,"The impacts of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on human life continue to be serious. To control the spread of COVID-19, the production of effective vaccines is likely to be one of the best solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy may decrease individuals' willingness to get vaccinated. The Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (DrVac-COVID19S) was recently developed to help healthcare professionals and researchers better understand vaccination acceptance. The present study examined whether DrVac-COVID19S is measurement invariant across different subgroups (Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese university students; males vs. females; and health-related program majors vs. non-health-related program majors). Taiwanese (n = 761; mean age = 25.51 years; standard deviation (SD) = 6.42; 63.5% females) and mainland Chinese university students (n = 3145; mean age = 20.72 years; SD = 2.06; 50.2% females) were recruited using an online survey between 5 January and 21 February 2021. Factor structure and measurement invariance of the two DrVac-COVID19S scales (nine-item and 12-item) were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings indicated that the DrVac-COVID19S had a four-factor structure and was measurement invariant across the subgroups. The DrVac-COVID19S's four-factor structure was supported by the CFA results is a practical and valid instrument to quickly capture university students' willingness to get COVID-19 vaccination.

To this end, the effectiveness of several air cleaning devices (ACDs) in reducing HCPs exposure to aerosols generated during dental procedures was estimated, separately or in combination with each other. These ACDs were a chairside unit capturing aerosols at the source of generation, and four ambient ACDs: a portable ambient ACD; a negative pressure module; a custom made, fan-operated and wall-mounted air filter (WMAF); and a smaller and passive version of the latter. The last three ACDs were intended for mobile dental clinics (MDCs) only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This assessment was performed in two different environments: in a dental clinic operatory and in a MDC. Two dental personnel, acting in the roles of dentist and dental assistant, performed on simulated patient aerosol-generating and non-aerosol-generating procedures. For each 5-minute scenario, the cumulative exposure to airborne particulate matter 10 µm in size or smaller (PM10) was determined by calculating the sum of all 1 second readings obtained with personal and ambient air monitors. The effectiveness of the ACDs in capturing PM10 was estimated based on the capability of the ACDs to keep PM10 level at or below the initial background level. RESULTS: In all conditions assessed in the dental clinic operatory, when both the chairside and portable ambient ACDs were functioning, an estimated effectiveness of 100% in capturing PM10 was achieved. In the MDC, in all conditions where the chairside ACD was used without the negative pressure module, an estimated effectiveness of 100% was also achieved. The simultaneous operation of the negative pressure module in the MDC, which led to a room negative pressure of -0.25 inch wc, reduced the chairside ACD's effectiveness in capturing aerosols. Conversely, the use of the WMAF in the MDC in combination with the chairside ACD further reduced exposure to PM10 below the initial background level. Nonetheless, in all conditions assessed in both settings (dental clinic operatory and MDC), larger visible aerosols were produced, often landing on the surrounding environment. A fair portion of these aerosols landed on the inside of the chairside ACD flange. CONCLUSIONS: This assessment suggests that the use of the tested chairside ACD, by capturing aerosols at the source of generation, had the greatest impact on reducing exposure of dental personnel to PM10 produced during dental procedures. This study also indicates that such exposure is further reduced with the addition of an ambient ACD. However, creating a negative pressure room as high as -0.25 inch wc can lead to air turbulence reducing the effectiveness of ACDs in capturing aerosols at the source. Furthermore, the presence of uncaptured droplets and spatter on the surrounding environment supports the need to complement the use of engineering controls with proper administrative controls and personal protective equipment, as recommended by governmental agencies and the scientific community for preventing the transmission of infection in health care settings.","Maurais, T; Kriese, J; Fournier, M; Langevin, L; MacLeod, B; Blier, S; Tessier-Guay, J P; Girardin, A; Maheux, L",Mil. med,,544
471926,Advancing African otolaryngology and head & neck surgery education and training through virtual academic platforms and multidisciplinary teams,2021,"The lifestyle adopted by most people in Western societies has an important impact on the propensity to metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases). This is often accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, driven by the activation of various molecular pathways such as STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), IKK (I&#954;B kinase), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), COX2 (cyclooxigenase 2), and NF-Kß (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells). Multiple intervention studies have demonstrated that lifestyle changes can lead to reduced inflammation and improved health. This can be linked to the concept of real-life risk simulation, since humans are continuously exposed to dietary factors in small doses and complex combinations (e.g., polyphenols, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, etc.). Inflammation biomarkers improve in patients who consume a certain amount of fiber per day; some even losing weight. Fasting in combination with calorie restriction modulates molecular mechanisms such as m-TOR, FOXO, NRF2, AMPK, and sirtuins, ultimately leads to significantly reduced inflammatory marker levels, as well as improved metabolic markers. Moving toward healthier dietary habits at the individual level and in publicly-funded institutions, such as schools or hospitals, could help improving public health, reducing healthcare costs and improving community resilience to epidemics (such as COVID-19), which predominantly affects individuals with metabolic diseases.","Margina, Denisa; Ungurianu, Anca; Purdel, Carmen; Tsoukalas, Dimitris; Sarandi, Evangelia; Thanasoula, Maria; Tekos, Fotios; Mesnage, Robin; Kouretas, Demetrios; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,544
472213,Emergency Tracheostomy Amid COVID-19,2021,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus infected cells within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, Felix; Neufeldt, Christopher J; Cerikan, Berati; Prasad, Vibhu; Pape, Costantin; Laketa, Vibor; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Cortese, Mirko",J. virol,,544
472724,Insights on Otolaryngology Residency Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The three main goals of ecological economic theory seek to predict and prevent system breakdowns. However chaos theory and human uncertainty/ignorance guarantee that shocks, breakdowns and catastrophes like COVID-19 will increasingly occur due to converging environmental resource crises. The challenge then is designing a resilient (safe-fail) economy that can endure, adapt to and successfully recover from breakdowns and avoid collapse. To date little attention has been paid in ecological economics to the implications of resilience for broader economic decisions affecting the design of global civilization. This paper provides a general introduction to resilience and an argument for why it should become a much larger focus of ecological economic research going forward. Five arguments are advanced for why resilience should not be subsumed under an existing goal, including that efforts to build resilience have the potential to both complement and contradict the other three goals, especially efficiency. The Resilience Alliance‘s adaptive cycle highlighting the cost to resilience of increasing scale and complexity meshes readily with ecological economist's own critiques of growth, encouraging increased collaboration between these transdisciplines. The need to further study these tensions provides justification for adding “Resilient Design” as a distinct fourth policy goal to core ecological economic theory.","Stanley, Conrad",Ecol. Econ.,,544

However, age and metabolic syndrome are potential cofounders when assessing the value of coagulation biomarkers prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. We assessed whether coagulation biomarkers, including FVIII and VWF levels, measured at time of admission were predictive of COVID-19 adverse outcomes irrespective of age and major comorbidities associated with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Blood was sampled at admission in 243 adult COVID-19 patients for analysis of coagulation biomarkers including FVIII and VWF on platelet-poor plasma. The association between baseline CRP, aPTT ratio, PT ratio, D-dimers, fibrinogen, FVIII, VWF:Ag and FVIII/VWF:Ag ratio levels and adverse outcomes (increased oxygen requirements, thrombosis and death at day-30) was assessed by regression analysis after adjustment on age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. RESULTS: In univariable regression analysis increased CRP (SHR, 1.68; 95%CI, 1.26 to 2.23), increased fibrinogen (SHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.68) and decreased FVIII/VWF:Ag ratio (SHR, 0.70 ; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96) levels at admission were significantly associated with the risk of increased oxygen requirement during follow-up. Leucocytes (SHR, 1.36; 95%CI, 1.04 to 1.76), platelets (SHR,1.71; 95%CI, 1.11 to 2.62), D-dimers (SHR, 2.48; 95%CI, 1.66 to 3.78), FVIII (SHR, 1.78; 95%CI, 1.17 to 2.68) were associated with early onset of thrombosis after admission. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension and diabetes, these associations were not modified. CONCLUSION: Coagulation biomarkers are early and independent predictors of increased oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients.","Rauch, Antoine; Labreuche, Julien; Lassalle, Fanny; Goutay, Julien; Caplan, Morgan; Charbonnier, Leslie; Rohn, Aurelien; Jeanpierre, Emmanuelle; Dupont, Annabelle; Duhamel, Alain; Faure, Karine; Lambert, Marc; Kipnis, Eric; Garrigue, Delphine; Lenting, Peter J; Poissy, Julien; Susen, Sophie",J. thromb. haemost,,544

478773,Prevalence of Otorhinolaryngological Symptoms in Covid 19 Patients,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 pneumonia CT extent correlates well with outcome including mortality. However, CT is not widely available in many countries. This study aimed to explore the relationship between Covid-19 pneumonia CT extent and blood tests variations. The objective was to determine for the biological variables correlating with disease severity the cut-off values showing the best performance to predict the parenchymal extent of the pneumonia. METHODS: Bivariate correlations were calculated between biological variables and grade of disease extent on CT. Receiving Operating Characteristic curve analysis determined the best cutoffs for the strongest correlated biological variables. The performance of these variables to predict mild (<10%) or severe pneumonia (>50% of parenchyma involved) was evaluated. RESULTS: Correlations between biological variables and disease extent was evaluated in 168 patients included in this study. LDH, lymphocyte count and CRP showed the strongest correlations (with 0.67, -0.41 and 0.52 correlation coefficient, respectively). Patients were split into a training and a validation cohort according to their centers. If one variable was above/below the following cut-offs, LDH>380, CRP>80 or lymphocyte count <0.8G/L, severe pneumonia extent on CT was detected with 100% sensitivity. Values above/below all three thresholds were denoted in 73% of patients with severe pneumonia extent. The combination of LDH<220 and CRP<22 was associated with mild pneumonia extent (<10%) with specificity of 100%. DISCUSSION: LDH showed the strongest correlation with the extent of Covid-19 pneumonia on CT. Combined with CRP±lymphocyte count, it helps predicting parenchymal extent of the pneumonia when CT scan is not available.","Tordjman, Mickael; Ahmed, Mekki; Rahul, Mali D; Hippolyte, Monnier; Sophie, Neveu; Guillaume, Chassagnon; Fadila, Mihoubi; Nicolas, Carlier; Jonathan, Marey; Laure, Fournier; Robert-Yves, Carlier; Jean-Luc, Drape; Marie-Pierre, Revel",Respir Med,,544

The researcher aims to understand the experiences, sense of belonging, and decision-making processes about Japanese pre-service nursing students and how the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, and lockdown has influenced their understanding as pre-service nursing professionals in Japan. As this study focuses on the issues of pre-service nursing students, the researcher invited forty-nine pre-service nursing students for a virtual interview due to the recommendation of social distancing. To increase the coverage of the population, the researcher employed snowball sampling to recruit participants from all over Japan. Although the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the overall performance of the medical and nursing professions, all participants showed a sense of belonging as Japanese citizens and nursing professionals due to the natural disaster of their country. More importantly, all expressed their desires and missions to upgrade and improve the overall performance of the public health system due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results discovered that many Japanese nursing students advocated that Japan's national development, the benefits and advantages of their country, were of a greater importance than their own personal development and goals.","Santos, Luis Miguel Dos",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,544

The COvid MEdicaTion (COMET) study is an observational, multinational study that focused on the clinical course of COVID-19 (i.e. hospital mortality and intensive care unit [ICU] admission), and included COVID-19 patients who were registered at the emergency department or admitted to clinical wards of 63 participating hospitals. Pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists or treating physicians collected data on medication prescribed prior to admission. The association between the medication and composite clinical endpoint, including mortality and ICU admission, was analysed by multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for potential confounders. A total of 4870 patients were enrolled. ACEi were used by 847 (17.4%) patients and ARB by 761 (15.6%) patients. No significant association was seen with ACEi and the composite endpoint (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.12), mortality (OR 1.03; 95%CI 0.84 to 1.27) or ICU admission (OR 0.96; 95%CI 0.78 to 1.19) after adjustment for covariates. Similarly, no association was observed between ARB and the composite endpoint (OR 1.09; 95%CI 0.90 to 1.30), mortality (OR 1.12; OR 0.90 to 1.39) or ICU admission (OR 1.21; 95%CI 0.98 to 1.49). In conclusion, we found no evidence of a harmful or beneficial effect of ACEi or ARB use prior to hospital admission on ICU admission or hospital mortality.","Sablerolles, Roos S G; Hogenhuis, Freija E F; Lafeber, Melvin; van de Loo, Bob P A; Borgsteede, Sander D; Boersma, Eric; Versmissen, Jorie; van der Kuy, Hugo",,,544

During several essential steps of the membrane processing, an intensive employment of ZrO2 milling balls is usually inevitable. However, how these milling balls affect the final LWO-Mo membranes, is still largely unknown. Employing comprehensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, the residual Zr was found to segregate to the grain boundaries (GBs) of the LWO-Mo, either as thin layers or as individual nanograins. At atomic scale, structural and chemical analyses on these GB features were carried out quantitatively. The segregated Zr took more than half of the W sites of the LWO-Mo, resulting in a strained LWO structure and locally concentrated oxygen vacancies. To minimize any Zr contamination, either a competent alternative for ZrO2 or a careful introduction of certain secondary phases (SPs) was proposed. Our results unravel the processing-induced GB behaviors in LWO-Mo, which pave the way towards further optimized processing for various types of functional membranes.","Ran, Ke; Deibert, Wendelin; Ivanova, Mariya E; Meulenberg, Wilhelm A; Mayer, Joachim",Nanoscale (Online),,544

As a result, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Error, Trend, and Seasonality (ETS) modeling have been successfully applied to resolve problems with nonlinear estimation. Our research suggests that it would be ideal to use a single model of ETS or ARIMA for COVID-19 time series forecasting rather than a complicated Hybrid model that combines several models. We compare the forecasting performance of these models using real, worldwide, daily COVID-19 data for the period between January 22, 2020 till June 19, and June 20 till January 2, 2021 which marks two stages, each stage indicating the first and the second wave respectively. We discuss various forecasting approaches and the criteria for choosing the best forecasting technique. The best forecasting model selected was compared using the forecasting assessment criterion known as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The empirical results show that the ETS and ARIMA models outperform the ANN and Hybrid models. The main finding from the ETS and ARIMA models analysis indicate that the magnitude of the increase in total confirmed cases over time is declining and the percentage change in the death rate is also on the decline. Our results shows that the chosen forecaste models are consistent during the first and second wave of of the pandemic. These forecasts are encouraging as the world struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19.

This syndrome characterizes by the onset of clinical signs and symptoms and delivery before (early-onset preeclampsia, eoPE) or after (late-onset preeclampsia, loPE) the 34 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia is a mitochondrial disorder where differential involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in eoPE and loPE is unclear. Mitochondria regulate cell metabolism and are a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The syncytiotrophoblast in eoPE and loPE show with altered mitochondria structure and function resulting in ROS overproduction, oxidative stress, and cell damage and death. Mitochondria dysfunction may result from different alterations in eoPE where an altered expression of several molecules, including dynamin-related protein 1 and mitofusins, compared with loPE where these factors are either reduced or unaltered. Equally, mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics seem differentially modulated in eoPE and loPE. However, it is unclear whether the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are differentially altered in these two subgroups of preeclampsia. However, the activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and expression of essential proteins involved in the electron transport chain is reduced, leading to lower oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration in the placenta in preeclampsia. Interventional studies in patients with preeclampsia using the coenzyme Q10, a key molecule in the electron transport chain, suggest that agents increasing the antioxidant capacity of the placenta may be protective of developing preeclampsia. In this review, the mitochondrial dysfunction in both eoPE and loPE is summarized. Therapeutical approaches are discussed in the context of contributing to the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in eoPE and loPE.","Marín, Reinaldo; Chiarello, Delia I; Abad, Cilia; Rojas, Deliana; Toledo, Fernando; Sobrevia, Luis",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,544

Blood samples were collected from all cows at on 3 occasions pre-partum and 3 occasions post-partum. Body condition (BCS) score was evaluated and glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), BHB, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin, total proteins, globulins, albumin and urea concentrations were assessed. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was applied. Statistically significant differences among the three experimental groups were found in the values of all studied parameters (P < 0.05). Our results confirm the established beneficial effect of MON treatment in decreasing BHB levels and increasing glucose availability after calving. Serum biochemical analysis revealed the expected post-partum alterations attributable to adaptations that influenced the metabolism and liver function in CTRL, whereas these alterations were reduced or absent in SUPP and MON. Results from the present study suggest that both preventive protocols, but in particular SUPP, could positively affect selected indicators of energy metabolism reducing the risk of hyperketonaemia and increase of liver function in Holstein dairy cows, both pre- and post-partum.","Fiore, Enrico; Perillo, Laura; Gianesella, Matteo; Giannetto, Claudia; Giudice, Elisabetta; Piccione, Giuseppe; Morgante, Massimo",J Dairy Res,,544

508173,Surgical Considerations for Tracheostomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned From the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak,2020,"This paper introduces a new basic risk model that could also be utilized by Covid-19 warning apps a priori, before an action is performed. Today the common warning apps estimate risk a posteriori and give no advice on particular scenarios. The new model also has the advantage that the individual risks behind the decision-making process would be uniform (in contrast to some current regulations) and it could help to understand the risks better and could also help to reduce risks a priori. It could be easily implemented on a single app screen, needing only some individual preferences to be set and a handful of adjustments to the particular scenario that shall be assessed. The disadvantage as of any simplified semi-quantitative risk models is that calibration is not easy (as some calibration points may even contradict) and that cumulative effects are hard to integrate e. g. the joint effect of combined scenarios. But, in principle calibration is feasible and it may be a good decision to calibrate the model conservatively.","Braband, Jens; Schabe, Hendrik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02243v1.pdf,544

509102,Lockdown Boredom in COVID-19 Pandemic: As a Cause of Pediatric Foreign Bodies,2020,"RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which commonly presents with symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea. More recently, however, some patients have tested positive for COVID-19 after developing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms either solely or in conjunction with respiratory symptoms. This may be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the GI tract. In patients with chronic GI illnesses, COVID-19 may initially present as a flare of their underlying GI conditions as viruses have historically been implicated in exacerbations of GI disorders, including gastroparesis. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetic gastroparesis who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with nausea and vomiting similar to her gastroparesis flares. DIAGNOSES: Her symptoms in the ED failed to improve with fluids and anti-emetic medications. After developing a fever, she was tested and found to be positive for COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: She was started on antibiotic, steroid, and antiviral medications. OUTCOMES: Her symptoms improved, her fever defervesced on day 4 of hospitalization, and she was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization. The patient reported symptom improvement at a follow-up outpatient gastroenterology visit 2 months after hospitalization. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, at the present time, this is the first report of a patient with COVID-19 presenting with signs and symptoms of a gastroparesis flare. This case illustrates that COVID-19 may present in an exacerbation of symptoms of an underlying disorder, such as a severe gastroparesis flare, in a patient with underlying gastroparesis. Initial presentation of these patients manifesting as a flare of their chronic GI disease, more severe than usual, should prompt an index of suspicion for COVID-19.","Song, Jun; Bhuta, Rajiv; Baig, Kamal; Parkman, Henry P; Malik, Zubair",Medicine (Baltimore),,544

518157,Covid-19 Demographics from a Tertiary Care Center: Does It Depreciate Quality-of-Life?,2020,"Context: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a turbulent business environment, resulting in market uncertainties, frustrations, and rumors. Wrongly held beliefs—or myths—can hinder startups from turning new market opportunities into their favor (for example, by failing at diversification decisions) or undertaking wrong business decisions, e.g., diversifying in industries that have products of no real market value). Objectives: The objective of the paper is to identify the beliefs that drive the business decisions of startups in a pandemic and to isolate those beliefs that are merely myths. Further, this paper proposes strategic guidelines in the form of a framework to help startups make sound decisions that can lead to market success. Method: The two-step research method involved multiple case studies with five startups based in India, France, Italy, and Switzerland, to identify perceptual beliefs that drove strategic business decisions, followed by a case study of 36 COVID-19-solution focused startups, funded by the European Union (EU). The findings were validated through a survey that involved 102 entrepreneurs. The comparative analysis of two multiple case studies helped identify beliefs that were merely “myths”;myths that drove irrational strategic decisions, resulting in business failures. Results: The results indicate that startups make decisions in pandemic situations that are driven by seven myths, pertaining to human, intellectual, and financial resources. The decision on whether to diversify or continue in the same business operation can be divided into four strategic options of the Competency-Industry Relatedness (C-IR) framework: ignore, delay, phase-in, and diversify. Diversification in the same (or different industry) is less risky for startups if they have the skills, as needed, to diversify in related industries. Diversification in related industries helps startups leverage their experiences and learning curves (those associated with existing product lines) to adapt their existing products in new markets, or utilize their technologies to solve new problems via new products. The desired outcome for these startups should be sustainable business growth—to meet sustainability goals by contributing to the society and the economy. Conclusion: The C-IR framework is a strategic guide for startups to make business decisions based on internal factors, rather than myths. Accurately assessing skill diversity and the nature of new industries (or markets) will help startups leverage their existing resources optimally, without the need for (pricey) external funding. This will foster sustained business growth resulting in a nation economic development. Knowledge transfer from the Innovation ecosystem will further strengthen the C-IR framework effectiveness.","Gupta, Varun Rubalcaba Luis",Sustainability,,544

520507,Flexible Laryngoscopy and COVID-19,2020,"With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, fast diagnostic testing has become one of the major challenges due to the critical shortage of test kit. Pneumonia, a major effect of COVID-19, needs to be urgently diagnosed along with its underlying reasons. In this paper, deep learning aided automated COVID-19 and other pneumonia detection schemes are proposed utilizing a small amount of COVID-19 chest X-rays. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, named as CovXNet, is proposed that utilizes depthwise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. Since the chest X-ray images corresponding to COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other traditional pneumonias have significant similarities, at first, a large number of chest X-rays corresponding to normal and (viral/bacterial) pneumonia patients are used to train the proposed CovXNet. Learning of this initial training phase is transferred with some additional fine-tuning layers that are further trained with a smaller number of chest X-rays corresponding to COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets are designed and trained with X-ray images of various resolutions and for further optimization of their predictions, a stacking algorithm is employed. Finally, a gradient-based discriminative localization is integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images referring to different types of pneumonia. Extensive experimentations using two different datasets provide very satisfactory detection performance with accuracy of 97.4% for COVID/Normal, 96.9% for COVID/Viral pneumonia, 94.7% for COVID/Bacterial pneumonia, and 90.2% for multiclass COVID/normal/Viral/Bacterial pneumonias. Hence, the proposed schemes can serve as an efficient tool in the current state of COVID-19 pandemic.

521387,Hearing Loss-a Camouflaged Manifestation of COVID 19 Infection,2021,"Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignancy with high morbidity/mortality, partly due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. It is important to develop reliable biomarker(s) with specificity, sensitivity and convenience for early diagnosis. The role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and survival of GC patients are controversial. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) regulates monocytes/macrophages. Elevated MCSF is correlated with invasion, metastasis and poor survival of tumour patients. IL-34, a ligand of the M-CSF receptor, acts as a ""twin"" to M-CSF, demonstrating overlapping and complimentary actions. IL-34 involvement in tumours is controversial, possibly due to the levels of M-CSF receptors. While the IL-34/M-CSF/M-CSFR axis is very important for regulating macrophage differentiation, the specific interplay between these cytokines, macrophages and tumour development is unclear. Methods: A multi-factorial evaluation could provide more objective utility, particularly for either prediction and/or prognosis of gastric cancer. Precision medicine requires molecular diagnosis to determine the specifically mutant function of tumours, and is becoming popular in the treatment of malignancy. Therefore, elucidating specific molecular signalling pathways in specific cancers facilitates the success of a precision medicine approach. Gastric cancer tissue arrays were generated from stomach samples with TNM stage, invasion depth and the demography of these patients (n = 185). Using immunohistochemistry/histopathology, M-CSF, IL-34 and macrophages were determined. Results: We found that IL-34 may serve as a predictive biomarker, but not as an independent, prognostic factor in GC; M-CSF inversely correlated with survival of GC in TNM III-IV subtypes. Increased CD68+ TAMs were a good prognostic factor in some cases and could be used as an independent prognostic factor in male T3 stage GC. Conclusion: Our data support the potency of IL-34, M-CSF, TAMs and the combination of IL-34/TAMs as novel biological markers for GC, and may provide new insight for both diagnosis and cellular therapy of GC.","Liu, Qinghua; Zhang, Ying; Zhang, Jiwei; Tao, Kun; Hambly, Brett D; Bao, Shisan",Cell Biosci,,544
523447,Anosmia due to dryness in about 1771: An ancestor of COVID-19?,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised numerous questions among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases regarding potential reciprocal effects of COVID-19 and their underlying disease, and potential effects of immunomodulatory therapy on outcomes related to COVID-19. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are still unclear. The Euro-COVIMID study aimed to determine the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as factors associated with COVID-19 occurrence and the impact of the pandemic in its management. Methods: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, or giant cell arteritis were recruited from six tertiary referral centres in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and recent disease flares, as well as information on COVID-19 symptoms, were collected through a questionnaire completed by participants. SARS-CoV-2 serology was systematically tested. The main outcome was the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, and incidence of recent disease flares, changes in treatments for underlying disease, and the reasons for treatment changes were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04397237. Findings: Between June 7 and Dec 8, 2020, 3136 patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory disease answered the questionnaire. 3028 patients (median age 58 years [IQR 46-67]; 2239 [73·9%] women and 789 [26·1%] men) with symptomatic COVID-19, serological data, or both were included in analyses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (5·5% [95% CI 4·7-6·4]) of 3018 patients who had serology tests. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 122 (4·0% [95% CI 3·4-4·8]) of 3028 patients, of whom 24 (19·7%) were admitted to hospital and four (3·3%) died. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1·18, 95% CI 1·05-1·33; p=0·0063), and higher numbers of recent disease flares (1·27, 1·02-1·58; p=0·030), whereas use of biological therapy was associated with reduced risk (0·51, 0·32-0·82; p=0·0057). At least one disease flare occurred in 654 (21·6%) of 3028 patients. Over the study period, 519 (20·6%) of 2514 patients had treatment changes, of which 125 (24·1%) were due to the pandemic. Interpretation: This study provides key insights into the epidemiology and risk factors of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overall, immunosuppressants do not seem to be deleterious in this scenario, and the control of inflammatory activity seems to be key when facing the pandemic.

593627,Pediatric Airway Surgeries in COVID 19 Era,2020-07-27,"INTRODUCTION: Although many Medicare Advantage plans have waived cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations, these waivers are voluntary and may be temporary. To estimate the magnitude of potential patient cost sharing if waivers are not implemented or are allowed to expire, this study assesses the level and predictors of out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations in 2018 among elderly Medicare Advantage patients. METHODS: Using the Optum De-Identified Clinformatics DataMart, investigators identified Medicare Advantage patients aged ≥65 years hospitalized for influenza in 2018. For each hospitalization, out-of-pocket spending was calculated by summing deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. The mean out-of-pocket spending and the proportion of hospitalizations with out-of-pocket spending exceeding $2,500 were calculated. A 1-part generalized linear model with a log link and Poisson variance function was fitted to model out-of-pocket spending as a function of patient demographic characteristics, plan type, and hospitalization characteristics. Coefficients were converted to absolute changes in out-of-pocket spending by calculating average marginal effects. RESULTS: Among 14,278 influenza hospitalizations, the mean out-of-pocket spending was $987 (SD=$799). Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2,500 for 3.0% of hospitalizations. The factors associated with higher out-of-pocket spending included intensive care use, greater length of stay, and enrollment in a preferred provider organization plan (average marginal effect=$634, 95% CI=$631, $636) compared with enrollment in an HMO plan. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of elderly Medicare Advantage patients, the mean out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations was almost $1,000. Federal policymakers should consider passing legislation mandating insurers to eliminate cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Insurers with existing cost-sharing waivers should consider extending them indefinitely, and those without such waivers should consider implementing them immediately.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Conti, Rena M.",Am J Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612337/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.11.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379721000106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721000106,544

The information is based on data collected from infectious disease/epidemiological centers in the USA, Brazil, and South Africa. Adverse COVID-19 outcomes have been associated with the burden of exposure and disease, linked to socioeconomic determinants, among specific ethnicities in all three countries. The prevalence of comorbidities before and the likelihood of work-related exposure in the context of COVID-19 infection puts ethnic minorities in the USA and some ethnic majorities and minorities in Brazil and South Africa at greater risk.

595223,Simple Face Shield for Public as a Crucial Factor to Slow Aerosol Transmission During Unlock Phase of COVID Pandemic,2020-08-27,"Activated T-cells express Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD-1), a key immune checkpoint receptor. PD-1 functions primarily in peripheral tissues, where T cells may encounter tumor-derived immunosuppressive ligands. Monoclonal antibodies that disrupt the interaction between T-cell derived PD-1 and immunosuppressive ligands, such as PD-L1, have revolutionized approaches to cancer therapy. For instance, Nivolumab is a monoclonal Ab that targets human PD-1 and has played an important role in immune checkpoint therapy. Herein we report the purification and initial characterization of a ∼ 27 kDa single chain variable fragment (scFv) of Nivolumab that targets human PD-1 and blocks binding by PD-L1. The possibility that the anti-PD-1 scFv can serve as both an anti-tumor agent and as an anti-viral agent is discussed. IMPORTANCE: The clinical significance of anti-PD-1 antibodies for treatment of a range of solid tumors is well documented (reviewed in [1-4]). In this report, we describe the results of studies that establish that an anti-PD-1 scFv purified from E. coli binds tightly to human PD-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that upon binding, the anti-PD-1 scFv disrupts the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. Thus, the properties of this scFv, including its small size, stability and affinity for human PD-1, suggest that it has the potential to be a useful reagent in subsequent immunotherapeutic, diagnostic and anti-viral applications.","Shin, Jong; Phelan, Paul J.; Gjoerup, Ole; Bachovchin, William; Bullock, Peter A.",Protein Expr Purif,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2020.105766; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592820303570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987122/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592820303570?v=s5,544

DESIGN: Observational study with follow-up. SETTING: Data extraction from medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Nair Hospital & TN Medical College, Mumbai, India. PARTICIPANTS: 689 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in the hospital from 26 March 2020 to 11 May 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality; joint effect of comorbidity and age on the risk of dying. RESULTS: A total of 689 patients (median age 44 years) admitted with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Of these, 77.36% of patients were discharged alive while 22.64% died. 11.61% required some kind of oxygen support while 2.8% of patients required intensive care unit admissions. Older age (HR 2.88, 95% CI 2.09 to 3.98), presence of comorbidities (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.55), history of hypertension (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.08), and presence of symptoms at the time of admission (HR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41 to 7.26) were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Treatment with a combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine, antiviral or steroid compared with no treatment did not alter the disease course and in-hospital mortality. The combined effect of old age and presence of comorbid conditions was more pronounced in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital patients were younger, less symptomatic with lesser need of ventilators and oxygen support as compared with many western countries.

599197,COVID-19 in the Clinic: Aerosol Containment Mask for Endoscopic Otolaryngologic Clinic Procedures,2021-06-22,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 3 200 000 cases and 230 000 deaths as on 2 May 2020, and has quickly become an unprecedented global health threat. India, with its unique challenges in fighting this pandemic, imposed one of the worlds strictest and largest population-wide lockdown on 25 March 2020. Here, we estimated key epidemiological parameters and evaluated the effect of control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in India and its states. Through a modeling approach that accounted for asymptomatics, we assessed the impact of lockdown relaxation and increased testing. Methods: We estimated the basic reproduction number and effective reproduction number at a national and state level in India after adjusting for imported cases and reporting lag using established statistical methods, using time-series data from 4 March to 25 April 2020. Using a dynamic SEIR-QDPA model fitted to data from India, we forecasted the size and temporality of the ongoing first wave while accounting for the interventions in place. We used the model to simulate lockdown relaxation under various scenarios to evaluate its effect on the size and temporality of the second wave. We also evaluated the feasibility of increased testing as a containment strategy after restrictions are relaxed and its impact on the epidemic size and resumption of socio-economic activities, while taking into account the changes in transmission dynamics brought about by asymptomatic carriers. Findings: The median delay from symptom onset to detection (reporting lag) was estimated to be 2{middle dot}68 days (95% CI 2{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00) with an IQR of 2{middle dot}03 days (95% CI 1{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00). The R0 for India was estimated to be 2{middle dot}083 (95% CI 2{middle dot}044-2{middle dot}122 ; R2 = 0{middle dot}972), while the Rt gradually down trended from 1{middle dot}665 (95%CI 1{middle dot}539-1{middle dot}789) on 30 March to 1{middle dot}159 (95% CI 1{middle dot}128-1{middle dot}189) on 21 April. 60{middle dot}7% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our sample were found to be asymptomatic. We observed that delaying the lockdown relaxation increases the time to new rise in active cases after the relaxation in a linear fashion. If lockdown was reintroduced after a fixed relaxation period, the magnitude of the second peak could be reduced by delaying the relaxation and decreasing the duration of relaxation. These benefits were greater in case of a gradual relaxation as compared to a sudden lifting of lockdown. We found that detecting a higher proportion of cases through testing significantly decreases the total infections. This positive impact of testing progressively increased at higher transmission rates when restrictions were relaxed. We found that similar containment targets could be achieved by both, a combination of high testing and less social restrictions, and a combination of lower testing with intensive social distancing. Interpretation: The nationwide social distancing interventions in India since 25 March have reduced the effective transmission levels, though sub-threshold Rt remains to be achieved. If lockdown is to be extended, additional benefits for mitigating the second wave can be achieved if it is extended farther after the peak of active cases has passed. Intensive social distancing is inherently enough to contain the epidemic, however, testing will play a pivotal role in the lockdown exit strategy by impeding the epidemic growth enough to allow for a greater resumption of socio-economic activities, thus minimizing the social and economic fallout resulting from severe restrictions. Considering that asymptomatics play an undeniable role in the transmission of COVID-19, dependence on presence of symptoms for control strategies, behavioural changes and testing should be reduced.","Gupta, M.; Mohanta, S.

These measures may have led to a disruption of daily life and affected food-related behaviors. This paper investigates the state of food waste management in Serbia and COVID-19’s direct effect on consumer awareness, food consumption, and food waste behaviors. The study is based on an online survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Serbian from May 13 until June 13, 2020, through the Google forms platform. A total of 1212 valid answers were collected, mainly from female, young, and high-educated people. The survey results suggested that (i) household food waste in Serbia is low and there is a positive attitude toward food waste prevention; (ii) food waste increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; (iii) consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and shopped more than usual during the pandemic. This study contributes to a better understanding of consumers’ consumption habits and attitudes toward food waste to prevent and reduce it.","Berjan, Sinisa; Vaško, Željko; Ben Hassen, Tarek; El Bilali, Hamid; Allahyari, Mohammad S.; Tomić, Vedran; Radosavac, Adriana",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532805/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16485-8,544

Ever since, several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. In the present review, we aimed to characterize the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A systematic review including the current evidence related to different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the related morbidity and mortality was conducted through a systematic search utilizing the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct; we retrieved all related papers and reports published in English from December 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: A review of identified articles has shown three main genomic variants, including type A, type B, and type C. we also identified three clades including S, V, and G. Studies have demonstrated that the C14408T and A23403G alterations in the Nsp12 and S proteins are the most prominent alterations in the world, leading to life-threatening mutations.The spike D614G amino acid change has become the most common variant since December 2019. From missense mutations found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in the nucleocapsid (N) gene was significantly associated with patients' mortality. The other significant deleterious variant (G25563T) is found in patients located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Overall, researchers identified several SARS-CoV-2 variants changing clinical manifestations and increasing the transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19. This should be considered in current practice and interventions to combat the pandemic and prevent related morbidity and mortality.","SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Mirzapour, Pegah; Dadras, Omid; Pashaei, Zahra; Karimi, Amirali; MohsseniPour, Mehrzad; Soleymanzadeh, Mahdi; Barzegary, Alireza; Afsahi, Amir Masoud; Vahedi, Farzin; Shamsabadi, Ahmadreza; Behnezhad, Farzane; Saeidi, Solmaz; Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Shayesteh Jahanfar",Eur J Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-021-00524-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103090/,544

As these new modalities progress, concern and uncertainty arise regarding their safe handling by the researchers developing them, employees manufacturing them and nurses administering them. This manuscript reviews the available literature for emerging modalities (including oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, peptides, vaccines, genetically modified organisms, and several others) and provides considerations for occupational health and safety-oriented hazard identification and risk assessments to enable timely, consistent and well-informed hazard identification, hazard communication and risk-management decisions.

We present feasibility and efficacy of DTG/3TC in newly diagnosed individuals in a test-and-treat setting. DESIGN: The single-arm STAT study evaluated DTG/3TC in a US test-and-treat setting. METHODS: Eligible adults initiated DTG/3TC 14 days or less after HIV-1 diagnosis without availability of baseline laboratory results. If baseline testing indicated DTG or 3TC resistance, HBV co-infection, or creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), participants remained on study with treatment modification. Efficacy endpoints included proportions of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Week 24, regardless of antiretroviral regimen, among all participants (intention-to-treat exposed) and those with available HIV-1 RNA data (observed). RESULTS: Of 131 participants enrolled, 8% were female and 50% were non-white. Through Week 24, treatment was modified in eight participants [five with HBV co-infection, one with baseline M184V, one for adverse event (rash), one participant decision]. At Week 24, 78% (102/131) of all participants and 92% (102/111) of those with available data achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml. Incidence of drug-related adverse events was low (7%); no drug-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of using DTG/3TC as a first-line regimen in a test-and-treat setting, with therapy adjustments for baseline resistance or HBV co-infection occurring safely via routine clinical care as needed [ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03945981; see Supplemental Digital Content 1, video abstract (Video abstract summarizing the STAT study design and results)].","Rolle, Charlotte-Paige; Berhe, Mezgebe; Singh, Tulika; Ortiz, Roberto; Wurapa, Anson; Ramgopal, Moti; Leone, Peter A.; Matthews, Jessica E.; Dalessandro, Marybeth; Underwood, Mark R.; Angelis, Konstantinos; Wynne, Brian R.; Merrill, Deanna; Nguyen, Christopher; van Wyk, Jean; Zolopa, Andrew R.",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115650/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002979,544

Interactions are everywhere. At the cellular level, protein interactions play a key role and their ensemble, also called interactome, is often referred as the basic building blocks of life. Given its importance, the maintenance of the integrity of the interactome is a real challenge in the cell. Many events during evolution can disrupt interactomes and potentially result in different characteristics for the organisms. However, the molecular underpinnings of changes in interactions at the cellular level are still largely unexplored. Among the perturbations, hybridization puts in contact two different interactomes, which may lead to many changes in the protein interaction network of the hybrid, including gains and losses of interactions. We recently investigated the fate of the interactomes after hybridization between yeast species using a comparative proteomics approach. A large-scale conservation of the interactions was observed in hybrids, but we also noticed the presence of proteostasis-related changes. This suggests that, despite a general robustness, small differences may accumulate in hybrids and perturb their protein physiology. Here, we summarize our work with a broader perspective on the importance of interactions.","Berger, Caroline M.; Landry, Christian R.",Curr Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948708/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-021-01188-x,544

The development of FKS-associated pan-echinocandin resistance in the C. glabrata isolated from the patient after 13 days of caspofungin treatment aggravated the situation. The patient died of septic shock shortly before the prospect of receiving potentially effective antifungal therapy.

Multiple human cohort studies demonstrate MAIT cells are selectively depleted in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues during HIV infection, with incomplete restoration during suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Because MAIT cells play an important role in mucosal defense against a wide array of pathogens, fully reconstituting the MAIT cell compartment in ART-treated populations could improve immunity against co-infections. Non-human primates (NHPs) are a valuable, well-described animal model for HIV infection in humans. NHPs also maintain MAIT cell frequencies more comparable to humans, compared to other common animal models, and provide a unique opportunity to study MAIT cells in the circulation and mucosal tissues in a longitudinal manner. Only recently, however, have NHP MAIT cells been thoroughly characterized using macaque-specific MR1 tetramer reagents.

By analyzing several thousand plasma proteins in 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls over serial timepoints using two complementary approaches, we uncover COVID-19 host immune and non-immune proteins not previously linked to this disease. Integration of plasma proteomics with nine published scRNAseq datasets shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates monocyte/macrophage, plasmablast, and T cell effector proteins. By comparing patients who died to severely ill patients who survived, we identify dynamic immunomodulatory and tissue-associated proteins associated with survival, providing insights into which host responses are beneficial and which are detrimental to survival. We identify intracellular death signatures from specific tissues and cell types, and by associating these with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, we map tissue damage associated with severe disease and propose which damage results from direct viral infection rather than from indirect effects of illness. We find that disease severity in lung tissue is driven by myeloid cell phenotypes and cell-cell interactions with lung epithelial cells and T cells. Based on these results, we propose a model of immune and epithelial cell interactions that drive cell-type specific and tissue-specific damage in severe COVID-19.","Filbin, Michael R.; Mehta, Arnav; Schneider, Alexis M.; Kays, Kyle R.; Guess, Jamey R.; Gentili, Matteo; Fenyves, Bánk G.; Charland, Nicole C.; Gonye, Anna L.K.; Gushterova, Irena; Khanna, Hargun K.; LaSalle, Thomas J.; Lavin-Parsons, Kendall M.; Lilly, Brendan M.; Lodenstein, Carl L.; Manakongtreecheep, Kasidet; Margolin, Justin D.; McKaig, Brenna N.; Rojas-Lopez, Maricarmen; Russo, Brian C.; Sharma, Nihaarika; Tantivit, Jessica; Thomas, Molly F.; Gerszten, Robert E.; Heimberg, Graham S.; Hoover, Paul J.; Lieb, David J.; Lin, Brian; Ngo, Debby; Pelka, Karin; Reyes, Miguel; Smillie, Christopher S.; Waghray, Avinash; Wood, Thomas E.; Zajac, Amanda S.; Jennings, Lori L.; Grundberg, Ida; Bhattacharyya, Roby P.; Parry, Blair Alden; Villani, Alexandra-Chloé; Sade-Feldman, Moshe; Hacohen, Nir; Goldberg, Marcia B.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173871/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.365536,544

Albert Camus addresses this traumatic dimension in his 1947 novel The Plague, in which he reserves a rather puzzling statement for the closing paragraph: A plague never disappears, he wrote, but can lie dormant only to reappear once again “for the education of men”. What lessons can be learned from the pandemic we are experiencing right now? While Covid-19 is often discussed from a biological perspective, the magnitude of the tragedy raises questions far beyond the confines of the natural/medical sciences, questions about humanity, our limits and possibilities, and the transcendent. This article explores the potential educational aspect of the pandemic by framing the discussion in an exegetical reading of Camus’ novel. Through this reading, it claims that even within the tragic reality of its effects, the present pandemic might bring to the fore the notion of an existential kind of learning—one that is deeply personal, that cannot be programmed or learned from direct teaching, and that connects us in relevant ways to the lives of others. At the same time, this reading is not oblivious to the practical needs around decision-making on the part of educational policymakers, administrators, and teachers. As the novel shows, tragic events create a demand for quick action, so a few practical principles for curriculum decision-making are also offered.","Murillo, Fernando",Prospects (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09535-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518814/,544

615282,Strategies for the Practice of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery During the Monitoring Phase of COVID-19(),2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a national public health protection agency in the United States. With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords—cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov—while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. RESULTS: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each. The 16 topics fell into four overarching themes: knowing the virus and the situation, policy and government actions, response guidelines, and general opinion about credibility.

We begin with an overview of mechanistic models for infectious disease, and then describe the sources of statistical uncertainty in the context of a case study on SARS-CoV-2. We describe the statistical uncertainty as belonging to three categories: data uncertainty, stochastic uncertainty, and structural uncertainty. We demonstrate how to account for each of these via statistical uncertainty measures and sensitivity analyses broadly, as well as in a specific case study on estimating the basic reproductive number, $R_0$, for SARS-CoV-2.","McGowan, Lucy D'Agostino; Grantz, Kyra H.; Murray, Eleanor",Am J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475686/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07329v2.pdf,544
620271,A Review of the Importance of Atypical Otorhinolaryngological Symptoms in the Screening of COVID-19 Patients,2020-08-17,"Inflammation is intimately involved at all stages of atherosclerosis and remains a substantial residual cardiovascular risk factor in optimally treated patients. The proof of concept that targeting inflammation reduces cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction has highlighted the urgent need to identify new immunotherapies to treat patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, emerging data from new clinical trials show that successful immunotherapies for atherosclerosis need to be tailored to the specific immune alterations in distinct groups of patients. In this Review, we discuss how single-cell technologies — such as single-cell mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing — are ideal for mapping the cellular and molecular composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and how these data can aid in the discovery of new precise immunotherapies. We also argue that single-cell data from studies in humans need to be rigorously validated in relevant experimental models, including rapidly emerging single-cell CRISPR screening technologies and mouse models of atherosclerosis. Finally, we discuss the importance of implementing single-cell immune monitoring tools in early phases of drug development to aid in the precise selection of the target patient population for data-driven translation into randomized clinical trials and the successful translation of new immunotherapies into the clinic.","Fernandez, Dawn M.; Giannarelli, Chiara",Nat Rev Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41569-021-00589-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267377/,544

Methods: Hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were recruited from Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo (a quaternary referral teaching hospital), and from Ibirapuera Field Hospital, both located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Physical activity levels were assessed by Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. The secondary outcomes were: mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mechanical ventilation requirement. Results: Mean hospital length of stay was 8.5 (7.1) days; 3.3% of patients died, 13.8% were admitted to ICU, and 8.6% required mechanical ventilation. Linear regression models showed that physical activity indexes were not associated with hospital length of stay (work index: B=-0.57 [95%CI: -1.80 to 0.65], p=0.355; sport index: B=0.43 [95%CI: -0.94 to 1.80], p=0.536; leisure-time index: B=1.18 [95%CI: -0.22 to 2.59], p=0.099; total activity index: B=0.20 [95%CI: -0.48 to 0.87], p=0.563. Physical activity indexes were not associated with mortality, admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation requirement (all p>0.05). Conclusions: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, physical activity did not associate with hospital length of stay or any other clinically-relevant outcomes. These findings suggest that previous physical activity levels may not change the prognosis of severe COVID-19.","Pinto, A. J.; Goessler, K. F.; Fernandes, A. L.; Murai, I. H.; Sales, L. P.; Reis, B.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with K(d) of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with K(d) < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32280433/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020300490?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020300490,544
634481,COVID-19 in the Clinic: Human Testing of an Aerosol Containment Mask for Endoscopic Clinic Procedures,2021,"BACKGROUND: Changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) care planning due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and well-being of patients with CRC are unknown. We report changes in CRC care and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including HRQoL, distress, and loneliness during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In April 2020, 4,984 patients included in the nationwide Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer cohort were invited to complete a COVID-19-specific questionnaire, together with the validated EORTC QLQ-C30, De Jong Gierveld, and HADS. Clinical data were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Scores were compared with the year prior to COVID-19, and with an age- and sex-matched control population during COVID-19. RESULTS: In total, 3,247 (65.1%) patients responded between April and June 2020. Seventeen percent of patients had cancelled/postponed/changed hospital visits into a telephone- or video consult while 5.3% had adjusted/postponed/cancelled treatment. Compared to controls, patients reported worse HRQoL, but comparable distress and less social loneliness (patients = 21.2%; controls = 32.9%). Compared to pre-COVID-19, clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was more prevalent in patients with changes in cancer care planning than in patients without changes. Prior to undergoing or currently undergoing treatment, and infection worries were associated with lower HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients reported equal anxiety and depression, but worse HRQoL than the control population. Changes in care planning were associated with deterioration of HRQoL and increased anxiety. In case of one or more risk factors, healthcare specialists should discuss (mental) health status and possible support during future SARS-CoV-2 infection waves or comparable pandemics.","Derksen, Jeroen W G; May, Anne M; van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V; de Rooij, Belle H; Hafkenscheid, Dorothee A; Verkooijen, Helena M; Koopman, Miriam; Vink, Geraldine R",JNCI Cancer Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkab047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373848/,544

638861,Correlation Between Anosmia and Severity Along with Requirement of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 Patients,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND. The Lombardy region, Italy, has been severely affected by COVID-19. During the epidemic peak, in March 2020, patients needing intensive care unit treatments were approximately 10% of those infected. This fraction decreased to approximately 2% in the second part of April, and to 0.4% at the beginning of July. COVID-19 is characterized by several biochemical abnormalities whose discrepancy from normal values was associated to the severity of the disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the biochemical patterns of patients during and after the pandemic peak in order to verify whether later patients were experiencing a milder COVID-19 course, as anecdotally observed by several clinicians of the same Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The laboratory findings of two equivalent groups of 84 patients each, admitted at the emergency department of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy), during March and April respectively, were analyzed and compared. RESULTS. White blood cell, platelets, lymphocytes and lactate dehydrogenase showed a statistically significant improvement (i.e. closer or within the normal clinical range) in the April group compared to March. Creatinine, C-reactive protein, Calcium and liver enzymes, were also pointing in that direction, although the differences were not significant. DISCUSSION. The laboratory findings analyzed in this study were consistent with a milder COVID-19 course in the April group. After excluding several hypotheses, we concluded that our observation was likely the consequence of the lockdown strategy enforcement, which, by imposing social distancing and the use of respiratory protective devices, reduced viral loads upon infection.

Methods: Participants (n = 237) completed a survey with open-ended questions that included the following domains: (1) satisfaction with telephone counseling, (2) perceived convenience, (3) changes to the therapeutic relationship, (4) perceived impact on substance use recovery, and (5) general feedback. Responses were coded using thematic analysis. Codes were subsequently organized into themes and subthemes (covering 98% of responses). Interrater reliability for coding of participants’ responses ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Results: Overall, patients reported that telephone counseling improved the therapeutic experience. Specifically, 74% of respondents were coded as providing responses consistently indicating “positive valency”. “Positive valency” responses include: (1) feeling supported, (2) greater comfort and privacy, (3) increased access to counselors, and (4) resolved transportation barriers. Conversely, “negative valency” responses include: (1) impersonal experience and (2) reduced privacy. Conclusions: Telephone counseling presents its own set of challenges that should be investigated further to improve the quality of care and long-term patient outcomes.","Kang, Augustine W.; Walton, Mary; Hoadley, Ariel; DelaCuesta, Courtney; Hurley, Linda; Martin, Rosemarie",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199582/,544
641895,Hearing Loss-a Camouflaged Manifestation of COVID 19 Infection,2021-05-10,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to provide an overview of standard and adjunctive treatment options in opioid dependence in consideration of therapy-refractory courses. The relevance of oral opioid substitution treatment (OST) and measures of harm reduction as well as heroin-assisted therapies are discussed alongside non-pharmacological approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, recommendation can be given for OST with methadone, buprenorphine, slow-release oral morphine (SROM), and levomethadone. Heroin-assisted treatment using diamorphine shall be considered as a cost-effective alternative for individuals not responding to the afore-mentioned opioid agonists in order to increase retention and reduce illicit opioid use. The modalities of application and the additional benefits of long-acting formulations of buprenorphine should be sufficiently transferred to clinicians and the eligible patients; simultaneously methods to improve planning of actions and self- management need to be refined. Regarding common primary outcomes in research on opioid treatment, evidence of the effectiveness of adjunctive psychological interventions is scarce. SUMMARY: Maintaining a harm reduction approach in the treatment of opioid addiction, a larger range of formulations is available for the prescribers. Embedding the pharmacological, ideally individualized treatment into a holistic, structure-giving concept also requires a reduction of fragmentation of ancillary services available, drug policies, and treatment philosophies on a global scale.","Mielau, Juliane; Vogel, Marc; Gutwinski, Stefan; Mick, Inge",Curr Addict Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-021-00373-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055568/,544

Spain has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective. To create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. Methods. A multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Results. Up to April 30th 2020, 6,424 patients from 109 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.1 years (range: 18-102 years) and 56.9% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.2%, 39.7%, and 18.7%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (86.2%) and cough (76.5%). High values of ferritin (72.4%), lactate dehydrogenase (70.2%), and D-dimer (61.5%), as well as lymphopenia (52.6%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.7%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (62.4%). 31.5% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.1%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.2%, 60-69 years: 9.1%, 70-79 years: 21.4%, 80-89 years: 42.5%, [≥] 90 years: 51.1%). Conclusions. The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the menstrual cycle and any contributing factors to these changes. Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 749 participants, whom ranged from physically active to elite, in their training status. The questionnaire captured detail on menstrual cycle symptoms and characteristics prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, as well as lifestyle, stress, exercise and nutrition. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution were reported and decision tree analysis performed. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05. Results: Fifty-two point six percent of females experienced a change in their menstrual cycle during the lockdown period. Psychosocial symptoms had changed in over half of all participants. Participants who reported increased stress/worry in family and personal health were significantly associated with changes in menstrual symptoms. Similarly, job security stress was associated with increases in bleeding time (p<0.05).

656261,Carbon footprint reduction associated with a surgical outreach clinic,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the public health importance, little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America. In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with ILI (fever ≥38°C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient. During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations. At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region. Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%). Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru. These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Peru and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with ILI. Furthermore, these data have implications for influenza vaccine design and implementation in South America.","Laguna-Torres, V.

657960,Least Expensive Facial Mask Against Corona Virus for Short Airway Procedures Generating Aerosol,2020-10-28,"Changes in household dynamics in Korea, such as the transition from multi- to single-person households, have led to changes in individuals’ dietary behavior patterns and health status. Thus, this study aimed to compare dietary behaviors and determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as explore factors associated with MetS according to household type among Korean adults. Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014–2018, we included 21,944 Korean adults with available health examination and dietary recall data. Based on self-reported information, individuals were divided into two household types: single- and multi-person households. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MetS and its components after adjusting for potential covariates. Among the study population, 9.19% and 90.81% lived in single-person and multi-person households, respectively. Individuals in single-person households had a higher energy intake overall and a greater percentage of energy from animal protein; total, saturated, and monounsaturated fats; and animal source foods and a lower percentage of energy from carbohydrates, plant protein, and plant source foods than those from multi-person households (all, p < 0.05). Individuals living in single-person rather than multi-person households were more likely to consume milk/dairy products, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, oils/fats, and others but were less likely to consume vegetables/mushrooms, fruits, seaweeds, and fish/shellfish (all, p < 0.05). Living alone was associated with higher energy intake from main meals and foods prepared away from home but a lower dietary variety score and fewer total main meals consumed (all, p < 0.05). Skipping breakfast, frequent eating out, food insecurity, and MetS combination phenotypes significantly differed by household type. Individuals living alone had higher odds of MetS (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02–1.29), abdominal obesity (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01–1.28), elevated blood pressure (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.12–1.47), and elevated fasting blood glucose (AOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05–1.33) than those living with others. Compared with those in multi-person households, individuals in single-person households tend to have health and dietary behaviors that increase vulnerability to MetS; therefore, establishing health care strategies and nutrition policies according to household type is necessary.","Lee, Kyung Won; Shin, Dayeon",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574889/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091116,544
658561,Incidence of Anosmia among Covid 19 patients in India,2021-06-03,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly contagious, life-threatening condition with unprecedented impacts for worldwide societies and healthcare systems. Since the first detection in China, it has spread rapidly worldwide. The increased burden has substantially impacted the neurosurgery practice and intensive modifications were required in surgical scheduling, inpatient and outpatient clinics, management of emergency cases, and even academic activities. In some systems, non-overlapping teams were created to minimize transmission among healthcare workers. In case of a massive burden, neurosurgeons may be needed to reassign to the COVID-19 wards, or teams from other regions may be needed to send to severely affected areas. In outpatient practice, if possible, appointments should be turned into telemedicine. All staff assigned in the non-COVID treatment unit should be clothed in level 1 personal protective equipment. If possible, postponement is recommended for operations that do not require urgent or emergent intervention. All patients indicated for surgery must receive a COVID-19 screening, including nasopharyngeal swab, and thorax computed tomography. Level 2 protection measures would be appropriate during COVID-19 negative patients' operations. Operations of COVID-19 positive patients, and emergency cases, where screening can not be obtained, should be performed following level 3 protective measures. During surgery, the use of high-speed drills and electrocautery should be reduced to minimize aerosol production. Screening is crucial in all patients since the surgical outcome is highly mortal in COVID-19 patients. All educational and academic conferences can be turned into virtual webinars.","Ozoner, Baris; Gungor, Abuzer; Hasanov, Teyyup; Toktas, Zafer Orcun; Kilic, Turker",World Neurosurg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.195; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020311669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474101/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020311669?v=s5,544

The development of population-based cancer indicators project was conducted as part of a Nationwide Population-based Cancer Registration Project and aimed to applying quality of health care system approaches to the cancer care in population-based monitoring system. The literature review and grey literature review were conducted prior to Delphi method. Our findings confirm 26 cancer indicators and classify them into “Primary prevention,” “Secondary prevention,” “Treatment,” “Quality of care,” “Survivor management,” and “End-of-life care.” The Donabedian model used for health services and the Institute of Medicine quality of healthcare domains of six dimensions were applied to the measurement system. The developed cancer indicators and measurements will be able to provide useful information for prioritizing the operational tasks that can be used by health authorities and policymakers from the other countries. ABSTRACT: To identify population-based cancer indicators and construct monitoring systems for the entire lifecycle of cancer patients using a modified Delphi method. A modified Delphi method was used to identify the cancer indicators and measurement by scoping review and gray literature. The final list of cancer indicators was developed by consensus of 11 multidisciplinary experts over multiple rounds and rating scored the importance of each indicator on a 10-point scale. Frequency analysis was performed to rate with median scores ≥7 and finalized the list of indicators according to the priority. Initially, 254 indicators were identified, of which 94 were considered important and feasible. After two rounds of rating by the experts and panel discussions, 26 indicators were finalized in six domains: primary prevention (n = 7), secondary prevention (n = 11), treatment (n = 2), quality of life (n = 4), survivor management (n = 1), and end-of-life care (n = 1). The Donabedian model used for examining health services and the Institute of Medicine quality of healthcare domains were applied to the measurement system. Panel experts identified cancer indicators based on priorities with a high level of consensus, providing a scrupulous foundation for community-based monitoring of cancer patients.","Rajaguru, Vasuki; Jang, Jieun; Kim, JaeHyun; Kwon, JeoungA; Cho, Oyeon; Chung, SeungYeun; Ahn, MiSun; Park, JinHee; Won, YoungJoo; Jung, KyuWon; Shin, Jaeyong; Chun, Mison",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638310/,544

The biopolymer was obtained by crosslinking of chitosan (CHIT) with genipin, a nontoxic compound of plant origin, in inverted emulsion and reacting the chitosan nano/microspheres obtained (CHIT-NS/MS) with glycidyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride (GTMAC). As a result the nano/microspheres of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethyl chitosan (HTCC-NS/MS) were obtained. HTCC-NS/MS were studied as the adsorbents of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 particles in aqueous virus suspensions. By studying cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by these viruses and performing PCR analyses it was found HTCC-NS/MS strongly adsorb the particles of HCoV-NL63 virus, moderately adsorb mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) particles, but do not adsorb HCoV-OC43 coronavirus. The adsorption capacity of HTCC-NS/MS well correlated with the antiviral activity of soluble HTCC against a given virus. Importantly, it was shown that HCoV-NL63 particles could be desorbed from the HTCC-NS/MS surface with a salt solution of high ionic strength with retention of virus virulence. The obtained material may be applied for the removal of coronaviruses, purification and concentration of virus samples obtained from biological matrices and for purification of water from pathogenic coronaviruses.","Ciejka, Justyna; Wolski, Karol; Nowakowska, Maria; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Szczubiałka, Krzysztof",Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2017.03.047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493116319634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28482585/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928493116319634,544

With a bewildering array of complications, renal involvement in various forms is common, including serum electrolyte derangements. Hypokalaemia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 was common in a reported Chinese cohort. Here we review the emerging evidence on hypokalaemia and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the potential pathophysiological mechanisms based on early clinical and histopathological data and important clinical implications. Mechanisms of hypokalaemia are multifactorial and so the electrolyte disturbance can be difficult to avoid. We provide further support to the theory of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) activation, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implicating RAS involvement and highlight the importance of calculating the transtubular potassium gradient to identify those at risk of hypokalaemia and its complications.","Mabillard, Holly; Sayer, John A.",F1000Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.24441.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093945/,544

The mortality rates of severe cases range from 8.1% to 38%, and it is particularly important to identify risk factors that aggravate the disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis, using 7 databases to identify studies reporting on clinical characteristics, comorbidities and complications in severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19. All the observational studies were included. We performed a random or fixed effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI). Measure of heterogeneity was estimated by Cochran's Q statistic, I(2) index and P value. RESULTS: A total of 4881 cases from 25 studies related to COVID-19 were included. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (severe: 33.4%, 95% CI: 25.4%–41.4%; non-severe 21.6%, 95% CI: 9.9%–33.3%), followed by diabetes (severe: 14.4%, 95% CI: 11.5%–17.3%; non-severe: 8.5%, 95% CI: 6.1%–11.0%). The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury and shock were all higher in severe cases, with 41.1% (95% CI: 14.1%–68.2%), 16.4% (95% CI: 3.4%–29.5%) and 19.9% (95% CI: 5.5%–34.4%), rather than 3.0% (95% CI: 0.6%–5.5%), 2.2% (95% CI: 0.1%–4.2%) and 4.1% (95% CI: −4.8%–13.1%) in non-severe patients, respectively. The death rate was higher in severe cases (30.3%, 95% CI: 13.8%–46.8%) than non-severe cases (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.1%–2.8%).

Despite substantial research efforts, conventional treatments of PA using antifungal agents are associated with limitations such as excessive systemic exposure, serious side effects and limited availability of the therapeutics in the lungs for an adequate duration. To overcome the limitations associated with the conventional regimens, pulmonary delivery of antifungal agents has become a focal point of research because of the superiority of local and targeted drug delivery. Dry powder inhalers and nebulized formulations of antifungal agents have been developed and evaluated for their capability to effectively deliver antifungal agents to the lungs. Moreover, progress in nanotechnology and the utilization of nanocarriers in the development of pulmonary delivery formulations has allowed further augmentation of treatment capability and efficiency. Thus, the following review provides an insight into the advantages and therapeutic potential of the utilization of nanocarriers in pulmonary delivery of antifungal agents for the treatment of PA. In addition, discussions on formulation aspects and safety concerns together with the clinical and regulatory aspects of the formulations are presented, which suggest the possibility and desirability of utilization of nanocarriers in the treatment of PA.","Cheng, Shen Nam; Tan, Zhi Guang; Pandey, Manisha; Srichana, Teerapol; Pichika, Mallikarjuna Rao; Gorain, Bapi; Choudhury, Hira",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260598/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12121161,544

However, how network effectiveness in international development projects can be achieved remains unclear. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this study explores the causal conditions of network effectiveness of 37 international development projects implemented by South Korean NGOs based on a theoretical lens of collaborative networks. Findings revealed two causal configurations for network effectiveness. Even under a lack of network management capacity and unintegrated networks, or under resource deficiency and lack of network management capacity, high-level local capacity or high-quality collaboration among partners was shown to produce network effectiveness. An in-depth analysis of two cases with successful network effectiveness was also conducted to achieve a more thorough and comprehensive understanding of the causal conditions. The findings suggest practical solutions to manage collaborative networks and compensate for deficiencies of diverse conditions to improve network effectiveness.","Han, Seungheon; Kang, Minah",Voluntas,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-021-00358-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092933/,544

Quantifying the changes in NOx emissions resulting from COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understanding its impacts on the environment. Here, we divided the research timeframe into three periods: the normal operation period (P1), the Spring Festival period (P2), and the epidemic period following the Spring Festival (P3). We then calculated the NOx operating vent numbers and emission concentrations of key polluting enterprises in 29 provinces and 20 industrial sectors and compared the data for the same periods in 2020 and 2019 to obtain the impacts of COVID-19 on industrial NOx emissions. We found that spatially, from P1 to P2 in 2020, the operating NOx vent numbers in North China changed the most, with a relative change rate of –33.84%. Comparing the operating vent numbers in P1 and P3, East China experienced the largest decrease, approximately –32.72%. Among all industrial sectors, the mining industry, manufacturing industry, power, heat, gas, and water production and supply industry, and the wholesale and retail industry, were the most heavily influenced. In general, the operating vent numbers of key polluting enterprises in China decreased by 24.68%, and the standardized NOx (w)(5-day) decreased by an average of −9.54 ± −6.00 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thus, upon intracellular virus detection, the infected cell must initiate clearance pathways without triggering neuronal cell death. As a result, the inflammatory response must be tightly regulated and unique mechanisms contribute to the immune response in the CNS. Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells. Infiltrating immune cells enter from the periphery to clear virus. Antibodies and interferon-γ are primary contributors to noncytolytic clearance of virus in the CNS. Lymphocytes are retained in the CNS after the acute phase of infection presumably to block reactivation of virus replication.","Schultz, Kimberly L.W.; Griffin, Diane E.",Encyclopedia of Immunobiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140226; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140226,544

Several systemic involvements have been reported in Covid-19 patients. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the cerebrovascular hemodynamics in patients with Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample of this study included 20 patients hospitalized in our clinic diagnosed with Covid-19 via PCR modality and 20 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex. Bilateral middle cerebral arteries were investigated with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity rates were determined and statistically compared. RESULTS: When patient and control groups were compared, the mean blood flow velocity was found to be higher in Covid-19 patients than in the healthy volunteers and it was statistically significant (P = 0.00). The mean vasomotor reactivity rates values were found to be lower in the Covid-19 group than the healthy group and was also statistically significant (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: An increase in basal cerebral blood velocity and a decrease in vasomotor reactivity rates in patients with Covid-19 can be considered as an indicator of dysfunction of cerebral hemodynamics in the central nervous system and this can be evaluated as a result of endothelial dysfunction.","SONKAYA, Ali Rıza; ÖZTÜRK, Bilgin; KARADAŞ, Ömer",Turk J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021761/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2006-203,544

Methods: Institutional data were captured from the EMR for the first 4 months of the US COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and compared to a historical control (March-June 2019). Data were collected from three major hospitals within an urban academic health system. Patients were identified as those with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and active treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation) within the prior 180 days of ED encounter, with an outpatient oncology visit within the last 90 days. Data including number and location of emergency department visits, admission outcomes, primary ICD-10 emergency department diagnosis, payer type, and patient demographics were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Gynecologic oncology patients were significantly less likely to present to the ED for care during the first 4 months of COVID-19 (n=91) when compared to a historical control (n=144), p<0.01. Patients presenting during COVID were more likely to be admitted (43/91 vs 47/144, p<0.01), and to be kept for observation (18/43 vs 8/47, p=0.01). Of patients who were admitted, those presenting during COVID were significantly more likely to require an ICU stay during admission (12/43 vs 5/47, p=0.04). Six patients admitted during COVID (14%) died during their admission, while 3 patients (6%) died in the control group. There were no differences with respect to race, payor type, diagnosis, length of stay, or need for procedures when comparing patients admitted during COVID versus the control group. Four patients were COVID 19 positive during admission, which contributed to 1 patient death. Utilization of the health system's outpatient oncology urgent care center remained unchanged during COVID-19 (n=19 vs. n=15, p=0.43). Conclusions: Fewer gynecologic cancer patients presented to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic, and those presenting had increased rates of indicated and complex care requirements. The concurrent stability in the outpatient urgent care center volume highlights a potential role for more stringent patient triaging to improve healthcare utilization in this vulnerable population going forward.","Byrne, Maureen; Nasioudis, Dimitrios; Gysler, Stefan; Ko, Emily; Haggerty, Ashley",Gynecologic Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0090-8258(21)00921-5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825821009215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825821009215,544

To assess whether chest Computed Tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patient's admission to ICU. Methods. We performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-Reactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set. Measurements and Main Results. Twenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p=0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval 0.56-0.86).
