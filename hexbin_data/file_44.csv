57,Differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes of human hepatoma using a novel SSH/microarray approach,2006-05-31,"BACKGROUND: The main limitation in performing genome-wide gene-expression profiling is the assay of low-expression genes. Approaches with high throughput and high sensitivity for assaying low-expression transcripts are urgently needed for functional genomic studies. Combination of the suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray techniques using the subtracted cDNA clones as probes printed on chips has greatly improved the efficiency for fishing out the differentially expressed clones and has been used before. However, it remains tedious and inefficient sequencing works for identifying genes including the great number of redundancy in the subtracted amplicons, and sacrifices the original advantages of high sensitivity of SSH in profiling low-expression transcriptomes. RESULTS: We modified the previous combination of SSH and microarray methods by directly using the subtracted amplicons as targets to hybridize the pre-made cDNA microarrays (named as ""SSH/microarray""). mRNA prepared from three pairs of hepatoma and non-hepatoma liver tissues was subjected to the SSH/microarray assays, as well as directly to regular cDNA microarray assays for comparison. As compared to the original SSH and microarray combination assays, the modified SSH/microarray assays allowed for much easier inspection of the subtraction efficiency and identification of genes in the subtracted amplicons without tedious and inefficient sequencing work. On the other hand, 5015 of the 9376 genes originally filtered out by the regular cDNA microarray assays because of low expression became analyzable by the SSH/microarray assays. Moreover, the SSH/microarray assays detected about ten times more (701 vs. 69) HCC differentially expressed genes (at least a two-fold difference and P < 0.01), particularly for those with rare transcripts, than did the regular cDNA microarray assays. The differential expression was validated in 9 randomly selected genes in 18 pairs of hepatoma/non-hepatoma liver tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. The SSH/microarray approaches resulted in identifying many differentially expressed genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle, cell death, signal transduction and cell morphogenesis, suggesting the involvement of multi-biological processes in hepato-carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: The modified SSH/microarray approach is a simple but high-sensitive and high-efficient tool for differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes. It is most adequate for applying to functional genomic studies.","Pan, Yi-Shin; Lee, Yun-Shien; Lee, Yung-Lin; Lee, Wei-Chen; Hsieh, Sen-Yung",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1522022/,44

233,Protein Domain Boundary Predictions: A Structural Biology Perspective,2009-01-21,"One of the important fields to apply computational tools for domain boundaries prediction is structural biology. They can be used to design protein constructs that must be expressed in a stable and functional form and must produce diffraction-quality crystals. However, prediction of protein domain boundaries on the basis of amino acid sequences is still very problematical. In present study the performance of several computational approaches are compared. It is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor. Nevertheless, when the right number of domains is correctly predicted, domain boundaries are predicted within very few residues from their real location. It can be concluded that prediction methods cannot be used yet as routine tools in structural biology, though some of them are rather promising.","Kirillova, Svetlana; Kumar, Suresh; Carugo, Oliviero",Open Biochem J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669640/,44
332,Localization of Low-Density Detergent-Resistant Membrane Proteins in Intact and Acrosome-Reacted Mouse Sperm,2009-05-01,"Mammalian sperm become fertile after completing capacitation, a process associated with cholesterol loss and changes in the biophysical properties of the sperm membranes that prepares the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.","Miranda, Patricia V.; Allaire, Alicia; Sosnik, Julian; Visconti, Pablo E.",Biology of Reproduction,https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/80/5/897/10571849/biolreprod0897.pdf,44
503,Avipoxviruses: infection biology and their use as vaccine vectors,2011-02-03,"Avipoxviruses (APVs) belong to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the Poxviridae family. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors.","Weli, Simon C; Tryland, Morten",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042955/,44
554,Classification of viral zoonosis through receptor pattern analysis,2011-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.","Bae, Se-Eun; Son, Hyeon Seok",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090355/,44
888,A New Model for Hendra Virus Encephalitis in the Mouse,2012-07-10,"Hendra virus (HeV) infection in humans is characterized by an influenza like illness, which may progress to pneumonia or encephalitis and lead to death. The pathogenesis of HeV infection is poorly understood, and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research. In this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for HeV infection and found that mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure, with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease. We propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain, possibly along olfactory nerves. This is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals. In our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models. These studies report a new animal model of HeV encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of HeV infection, particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system; investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease; and inform the development of improved treatment options for human patients.","Dups, Johanna; Middleton, Deborah; Yamada, Manabu; Monaghan, Paul; Long, Fenella; Robinson, Rachel; Marsh, Glenn A.; Wang, Lin-Fa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3393746/,44

1449,Antiviral restriction factor transgenesis in the domestic cat,2011-09-11,"Studies of the domestic cat have contributed to many scientific advances, including the present understanding of the mammalian cerebral cortex. A practical capability for cat transgenesis is needed to realize the distinctive potential of research on this neurobehaviorally complex, accessible species for advancing human and feline health. For example, humans and cats are afflicted with pandemic AIDS lentiviruses that are susceptible to species-specific restriction factors. Here we introduced genes encoding such a factor, rhesus macaque TRIMCyp, and eGFP, into the cat germline. The method establishes gamete-targeted transgenesis for the first time in a carnivore. We observed uniformly transgenic outcomes, widespread expression, no mosaicism and no F1 silencing. TRIMCyp transgenic cat lymphocytes resisted feline immunodeficiency virus replication. This capability to experimentally manipulate the genome of an AIDS-susceptible species can be used to test the potential of restriction factors for HIV gene therapy and to build models of other infectious and noninfectious diseases.

1763,The Highly Conserved Codon following the Slippery Sequence Supports −1 Frameshift Efficiency at the HIV-1 Frameshift Site,2015-03-25,"HIV-1 utilises −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting to translate structural and enzymatic domains in a defined proportion required for replication. A slippery sequence, U UUU UUA, and a stem-loop are well-defined RNA features modulating −1 frameshifting in HIV-1. The GGG glycine codon immediately following the slippery sequence (the ‘intercodon’) contributes structurally to the start of the stem-loop but has no defined role in current models of the frameshift mechanism, as slippage is inferred to occur before the intercodon has reached the ribosomal decoding site. This GGG codon is highly conserved in natural isolates of HIV. When the natural intercodon was replaced with a stop codon two different decoding molecules—eRF1 protein or a cognate suppressor tRNA—were able to access and decode the intercodon prior to −1 frameshifting. This implies significant slippage occurs when the intercodon is in the (perhaps distorted) ribosomal A site. We accommodate the influence of the intercodon in a model of frame maintenance versus frameshifting in HIV-1.","Mathew, Suneeth F.; Crowe-McAuliffe, Caillan; Graves, Ryan; Cardno, Tony S.; McKinney, Cushla; Poole, Elizabeth S.; Tate, Warren P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373837/,44
1941,Evolutionary History of the Photolyase/Cryptochrome Superfamily in Eukaryotes,2015-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Photolyases and cryptochromes are evolutionarily related flavoproteins, which however perform distinct physiological functions. Photolyases (PHR) are evolutionarily ancient enzymes. They are activated by light and repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Although cryptochromes share structural similarity with DNA photolyases, they lack DNA repair activity. Cryptochrome (CRY) is one of the key elements of the circadian system in animals. In plants, CRY acts as a blue light receptor to entrain circadian rhythms, and mediates a variety of light responses, such as the regulation of flowering and seedling growth. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the CRY/PHR superfamily. The superfamily consists of 7 major subfamilies: CPD class I and CPD class II photolyases, (6–4) photolyases, CRY-DASH, plant PHR2, plant CRY and animal CRY. Although the whole superfamily evolved primarily under strong purifying selection (average ω = 0.0168), some subfamilies did experience strong episodic positive selection during their evolution. Photolyases were lost in higher animals that suggests natural selection apparently became weaker in the late stage of evolutionary history. The evolutionary time estimates suggested that plant and animal CRYs evolved in the Neoproterozoic Era (~1000–541 Mya), which might be a result of adaptation to the major climate and global light regime changes occurred in that period of the Earth’s geological history.","Mei, Qiming; Dvornyk, Volodymyr",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564169/,44
2024,Alteration of somatostatin receptor 2 expression in canine mammary gland tumor,2015-05-18,"Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a negative regulator of cell proliferation in human breast cancer. Since there is little information about SSTR2 in canine mammary gland tumor (MGT), we clarified its distribution and expression level in normal mammary gland, benign MGT and malignant MGT. SSTR2 expression determined by immunohistochemical staining was observed in the cytoplasm of luminal epithelial cells. The intensity was negatively correlated with malignancy: normal tissues and some of the benign tumors had the highest levels, while the malignant tumors had little or no SSTR2 expression. As for the Western blotting, SSTR2 protein level in benign tumors was significantly lower than the normal mammary gland. On the other hand, SSTR2 protein levels in two of three malignant tumors were higher than the other groups. These results suggest that SSTR2 expression alters according to the malignancy of canine MGT.","SAKAI, Kosei; YONEZAWA, Tomohiro; YAMAWAKI, Hideyuki; OYAMADA, Toshifumi",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638304/,44
2144,Characterization and Vaccine Potential of Outer Membrane Vesicles Produced by Haemophilus parasuis,2016-03-01,"Haemophilus parasuis is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of swine and is capable of causing a systemic infection, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. H. parasuis isolates display a wide range of virulence and virulence factors are largely unknown. Commercial bacterins are often used to vaccinate swine against H. parasuis, though strain variability and lack of cross-reactivity can make this an ineffective means of protection. Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and OMV are often enriched in toxins, signaling molecules and other bacterial components. Examination of OMV structures has led to identification of virulence factors in a number of bacteria and they have been successfully used as subunit vaccines. We have isolated OMV from both virulent and avirulent strains of H. parasuis, have examined their protein content and assessed their ability to induce an immune response in the host. Vaccination with purified OMV derived from the virulent H. parasuis Nagasaki strain provided protection against challenge with a lethal dose of the bacteria.","McCaig, William D.; Loving, Crystal L.; Hughes, Holly R.; Brockmeier, Susan L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773134/,44

3198,"Revalidation and genetic characterization of new members of Group C (Orthobunyavirus genus, Peribunyaviridae family) isolated in the Americas",2018-05-24,"Group C serogroup includes members of the Orthobunyavirus genus (family Peribunyaviridae) and comprises 15 arboviruses that can be associated with febrile illness in humans. Although previous studies described the genome characterization of Group C orthobunyavirus, there is a gap in genomic information about the other viruses in this group. Therefore, in this study, complete genomes of members of Group C serogroup were sequenced or re-sequenced and used for genetic characterization, as well as to understand their phylogenetic and evolutionary aspects. Thus, our study reported the genomes of three new members in Group C virus (Apeu strain BeAn848, Itaqui strain BeAn12797 and Nepuyo strain BeAn10709), as well as re-sequencing of original strains of five members: Caraparu (strain BeAn3994), Madrid (strain BT4075), Murucutu (strain BeAn974), Oriboca (strain BeAn17), and Marituba (strain BeAn15). These viruses presented a typical genomic organization related to members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Interestingly, all viruses of this serogroup showed an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the putative nonstructural NSs protein that precedes the nucleoprotein ORF, an unprecedented fact in Group C virus. Also, we confirmed the presence of natural reassortment events.

3222,Generation and comparative genomics of synthetic dengue viruses,2018-05-08,"BACKGROUND: Synthetic virology is an important multidisciplinary scientific field, with emerging applications in biotechnology and medicine, aiming at developing methods to generate and engineer synthetic viruses. In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health. The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies. RESULTS: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains. Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain. Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes. These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected. CONCLUSIONS: The approach reported in this study can be used to generate and analyze synthetic RNA viruses both on genotypic and on phenotypic level. It could be applied for understanding the functionality and the fitness effects of any set of mutations in viral RNA and for editing RNA viruses for various target applications.

Monitoring progress towards this goal requires tracking ongoing transmission. Here we develop methods that estimate individual reproduction numbers and their variation through time and space. Individual reproduction numbers, R(c), describe the state of transmission at a point in time and differ from mean reproduction numbers, which are averages of the number of people infected by a typical case. We assess elimination progress in El Salvador using data for confirmed cases of malaria from 2010 to 2016. Our results demonstrate that whilst the average number of secondary malaria cases was below one (0.61, 95% CI 0.55–0.65), individual reproduction numbers often exceeded one. We estimate a decline in R(c) between 2010 and 2016. However we also show that if importation is maintained at the same rate, the country may not achieve malaria elimination by 2020.","Routledge, Isobel; Chevéz, José Eduardo Romero; Cucunubá, Zulma M.; Rodriguez, Manuel Gomez; Guinovart, Caterina; Gustafson, Kyle B.; Schneider, Kammerle; Walker, Patrick G.T.; Ghani, Azra C.; Bhatt, Samir",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6018772/,44
3647,Benefits and Inputs From Lactic Acid Bacteria and Their Bacteriocins as Alternatives to Antibiotic Growth Promoters During Food-Animal Production,2019-02-11,"Resistance to antibiotics is escalating and threatening humans and animals worldwide. Different countries have legislated or promoted the ban of antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock and aquaculture to reduce this phenomenon. Therefore, to improve animal growth and reproduction performance and to control multiple bacterial infections, there is a potential to use probiotics as non-antibiotic growth promoters. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) offer various advantages as potential probiotics and can be considered as alternatives to antibiotics during food-animal production. LAB are safe microorganisms with abilities to produce different inhibitory compounds such as bacteriocins, organic acids as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, and carbon dioxide. LAB can inhibit harmful microorganisms with their arsenal, or through competitive exclusion mechanism based on competition for binding sites and nutrients. LAB endowed with specific enzymatic functions (amylase, protease…) can improve nutrients acquisition as well as animal immune system stimulation. This review aimed at underlining the benefits and inputs from LAB as potential alternatives to antibiotics in poultry, pigs, ruminants, and aquaculture production.","Vieco-Saiz, Nuria; Belguesmia, Yanath; Raspoet, Ruth; Auclair, Eric; Gancel, Frédérique; Kempf, Isabelle; Drider, Djamel",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6378274/,44

LASV causes severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in humans, whereas no case of MOPV infection has been reported. Comparing MOPV and LASV is a powerful strategy to unravel pathogenic mechanisms that occur during the course of pathogenic arenavirus infection. We used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify cell partners of MOPV and LASV Z matrix protein in which two autophagy adaptors were identified, NDP52 and TAX1BP1. Autophagy has emerged as an important cellular defense mechanism against viral infections but its role during arenavirus infection has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is transiently induced by MOPV, but not LASV, in infected cells two days after infection. Impairment of the early steps of autophagy significantly decreased the production of MOPV and LASV infectious particles, whereas a blockade of the degradative steps impaired only MOPV infectious particle production. Our study provides insights into the role played by autophagy during MOPV and LASV infection and suggests that this process could partially explain their different pathogenicity.","Baillet, Nicolas; Krieger, Sophie; Journeaux, Alexandra; Caro, Valérie; Tangy, Frédéric; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Baize, Sylvain",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466445/,44
3790,Assessment of the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk testing for bovine viral diarrhea in Japan,2019-03-01,"Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by infection with BVD virus (BVDV) and can result in economic losses within the livestock industry. In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy. In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed. We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study. The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population. Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence. However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%). Disease models with a cost-effective output could be a powerful tool in developing a control scheme for chronic animal diseases, including BVD, with the consent of relevant stakeholders.","ISODA, Norikazu; ASANO, Akihiro; ICHIJO, Michiru; OHNO, Hiroshi; SATO, Kazuhiko; OKAMOTO, Hirokazu; NAKAO, Shigeru; KATO, Hajime; SAITO, Kazuma; ITO, Naoki; USUI, Akira; TAKAYAMA, Hiroaki; SAKODA, Yoshihiro",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483914/,44

4178,Posters Have Limited Utility in Conveying a Message of Antimicrobial Stewardship to Pet Owners,2019-11-22,"Pet owners frequently administer antimicrobials to their pets and therefore have an important role to play in promoting antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. However, best methods of educating pet owners about antimicrobial stewardship have yet to be defined. While visual materials such as brochures and posters are often used in health promotion campaigns, their effectiveness in veterinary medicine is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether pet owners noticed and retained the message of a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message placed in veterinary clinic exam rooms. A total of 111 pet owners from five veterinary clinics (three general practices, two low-cost clinics) in the greater Philadelphia area participated in the study. Participants completed a survey asking whether they noticed the poster and if they could paraphrase its message. In a follow-up survey, an antibiotic knowledge score was calculated from answers to questions assessing their knowledge of the poster message. Baseline knowledge was assessed by asking participants to define antibiotic resistance. At the end of the study, veterinarians at participating clinics were interviewed about their experiences with the poster. Only 51 (46.4%) participants noticed the poster, and only 11 (9.9%) could partially or completely reproduce its message. No demographic or clinic-level factors were significantly associated with noticing the poster or recalling its message. Antibiotic knowledge scores were highly correlated (ρ = 0.87, p < 0.001) with baseline knowledge and not affected by viewing the poster (p = 0.955). Veterinarians expressed skepticism that the poster was effective in conveying a message of judicious antibiotic use to clients and noted no difference in the frequency with which they discussed antibiotic resistance or felt pressured to prescribe antibiotics by their clients.

4803,600-ns pulsed electric fields affect inactivation and antibiotic susceptibilities of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus,2020-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Birth asphyxia accounts for one-quarter newborn deaths. Providing quality care service of neonatal resuscitation reduces neonatal mortality. However, challenges to providing quality neonatal resuscitation are not well investigated in Ethiopia. Hence, this study is conducted to assess the quality provision of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia. METHOD: We used data from the Ethiopian 2016 Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey, conducted in 3804 health facilities providing maternal and newborn health services. We described the quality of neonatal resuscitation services according to the structure, process and outcome triad of quality dimension. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby was considered to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed. Logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between the neonatal resuscitation processes, provider, facility and newborn characteristics with neonatal outcome at the time of discharge. RESULTS: The finding suggested that, around two-third, 364(65.6%) of the asphyxiated babies resuscitated by bag and mask type of neonatal resuscitation. Of the babies who had got neonatal resuscitation 463 (83.4%) survived. Resuscitated neonates with a gestational age of greater than 37 weeks and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.09–3.04)), availability of priority equipment in health facilities for neonatal resuscitation (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.09, 1.54)) and women who had 12 h and less duration of labor (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI (1.23, 3.13)) were the independent factors of survival of the neonate. CONCLUSION: Only half of the health facilities were ready for neonatal resuscitation (NR) in terms of priority equipment’s. However, eight out of ten babies survived after NR in Ethiopia. Gestational age, priority equipment for NR and duration of labor were determinants of survival of resuscitated neonates in Ethiopia. Therefore, the availability of priority equipment and attentive care and follow-up for premature neonates and those face prolonged labor need to be improved in Ethiopia.","Weldearegay, Haftom Gebrehiwot; Abrha, Mulugeta Woldu; Hilawe, Esayas Haregot; Gebrekidan, Brhane Ayele; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081675/,44

Biochemical and biophysical properties",1974,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs), well-characterized pattern-recognizing receptors of the innate arm of the immune system, are vital in detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The TLR-PAMP interaction initiates an intracellular signaling cascade, predominantly culminating in upregulation of antiviral components, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). After activation, various TLR pathways can promote iNOS production via the myeloid differentiation primary response-88 (MyD-88) adapter protein. Subsequently, iNOS facilitates production of nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive and potent antiviral molecule that can inhibit replication of RNA and DNA viruses. Furthermore, NO can diffuse freely across cell membranes and elicit antiviral mechanisms in various ways, including direct and indirect damage to viral genomes. This review emphasizes current knowledge of NO-mediated antiviral responses elicited after activation of TLR signaling pathways.","Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; Amarasinghe, Aruna; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087267/,44

The CEAI is composed of six indicators: (i) availability of CPE; (ii) distribution of CPE; (iii) informational access; (iv) geographical access; (v) economic access; and (vi) preparedness to release staff. When developing the equation of the CEAI, these six component indicators were weighted in accordance with the order of importance reported by the earlier studies. To test its validity, the CEAI was applied to the CPE status in three regions of Ghana. The results of this application revealed that there was greater discrepancies in the CEAI values according to the type of health facilities. The type of health facilities with the greatest CEAI (= 0.609) implying the best access to CPE was clinics while training/research institutes resulted in the lowest CEAI (= 0.447). Regional variation among the three regions was not significant. A simple linear regression between CEAI and adjusted number of CPE opportunities per health worker produced an extremely high conformity in the model (R (2) = 0.960). This may indicate the validity of the proposed CEAI model to the large extent.","Aiga, Hirotsugu",Soc Indic Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089030/,44

6253,Ace revisited: A new target for structure-based drug design,2003,"ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification with wide-ranging biological functions in all kingdoms of life. A variety of enzymes use NAD(+) to transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose (ADPr) moieties onto distinct amino acid substrates, often in response to DNA damage or other stresses. Poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase readily reverses poly-ADP-ribosylation induced by the DNA-damage sensor PARP1 and other enzymes, but it does not remove the most proximal ADPr linked to the target amino acid. Searches for enzymes capable of fully reversing cellular mono-ADP-ribosylation back to the unmodified state have proved elusive, which leaves a gap in the understanding of this modification. Here, we identify a family of macrodomain enzymes present in viruses, yeast and animals that reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation by acting on mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates. Our discoveries establish the complete reversibility of PARP-catalyzed cellular ADP-ribosylation as a regulatory modification.

6261,Antiviral agents active against influenza A viruses,2006,"PURPOSE: There are many differences in how authorities handle the dead during mass death incidents involving disasters and pandemics. These differences would suggest that planning for a disaster death and planning for a pandemic death should be done separately. This may be true to some extent, however, there are many similarities between the two that this article will seeks to examine. The main objective of this study is to show that planning for both disasters and pandemics should either be done by a single entity that coordinates both types of responses, or by agencies that communicate closely and frequently. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study compared mass death incidents predominantly within the Canadian historical record, including disasters and pandemics. It took a specific look at the influenza pandemic of 1918 in North America and how the dead were handled. FINDINGS: Both disasters and pandemics offer unique challenges in handling the dead and documenting the incident. In a pandemic the cause of death is usually clear, while in a disaster it is not always understood. However, the similarities they hold in common must not be overlooked. They will involve immense and complicated amounts of paperwork, cause a shortage of supplies (be it medical, food or otherwise) and create the need for assistance. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The research finds that though disasters and pandemics are often handled differently by the various agencies involved, they should be treated alike and dealt with in the same manner.","Scanlon, Joseph; McMahon, Terry",Disaster Prev Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098006/,44

The various types of alveolitis are classified according to their histological characteristics and range from “luminal phagocytic” or “mural lymphoplasmacellular” and “exudative” to “fibrosing” alveolitis. In this overview, various exogenous and endogenous causes of different types of alveolitis, and the cellular events in their pathogenesis are briefly discussed to illustrate the complex mechanisms involved. Particular emphasis is placed on the possible transition from diffuse exudative to fibrosing alveolitis. It appears that pulmonary fibrosis, which is usually patchy rather than truly diffuse, does not have a uniform pathogenesis. Besides the possibility of a certain degree of a diffuse fibrosis three major pathways are evident: (1) granulation tissue budding into alveolar lumina (luminal fibrosis) (2) exudate incorporation into alveolar walls (mural fibrosis) and — at least equally important-(3) so-called collapse (atelectatic) induration (obliterative-interseptal fibrosis), a process that has largely been neglected so far.","Burkhardt, A.; Cottier, H.",Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101526/,44

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients who had undergone CARTO-II between June 2016 and April 2018 were included in the study. In the CARTO procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein is performed “before” injection of the sclerosant to replace the use of balloon catheter. In the CARTO-II procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein was performed “after” injection of the sclerosant to prevent migration of the sclerosant. CARTO-II was performed with ethanolamine oleate iopamidol, and the balloon catheter was immediately removed after coil placement. Technical and clinical success rates, number of coils used, presence or absence of severe complications, timing of the procedure, and rate of GV recurrence after the procedure were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In all patients, GV sclerosis, coil placement and removal of the balloon catheter were successfully completed. The technical success rate was 100%. No patients experienced severe complications such as coil migration or pulmonary embolization. The mean number of metallic coils used per procedure was 3.36. Mean length of the procedure was 132.8 min. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography after CARTO-II confirmed complete variceal thrombosis in all cases. The recurrence rate of GV during follow-up was 2.8% (mean follow-up, 207 days). CONCLUSION: CARTO-II was feasible and safe and could be performed relatively quickly. The number of coils used and the rate of GV recurrence were both low. CARTO-II may have an important role to play in the management of GV.","Yamamoto, Akira; Jogo, Atsushi; Kageyama, Ken; Sohgawa, Etsuji; Hamamoto, Shinichi; Hamuro, Masao; Kamino, Toshio; Miki, Yukio",Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101606/,44
7108,Exploring the role of genome and structural ions in preventing viral capsid collapse during dehydration,2018-03-14,"A major part of the interactions involved in the assembly and stability of icosahedral, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses is electrostatic in nature, as can be inferred from the strong pH- and salt-dependence of their assembly phase diagrams. Electrostatic interactions do not act only between the capsid coat proteins (CPs), but just as often provide a significant contribution to the interactions of the CPs with the genomic RNA, mediated to a large extent by positively charged, flexible N-terminal tails of the CPs. In this work, we provide two clear and complementary definitions of an N-terminal tail of a protein, and use them to extract the tail sequences of a large number of CPs of ssRNA+ viruses. We examine the pH-dependent interplay of charge on both tails and CPs alike, and show that—in contrast to the charge on the CPs—the net positive charge on the N-tails persists even to very basic pH values. In addition, we note a limit to the length of the wild-type genomes of those viruses which utilize positively charged tails, when compared to viruses without charged tails and similar capsid size. At the same time, we observe no clear connection between the charge on the N-tails and the genome lengths of the viruses included in our study.","Lošdorfer Božič, Anže; Podgornik, Rudolf",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104810/,44

Eight (17 per cent) of the malnourished infants died and results were evaluated with respect to ultimate outcome. In addition a discriminant analysis was retrospectively applied to the immunological data of the two groups of malnourished infants. Both groups of malnourished infants presented significantly lower values than the control group for all measurements, although not very evident for B lymphocytes. The immunodepression was more intense for the infants who died than for those who survived, as shown by significantly lower values for the SI, the skin test, and by the discriminant analysis. The discriminant analysis led to a linear predictive model which accurately classified 85 per cent of the survivors and 100 per cent of those who died. It was con cluded that immunological parameters may be useful to select prospectively those infants who need a different therapeutic approach because of their high risk of mortality.","Maffei, Helga V.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel bunyavirus reported to be endemic in central and northeastern China. This article describes the first identified patient with SFTS and a retrospective study on SFTS in Japan. Methods. Virologic and pathologic examinations were performed on the patient's samples. Laboratory diagnosis of SFTS was made by isolation/genome amplification and/or the detection of anti-SFTSV immunoglobulin G antibody in sera. Physicians were alerted to the initial diagnosis and asked whether they had previously treated patients with symptoms similar to those of SFTS. Results. A female patient who died in 2012 received a diagnosis of SFTS. Ten additional patients with SFTS were then retrospectively identified. All patients were aged ≥50 years and lived in western Japan. Six cases were fatal. The ratio of males to females was 8:3. SFTSV was isolated from 8 patients. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that all of the Japanese SFTSV isolates formed a genotype independent to those from China. Most patients showed symptoms due to hemorrhage, possibly because of disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or hemophagocytosis. Conclusions.

Recent advancements in viral-vectored malaria vaccine development and emerging vector technologies were presented and discussed. Classic viral vectors such as poxvirus, adenovirus and alphavirus vectors have been successfully used to deliver malaria antigens. Some of the vaccine candidates have demonstrated their potential in inducing malaria-specific immunity in animal models and human trials. In addition, emerging viral-vector technologies, such as measles virus (MV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and yellow fever (YF) virus, may also be useful for malaria vaccine development. Studies in animal models suggest that each viral vector is unique in its ability to induce humoral and/or cellular immune responses. Those studies have also revealed that optimization of Plasmodium genes for mammalian expression is an important aspect of vaccine design. Codon-optimization, surface-trafficking, de-glycosylation and removal of toxic domains can lead to improved immunogenicity. Understanding the vector's ability to induce an immune response and the expression of malaria antigens in mammalian cells will be critical in designing the next generation of viral-vectored malaria vaccines.","Li, Shengqiang; Locke, Emily; Bruder, Joseph; Clarke, David; Doolan, Denise L.; Havenga, Menzo J.E.; Hill, Adrian V.S.; Liljestrom, Peter; Monath, Thomas P.; Naim, Hussein Y.; Ockenhouse, Christian; Tang, De-chu C.; Van Kampen, Kent R.; Viret, Jean-Francois; Zavala, Fidel; Dubovsky, Filip",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131149/,44

Therefore, it was the aim of this study to determine the life expectancy, spectrum and incidence of spontaneous neoplasms of the inbred rat strain LEW/Han. A total of 629 LEW/Han rats (305 females and 324 males) from a specified pathogen-free breeding colony were kept from weaning up to their natural death under defined environmental conditions. A complete histological examination was performed on all organs and macroscopically altered tissues of all animals which died during the first three years of the study. These were 296 female (98%) and 213 male (66%) rats. The mean lifespan of the females (27.7±5.1 months) was significantly shorter than that of the males (32.5±6.6 months). In both sexes, the lifespan was mainly determined by the occurrence of neoplasms. Of the large spectrum of 52 histologically different tumour types, the highest incidences were observed for adenomas of the pituitary gland and adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the adrenal cortex in both sexes, mammary gland tumours and endometrial carcinomas in females, and C-cell adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the thyroid gland and tumours of the haemopoietic system in males. Of these, the high incidences of tumours of the haemopoietic system in males (27.7%) and of endometrial carcinomas in females (45.2%) should be considered as characteristic features of the strain.","Baum, Anke; Pohlmeyer, Gabriele; Rapp, Karl G.; Deerberg, Friedrich",Exp Toxicol Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135737/,44

The surveyed herds had at least one whole herd test, and BMRT was done at regular intervals in the period of the survey. Of the 99 (3.7%) herds that reacted to the BMRT, 91 (3.4%) herds had false positive reactions and 8 (0.3%) herds were declared infected on follow‐up herd testing. False‐positive reactions were obtained in 22 herds on more than one occasion. Common causes of false positive reactions to the BMRT were thought to be previous vaccination with Strain 19 and sampling in very early or late lactation. Of the 98 (3.63%) herds that reacted to the whole herd serological tests, 80 (2.96%) herds had false‐positive reactions and 18 (0.67%) herds were declared infected. Strain 19 vaccination was thought to be an important cause of false‐positive reactions. Fifty‐three (2.0%) herds showed suspicious reactions on abattoir monitoring but none was declared infected on follow‐up testing. Of the 18 herds with infected or equivocal status, the BMRT identified 8. In a further 6 herds, the infected cattle were not in the milking herd. Four other herds had milkers with high CFT titres which could not be confirmed as infected on culture. In no herds were culture positive RBT or CFT reactors from the milking herd detected without the BMRT being positive. The proportion of false‐positive reactions to the BMRT was high but the BMRT proved very useful in identifying dairy herds infected with B. abortus, when the prevalence of brucellosis was very low.

9893,Guidelines for the Control of Equine Viral Infections,2010-04-23,"Collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) in rats, induced with homologous type II collagen (CII), is a genetically more restricted disease and has better resemblance to rheumatoid arthritis by its chronic disease course, than CIA induced with heterologous CII. The DA strain is highly susceptible to CIA induced with homologous CII, while the Lewis strain is resistant. (DAxLew)F(1) is susceptible and backcrossing to Lewis reveals a close, but not complete, association of both arthritis and CII responsiveness to the RT1(a) haplotype. Analyses of congenic strains on DA and Lewis backgrounds suggest that expression of a major histocompatibility complex class II B(a) molecule, encoded from the RT1B(a) locus, is associated with arthritis susceptibility and CII responsiveness. The second exons coding for the first domains of the α and β chains of both the RT1(a) and RT1(1) haplotypes were sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequences compared with the corresponding molecule associated with susceptibility to CIA in the mouse (H‐2 A(q)). The sequences of the respective alleles revealed no obvious structural homology explaining the extensive similarities in the development of chronic autoimmune arthritis. Instead, this finding implies that different trimolecular constituents (i.e. class II,T cell receptor, and CII peptides) may yield an antigen presentation event that is able to trigger a similar autoaggressiveness in the two rodent species.","Holmdahl, Rikard; Vingsbo, Carina; Hedrich, Hans; Karlsson, Mikael; Kvick, Christina; Goldschmidt, Tom J.; Gustafsson, Kenth",Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163539/,44
10236,Analysis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates by matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry: An update for 2003–2004,2008-09-29,"Deciphering the evolutionary history and transmission patterns of virulence determinants is necessary to understand the emergence of novel pathogens. The main virulence determinant of most pathogenic proteobacteria is the type three secretion system (T3SS). The Xanthomonas genus includes bacteria responsible for numerous epidemics in agroecosystems worldwide and represents a major threat to plant health. The main virulence factor of Xanthomonas is the Hrp2 family T3SS; however, this system is not conserved in all strains and it has not been previously determined whether the distribution of T3SS in this bacterial genus has resulted from losses or independent acquisitions. Based on comparative genomics of 82 genome sequences representing the diversity of the genus, we have inferred three ancestral acquisitions of the Hrp2 cluster during Xanthomonas evolution followed by subsequent losses in some commensal strains and re‐acquisition in some species. While mutation was the main force driving polymorphism at the gene level, interspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through several genes shaped Hrp2 cluster polymorphism. Horizontal gene transfer of the entire Hrp2 cluster also occurred. A reduced core effectome composed of xopF1, xopM, avrBs2 and xopR was identified that may allow commensal strains overcoming plant basal immunity. In contrast, stepwise accumulation of numerous type 3 effector genes was shown in successful pathogens responsible for epidemics. Our data suggest that capacity to intimately interact with plants through T3SS would be an ancestral trait of xanthomonads. Since its acquisition, T3SS has experienced a highly dynamic evolutionary history characterized by intense gene flux between species that may reflect its role in host adaptation.","Merda, Déborah; Briand, Martial; Bosis, Eran; Rousseau, Céline; Portier, Perrine; Barret, Matthieu; Jacques, Marie‐Agnès; Fischer‐Le Saux, Marion",Mol Ecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168496/,44

10449,The blind watchmaker and rational protein engineering,1994-08-31,"It is an accepted concept that the pathogenicity of a virus is of polygenic nature. Because of their segmented genome, influenza viruses provide a suitable system to prove this concept. The studies employing virus mutants and reassortants have indicated that the pathogenicity depends on the functional integrity of each gene and on a gene constellation optimal for the infection of a given host. As a consequence, virtually every gene product of influenza virus has been reported to contribute to pathogenicity, but evidence is steadily growing that a key role has to be assigned to hemagglutinin. As the initiator of infection, hemagglutinin has a double function: (1) promotion of adsorption of the virus to the cell surface, and (2) penetration of the viral genome through a fusion process among viral and cellular membranes. Adsorption is based on the binding to neuraminic acid-containing receptors, and different virus strains display a distinct preference for specific oligosaccharides. Fusion capacity depends on proteolytic cleavage by host proteases, and variations in amino acid sequence at the cleavage site determine whether hemagglutinin is activated in a given cell. Differences in cleavability and presumably also in receptor specificity are important determinants for host tropism, spread of infection, and pathogenicity. The concept that proteolytic activation is a determinant for pathogenicity was originally derived from studies on avian influenza viruses, but there is now evidence that it may also be relevant for the disease in humans because bacterial proteases have been found to promote the development of influenza pneumonia in mammals.","Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Rott, Rudolf",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173235/,44

11607,The In Silico Prediction of Hotspot Residues that Contribute to the Structural Stability of Subunit Interfaces of a Picornavirus Capsid,2020-03-31,"Rabies, caused by rabies virus (RABV), is a fatal neurological disease that still causes more than 59,000 human deaths each year. Type III interferon IFN-λs are cytokines with type I IFN-like antiviral activities. Although IFN-λ can restrict the infection for some viruses, especially intestinal viruses, the inhibitory effect against RABV infection remains undefined. In this study, the function of type III IFN against RABV infection was investigated. Initially, we found that IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 could inhibit RABV replication in cells. To characterize the role of IFN-λ in RABV infection in a mouse model, recombinant RABVs expressing murine IFN-λ2 or IFN-λ3, termed as rB2c-IFNλ2 or rB2c-IFNλ3, respectively, were constructed and rescued. It was found that expression of IFN-λ could reduce the pathogenicity of RABV and limit viral spread in the brains by different infection routes. Furthermore, expression of IFN-λ could induce the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in the production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). It was also found that rRABVs expressing IFN-λ could reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes and microgila cells, restrict the opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and prevent excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain, which could be responsible for the neuronal damage caused by RABV. Consistently, IFN-λ was found to maintain the integrity of tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1 of BBB to alleviate neuroinflammation in a transwell model. Our study underscores the role of IFN-λ in inhibiting RABV infection, which potentiates IFN-λ as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of RABV infection.","Li, Yingying; Zhao, Ling; Luo, Zhaochen; Zhang, Yachun; Lv, Lei; Zhao, Jianqing; Sui, Baokun; Huang, Fei; Cui, Min; Fu, Zhen F.; Zhou, Ming",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232327/,44

The study of PSCs has relied on an anatomy-based approach, as the identities of cell-specific PSC molecular markers have remained elusive. This limited approach has precluded our ability to isolate and genetically manipulate PSCs in a cell specific manner. We have identified neuron-glia antigen 2 (NG2) as a unique molecular marker of S100β+ PSCs in skeletal muscle. NG2 is expressed in Schwann cells already associated with the NMJ, indicating that it is a marker of differentiated PSCs. Using a newly generated transgenic mouse in which PSCs are specifically labeled, we show that PSCs have a unique molecular signature that includes genes known to play critical roles in PSCs and synapses. These findings will serve as a springboard for revealing drivers of PSC differentiation and function.","Castro, Ryan; Taetzsch, Thomas; Vaughan, Sydney K; Godbe, Kerilyn; Chappell, John; Settlage, Robert E; Valdez, Gregorio",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316509/,44

METHODS: DBS samples, along with simultaneous serum samples, were collected from 107 healthy individuals (11 months to 57 years of age). After eluting proteins from DBS, IgG, IgM, and IgA were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Ig-DBS assay was validated through calibration curve performance, intra- and inter-assay precision, accuracy, specificity, selectivity, and linearity. The ELISA measurements were compared with serum Ig levels obtained using a standard nephelometry assay on serum samples collected simultaneously with the DBS samples and the results of the two assays were correlated. The stability of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the DBS was tested at room temperature, 36° to 38 °C, 2 to 8 °C, and −25 to −40 °C, from 4 to 14 days. RESULTS: The Ig-DBS assay demonstrated precision, accuracy, specificity, selectivity, and linearity. Using the identified correlation coefficients of 0.834 for IgG, 0.789 for IgM, and 0.918 for IgA, the standard nephelometry-based normal reference ranges for all 3 serum Ig isotypes could be used with the Ig-DBS assay in individuals ≥16 years of age. The DBS samples were stable for 14 days at room temperature in a closed polyethylene bag. CONCLUSIONS: The Ig-DBS assay is both sensitive and accurate for quantification of serum immunoglobulins. Samples are sufficiently stable at ambient temperature to allow for convenient shipping and analysis at a centralized laboratory. This assay therefore presents a new option for screening patients ≥16 years of age for hypogammaglobulinemia in any setting.","Yel, Leman; Rabbat, Christopher J.; Cunningham-Rundles, Charlotte; Orange, Jordan S.; Torgerson, Troy R.; Verbsky, James W.; Wang, Yeong; Fu, Maoyong; Robins, Terry S.; Edwards, Marc S.; Nymann-Andersen, Jesper",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4572045/,44

Supposedly, it is similarly important for carrion entomofauna; however, most of its likely effects have not been tested experimentally. Here, simultaneous effects of carcass mass and clothing are analyzed. A factorial block experiment with four levels of carcass mass (small carcasses 5–15 kg, medium carcasses 15.1–30 kg, medium/large carcasses 35–50 kg, large carcasses 55–70 kg) and two levels of carcass clothing (clothed and unclothed) was made in a grassland habitat of Western Poland. Pig carcasses (N = 24) were grouped into spring, early summer, and late summer blocks. Insects were sampled manually and with pitfall traps. Results demonstrate that insect assemblages are more complex, abundant, and long-lasting on larger carcasses, whereas clothing is of minor importance in this respect. Only large or medium/large carcasses were colonized by all guilds of carrion insects, while small or medium carcasses revealed high underrepresentation of late-colonizing insects (e.g., Cleridae or Nitidulidae). This finding indicates that carcasses weighing about 23 kg—a standard in forensic decomposition studies—give an incomplete picture of carrion entomofauna. Residencies of all forensically relevant insects were distinctly prolonged on larger carcasses, indicating that cadaver mass is a factor of great importance in this respect. The pre-appearance interval of most taxa was found to be unrelated to mass or clothing of a carcass. Moreover, current results suggest that rate of larval development is higher on smaller carcasses. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that carcass mass is a factor of crucial importance for carrion entomofauna, whereas the importance of clothing is small.","Matuszewski, Szymon; Frątczak, Katarzyna; Konwerski, Szymon; Bajerlein, Daria; Szpila, Krzysztof; Jarmusz, Mateusz; Szafałowicz, Michał; Grzywacz, Andrzej; Mądra, Anna",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712242/,44

OBJECTIVES: To establish the inter-rater reliability in the quantitative evaluation of spinal cord damage following cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used to perform manual measurements of the cranial and caudal boundaries of edema, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume in 10 participants with cervical incomplete SCI. SETTING: Academic university setting. METHODS: Structural MRIs of 10 participants with SCI were collected from Northwestern University’s Neuromuscular Imaging and Research Lab. All manual measures were performed using OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine inter-rater reliability across seven raters of varying experience. RESULTS: High-to-excellent inter-rater reliability was found for all measures. ICC values for cranial/caudal levels of involvement, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume were 0.99, 0.98, 0.90, 0.84, and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Manual MRI measures of spinal cord damage are reliable between raters. Researchers and clinicians may confidently utilize manual MRI measures to quantify cord damage.

This a priori, exploratory, secondary analysis from the ASPECT-NP clinical trial evaluated resource utilization among patients with ventilated HABP (vHABP)/VABP treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. METHODS: This analysis used data from the randomized, double-blind, noninferiority phase 3 ASPECT-NP trial of patients with vHABP/VABP randomized to receive ceftolozane/tazobactam 3 g (ceftolozane 2 g/tazobactam 1 g) or meropenem 1 g for 8–14 days. Day 28 outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and time to mechanical ventilation extubation in the microbiological intention-to-treat (mITT) population and in an HCRU population. The HCRU population, a subset of patients from the mITT population that were alive at day 28, was used to remove resource use bias influenced by mortality rates. RESULTS: Ceftolozane/tazobactam-treated versus meropenem-treated patients, respectively, had fewer deaths (20.1% vs. 25.5%), fewer hospital discharges (30.7% vs. 32.4%), and higher ICU discharges (60.0% vs. 58.3%) and extubations (51.9% vs. 48.2%) by day 28. In the HCRU population, adjusted LOS differences (95% confidence intervals) for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with meropenem were 0.1 (− 1.4 to 1.6) hospitalization days, − 1.4 (− 2.9 to 0.2) ICU days, and − 0.9 (− 2.4 to 0.7) mechanical ventilation days. Patterns were similar among the VABP and Pseudomonas aeruginosa subgroups. CONCLUSION: Similar 28-day resource utilization outcomes were observed between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in the mITT population of patients from ASPECT-NP with vHABP/VABP due to gram-negative pathogens. ASPECT-NP was not powered to detect differences in resource utilization outcomes between treatment groups; however, numerical differences in ICU LOS and duration of mechanical ventilation were noted. Further study is needed to assess resource utilization in the real-world practice setting, especially among patients excluded from ASPECT-NP, including those with resistant P. aeruginosa infections.

13265,Diagnostic Challenges in Canine Parvovirus 2c in Vaccine Failure Cases,2020-09-03,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Chicken eggs provide a considerable source of high-quality nutrients for human food and health. However, egg consumption may harm some people for its high contents of cholesterol and association with cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, we investigated the possible effect of using Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) as a probiotic additive in the laying hens’ diets on lowering egg-yolk cholesterol and also evaluated the immune responses and the productive performance of laying hens. The obtained results display the ability of LA, when supplemented in hen diets, to decrease the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels and the liver and egg yolk cholesterols in the hen. The beneficial effects of LA were also explored on some important humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the laying hens. These positive effects led to an improvement in the productive performance of laying hens. Therefore, dietary LA supplementation could be recommended as a nutritional strategy for commercial lower-cholesterol egg production in addition to positive impacts on the performance and health of laying hens. ABSTRACT: This study examines the effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) on the cholesterol levels, immune response, and productive performance of laying hens. A total of 216, 40-week-old, commercial Hy-Line brown chicken layers were randomly assigned into four treatment groups (18 birds × three replicates per group) and fed diet supplemented with 0 (control), 1 × 10(9), 21 × 10(9), and 31 × 10(9) colony forming units (CFUs) of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) per kg of feed for six consecutive weeks. Results show that plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterols became lesser, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol became higher in LA-supplemented groups compared to the control. In addition, a significant reduction occurred in the liver and egg yolk cholesterol by LA supplementation. Moreover, the immunological parameters including antibody titer against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-wattle swelling test, and T- & B-lymphocyte proliferation were enhanced in laying hens supplemented with LA compared to the control hens. While the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio decreased with LA supplementation, indicating low stress conditions in the treated hens. These positive effects for LA were further reflected on the productive performance of laying hens and improved egg production, egg weight, egg mass, and feed efficiency. Our findings indicate that LA probiotic could be recommended in laying hens’ diets for lowering egg yolk cholesterol with positive impacts on health and performance.","Alaqil, Abdulaziz A.; Abbas, Ahmed O.; El-Beltagi, Hossam S.; El-Atty, Hanaa.

13329,ZIKV viral proteins and their roles in virus-host interactions,2020-10-14,"IMPORTANCE: Serious illness conversations (SICs) are structured conversations between clinicians and patients about prognosis, treatment goals, and end-of-life preferences. Interventions that increase the rate of SICs between oncology clinicians and patients may improve goal-concordant care and patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a clinician-directed intervention integrating machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges on motivating clinician-patient SICs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 weeks (from June 17 to November 1, 2019) at 9 medical oncology clinics (8 subspecialty oncology and 1 general oncology clinics) within a large academic health system in Pennsylvania. Clinicians at the 2 smallest subspecialty clinics were grouped together, resulting in 8 clinic groups randomly assigned to the 4 intervention wedge periods. Included participants in the intention-to-treat analyses were 78 oncology clinicians who received SIC training and their patients (N = 14 607) who had an outpatient oncology encounter during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Weekly emails to oncology clinicians with SIC performance feedback and peer comparisons; (2) a list of up to 6 high-risk patients (≥10% predicted risk of 180-day mortality) scheduled for the next week, estimated using a validated machine learning algorithm; and (3) opt-out text message prompts to clinicians on the patient’s appointment day to consider an SIC. Clinicians in the control group received usual care consisting of weekly emails with cumulative SIC performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of patient encounters with an SIC in the intervention group vs the usual care (control) group. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 78 clinicians and 14 607 patients. The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.9 (14.2) years, 53.7% were female, and 70.4% were White. For all encounters, SICs were conducted among 1.3% in the control group and 4.6% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.5; P < .001). Among 4124 high-risk patient encounters, SICs were conducted among 3.6% in the control group and 15.2% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 11.6; 95% CI, 8.2-12.5; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, an intervention that delivered machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges to oncology clinicians significantly increased the rate of SICs among all patients and among patients with high mortality risk who were targeted by the intervention. Behavioral nudges combined with machine learning mortality predictions can positively influence clinician behavior and may be applied more broadly to improve care near the end of life.

14045,Rift Valley Fever – assessment of effectiveness of surveillance and control measures in the EU,2020-11-05,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been appointed as a possible alternative to traditional antibiotics in face of pathogens increasing resistance to conventional drugs. Hylin a1 (IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK), an AMP extracted from the skin secretion of a South American frog, Hypsiboas albopunctatus, was found to show a strong cytotoxicity against bacteria and fungus, but also a considerable hemolytic action. Considering the toxicity of the peptide in eukaryotic cells, this work focuses on investigating the effects of the interaction of the Hylin a1 analogues W(6)Hya1, D(0)W(6)Hya1 and K(0)W(6)Hya1 with models of eukaryotic structures, namely zwitterionic liposomes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA). Through intrinsic Trp fluorescence we determined that the peptide affinity for fluid DPPC bilayers follows the decreasing order: D(0)W(6)Hya1 (+2) > W(6)Hya1 (+3) » K(0)W(6)Hya1 (+4). Fluorescence data also indicate that the Trp residue in the more positively charged peptide, K(0)W(6)Hya1, is less deep in the bilayer than the residue in the other two peptides. This finding is supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, which shows that both D(0)W(6)Hya1 and W(6)Hya1 disturb DPPC gel-fluid transition slightly more effectively than K(0)W(6)Hya1. DPPC DSC profiles are homogeneously disturbed by the three peptides, probably related to peptide-membrane diffusion. Surprisingly, the peptide that displays the lowest affinity for PC membranes and is located at the more superficial position in the bilayer, K(0)W(6)Hya1, is the most efficient in causing formation of pores on the membrane, as attested by carboxyfluorescein leakage assays. The three peptides were found to interact with CT DNA, with a deep penetration of the Trp residue into hydrophobic pockets of the double helix, as indicated by the significant blue shift on the Trp fluorescence, and the displacement of DNA-bound ethidium bromide by the peptides. The experiments of DNA electrophoresis confirm that Hylin peptides bind DNA in a concentration-dependent manner, inducing complete DNA retardation at the relative AMP/plasmid DNA weight ratio of ~17. These findings could help to better understand the AMPs toxic effects on eukaryotic cells, thus contributing to the design of healthier therapeutic agents.","Vignoli Muniz, Gabriel S.; De la Torre, Lilia I.; Duarte, Evandro L.; Lorenzón, Esteban N.; Cilli, Eduardo M.; Balan, Andrea; Lamy, M.

They have been linked to altered facial patterns and dento-skeletal changes. However, no firm correlation based on the evidence has been established. This systematic review has been undertaken to evaluate the available evidence between malocclusion and allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients. Methods: The research refers to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, databases (Medline, Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase and Google Scholar) were screened, the quality was evaluated through Quality Assessment of Diagnosfic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Results: The articles selected (6 out of initial 1782) were divided on the basis of the study design: two observational randomized study, three case–control study, one descriptive cross-sectional study, and one longitudinal study. A total of 2188 patients were considered. Different results were reported as related to allergic rhinitis ranging from a higher incidence of dental malocclusion, to an increase of palatal depth, and in posterior cross-bite about anterior open-bite and to longer faces and shorter maxillas. Conclusions: Most of the studies selected found a rise in the prevalence of both malocclusion and allergic rhinitis in children. However, the level of bias is high, impaired by a poor design and no conclusive evidence can be drawn.","Farronato, Marco; Lanteri, Valentina; Fama, Andrea; Maspero, Cinzia",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760209/,44
14561,Subpopulations of sensorless bacteria drive fitness in fluctuating environments,2020-12-03,"Goal-directed behaviors are essential for normal function and significantly impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite extensive associations between genetic mutations and these disorders, the molecular contributions to goal-directed dysfunction remain unclear. We examined mice with constitutive and brain region-specific mutations in Neurexin1α, a neuropsychiatric disease-associated synaptic molecule, in value-based choice paradigms. We found Neurexin1α knockouts exhibited reduced selection of beneficial outcomes and impaired avoidance of costlier options. Reinforcement modeling suggested that this was driven by deficits in updating and representation of value. Disruption of Neurexin1α within telencephalic excitatory projection neurons, but not thalamic neurons, recapitulated choice abnormalities of global Neurexin1α knockouts. Furthermore, this selective forebrain excitatory knockout of Neurexin1α perturbed value-modulated neural signals within striatum, a central node in feedback-based reinforcement learning. By relating deficits in value-based decision-making to region-specific Nrxn1α disruption and changes in value-modulated neural activity, we reveal potential neural substrates for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disease-associated cognitive dysfunction.","Alabi, Opeyemi O; Davatolhagh, M Felicia; Robinson, Mara; Fortunato, Michael P; Vargas Cifuentes, Luigim; Kable, Joseph W; Fuccillo, Marc Vincent",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7759380/,44
14772,Emergency deployment of direct air capture as a response to the climate crisis,2021-01-14,"Weight reduction continues to be first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension (HTN). However, the long-term effect of bariatric malabsorptive surgical techniques such as Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery in the management of hypertension (HTN) is less clear. African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected by obesity and hypertension and have inconsistent outcomes after bariatric surgery (BS). Despite a plethora of bariatric literature, data about characteristics of a predominantly AA bariatric hypertensive cohort including hypertension in obese (HIO) are scarce and underreported. The aims of this study were, (1) to describe the preoperative clinical characteristics of HIO with respect to HTN status and age, and (2) to identify predictors of HTN resolution one year after RYGB surgery in an AA bariatric cohort enrolled at the Howard University Center for Wellness and Weight Loss Surgery (HUCWWS). In the review of 169 AA bariatric patients, the average BMI was 48.50 kg/m(2) and the average age was 43.86 years. Obese hypertensive patients were older (46 years vs. 37.89 years; p < .0001); had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, 43.09% vs. 10.87%; p < .0001) and dyslipidemia (38.2% vs. 13.04%; p 0.002). Hypertensive AA who were taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications prior to RYGB were 18 times less likely to experience HTN resolution compared to hypertensive AA taking 0–1 medications, who showed full or partial response. Also, HIO was less likely to resolve after RYGB surgery in patients who needed ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications prior to surgical intervention.","Gandotra, Charu; Basam, Motahar; Mahajan, Ankit; Ngwa, Julius; Ortega, Gezzer; Tran, Daniel; Fullum, Terrence M.; Sherif, Zaki A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814052/,44

Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC).","Douglas, Jordan; Zhang, Rong; Bouckaert, Remco",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880504/,44
15651,The Ecology of Nipah Virus in Bangladesh: A Nexus of Land-Use Change and Opportunistic Feeding Behavior in Bats,2021-01-23,"The aim of this review is to provide overall information on Argentine propolis and to shed light on its potential, especially the one from the Monte region so as to support future research in the field. Around 1999, the Argentine propolis began to be chemically and functionally characterized to give it greater added value. Because Argentina has a wide plant biodiversity, it is expected that its propolis will have various botanical origins, and consequently, a different chemical composition. To date, five types have been defined. Based on their functionality, several products have been developed for use in human and veterinary medicine and in animal and human food. Because the Argentine propolis with the greatest potential is that of the Monte eco-region, this review will describe the findings of the last 20 years on this propolis, its botanical source (Zuccagnia punctata Cav.), its chemical composition, and a description of markers of chemical quality (chalcones) and functionality. Propolis can regulate the activity of various pro-inflammatory enzymes and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism enzymes, as well as remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Consequently, it can modulate metabolic syndrome and could be used as a functional ingredient in food. Furthermore, hydroalcoholic extracts can act against human and animal pathogenic bacteria and human yeast, and mycelial pathogenic fungi. The ability to stop the growth of post-harvest pathogenic bacteria and fungi was also demonstrated. For this reason, Argentine propolis are natural products capable of protecting crops and increasing the lifespan of harvested fruit and vegetables. Several reports indicate the potential of Argentine propolis to be used in innovative products to improve health, food preservation, and packaging. However, there is still much to learn about these natural products to make a wholesome use of them.","Zampini, Iris Catiana; Salas, Ana Lia; Maldonado, Luis M.; Simirgiotis, Mario J.; Isla, María Inés",Metabolites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911552/,44

A scientific literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) “Influenza A H1N1” and “Genetic susceptibility”. Due to the amount of information and evidence about genetic susceptibility generated from the studies carried out in the last influenza A H1N1 pandemic, studies published between January 2009 to May 2020 were considered; 119 papers were found. Several pathways are involved in the host defense against IAV infection (innate immune response, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, complement activation, and HLA molecules participating in viral antigen presentation). On the other hand, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a type of variation involving the change of a single base pair that can mean that encoded proteins do not carry out their functions properly, allowing higher viral replication and abnormal host response to infection, such as a cytokine storm. Some of the most studied SNPs associated with IAV infection genetic susceptibility are located in the FCGR2A, C1QBP, CD55, and RPAIN genes, affecting host immune responses through abnormal complement activation. Also, SNPs in IFITM3 (which participates in endosomes and lysosomes fusion) represent some of the most critical polymorphisms associated with IAV infection, suggesting an ineffective virus clearance. Regarding inflammatory response genes, single nucleotide variants in IL1B, TNF, LTA IL17A, IL8, IL6, IRAK2, PIK3CG, and HLA complex are associated with altered phenotype in pro-inflammatory molecules, participating in IAV infection and the severest form of the disease.","Pérez-Rubio, Gloria; Ponce-Gallegos, Marco Antonio; Domínguez-Mazzocco, Bruno André; Ponce-Gallegos, Jaime; García-Ramírez, Román Alejandro; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926867/,44

Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and increased physical activity (PA) have been proposed as strategies to facilitate healthy brain ageing and reduce dementia risk. However, to date, there have been no dementia prevention trials in the UK focussed on combined dietary and PA interventions. This study aims to: (1) assess feasibility and acceptability of a theory-underpinned digital and group-based intervention for dementia risk reduction in an ‘at risk’ UK cohort; (2) evaluate behaviour change responses to the intervention; and, (3) provide information on cognitive, neurological, vascular and physiological outcomes to inform the design of a follow-on, full-scale efficacy trial. METHODS: One hundred and eight participants aged 55 to 74 years with a QRISK2 score of ≥10% will be recruited to take part in this 24-week multi-site study. Participants will be randomised into three parallel arms: (1) Control; (2) MedDiet; and, (3) MedDiet+PA. The study will evaluate a personalised website, group session and food delivery intervention to increase MedDiet adherence and PA in older adults at risk of dementia. Diet and PA will be monitored prior to, during and following the intervention. Feasibility, acceptability and hypothesised mediators will be assessed in addition to measures of cognitive function, brain structure/perfusion (MRI), vascular function and metabolic markers (blood, urine and faecal) prior to, and following, the intervention. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide insights into the feasibility, acceptability and mechanism of effect of a multi-domain intervention focussed on the MedDiet alone and PA for dementia risk reduction in an ‘at risk’ UK cohort.

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA.","Cox, Robert M.; Sourimant, Julien; Govindarajan, Mugunthan; Natchus, Michael G.; Plemper, Richard K.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935272/,44

17398,Overview of Control Programs for EU Non-regulated Cattle Diseases in Italy,2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Water in the environment can be a source of infection linked to outbreaks and environmental transmission in hospitals. Water safety in hospitals remains a challenge. This article has summarized available scientific literature to obtain an overview of outbreaks linked to water-containing hospital equipment and strategies to prevent such outbreaks. METHODS: We made a list of water-containing hospital equipment and devices in which water is being used in a semi-closed circuit. A literature search was performed in PubMed with a search strategy containing the names of these medical devices and one or more of the following words: outbreak, environmental contamination, transmission, infection. For each medical device, we summarized the following information: the function of the medical device, causes of contamination, the described outbreaks and possible prevention strategies. RESULTS: The following water-containing medical equipment or devices were identified: heater-cooler units, hemodialysis equipment, neonatal incubators, dental unit waterlines, fluid warmers, nebulizers, water traps, water baths, blanketrol, scalp cooling, and thermic stimulators. Of the latter three, no literature could be found. Of all other devices, one or more outbreaks associated with these devices were reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The water reservoirs in water-containing medical devices can be a source of microbial growth and transmissions to patients, despite the semi-closed water circuit. Proper handling and proper cleaning and disinfection can help to reduce the microbial burden and, consequently, transmission to patients. However, these devices are often difficult to clean and disinfect because they cannot be adequately opened or disassembled, and the manufacturer’s cleaning guidelines are often not feasible to execute. The development of equipment without water or fluid containers should be stimulated. Precise cleaning and disinfection guidelines and instructions are essential for instructing healthcare workers and hospital cleaning staff to prevent potential transmission to patients.","Yiek, Wing-Kee; Coenen, Olga; Nillesen, Mayke; van Ingen, Jakko; Bowles, Edmée; Tostmann, Alma",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108015/,44

OBJECTIVE: This subanalysis of the Telavancin Observational Use Registry (TOUR™) aimed to record real-world telavancin usage patterns in patients with bone and joint infections treated with telavancin. METHODS: TOUR was a multicenter observational-use registry study conducted at 45 US sites between January 2015 and March 2017. Patient characteristics, infection type, infecting pathogen(s), previous treatment, telavancin dosing and duration, clinical response, and adverse event data were collected by retrospective medical chart reviews. As such, inclusion/exclusion criteria were limited, and any patient receiving at least one dose of telavancin at the discretion of the treating physician was eligible. Patients were assessed as either positive clinical response, failed treatment, or indeterminate outcome. RESULTS: Of the 1063 patients enrolled in TOUR, 27.4% (291/1063) were patients with bone and joint infections including osteomyelitis (with or without prosthetic material), acute septic arthritis, and prosthetic joint infections. Most of these patients had osteomyelitis without prosthetic material (191/291; 66.0%). Among patients assessed at the end of treatment, 211/268 (78.7%) achieved a positive clinical response, 26/268 (9.7%) failed treatment, and 31/268 (11.6%) had an indeterminate outcome. The most frequent pathogen was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (110/291; 37.8%). The median (interquartile range [IQR as Q1, Q3]) telavancin dose was 750.0 mg (IQR, 750, 750 mg) or 8.2 mg/kg (IQR, 6.8, 9.7 mg/kg) administered for a median of 26 days (IQR, 12, 42 days). These assessments were recorded in the registry ≥ 30 days after the last dose of telavancin was administered.

Intra-articular administration of agents is clinically used for pain management. However, the effectiveness is inapparent caused by the rapid clearance of agents. To overcome this issue, nanoparticles as delivery systems hold considerable promise for local control of the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic agents. Given the therapeutic programs are inseparable from pathological progress of osteoarthritis, an ideal delivery system should allow the release of therapeutic agents upon specific features of disorders. In this review, we firstly introduce the pathological features of osteoarthritis and the design concept for accurate localization within cartilage for sustained drug release. Then, we review the interactions of nanoparticles with cartilage microenvironment and the rational design. Furthermore, we highlight advances in the therapeutic schemes according to the pathology signals. Finally, armed with an updated understanding of the pathological mechanisms, we place an emphasis on the development of “smart” bioresponsive and multiple modality nanoparticles on the near horizon to interact with the pathological signals. We anticipate that the exploration of nanoparticles by balancing the efficacy, safety, and complexity will lay down a solid foundation tangible for clinical translation.

In the brain, where neurons critically depend on an efficient and dynamic supply of oxygen and glucose, age‐related changes in the complex interaction between the brain parenchyma and the cerebrovasculature have effects on health and functioning that negatively impact cognition and play a role in pathology. Thus, cerebrovascular health is considered one of the main mechanisms by which a healthy lifestyle, such as habitual cardiorespiratory exercise and a healthful diet, could lead to improved cognitive outcomes with aging. This review aims at detailing how the physiology of the cerebral vascular system changes with age and how these changes lead to differential trajectories of cognitive maintenance or decline. This provides a framework for generating specific mechanistic hypotheses about the efficacy of proposed interventions and lifestyle covariates that contribute to enhanced cognitive well‐being. Finally, we discuss the methodological implications of age‐related changes in the cerebral vasculature for human cognitive neuroscience research and propose directions for future experiments aimed at investigating age‐related changes in the relationship between physiology and cognitive mechanisms.","Zimmerman, Benjamin; Rypma, Bart; Gratton, Gabriele; Fabiani, Monica",Psychophysiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244108/,44

METHODS: Children with MIOP and IOP who underwent haplo-HSCT in Beijing Children’s Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2010 to May 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Data relating to the clinical manifestations, engraftment, and prognosis of the children were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients, including 18 males and 9 females, with an onset age of 12 (0.04–72) months were enrolled in this study. The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 4 (1–23) months. All patients received haplo-HSCT with a myeloablative conditioning regimen (including fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was based on anti-human T lymphocyte porcine immunoglobulin/anti-human thymus globulin, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. The median observation time was 55.2 (0.3–126.2) months. By the end of follow-up, twenty patients survived and seven patients died. The 5 year overall survival rate was 73.9%. Stage I-II acute GVHD was observed in 20 patients, stage III GVHD in 1 patient and no patients had stage IV disease. Chronic GVHD was observed in 11 patients (40.7%) and was controlled by anti-GVHD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Haplo-HSCT was an effective treatment for MIOP and IOP, with a high survival rate and significantly improved clinical symptoms. For patients with a vision impairment before HSCT, the improvement was slow after transplantation. The incidence of GVHD was high but mild and was effectively controlled by appropriate treatment. These data indicated that haplo-HSCT was a feasible treatment for MIOP and IOP.","Zhu, Guanghua; Wei, Ang; Wang, Bin; Yang, Jun; Yan, Yan; Wang, Kai; Jia, Chenguang; Luo, Yanhui; Li, Sidan; Zhou, Xuan; Wang, Tianyou; Zheng, Huyong; Qin, Maoquan",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280586/,44
19356,The inventory of camel feed resource and the evaluation of its chemical composition in south‐east rangelands of Ethiopia,2021-03-22,"Existing research shows consistent links between boredom and depression, somatic complaints, substance abuse, or obesity and eating disorders. However, comparatively little is known about potential psychological and physical health-related correlates of academic boredom. Evidence for such a relationship can be derived from the literature, as boredom has adverse consequences in both work and achievement-related settings. The present study investigates latent correlations of 1.484 adolescents’ (M(age) = 13.23) mathematics boredom scores at three time points during a semester in 2018/19 and their Rasch scaled health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Moreover, we applied latent growth curve modeling to estimate boredom trajectories across the semester and determined the relationship between the latent growth parameters of student boredom and HRQoL in bivariate correlation analyses. Our results show that boredom is significantly negatively linked with all HRQoL dimensions (physical well-being, psychological well-being, autonomy and parent relation, social support and peers, school environment [SCH], and general HRQoL [GH]). Furthermore, stronger increases in boredom across the semester were negatively associated with SCH scores and GH. In conclusion, given that boredom is negatively linked with HRQoL and that stronger boredom growth is linked with more severe health-related problems, signs of academic boredom could be an early warning signal for adolescents’ potentially severe problems.","Schwartze, Manuel M.; Frenzel, Anne C.; Goetz, Thomas; Pekrun, Reinhard; Reck, Corinna; Marx, Anton K.G.; Fiedler, Daniel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8296113/,44

Currently, the regulatory mechanisms controlling RIG-I activation remain to be fully elucidated. Here we show that the FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) facilitates RIG-I activation. FIP200 deficiency impaired RIG-I signaling and increased host susceptibility to RNA virus infection. In vivo studies further demonstrated FIP200 knockout mice were more susceptible to RNA virus infection due to the reduced innate immune response. Mechanistic studies revealed that FIP200 competed with the helicase domain of RIG-I for interaction with the two tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD), thereby facilitating the release of 2CARD from the suppression status. Furthermore, FIP200 formed a dimer and facilitated 2CARD oligomerization, thereby promoting RIG-I activation. Taken together, our study defines FIP200 as an innate immune signaling molecule that positively regulates RIG-I activation.","Wang, Lingyan; Song, Kun; Hao, Wenzhuo; Wu, Yakun; Patil, Girish; Hua, Fang; Sun, Yiwen; Huang, Chaoqun; Ritchey, Jerry; Jones, Clinton; Liu, Lin; Guan, Jun-Lin; Li, Shitao",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322336/,44

The magnetic NiCoFe(2)O(4) core was coated by a thin layer of silica, followed by a niosomal structure, allowing us to load letrozole and curcumin into the silica layer and niosomal layer, respectively, and investigate their synergic effects on breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the nanocarriers demonstrated a pH-dependent release due to the niosomal structure at their outer layer, which is a promising behavior for cancer treatment. Additionally, cellular assays revealed that the nanocarriers had low cellular uptake in the case of non-tumorigenic cells (i.e., MCF-10A) and related high viability but high cellular uptake in cancer cell lines (i.e., MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3) and related low viability, which is evidenced in their high cytotoxicity against different breast cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the letrozole/curcumin co-loaded nanocarrier is higher than that of the aqueous solutions of both drugs, indicating their enhanced cellular uptake in their encapsulated states. In particular, NiCoFe(2)O(4)@L-Silica-L@C-Niosome showed the highest cytotoxicity effects on MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. The observed cytotoxicity was due to regulation of the expression levels of the studied genes in breast cancer cells, where downregulation was observed for the Bcl-2, MMP 2, MMP 9, cyclin D, and cyclin E genes while upregulation of the expression of the Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 genes was observed. The flow cytometry results also revealed that NiCoFe(2)O(4)@L-Silica-L@C-Niosome enhanced the apoptosis rate in both MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells compared to the control samples. The findings of our research show the potential of designing magnetic niosomal formulations for simultaneous targeted delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs into cancer cells in order to enhance their synergic chemotherapeutic effects. These results could open new avenues into the future of nanomedicine and the development of theranostic agents.","Jamshidifar, Elham; Eshrati Yeganeh, Faten; Shayan, Mona; Tavakkoli Yaraki, Mohammad; Bourbour, Mahsa; Moammeri, Ali; Akbarzadeh, Iman; Noorbazargan, Hassan; Hossein-Khannazer, Nikoo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347826/,44
20361,Occurrence and Accumulation of Human Enteric Viruses and Phages in Process Water from the Fresh Produce Industry,2021-08-11,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This study aims to evaluate overall survival and the risk of cause-specific mortality of thyroid cancer patients. Thyroid cancer patients were obtained from the universal health insurance claims from Taiwan between 2001 and 2017. We compared these patients with control subjects matched for age, gender, and baseline conditions to assess the risk of mortality. Of the 30,778 patients with thyroid cancer, the overall mortality rate was 1.29% and the leading causes of death were thyroid cancer (31.2%), other cancers (29.9%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (12.3%), respectively. We found patients with thyroid cancer had excellent overall survival and lower CVD mortality risk. ABSTRACT: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased substantially worldwide. However, the overall mortality risk and actual causes of death in thyroid cancer patients have not been extensively evaluated. In this study, patients with thyroid cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2017 were analyzed from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. We compared these patients with control subjects matched for age, gender, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and occupation to assess the risk of overall mortality and cause-specific mortality. Finally, our cohort comprised 30,778 patients with thyroid cancer. Three hundred and ninety-eight deaths (1.29%) occurred during a median follow-up of 60.0 months (range: 30.3 to 117.6 months). The primary cause of death was thyroid cancer mortality (31.2%), followed by other malignancy-related mortality (29.9%) and CVD mortality (12.3%). The overall mortality risk was similar between the thyroid cancer and control groups (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88–1.10); the adjusted HR was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.95–1.20) after multivariate adjustment for age, gender, history of CVD, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and occupation. The risk of other malignancy-related mortality was comparable between two groups. CVD mortality risk was lower in the thyroid cancer group, with an unadjusted HR of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.38–0.69) and adjusted HR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42–0.76). In conclusion, patients with thyroid cancer had excellent overall survival. Thyroid cancer-specific mortality was the leading cause of death, highlighting the importance of thyroid cancer management. Thyroid cancer patients had lower CVD mortality risk than the general population.","Lu, Yu-Ling; Lin, Shu-Fu; Wu, Ming-Hsien; Lee, Yi-Yin; Lee, Pai-Wei; Chang, Shang-Hung; Huang, Yu-Tung",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391882/,44

22540,Recently published papers in the field of molecular evolution: General aspects,1983,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that well-appearing febrile infants (FI) with viral respiratory infections have a reduced risk of bacterial infections (BI; urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, meningitis). Respiratory testing by PCR allows detection of human rhinovirus (HRV), but few data exist on the risk of concomitant BI in HRV-positive FI. METHODS: We identified well-appearing FI 1–90 days old within Intermountain Healthcare evaluated in the ED or inpatient setting (IP) with viral respiratory testing by PCR (RVPCR) from August 2007 to August 2016. Respiratory viruses detected by RVPCR included: adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1–4, RSV and HRV. We used relative risk (RR) to compare the risk of BI for infants with HRV vs. non-HRV viruses detected. Similarly, we used RR to compare risk of UTI and invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and meningitis) for infants with HRV detected compared with those who were virus negative. RESULTS: 10,964 FI were evaluated in the ED/IP during the study period. 4037 (37%) had RVPCR and were included. 2212 (55%) FI were positive for a respiratory virus and 73% were 29–90 days old. HRV was detected alone in 1392 (34%) and non-HRV viruses were detected in 820 (20%). The overall frequency of BI in the cohort was 9.5%. FI with HRV were more likely to have BI when compared with those with non-HRV viruses [7.8% vs 3.7% P < 0.0001; RR 2.12 (95% CI; 1.43–3.15)]. When compared with virus-negative infants, HRV detection in infants 1–28 days did not decrease the risk for UTI [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.58–1.29)]; risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19–0.88)] but with wide CI approaching 1 suggesting that this may not be clinically meaningful. Similarly, UTI risk in infants 29–90 days was statistically lower with HRV detection [RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.65–0.95)], but unlikely to be clinically important. For infants 29–90 days with HRV, risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34–0.80)] with possible clinical relevance. CONCLUSION: HRV detection was common in young febrile infants. Infants with HRV were at higher risk of BI than infants with non-HRV infection. Detection of HRV did not meaningfully change risk for UTI at any age or meaningfully impact risk of IBI in infants 1–28 days. HRV detection may be associated with a decreased risk for IBI in infants 29–90 days. DISCLOSURES: A. J.

23425,Virus,2020-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes of CMV infection among HSCT recipients likely vary by patient population and treatment modality. However, data on these outcomes have been reported by relatively few centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of allogenic HSCT recipients age ≥18 years at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital (OHSU) between 2010–2015. During the study period, OHSU standard practice was to preemptively treat CMV-viremic patients (quantitative PCR assay ≥ 200 copies/mL or consecutive PCR assays <200 copies/mL) with first-line valganciclovir or ganciclovir and second line foscarnet if there were contraindications to first-line agents. Study data were collected from an electronic health record repository and local Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. Primary outcomes were clinical manifestations of CMV disease, death, and cause of death within 1 year of transplant. RESULTS: Among 409 HSCT recipients, mean age was 53 (standard deviation: 13) years and 41% were female. 192 (47%) patients had CMV viremia and the median (interquartile range) time to CMV reactivation was 42 (31–53) days (Figure 1). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia were significantly less likely to have CMV reactivation (39% vs. 55%, P < 0.01) and those with myelodysplastic syndromes had a non-significantly higher risk (24% vs. 17%, P = 0.06). 4 (1%) patients had a documented clinical manifestation of CMV disease (3 pneumonia and 1 pancreatitis). One-year mortality was 36% (148/409); there was no significant difference in mortality (37.5% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.60) or cause of death (P = 0.30) between patients with and without CMV reactivation (Figure 2). The most frequent causes of death among CMV viremic patients were recurrent/persistent disease (35%), acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (22%), infection (19%), and chronic GVHD (11%). CMV was documented as the primary cause of death for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of HSCT recipients had CMV reactivation and more than a third died within one year of transplant. However, incidence of CMV disease was rare and reactivation was not associated with increased mortality. Further study is needed to identify risk factors for CMV reactivation, infection and mortality in this population. DISCLOSURES: J. P.

23860,Characteristics of Metazoan DNA Replication Origins,2015-09-25,"The characteristics of AKI are significantly influenced by the setting in which it develops. The unique characteristics in the tropical ecosystem along with the prevailing socioeconomic circumstances in the region make AKI in the tropics different regarding etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Community-acquired AKI caused by infections; animal, plant, or chemical toxins; and obstetric complications are common in the tropics, compared to predominantly hospital-acquired AKI from sepsis and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions elsewhere. It is possible to discern certain distinct “AKI syndromes” in the tropics, like febrile illness with AKI, envenomation-related AKI, and obstetric AKI, where the patients develop AKI along with a typical constellation of clinical features, allowing more specific and quick diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Changes in disease epidemiology and ongoing socioeconomic transitions in the tropics are reflected in changing epidemiology of tropical AKI. While the incidence of obstetric AKI has shown a steady decline, HIV-associated AKI emerged as a significant entity in regions where HIV was endemic in the past few decades. There is better recognition of scrub typhus as a significant contributor to AKI with availability of better diagnostic techniques, and it is well recognized that the epidemiology of AKI associated with post-infectious glomerulonephritis is different in the tropics. Rapid urbanization has made large swaths of population susceptible to emerging infections like dengue fever, with increased incidence of AKI. Climate change and scarcity of potable water are expected to pose significant challenges to kidney health in the tropics in the future. However, community-acquired AKI in the tropics also presents a unique opportunity for prevention of AKI, and attendant morbidity and mortality as most of the contributing factors can be addressed by public health interventions and innovative strategies to deliver healthcare.","Parameswaran, Sreejith; Jha, Vivekanand",Core Concepts in Acute Kidney Injury,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119979/,44

The method combines terminological processing and dependency parsing of journal articles, and applies information extraction techniques to profile Web services using informative textual passages, related ontological annotations and service descriptors. Service descriptors are terminological phrases reflecting related concepts (e.g. tasks, approaches, data) and/or specific roles (e.g. input/output parameters, etc.) of the associated resource classes (e.g. algorithms, databases, etc.). They can be used to facilitate subsequent manual description of services, but also for providing a semantic synopsis of a service that can be used to locate related services. We present a case-study involving full text articles from the BMC Bioinformatics journal. We illustrate the potential of natural language processing not only for mining descriptions of known services, but also for discovering new services that have been described in the literature.","Afzal, Hammad; Stevens, Robert; Nenadic, Goran",The Semantic Web: Research and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121258/,44

The method is tested on an analysis of the association between heart disease incidence and a pool of socio-economic variables in Calgary over two consecutive census surveys. The method provides a reliable model, which can guide locational decisions to mitigate present and future disease incidence. The model is underpinned by a quantitative definition of neighbourhood connectivity throughout the city. Such connectivity, usually described by Euclidean distance, can be more effectively described by a specifically calibrated distance metric. The analytical results are meaningful, robust to neighbourhood size, and relatively constant over time. Owing to its effectiveness and simplicity, the procedure is generalizable to other health and socio-economic analysis. An automatic implementation is suggested, to assist in the definition of reliable spatial regression models.","Bertazzon, Stefania; Olson, Scott",Transactions on Computational Science VI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122376/,44

Moreover, the emergence of novel viruses in food with a greater potential to cause morbidity and mortality suggests that control at the retail level is important. Due to the ability of viruses to persist in the environment and resist many disinfection methods, only a few options are currently viable, yet recent advancements suggest other options may be available in the future.

26642,Interferons,2014-07-22,"In this chapter, sessile cells of the innate immune system are briefly introduced. Defined as cells equipped with diverse pattern recognition molecules capable of detecting MAMPs and DAMPs, they encompass cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. Located at the body surfaces, epithelial cells represent the first line of innate immune defense against invading microbial pathogens. They are significant contributors to innate mucosal immunity and generate various antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Also, epithelial cells critically contribute to tissue repair via the phenomenon of re-epithelialization. Fibroblasts operate as classical sentinel cells of the innate immune system dedicated to responding to MAMPs and DAMPs emitted upon any tissue injury. Typically, fibroblasts synthesize most of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, thereby playing a crucial role in tissue repair processes. Vascular cells of the innate immune system represent an evolutionarily developed first-line defense against any inciting insult hitting the vessel walls from the luminal side including bacteria, viruses, microbial toxins, and chemical noxa such as nicotine. Upon such insults and following recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs, vascular cells react with an innate immune response to create an acute inflammatory milieu in the vessel wall aimed at curing the vascular injury concerned. Chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts represent other vital cells of the skeletal system acting as cells of the innate immune system in its wider sense. These cells mediate injury-promoted DAMP-induced inflammatory and regenerative processes specific for the skeletal systems. Finally, adipocytes are regarded as highly active cells of the innate immune system. As white, brown, and beige adipocytes, they operate as a dynamic metabolic organ that can secrete certain bioactive molecules which have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123606/,44

This is a problem for many organisations that are either interested or have deployed some of the tools. The problem arises because there is no mechanism on how to determine appropriateness of the tools within context in an environment. Some of the implications of the problem are that it is difficult to assess appropriateness of the tools in an environment, which sometimes result to duplication; and the value of the tools. The aim of this project was to propose a solution through a model that can be used to evaluate big data analytics tools for organisations’ benefits. The qualitative method, case study approach and semi-structured interview technique were applied in the study. From the analysis, the role of criteria, business and IT alignment, governance, and skill-sets were revealed as critical factors. Based on the factors, a model was developed, which can be used as a building block through which evaluation of big data analytics tools in an organisation is carried out.","Kangelani, Phaphama; Iyamu, Tiko","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134230/,44

It is very important to see how the recipient country can utilize this aid in the economic upliftment of the nation. Taking a case of Nepalese economy, this paper investigates the effectiveness of foreign aid in developing countries. The result from Johansen’s cointegration test reveals that foreign aid independently is not adequate for the economic growth. Increased capital and technological infrastructures, improved skills on human capital, on the other hand, significantly changes the result for the positive aid impact on growth in the long run. Therefore, we can conclude that a good policy environment helps increase the aid effectiveness. However, the prevailing trade policy in the country is negatively affecting the aid effectiveness due to the extremely increased trade deficit. In the short-run, there is a negative impact of aid on growth.","Karki, Yashoda; Pappas, Ilias O.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134295/,44

We focus on this phenomenon by analyzing the models’ interpretability and possible structural and conceptual inconsistencies. By analyzing existing, staged maturity models, we develop a meta model for staged maturity models so different maturity models may share common semantics and syntax. Our meta model can therefore contribute to the conceptual rigor of existing and future maturity models in all domains and can be decisive for the success or failure of a maturity measurement in a company.","Bley, Katja; Schön, Hendrik; Strahringer, Susanne","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134302/,44

Data were collected at both the farm level (all farms) and the individual calf level (1968 calves, 35 farms). Farm-level management data were collected by means of questionnaires and farm visits. Calf-level management data were recorded by farmers on forms provided. Treatments for disease and mortality data were recorded by the farmers on the calves up to the age of weaning, the age at which calves were no longer fed milk or milk substitutes on a regular basis. Farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year. Farm-level mortality rates per six-month season (winter/summer) were skewed, with a mean of about 6%, a median of zero, and a range of 67%. Morbidity rates were similarly skewed. Four percent of liveborn heifer calves died, 20% were treated for scours, and 15% were treated for pneumonia before the age of weaning. Stated farm policies on calf rearing were implemented to varying degrees on different farms, as estimated from individual calf data. This posed particular problems for interpreting farm-level data, since the danger of committing an ecologic fallacy was high. The data set described in this paper formed the basis for an observational study of the interlationships of heifer calf management and clinical outcomes.","Waltner-Toews, D.; Martin, S.W.; Meek, A.H.; McMillan, I.",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134328/,44

The various types of solids and the composition of the samples influence the results and there is no technique available today which is 100% efficient under varied circumstances. Negative findings may be misleading, because there is no guarantee that the virus cultivation system employed will reveal all the virus types present in the sample. For some sludges it is possible to detect viruses by direct inoculation in cell cultures. Such a method may give 10-50% recovery, essentially depending on a balance between the cell-toxicity of the samples, the tenacity of the virus to stick to the solids and the care given the cell cultures. In most methods viruses are extracted from the sample either by elution by high pH (8.5-11.5), by proteinaceous media, with chelating agents, agitation with solvents or by sonication.

Biocidal properties should be a necessary feature for medical-use textiles. Biocidal functions, different from biostatic functions, include sterilization, disinfection, and sanitization in an order of the strength. According to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical use biocidal functions should be at least at the disinfection level, which can inactivate most infectious microorganisms. In addition, biocidal functions on textile materials should survive repeated laundering if used as uniforms, linens and even reusable surgical scraps and gowns. Among the currently investigated antimicrobial materials, only N-halamines have shown the capability of providing fast and total kill against a wide range of microorganisms without causing resistance from microorganisms. Furthermore, halamine structures can be recharged by chlorine bleaching, a process recommended by CD as well. Thus, biocidal textiles containing the halamine structures have been developed. Recent studies in biocidal polymers have resulted interesting progresses in incorporating halamines to all synthetic fabrics that are widely used as medical and other professional clothing materials.

Sinusitis, while also relatively common, may present with nonspecific signs and symptoms. An accurate diagnosis requires a complete history and careful physical examination to help distinguish between viral rhinosinusitis, a condition that is usually self-limiting, and bacterial rhinosinusitis, a condition that requires treatment with antibiotics. Mastoiditis is a less common condition that can occur as a complication of otitis media.

30104,The Structure and Chemistry of the Virion: A Systematic Survey,2013-11-17,"Pneumonia is the main cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Two thirds of pneumonias observed after both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantations are of infectious origin, and coinfections are frequent. One third is due to noninfectious process, such as alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar proteinosis, or alloimmune pulmonary complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans or idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis. Most of these noninfectious complications may require treatment with corticosteroids which may be deleterious in infection. On the other hand, these complications either mimic or may be complicated with infections. Therefore, a precise diagnosis of pneumonia is of crucial importance to decide of the optimal treatment. CT scan is the best procedure for imaging of the lung. Although several indirect biomarkers, such as serum or plasma galactomannan or (1-3) β(beta)-G-glucan, can help in the etiological diagnosis, only direct invasive investigations provide the best chance to identify the cause(s) of pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under fiberoptic bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice to identify the cause of pulmonary infection. It is safe and reproducible, and its diagnostic yield is around 50 % if the BAL fluid is processed at the laboratory according to a prespecified protocol established between the transplanter, the infectious diseases’ specialist, the pneumologist, and the laboratory, allowing the identification of the most likely hypotheses. Transbronchial biopsy does not provide significant additional information to BAL in most cases and more often complicates with bleeding and pneumothorax. In case of a noncontributory BAL, the decision to proceed to a second BAL, a transthoracic biopsy, or a surgical biopsy should be cautiously weighted in a multidisciplinary approach in regard to the benefits and risks of invasive procedures versus empirical treatment.","Cordonnier, Catherine",Transplant Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153442/,44

Bij een infectieziekte is er sprake van een bepaalde vorm van interactie waarbij schade optreedt voor de mens. Verreweg de meeste interacties tussen mensen en micro-organismen zijn echter niet schadelijk voor de mens. Infectieziekten behoren tot de meest prevalente aandoeningen van de mens en op mondiaal niveau zijn ze nog steeds de belangrijkste oorzaak van vermijdbare sterfte. Daarom is het voor het onderwijs in de geneeskunde van groot belang infectieziekten te beschouwen als een aparte groep ziekten, met een unieke etiologie, epidemiologie, pathogenese, diagnostiek, behandeling en preventie. Infecties komen op alle leeftijden voor en kunnen alle organen en weefsels van het lichaam treffen. Infectieziekten zijn daardoor een belangrijk paradigma in de geneeskunde.

30140,Immune-Mediated Disorders,2009-05-15,"Vaccines against infectious bronchitis of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) have arguably been the most successful, and certainly the most widely used, of vaccines for diseases caused by coronaviruses, the others being against bovine, canine, feline and porcine coronaviruses. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), together with the genetically related coronaviruses of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), is a group 3 coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus being tentatively in group 4, the other known mammalian coronaviruses being in groups 1 and 2. IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract—the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects. The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay. Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase. Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds. Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age. In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus. Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response. Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains. IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor. Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later. Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of <50% of chickens. Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others. In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations. This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny. The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S. The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody. Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (<50%) for commercial application. Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments. Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection. Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody. Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV. In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity. The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood. Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role. Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced αβ T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection. In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly. Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine. Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry. However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.g. health care workers and high-risk contacts). Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people. Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.","Cavanagh, Dave",Avian Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154303/,44

Although plagues may be global events, they are ultimately fought at the local level. In discussing the SARS epidemic, I present two theses. (1) In the wake of a plague, politics tends to shape a community's response in protecting the system, evaluating performances and allocating blame, punishments, and rewards, and restructuring organizations. (2) Because of their potential for demographic and institutional destruction, systemic responses to plague tend to become entwined in politics at all levels – the local, national, and international.","Schwirian, Kent P.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161672/,44

31316,The limited universe of exons,2004-07-29,"Interferon‐α/β (IFN‐α/β) is increasingly used as antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies. Unfortunately, bioavailability varies with IFN species and mode of administration, and all IFN species are potentially immunogenic. Assays for antiviral activity (IFN) and antiviral neutralization (antibodies, NAb) have been used for some time to monitor patients on IFN biologicals. These assays require laborious titrations making them unsuitable for large‐scale clinical use. Myxovirus A (MxA) is a resistance GTP‐binding protein that is specifically induced by treatment with type 1 IFNs. For example, IFN‐β‐induced MxA in blood leucocytes has been used as a biomarker in IFN‐β‐treated patients with multiple sclerosis. However, the degree of specificity of MxA in this regard is unclear, and measurements of MxA protein and/or mRNA are not yet suitable for routine clinical use. In an attempt to find new and better reporter genes (and, hopefully, genes and gene products with proven specificity for IFN‐α and ‐β), microarray screenings with U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix) were carried using human blood leucocytes and the human lung carcinoma cell line A549. We studied the simultaneous expression of 22,000 transcripts before and after exposure to human recombinant IFN‐α and IFN‐β and other antiviral and immunomodulatory cytokines. The results will be presented at the conference.","Sønder, S. U. S.; Hedegaard, C. J.; Bendtzen, K.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169493/,44

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD), receiving long‐term haemodialysis treatment. Methods: This study included 40 sera from patients with ESRD (29 male and 11 female) undergoing periodic haemodialysis; mean time of treatment was 42.6 months. Using ELISA technique, we investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori as well as IgG CagA (antibodies specific for CagA(+) strains of H. pylori). Sera from 40 healthy blood donors were used as a control group. Results: H. pylori IgG antibodies were detected in 32 out of 40 (80%) patients in the dialysis group, while 31/40 (77.5%) tested positive for IgA. IgG CagA antibodies were present in 13 out of 40 (32.5%). Prevalence of H. pylori IgG, IgA and CagA IgG antibodies in the control group was 33, 7 and 15%, respectively. Conclusions: Although international data suggest that prevalence of H. pylori infection is the same in ESRD patients as in healthy individuals, in our study that seems not to be the case. The higher blood and gastric juice urea levels may be a risk factor (among many others), but more studies are required in order to understand the relation of H. pylori infection in this group of patients.","Astrinidou‐Vakaloudi, A.; Xytsas, S.; Diamanti, I.; .

31355,Molecular phylogeny,2004-07-29,"Aloe emodin (AE) is a naturally occurring compound with wide spectrum of biological properties, including antimicrobial, vasorelaxant, immunosuppressive and anticancer actions. This anthraquinone induces apoptosis in several tumour cell lines with special affinity to tumours of neuroectodermal origin. High amounts of nitric oxide (NO) released by activated macrophages induce tumour cell death. Therefore, we explored the capacity of AE to modulate NO‐mediated antitumour response in vitro. Interestingly, while AE markedly suppressed NO release from macrophages alone, it significantly potentiated NO production in cocultures of macrophages and C6 cells, after 48 h of cultivation. Accordingly, the viability of C6 cells cocultivated with macrophages was reduced in the presence of AE. Moreover, the observed AE‐imposed potentiation of NO production in macrophages was closely related to macrophage culture cell density. According to these data, we proposed that NO modulator capacity of AE strongly depended on intercellular contact, indicating that macrophage antitumour response was not compromised but even potentiated by AE.","Mijatovic, S.; Maksimovic‐Ivanic, D.; Miljkovic, D.

34331,A decade of advances in transposon-insertion sequencing,2020-06-12,"Pedestrian wind comfort near a 400 m super-tall building in high and low ambient wind speeds, referred to as Windy and Calm climates, is evaluated by conducting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The super-tall building has 15 different configurations and is located at the center of 50 m medium-rise buildings in an urban-like setting. Pedestrian level mean wind speeds near the super-tall building is obtained from three-dimensional (3D), steady-state, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)-based simulations for five incident wind directions (θ = 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 90°, 180°) that are subsequently compared with two wind comfort criteria specified for Calm and Windy climates. Results show a 1.53 times increase in maximum mean wind speed in the urban area after the construction of a square-shaped super-tall building. The escalated mean wind speeds result in a 23%–15% and 36%–29% decrease in the area with “acceptable wind comfort” in Calm and Windy climates, respectively. The area with pedestrian wind comfort varies significantly with building configuration and incident wind direction, for example, the configurations with sharp corners, large plan aspect ratios and, frontal areas and the orientation consistently show a strong dependency on incident wind direction except for the one with rounded plan shapes. Minor aerodynamic modifications such as corner modifications and aerodynamically-shaped configurations such as tapered and setback buildings show promise in improving pedestrian wind comfort in Windy climate.","Zhang, Xinyue; Weerasuriya, Asiri Umenga; Zhang, Xuelin; Tse, Kam Tim; Lu, Bin; Li, Cruz Yutong; Liu, Chun-Ho",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282207/,44

37488,Detection of Plant Viruses and Disease Management: Relevance of Genetic Diversity and Evolution,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: The differentiation of CD4+ lymphocytes Th17/regulatory T cells (Treg) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is associated with the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Basic research has shown that IDO is likely a “switch” of the transition from Th17 cells to Tregs under certain conditions. However, no relevant clinical studies have been reported on the association between IDO activity and Th17/Treg imbalance in children with allergic asthma. The goal of this study was to test whether indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) participates in the pathogenesis of pediatric allergic asthma by influencing Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and related cytokines. METHODS: Thirty-three children with allergic asthma and 33 healthy children were selected. The subjects were evaluated via a pulmonary function test, a skin prick test, and an eosinophil count. Peripheral blood was collected to measure Th17/Treg percentages and related cytokine levels. Blood and induced sputum were obtained to measure the IDO level. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the patient group had an obvious Th17/Treg imbalance; their IDO levels were significantly lower, their IL-17 and IL-6 levels were markedly higher, and their IL-10 and TGF-β levels were markedly lower than those of the control group. The IDO levels in both blood and induced sputum were negatively correlated with the Th17/Treg ratio. CONCLUSIONS: A significant correlation was observed between IDO activity and Th17/Treg imbalance in children with allergic asthma. IDO may upregulate Treg numbers by stimulating IL-10 production and inhibiting IL-6 expression. Therefore, IDO may be a molecular switch that leads to the conversion of Th17 cells to Tregs, thus playing a potentially protective role in the pathogenesis of asthma.

38070,Unraveling the Dynamics of Antibody-Antigen Interaction by DNA Origami,2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Alteration of the mechanisms of cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). However, previous clinical studies on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) in sepsis had several cofounders. Furthermore, little is known on the potential impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in sepsis. The aim of our study was to determine the presence and time course of dCA and NVC alterations in a clinically relevant animal model and their potential impact on the development of SAE. METHODS: Thirty-six anesthetized, mechanically ventilated female sheep were randomized to sham procedures (sham, n = 15), sepsis (n = 14), or septic shock (n = 7). Blood pressure, CBF, and electrocorticography were continuously recorded. Pearson’s correlation coefficient Lxa and transfer function analysis were used to estimate dCA. NVC was assessed by the analysis of CBF variations induced by cortical gamma activity (Eγ) peaks and by the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between the spontaneous fluctuations of CBF and Eγ. Cortical function was estimated by the alpha-delta ratio. Wilcoxon signed rank and rank sum tests, Friedman tests, and RMANOVA test were used as appropriate. RESULTS: Sepsis and sham animals did not differ neither in dCA nor in NVC parameters. A significant impairment of dCA occurred only after septic shock (Lxa, p = 0.03, TFA gain p = 0.03, phase p = 0.01). Similarly, NVC was altered during septic shock, as indicated by a lower MSC in the frequency band 0.03–0.06 Hz (p < 0.001). dCA and NVC impairments were associated with cortical dysfunction (reduction in the alpha-delta ratio (p = 0.03)). CONCLUSIONS: A progressive loss of dCA and NVC occurs during septic shock and is associated with cortical dysfunction. These findings indicate that the alteration of mechanisms controlling cortical perfusion plays a late role in the pathophysiology of SAE and suggest that alterations of CBF regulation mechanisms in less severe phases of sepsis reported in clinical studies might be due to patients’ comorbidities or other confounders. Furthermore, a mean arterial pressure targeting therapy aiming to optimize dCA might not be sufficient to prevent neuronal dysfunction in sepsis since it would not improve NVC.","Ferlini, Lorenzo; Su, Fuhong; Creteur, Jacques; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Gaspard, Nicolas",Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40635-020-00332-0,44

Highlighting the role of pandemic in the construction of political narratives, it aims to shed light on the potential implications of the crisis in shaping domestic power struggles as well as Turkish foreign policy choices. The analysis revealed that both ruling and opposition parties in Turkey are instrumentalizing nationalist narratives with an emphasis on protection and self-reliance, and are engaged in political opportunism during the outbreak. It also demonstrated how the pandemic facilitated the restoration of Turkey’s ontological security in international arena while fostering nationalism and securing the “savior and protector” identity of its ruling elites. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that post-pandemic Turkish politics will be shaped by growing tension between religious and secular understandings of nationalism as well as frictions with allies and neighbors over the disputes in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

This report presents a challenging case of solitary brain metastasis secondary to prostate cancer that gave rise to intraventricular hemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus mimicking a giant aneurysm. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and morbid obesity presented to the emergency room with a severe headache. He was afebrile with a blood pressure of 144/79 mmHg, alert, without any sign of sensory or motor deficit. Shortly after admission, he became unresponsive and was immediately intubated. His blood tests revealed hypernatremia at 154 mmol/L; otherwise, the lab data including the COVID-19 screening proved normal. The cerebral CT and MR images, with and without contrast, were interpreted as a giant thrombotic aneurysm extending to the suprasellar region by the emergency radiologist. Also, moderate intraventricular hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, and sub-ependymal interstitial edema were observed. Upon further evaluation of the images, the lesion was determined to be an exophytic hemorrhagic hypothalamic mass, and the subsequent biopsy was consistent with prostate cancer metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The exophytic hemorrhagic hypothalamic metastasis can mimic a ruptured aneurysm on imaging.

46944,“SOFT–HARD” STRATEGY TO CONSTRUCT A PYRAZINE SULFONIC ACID COPPER(II) SUPRAMOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND A STUDY OF ITS FLUORESCENT PROPERTY,2021-03-16,"Introduction: Affecting ~1% of the world population, schizophrenia is known as one of the costliest and most burdensome diseases worldwide. Antipsychotic medications are the main treatment for schizophrenia to control psychotic symptoms and efficiently prevent new crises. However, due to poor compliance, 74% of patients with schizophrenia discontinue medication within 1.5 years, which severely affects recovery and prognosis. Through research on intra and interindividual variability based on a psychopathology–neuropsychology–neuroimage–genetics–physiology-biochemistry model, our main objective is to investigate an optimized and individualized antipsychotic-treatment regimen and precision treatment for first-episode schizophrenic patients. Methods and Analysis: The study is performed in 20 representative hospitals in China. Three subprojects are included. In subproject 1, 1,800 first-episode patients with schizophrenia are randomized into six different antipsychotic monotherapy groups (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and haloperidol) for an 8-week treatment. By identifying a set of potential biomarkers associated with antipsychotic treatment response, we intend to build a prediction model, which includes neuroimaging, epigenetics, environmental stress, neurocognition, eye movement, electrophysiology, and neurological biochemistry indexes. In subproject 2, apart from verifying the prediction model established in subproject 1 based on an independent cohort of 1,800 first-episode patients with schizophrenia, we recruit patients from a verification cohort who did not get an effective response after an 8-week antipsychotic treatment into a randomized double-blind controlled trial with minocycline (200 mg per day) and sulforaphane (3 tables per day) to explore add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Two hundred forty participants are anticipated to be enrolled for each group. In subproject 3, we tend to carry out one trial to construct an intervention strategy for metabolic syndrome induced by antipsychotic treatment and another one to build a prevention strategy for patients at a high risk of metabolic syndrome, which combines metformin and lifestyle intervention. Two hundred participants are anticipated to be enrolled for each group.

The question is relevant across the western world showing a pattern of more men than women in ICT work. This chapter presents an analysis of available statistics that contribute to an image of women’s participation in ICT work and education. The scope of the study is European countries with an emphasis on Norway, however, we also present statistics from OECD. The statistics confirm that the gender imbalance in ICT work is significant, suggesting that monitoring this field is important. The analysis also reveals challenges and gaps in the material, for instance the challenge of finding comparable numbers, a reduced use of gender as a variable in later years, difficulties in identifying the gendered structures of ICT due to a mixture of occupational fields for some of the relevant numbers, while other issues found to be relevant in qualitative studies are not represented in the available statistics. The monitoring of gendered structures of ICT work can be improved by developing statistics that better can capture inequalities and hierarchies. The findings also suggest that qualitative research is an important complement and correction to statistical overviews, in particular for identifying factors that alone and together contribute to gender inequalities in ICT.","Simonsen, Morten; Corneliussen, Hilde G.",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979030/,44

Despite the availability of a wide range of literature devoted to various aspects of advertising, the investigation of its influence on the processes occurring in society is still relevant. Previous researches in this field focused primarily on consumer behaviour influence techniques, the effectiveness of various marketing channels, and new forms of advertising centred at increasing trust among the target audience. The purpose of this study was to uncover how advertising impacts social processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology included system analysis (for comprehensive study of coronavirus-related advertisements) and comparative analysis (to review Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian advertising strategies and identify dominant ones). The examination of coronavirus-related advertisements revealed a shift from advertising directed at increasing consumption towards its reduction. A comparative analysis of samples from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine showed that the advertising market is closely related to the government and often appeals to negative emotions in all countries under consideration. However, their influence strategies are somewhat different. Belarus and Ukraine tend to apply provocative methods to attract the viewer’s attention. In contrast, the Russian advertising industry prefers using the TV appeal of socially significant persons and emotionally neutral outdoor advertisements with information on the proper rules of conduct. The results of this study can be applied by officials for developing information policies especially those related to pandemic and other extraordinary circumstances.","Pavlovskaya, Olga; Kurenova, Daria; Murtazina, Gulsina; Kolosova, Olga",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8052940/,44

Surgery and hospital admissions present risks to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of all NOF fractures from 24/3/20 to 26/6/20 in Morriston Hospital. Directly compared with 2019, allowing assessment of COVID-19’s impact. RESULTS: 179 NOF fractures were admitted, 158 had an operation. Increased from 127 patients in 2019. Average time to surgery increased from 39 to 67 hours. There were operation delays for 98 patients, and non-operative treatment increased from 2 to 21 patients. Prompt orthogeriatric reviews completed in 80.4% patients in 2020, up from 72.5%. Prompt physiotherapy review increased from 66.9% to 74.6%. Mortality remained similar at 8.6% (2019) and 8.5% (2020). Average length of stay reduced; 17.4 to 11 days in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: 2020 saw increased waits for operations. There was reduction in length of stay and improved promptness of orthogeriatric and physiotherapy reviews. Increased non-operative treatment in 2020, reflecting decisions about risks and benefits of surgery in the pandemic. Mortality remained stable.

53509,A Novel Solid Phase Extraction Sample Preparation Method for Lipidomic Analysis of Human Plasma Using Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: Public hospital(s). Main funding source(s): Dr. Sardjito Hospital Funding BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (EBCR) faced challenges. Patients could not freely attend EBCR in hospital. In our hospital, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) service adapted to the pandemic condition by reducing to sessions per week. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate whether the adaptation protocol of EBCR during COVID-19 period influenced the CR result. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. The subjects were patients underwent EBCR program in CR Service of our hospital. We retrieved the CR program registry and divided it into two periods, namely the non-pandemic period (January 2019 – February 2020) and the COVID-19 period (March 2020 – December 2020). During the non-pandemic period, subjects performed EBCR 3 times (@45 min) per week for 10-12 total sessions. During the COVID-19 period, the EBCR session was reduced 2 times (@45 min) per week for 10-12 total sessions. However, patients might modify the sessions provided space availability and acceptable reason. After total sessions were completed, the treadmill test evaluation was performed. We compared the duration and metabolic equivalent (METs) achieved in the treadmill test evaluation. RESULTS: There was nearly 50% reduction in patients who underwent EBCR during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 48), compared to during the non-pandemic period (n = 96). Post septal defect closure (42.7% vs. 60.4%) and mitral valve surgery (35.4% vs. 29.2%) predominated subjects registered for EBCR during the non-pandemic and the COVID-19 period, whereas post CABG was the minority (4.2% vs. 4.2%). Among 144 registered subjects, majority completed EBCR sessions and underwent treadmill test evaluation (79 (82.3%) vs. 37 (77.1%) during the non-pandemic and the COVID-19 period). During the COVID-19 period, the most common sessions were 2 times per week (48.6%), followed by 5 times per week (32.4%), whereas during the non-pandemic period, 3 times per week was the most common (77.2%), followed by 5 times per week (19.0%) (p < 0.001). Total sessions did not significantly differ between the non pandemic and the COVID-19 period. Total sessions also did not significantly differ among subjects undergoing 2 times per week, 3 times per week, and 5 times per week sessions. There was no difference in duration (7.1 ± 1.9 min vs. 6.6 ± 1.9 min, p = 0,136) and METs (7.5 ± 1.8 vs. 6.9 ± 1.9, p = 0.192) achieved on treadmill evaluation between subjects on two time periods. There was no significant difference in duration (6.9 ± 1.9 min, 7.0 ± 1.9 min and 6.8 ± 1.8 min)and METs (7.1 ± 1.9, 7.3 ± 1.7 and 7.4 ± 2.1) achieved on treadmill evaluation among subjects who underwent EBCR 2 times per week, 3 times per week and 5 times per week respectively. CONCLUSION: The adaptation protocol of EBCR during the COVID-19 period by reducing sessions per week did not influence the duration and METs achieved on treadmill evaluation at the end of CR as compared to usual EBCR practice.","Hartopo, AB; Islami, ZH; Arso, IA; Ambari, AM; Dwiputra, B; Radi, B",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136035/,44

In this study, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to characterize protein alterations in chicken bursa of Fabricius, before and after REV infection at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Our data showed that 1,127, 999, 910, and 1,138 differentially expressed proteins were significantly altered at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after REV infection, respectively. Morphological analysis showed that REV infection reduced in cortical lymphocytes, bursal follicle atrophy, and nuclear damage. Bioinformatics analysis indicated these proteins were mainly involved with immune responses, energy metabolism, cellular processes, biological regulation, metabolic processes, response to stimuli, and multicellular organismal process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway cluster analysis showed that post-infection, proteins were enriched in the cell cycle, Wnt signaling, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine receptor interaction, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling. In addition, we observed that peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4), peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), catalase (CAT), and peroxidasin (PXDN) were involved in oxidative stress. Some heat shock protein (HSP) family members such as HSPH1, DNAJA4, HSPA8, and HSPA4L also changed significantly after REV infection. These findings help clarify interactions between REV and the host and provides mechanistic insights on REV-induced host immunosuppression.","Yang, Dahan; Lv, Xiaoping; Zhang, Shujun; Zheng, Shimin",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186552/,44

Whilst the vaccine trials is underway, there a several antiviral and antibody treatments being clinically evaluated to fill the “therapeutic gap” in parallel. The development of potential drugs requires an understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenicity and mechanism of action. Thus, it is essential to understand the full repertoire of viral proteins and their interplay with host factors. Here, we show how the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein undergoes 3 stages of processing to allow virion activation and host cell infection. Our comprehensive structural and computational studies reveal why COVID19 is hypervirulent and incites the possible reason for the failure of several antibody treatments. In addition, our resolved complex structures of spike protein with different host cell receptors shows the complexity of entry. We also demonstrate via experimental, biophysical and molecular dynamics studies that how the host proteins CD26 (DPP4), Furin and TMPRSS2 process the viral spike glycoprotein and assist in the viral entry in addition to ACE2. These results cognise the detailed mechanism of spike glycoprotein for its entry or cascade into host cell and also reveal new avenues for potential therapeutics to block different stages of viral entry and new pathways for vaccine development.","Vankadari, Naveen",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239666/,44
56262,First person – Abdulsalam Isiaku,2021-07-23,"Introduction and objectives: Obesity represents a major global public health problem. Its etiology is multifactorial and includes poor dietary habits, such as hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diets (HFDs), physical inactivity, and genetic factors. Regular exercise is, per se, a tool for the treatment and prevention of obesity, and recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of exercise can be potentiated by the fasting state, thus potentially promoting additional effects. Despite the significant number of studies showing results that corroborate such hypothesis, very few have evaluated the effects of fasted-state exercise in overweight/obese populations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subacute effects (12 h after conclusion) of a single moderate-intensity exercise bout, performed in either a fed or an 8 h fasted state, on serum profile, substrate-content and heat shock pathway–related muscle protein immunocontent in obese male rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats received a modified high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. The animals were allocated to four groups: fed rest (FER), fed exercise (FEE), fasted rest (FAR) and fasted exercise (FAE). The exercise protocol was a 30 min session on a treadmill, with an intensity of 60% of VO(2)max. The duration of the fasting period was 8 h prior to the exercise session. After a 12 h recovery, the animals were killed and metabolic parameters of blood, liver, heart, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated, as well as SIRT1 and HSP70 immunocontent in the muscles. Results: HFD induced obesity and insulin resistance. Soleus glycogen concentration decreased in the fasted groups and hepatic glycogen decreased in the fed exercise group. The combination of exercise and fasting promoted a decreased concentration of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. In the heart, combination fasting plus exercise was able to decrease triglycerides to control levels. In the soleus muscle, both fasting and fasting plus exercise were able to decrease triglyceride concentrations. In addition, heat shock protein 70 and sirtuin 1 immunocontent increased after exercise in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Conclusions: An acute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise, when realized in fasting, may induce, in obese rats with metabolic dysfunctions, beneficial adaptations to their health, such as better biochemical and molecular adaptations that last for at least 12 h. Considering the fact that overweight/obese populations present an increased risk of cardiovascular events/diseases, significant reductions in such plasma markers of lipid metabolism are an important achievement for these populations.","Vogt, Éverton Lopes; Von Dentz, Maiza Cristina; Rocha, Débora Santos; Argenta Model, Jorge Felipe; Kowalewski, Lucas Stahlhöfer; de Souza, Samir Khal; Girelli, Vitória de Oliveira; de Bittencourt, Paulo Ivo Homem; Friedman, Rogério; Krause, Mauricio; Vinagre, Anapaula Sommer",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307452/,44

All the current solutions use an Identifier, Proximity Identifier (PID), that anonymously represents the user in the proximity data exchanged. The PID used in these applications varies in their structure, management and properties. This paper first identifies the common desirable properties of PID, including some non-obvious ones for its global application.

57032,Why the Rationale for Canine Borrelia burgdorferi Vaccination Is Unpersuasive,2021-08-11,"Osteoporosis is becoming a highly prevalent disease in a large proportion of the global aged population. Serum metabolite markers may be important for the treatment and early prevention of osteoporosis. Serum samples from 32 osteoporosis and 32 controls were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics and lipidomic approaches performed on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) system. To find systemic disturbance of osteoporosis, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and statistical methods were employed for data-mining. Then, an in-depth targeted method was utilized to determine potential markers from the family of key metabolites. As a result, 1,241 metabolites were identified from untargeted methods and WGCNA indicated that lipids metabolism is deregulated and glycerol phospholipids, sphingolipids, fatty acids, and bile acids (BA) are majorly affected. As key metabolites of lipids metabolism, 66 bile acids were scanned and 49 compounds were quantified by a targeted method. Interestingly, hyocholic acids (HCA) were found to play essential roles during the occurrence of osteoporosis and may be potential markers. These metabolites may be new therapeutic or diagnosis targets for the screening or treatment of osteoporosis. Quantified measurement of potential markers also enables the establishment of diagnostic models for the following translational research in the clinic.","Deng, Dawei; Pan, Chen; Wu, Zeming; Sun, Yujiao; Liu, Chang; Xiang, Hong; Yin, Peiyuan; Shang, Dong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378234/,44

We aimed to evaluate the impact of short-term IFN on incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: We included consecutive adults without known thyroid disorder admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from July 2020 to January 2021 who had thyroid function tests (TFTs) and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at three months. RESULTS: 226 patients were included (median age 55.0 years; 49.6% men): 135 were IFN-treated. There tended to be more abnormal TFTs upon reassessment in IFN-treated patients (8.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.080). 179 patients (65.4% IFN-treated) had a complete reassessment of anti-thyroid antibodies. There were significant increases in titres of both anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO: baseline 29.21 units [IQR: 14.97 – 67.14] vs reassessment 34.30 units [IQR: 18.82 – 94.65], p<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg: baseline 8.23 units [IQR: 5.40 – 18.44] vs reassessment 9.14 units [IQR: 6.83 – 17.17], p=0.001) in the IFN-treated group but not IFN-naïve group. IFN treatment (standardised beta 0.245, p=0.001) was independently associated with changes in anti-TPO titre. Of the 143 patients negative for anti-TPO at baseline, 8 became anti-TPO positive upon reassessment (seven IFN-treated; one IFN-naïve). Incident anti-TPO positivity was more likely to be associated with abnormal TFTs upon reassessment (phi 0.188, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: IFN for COVID-19 was associated with modest increases in anti-thyroid antibody titres, and a trend of more incident anti-TPO positivity and abnormal TFTs during convalescence. Our findings suggest that clinicians monitor the thyroid function and anti-thyroid antibodies among IFN-treated COVID-19 survivors, and call for further follow-up studies regarding the clinical significance of these changes.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lee, Chi Ho; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Pang, Polly; Ho, Tip Yin; Cheung, Chloe Yu Yan; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Lam, Ching Wan; Chow, Wing Sun; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Karen Siu Ling; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515032/,44

No studies or census has been carried out, and therefore, no data on this compelling issue are available. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data emanating from eight Arabic eastern/southern Mediterranean countries who responded to five surveys were collected and tabulated. RESULTS Asepsis during phlebotomy, screening for serological and immuno-haematological parameters and appropriate storage conditions are maintained across all countries. Variations in blood component processing exist. Universal leucoreduction is systematically applied in Lebanon. Nucleic acid testing is only performed in Egypt. Aphaeresis procedure, leucoreduction and quality control for blood components are virtually inexistent in Mauritania. Written donor questionnaire is absent in Algeria and Tunisia. Most donor deferral periods for infectious agents are inconsistent with international standards. CONCLUSION Gaps in the processing and in the quality/safety measures applied to the manufacture of blood components are quite evident in most eastern/southern Mediterranean countries.

This study tested the hypothesis whether the neutrophil compartment displays characteristics of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a prospective study was performed on all patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting at the emergency room of a large academic hospital. Blood drawn within 2 d after hospital presentation was analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry and compared with blood samples collected at later time points. COVID-19 patients did not exhibit neutrophilia or eosinopenia. Unexpectedly neutrophil activation markers (CD11b, CD16, CD10, and CD62L) did not differ between COVID-19-positive patients and COVID-19-negative patients diagnosed with other bacterial/viral infections, or between COVID-19 severity groups.

While exercise can have anti-inflammatory effects, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used an in vitro tissue-engineered model of human skeletal muscle (""myobundle"") to study effects of exercise-mimetic electrical stimulation (E-stim) on interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced muscle weakness. Chronic IFN-γ treatment of myobundles derived from multiple donors induced myofiber atrophy and contractile loss. E-stim altered the myobundle secretome, induced myofiber hypertrophy, and attenuated the IFN-γ-induced myobundle wasting and weakness, in part by down-regulating JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) signaling pathway amplified by IFN-γ. JAK/STAT inhibitors fully prevented IFN-γ-induced myopathy, confirming the critical roles of STAT1 activation in proinflammatory action of IFN-γ. Our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism of the cell-autonomous anti-inflammatory effects of muscle exercise and establish the utility of human myobundle platform for studies of inflammatory muscle disease and therapy.","Chen, Zhaowei; Li, Binjie; Zhan, Ren-Zhi; Rao, Lingjun; Bursac, Nenad",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd9502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523949/,44

For 20 years, since the advent of the synthetic opioids, 25,000 Americans, on average, have died annually from opioid-related overdoses. The United States produces and consumes by far the greatest amounts of opioids. National regulations introduced to curb overdoses and restrict opioid availability have condemned many Americans, such as cancer patients or those in need of palliative care, to a life of extreme pain due to lack of access to adequate pain management. As is often the case, US-driven laws have informed and guided international regulations. Worldwide, 83% of countries have low or non-existent access to opioids for pain relief. Over 25 million people are at the end-of-life stage, with eight million people dying annually in unnecessary pain and distress. Ineffectively controlled pain is a global public health issue blighting the lives of billions of people worldwide with immeasurable human and socioeconomic costs. International conventions regulate the trade and use of controlled medications, including many opioids. The goal is to balance widespread access to optimal forms of pain management with restrictions to govern the use and prevent the misuse of controlled substances. Those conventions are failing to meet their goals. International guidelines to inform national legislation have been compromised and withdrawn, thanks to undue interference from US-based opioid manufacturers. The new goal must be to ensure equitable access, for all, to opioids and ensure that optimal pain management becomes a central component of Universal Health Coverage. SIGNIFICANCE: The opioid crisis is, more accurately, a multicomponent global crisis and one that is not fully apparent or well understood. Regulations of the wealthy and powerful to control a surfeit of opioids, which encourages misuse, cannot be allowed to govern legislation in the majority of countries worldwide where citizens have little or no access to opioids to reduce pain and suffering. International conventions must be revised to ensure an optimal balance that allows access to opioids for all those who need them.","Miyachi, Takashi; Ozaki, Akihiko; Saito, Hiroaki; Sawano, Toyoaki; Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Crump, Andy",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822443/,44
61557,Use of Two Intracorporeal Ventricular Assist Devices As a Total Artificial Heart.,2018,"Pandemics such as that of COVID-19 affect a relatively large number of people and impose new rules and social habits on the world population. Information about the pandemic is constant in the media. Moreover, social distancing has been adopted in Brazil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may have economic and psychosocial consequences. This study aimed to verify the factors associated with indicators of mental disorders symptoms in residents of Rio Grande do Sul during the initial period of the social distancing policy. The study was approved by CONEP. There were 799 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years (M = 36.56; SD = 12.88); 82.7% were women, who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire of social distancing and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The results indicated that having decreased income in the period, being part of the risk group and being more exposed to information about deaths and infected, are factors that can significantly harm mental health in this pandemic period. Investigating social determinants that contribute to greater vulnerability to the mental illness of the population is vital in the field of collective health for the planning of public actions and policies.","Duarte, Michael de Quadros; Santo, Manuela Almeida da Silva; Lima, Carolina Palmeiro; Giordani, Jaqueline Portella; Trentini, Clarissa Marceli",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.16472020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876269/,44

Since its inception, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has become easier and more versatile to use. Many variants have been found, giving the CRISPR toolkit a great range that includes the activation and repression of genes aside from the previously known knockout and knockin of genes. Here, in this Perspective, we describe efforts on automating the gene-editing workflow, with particular emphasis given on the use of microfluidic technology. We discuss how automation can address the limitations of gene-editing and how the marriage between microfluidics and gene-editing will expand the application space of CRISPR.","Ahmadi, Fatemeh; Quach, Angela B V; Shih, Steve C C",Biomicrofluidics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0029846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262863/,44

Methods We searched five databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Pubmed) from inception to September 2018 and reviewed 19 experimental and non-experimental studies of 21 technology-driven diet plus physical activity interventions for adults (≥18 years) at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Behaviour change techniques were coded using the BCT taxonomy v1, and digital features were identified via thematic analysis of intervention descriptions. Results Sixty-three per cent of interventions were effective in the short term (achieving ≥3% weight loss at ≤6 months), using an average of 5.6 more behaviour change techniques than non-effective interventions, and 33% were effective in the long term (achieving ≥5% weight loss at ≥12 months), using 3.7 more behaviour change techniques than non-effective interventions. The techniques of social support (unspecified), goal setting (outcome/behaviour), feedback on behaviour, and self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour were identified in over 90% of effective interventions. Interventions containing digital features that facilitated health and lifestyle education, behaviour/outcome tracking, and/or online health coaching were most effective. Conclusion The integration of specific behaviour change techniques and digital features may optimise digital diabetes prevention interventions to achieve clinically significant weight loss. Additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms in which behaviour change techniques and digital features directly influence physical activity, dietary behaviours, and intervention engagement.","Van Rhoon, Luke; Byrne, Molly; Morrissey, Eimear; Murphy, Jane; McSharry, Jenny",Digital health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207620914427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269830/,44

OBJECTIVES We aimed to establish a clinically relevant colorectal tumor model with canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) utilizing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging guidance. DESIGN Survival study using a canine model. SETTING Endoscopic animal research laboratory at a tertiary cancer center. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study involved five canines. INTERVENTIONS A colorectal tumor model was established and evaluated in five canines under cyclosporine immune suppression. Under endoscopic imaging guidance, saline was injected into the submucosal layer forming a bleb. Subsequently, CTVT was inoculated into the bleb under EUS guidance. Endoscopy was the primary method of assessing tumor growth. Tumors developed in 60-130 days. Upon detection of lesions >1 cm, the animals were euthanized and the tumors were harvested for histopathological characterization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Success rate of tumor growth. The presence or absence of vasculature inside tumors. RESULTS Colorectal tumor successfully developed in three out of the five animals (60%). Among the ones with tumor growth, average inoculated CTVT volume, incubation time, and tumor size was 1.8 cc, 65.7 days, and 2.0 cm, respectively. The two animals without tumor growth were observed for >100 days. In all the tumors, vascular structure was characterized with CD31 imunohistochemical stain. LIMITATIONS Small number of animals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 disease as a pandemic, affecting the human respiratory and other body systems, which urgently demands for better understanding of COVID-19 histopathogenesis. OBJECTIVE Data on pathological changes in different organs are still scarce, thus we aim to review and summarise the latest histopathological changes in different organs observed after autopsy of COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Over the period of 3 months, authors performed vast review of the articles. The search engines included were PubMed, Medline (EBSCO & Ovid), Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and Bio-Medical. Search terms used were 'Histopathology in COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Pathological changes in different organs in COVID-19' or 'SARS-CoV-2'. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines were used for review writing. RESULT We identified various articles related to the histopathology of various organs in COVID-19 positive patients. Overall, 45 articles were identified as full articles to be included in our study. Histopathological findings observed are summarised according to the systems involved. CONCLUSION Although COVID-19 mainly affects respiratory and immune systems, but other systems like cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, nervous system and integumentary system are not spared, especially in elderly cases and those with comorbidity.

In RFA, ultrasonography (US) is most commonly used to guide tumor puncture, while its effects are assessed using dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance. The differences in modalities used for RFA and assessment of its effects complicate RFA. We developed a method for assessing the effects of RFA on HCC by combining contrast-enhanced (CE) US and real-time virtual sonography with three-dimensional US data. PATIENTS AND METHODS Before RFA, we performed a sweep scan of the target HCC nodule and the surrounding hepatic parenchyma to generate three-dimensional US data. After RFA, we synchronized multi-planar reconstruction images derived from stored three-dimensional US data with real-time US images on the same US monitor and performed CEUS and real-time virtual sonography. Using a marking function, we drew a sphere marker along the target HCC nodule contour on pre-treatment US- multi-planar reconstruction images so that the automatically synchronized sphere marker represented the original HCC nodule contour on post-treatment real-time CEUS images. Ablation was considered sufficient when an avascular area with a margin of several millimeters in all directions surrounded the sphere marker on CEUS. RESULTS This method was feasible and useful for assessing therapeutic effects in 13 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent RFA. In 2 patients who underwent multiple sessions of RFA, HCC-nodule portions requiring additional RFA were easily identified on US images. CONCLUSIONS This method using advanced US technologies will facilitate assessment of the effects of RFA on HCC.","Toshikuni, Nobuyuki; Shiroeda, Hisakazu; Ozaki, Kazuaki; Matsue, Yasuhiro; Minato, Takahiro; Nomura, Tomoe; Hayashi, Nobuhiko; Arisawa, Tomiyasu; Tsutsumi, Mikihiro",Radiology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.2478/raon-2013-0033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24133386/,44

The ideal decellularization technique removes cells and cellular remnants, but leaves the original collagen architecture intact. The tissue utilized in this study was the central tendon of the porcine diaphragm, which had not been previously investigated for soft tissue repair. Several treatments were investigated during this study including peracetic acid, TritonX-100, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and tri(n-butyl) phosphate (TnBP). Of the decellularization treatments investigated, only 1% TnBP was effective in removing cell nuclei while leaving the structure and composition of the tissue intact. Overall, the resulting acellular tissue scaffold retained the ECM composition, strength, resistance to enzymatic degradation, and biocompatibility of the original tissue, making 1% TnBP an acceptable decellularization treatment for porcine diaphragm tendon.","Deeken, C R; White, A K; Bachman, S L; Ramshaw, B J; Cleveland, D S; Loy, T S; Grant, S A","Journal of biomedical materials research.

We investigated the impact of social distancing practiced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on the incidence of selected VPDs in South Korea. METHODS National surveillance data on monthly incidence of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and pertussis were retrieved and compared the VPD incidences in 2020 to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019) of the corresponding months. RESULTS In 2020, there were 44% decline for mumps, 44% decline for varicella, 28% decline for pertussis, 22% decline for IPD, 14% decline in incidence of hepatitis A, and no change for hepatitis B incidences, compared to baseline years (2015-2019). The largest decline of total VPDs were in April (65%) and in May (67%), during the intensified social distancing measures.

Cross-sectional imaging liver volumetry data obtained before and 3-6 weeks after PVE were used to assess the FLR volume (FLRV) increase, degree of FLR hypertrophy and the FLR kinetic growth rate (KGR). Results Twenty-six patients (17 males; mean age, 58.7±11 years; range, 32-79 years) were included. The technical and clinical success rate was 100%. PVE produced adequate FLR hypertrophy in all patients. Embolization occurred in all targeted portal branches and in no non-target vessels. The %FLRV increased by 52.9%±32.5% and the degree of FLR hypertrophy was 16.7%±6.8%. The KGR was 4.4%±2.0% per week. Four patients experience minor complications after PVE which resolved with symptomatic treatment. The resection rate was 84.5%. One patient died during surgery for reasons unrelated to PVE.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of ABS tools on the consistency and reproducibility of the quantified brain volumetry from different scanners. METHODS We included fifteen healthy volunteers who were scanned with 3D isotropic brain T1-weighted sequence on three different 3.0 Tesla MRI scanners (GE, Siemens and Philips). For each individual, the time span between image acquisitions on different scanners was limited to 1 h. All the T1-weighted images were processed with FreeSurfer v6.0, FSL v5.0 and AccuBrain® with default settings to obtain volumetry of brain tissues (e.g. gray matter) and substructures (e.g. basal ganglia structures) if available. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to test inter-scanner variability in brain volumetry of various structures as quantified by these ABS tools. RESULTS The mean inter-scanner CV values per brain structure among three MRI scanners ranged from 6.946 to 12.29% (mean, 9.577%) for FreeSurfer, 7.245 to 20.98% (mean, 12.60%) for FSL and 1.348 to 8.800% (mean value, 3.546%) for AccuBrain®. In addition, AccuBrain® and FreeSurfer achieved the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between GE and Siemens scanners (from 0.818 to 5.958% for AccuBrain®, and from 0.903 to 7.977% for FreeSurfer), while FSL-FIRST had the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between GE and Philips scanners (from 2.603 to 16.310%). AccuBrain® also had the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between Siemens and Philips scanners (from 1.138 to 6.615%).

Softwoods have a significant economic value for timber production and the Pinus genus is widely utilized. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the hemicellulose extraction and lignin recovery from pine (Pinus spp.) residual sawdust (PRS) by sequential acid-alkaline treatment, generating a cellulose-rich solid fraction. The hemicellulose removed was 87.11% (wt·wt-1) after dilute acid treatment at 130 °C, 4.5% (wt·wt-1) of H2SO4 for 20 min at 120 rpm. Three temperatures were evaluated for recovering the lignin and the highest yield, 93.97% (wt·wt-1), was achieved at 170 °C, 10% (wt·wt-1) of NaOH for 90 min at 120 rpm. Lignin was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetry. The resulting cellulose-rich fraction exhibited polymorphic transformation. The results demonstrated that PRS is a promising lignocellulosic residue whose lignin and carbohydrates can be readily obtained.","Cavali, Matheus; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo; Tavares, Débora; Zevallos Torres, Luis Alberto; Oliveira de Andrade Tanobe, Valcineide; Zandoná Filho, Arion; Woiciechowski, Adenise Lorenci",Bioresource technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889386/,44

Online geriatric patient education materials (PEMs) should be written at or below a 6th grade reading level (GRL) that takes into account barriers unique to the geriatric population. The objectives of the study are to assess PEMs of geriatric associations' websites and determine whether they are above the GRL recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health. DESIGN Descriptive and correlational methodology. PEMs from 10 major geriatric associations were assessed for their GRL using 10 scales. Eight of the scales provide a numerical GRL while two of the scales provide a visual representation of the GRLs. Analysis was conducted using Readability Studio 2019.3. SETTING Analysis was conducted February 2020. PARTICIPANTS Identified 10 geriatric associations and 884 PEMs. MEASUREMENTS GRLs were measured by 10 validated readability indices: the Degrees of Reading Power and Grade Equivalent test, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook test, Coleman-Liau Index, Gunning Fog Index, New Fog Count, New Dale-Chall readability formula, Ford, Caylor, Sticht scale, Raygor readability estimate graph, and Fry readability graph. RESULTS The mean of all PEMs using the numerical scales was 11.1 ± 2.4. Ninety-nine percent of PEMs are above the 6th GRL. PEMs ranged from a grade 3.0 to 19.0 reading level. Analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference between associations (P < .0001), and multiple comparison analysis identified the National Institute on Aging as the content easiest to read (9.5 ± 1.6).

This study investigated the trends in cycling-related injuries requiring orthopaedic intervention during the COVID-19 lockdown period compared with similar time periods in 2018 and 2019. METHODS Data were collected prospectively for patients in 2020 and collected retrospectively for 2019 and 2018, from hospitals within four NHS Scotland Health Boards encompassing three major trauma centres. All patients who sustained an injury as a result of cycling requiring orthopaedic intervention were included. Patient age, sex, mechanism of injury, diagnosis and treatment outcome from electronic patient records. RESULTS Number of injuries requiring surgery 2020: 77 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2019: 47 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2018: 32 (mean age/years - 31.3). Overall incidence of cycling injuries 2020: 6.7%; 2019: 3.0%; 2018: 2.1%. Commonest mechanism of injury: fall from bike 2020 n = 54 (70.1%); 2019 n = 41 (65.1%); 2018 n = 25 (67.6%). Commonest injury type: fracture 2020 n = 68 (79.1%); 2019 n = 33 (70.2%); 2018 n = 20 (62.5%). Commonest areas affected: Upper extremity: 2020 n = 45 (58.5%); 2019 n = 25 (53.2%); 2018 n = 25 (78.1%). Lower extremity: 2020 n = 23 (29.9%); 2019 n = 14 (29.7%); 2018 n = 7 (21.8%). CONCLUSION A significant increase in the number of cycling related injuries requiring orthopaedic intervention, a greater proportion of female cyclists and an older mean age of patients affected was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown period compared with previous years.

We first compared the distribution of respiratory viruses in age-stratified patients with FSs with that in other patients. In an embedded case-control study, we compared the febrile response in patients with FSs with that in the controls matched for age, season and the same respiratory virus. RESULTS The relative risk for FS was the highest for coronavirus OC43, 229E, and NL63 infections [RR: 3.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.4-7.2) and influenza A and B [RR: 2.5, 95 % CI: 1.4-4.7] as compared to those with other respiratory viral infections. The patients with FSs had a stronger febrile response of 39.2 °C (difference: 0.8 °C, 95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) later during hospitalization after acute care than the controls matched for the same respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS Influenza and coronaviruses caused relatively more FS-related emergency room visits than other respiratory viruses. Furthermore, the febrile response was stronger in the patients with FSs than in the controls matched for the same respiratory virus. The results suggest that the pathomechanism of FSs includes modifiable pathogen-related and host-related factors with possible potential in the prevention of FSs.","Hautala, Maria; Arvila, Jukka; Pokka, Tytti; Mikkonen, Kirsi; Koskela, Ulla; Helander, Heli; Glumoff, Virpi; Rantala, Heikki; Tapiainen, Terhi",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2020.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285363/,44
70836,"Diclofenac-Based Hydrazones and Spirothiazolidinones: Synthesis, Characterization, and Antimicrobial Properties.",2017,"PURPOSE To describe the combined use of a tubular stent-graft for the ascending aorta and an inner-branched arch stent-graft for patients with acute type A aortic dissection. TECHNIQUE The technique to deploy these modular, custom-made stent-grafts is demonstrated in 2 patients with acute DeBakey type I aortic dissections and significant comorbidities precluding open surgery. Both emergent procedures were made possible by the availability of suitable devices manufactured for elective repair in other patients. After preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass, a long Lunderquist guidewire was introduced from the right femoral artery to the left ventricle for delivery of the Zenith Ascend and Zenith Branched Arch Endovascular Grafts under inflow occlusion. Bridging stent-grafts were delivered to the innominate and left common carotid arteries to connect to the 2 inner branches; the left subclavian artery was occluded. Both cases were technically successful and resulted in exclusion of the false lumen in the ascending aorta. The operating and fluoroscopy times did not exceed those of comparable elective procedures. The patients were rapidly extubated shortly after the procedure and without serious immediate complications. One patient survived 11 months with a satisfactory repair; the other succumbed to complications of recurrent pneumonia after 23 days. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment of patients with acute type A aortic dissection using a combination of tubular and branched stent-grafts in the ascending aorta is feasible and offers an alternative strategy to open surgery.","Kölbel, Tilo; Detter, Christian; Carpenter, Sebastian W; Rohlffs, Fiona; von Kodolitsch, Yskert; Wipper, Sabine; Reichenspurner, Herrmann; Debus, E Sebastian; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602816680089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881689/,44
70907,Combatting the Myth of Neuropathology.,2015,"By the splendid advance in computation power realized with the Fugaku supercomputer, it has become possible to perform ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations for thousands of dynamic structures of protein-ligand complexes in a parallel way. We thus carried out electron-correlated FMO calculations for a complex of the 3C-like (3CL) main protease (Mpro) of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its inhibitor N3 incorporating the structural fluctuations sampled by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in hydrated conditions. Along with a statistical evaluation of the interfragment interaction energies (IFIEs) between the N3 ligand and the surrounding amino-acid residues for 1000 dynamic structure samples, in this study we applied a novel approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to the analysis of IFIE data in order to extract the dynamically cooperative interactions between the ligand and the residues. We found that the relative importance of each residue is modified via the structural fluctuations and that the ligand is bound in the pharmacophore in a dynamic manner through collective interactions formed by multiple residues, thus providing new insight into structure-based drug discovery.","Tanaka, Shigenori; Tokutomi, Shusuke; Hatada, Ryo; Okuwaki, Koji; Akisawa, Kazuki; Fukuzawa, Kaori; Komeiji, Yuto; Okiyama, Yoshio; Mochizuki, Yuji",The journal of physical chemistry.

71279,Excision of Extensive Orbitozygomaticomaxillary Complex Tumors Combining an Intra- and Extraoral Approach With Transpalpebral Orbital Exenteration.,2020,"OBJECTIVE To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. DESIGN A scoping review. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. RESULTS Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). CONCLUSIONS Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

71477,Hydroxide promotes ion pairing in the NaNO2-NaOH-H2O system.,2020-12-11,"Peripheral nerves are exposed to mechanical stress during movement. However the in vivo mechanical properties of nerves remain largely unexplored. The primary aim of this study was to characterize the effect of passive dorsiflexion on sciatic nerve shear wave velocity (an index of stiffness) when the knee was in 90° flexion (knee 90°) or extended (knee 180°). The secondary aim was to determine the effect of five repeated dorsiflexions on the nerve shear wave velocity. Nine healthy participants were tested. The repeatability of sciatic nerve shear wave velocity was good for both knee 90° and knee 180° (ICCs ≥ 0.92, CVs ≤ 8.1%). The shear wave velocity of the sciatic nerve significantly increased (p<0.0001) during dorsiflexion when the knee was extended (knee 180°), but no changes were observed when the knee was flexed (90°). The shear wave velocity-angle relationship displayed a hysteresis for knee 180°. Although there was a tendency for the nerve shear wave velocity to decrease throughout the repetition of the five ankle dorsiflexions, the level of significance was not reached (p=0.055). These results demonstrate that the sciatic nerve stiffness can be non-invasively assessed during passive movements. In addition, the results highlight the importance of considering both the knee and the ankle position for clinical and biomechanical assessment of the sciatic nerve. This non-invasive technique offers new perspectives to provide new insights into nerve mechanics in both healthy and clinical populations (e.g., specific peripheral neuropathies).","Andrade, Ricardo J; Nordez, Antoine; Hug, François; Ates, Filiz; Coppieters, Michel W; Pezarat-Correia, Pedro; Freitas, Sandro R",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.12.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26725218/,44

METHODS A collection of 111 samples [43 QCMD samples, 13 bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and 55 nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs] was tested with Seegene AllplexTM. The clinical samples were tested previously using either FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 21 qPCR assay (Fast Track Diagnostics), an in-house multiplex PCR for Bordetella, or BioGX Sample-ReadyTM Atypical pneumo panel (Becton Dickinson). Samples were stored at -80°C prior to analysis with Seegene Allplex™, nucleic acids were automatically extracted with NucliSENS Easymag (bioMérieux). Samples returning discordant results were subjected to repeat testing and/or additional testing by reference laboratories. RESULTS Seegene correctly identified 41/43 QCMD samples (95.4%); two samples positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus, respectively, were only correctly identified following repeat testing. In the 56 clinical samples, overall, 97 pathogens were identified: 65 pathogens (67.0%) were detected both by routine methods and Seegene, 24 pathogens (24.7%) only by routine methods, and 8 pathogens (8.2%) only by Seegene. The majority of discordant results was detected in samples with low pathogen load (22/32, 68.8%) and in samples containing multiple pathogens (25/32, 78.1%). Full agreement between methods was observed for influenza, RSV, adenovirus, Bordetella (para)pertussis and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Discordance was observed for human metapneumovirus, coronavirus OC43, bocavirus and parainfluenza virus, mainly type 4. CONCLUSION Overall, the Seegene AllplexTM assay performed well for routine detection of important respiratory targets. Acceptable agreement was observed between Seegene and other routine assays.","Vandendriessche, Stien; Padalko, Elizaveta; Wollants, Elke; Verfaillie, Charlotte; Verhasselt, Bruno; Coorevits, Liselotte",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2018.1531605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307378/,44

METHODS The JetStream XC atherectomy device, a rotational cutter with aspiration capacity, was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 29 patients (mean age 69.9 ± 11.7 years; 11 men) with femoropopliteal ISR in 32 limbs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01722877). Lesion length was 17.4 ± 13.1 cm. The primary effectiveness outcome was acute success (≤ 30% residual narrowing with no serious adverse events). The primary safety endpoint was major adverse events. Secondary endpoints included clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 6 months and 1 year and loss of stent integrity as assessed by an angiographic core laboratory. RESULTS Treated length was 19.5 ± 12.9 cm. Acute success was obtained in 29/32 (91%) limbs. Acute device success (<50% residual narrowing after atherectomy alone) was 76% (22/29). Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in all cases at a mean pressure of 11.6 ± 3.3 atm. Embolic filter protection was used in 16 (50%) of 32 limbs. Macrodebris was noted in 2 (12%) of 16 filters. Distal embolization requiring treatment occurred in 3/32 (9.4%) limbs (2 with no filter). Other non-procedure-related adverse events were 1 (3%) death (nonvascular) and 1 (3%) case of major bleeding. There were no new stent fractures or deformities (n=24) postatherectomy. Follow-up was completed on 27 patients (29 limbs) at 6 and 12 months. TLR at these time points occurred in 4/29 (14%) and 12/29 (41%) patients. Patency (duplex-derived peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4) was 72% at 6 months. CONCLUSION JetStream atherectomy using the XC device has favorable acute results in treating femoropopliteal ISR with high procedure success, no device-stent interaction, and favorably low TLR rates. A multicenter trial is needed to confirm these results.","Shammas, Nicolas W; Shammas, Gail A; Banerjee, Subhash; Popma, Jeffrey J; Mohammad, Atif; Jerin, Michael",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602816634028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921281/,44

However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.","Zhuang, G H; Shen, M W; Zeng, L X; Mi, B B; Chen, F Y; Liu, W J; Pei, L L; Qi, X; Li, C",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32133832/,44

They are classified in different families according to structural similarities. Neutral mAPs catalyze the cleavage of neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of proteins or peptide substrates; they need one or two metallic cofactors in their active site. Information about marine invertebrate's neutral mAPs properties is scarce; available data are mainly derived from genomics and cDNA studies. The goal of this work was to characterize the biochemical properties of the neutral APs activities in eight Cuban marine invertebrate species from the Phyla Mollusca, Porifera, Echinodermata, and Cnidaria. Determination of substrate specificity, optimal pH and effects of inhibitors (1,10-phenanthroline, amastatin, and bestatin) and cobalt on activity led to the identification of distinct neutral AP-like activities, whose biochemical behaviors were similar to those of the M1 and M17 families of mAPs. Additionally, M18-like glutamyl AP activities were detected. Thus, marine invertebrates express biochemical activities likely belonging to various families of metallo-aminopeptidases.","Pascual Alonso, Isel; Rivera Méndez, Laura; Valdés-Tresanco, Mario E; Bounaadja, Lotfi; Schmitt, Marjorie; Arrebola Sánchez, Yarini; Alvarez Lajonchere, Luis; Charli, Jean-Louis; Florent, Isabelle","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

73386,Effective population size predicts local rates but not local mitigation of read-through errors in eukaryotic genes.,2020-08-14,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) altered the delivery of outpatient care and expanded the use of telehealth solutions. This research underscores the importance of providing options for accessing health care services and diagnostic testing in a clinically rigorous manner. Providing options for patients will be essential in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, and any concomitant confusion caused by the overlapping symptomology of the flu and other upper respiratory viruses. Methods: A survey was sent to patients to collect information related to their experience with testing, guidance, and consults in a telehealth model for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, patients were asked where they would have sought testing and care had this model not been available, and their satisfaction level with the service itself. Results: More than 1,400 patients responded to the survey for a response rate of 15%. Results demonstrate that patients who underwent testing and received guidance/consults through this model would have visited other in-person clinical environments such as emergency rooms or urgent care centers. Although ∼70% of patients had never used telehealth services before, >90% were highly satisfied with their experience. Conclusion: Many health experts are predicting a second wave for COVID-19 infections around the country. Given the strong overlap of flu and other upper respiratory infections with COVID-19, the winter season could prove challenging both to contain the spread of the virus and to differentiate the cause. This research sheds additional light on the importance of providing patients with viable safe alternatives to obtain diagnostic testing, guidance, and consults.","Weiss, Doria; Crooks, Mekhi; Goorland, Lara; Elwood, Douglas",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237851/,44

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to report the short-term preliminary results of a novel surgical procedure, transverse perineal support, for the correction of pathological perineal descent. DESIGN This was a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a hospital and a university center. PATIENTS Among 25 patients observed with failure of previous surgery for obstructed defecation syndrome, 12 with pathological perineal descent underwent transverse perineal support, were followed-up at 6 months, and constituted the object of analysis. INTERVENTIONS The surgical procedure was performed positioning a porcine dermal implant just above the perineum superficial fascia sutured to the periosteum membrane of ischiatic tuberosities at the insertion of the superficial transverse perineal muscle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures were obstructed defecation syndrome score and x-ray and magnetic resonance defecographic imaging evaluation of perineal descent and anorectal manometric parameters. RESULTS The postoperative median obstructed defecation syndrome score was 7.0 (range, 3-8), showing a statistically significant difference if compared with the preoperative score of 13.5 (range, 9-18; p = 0.0005). The mean postoperative maximum intrarectal pressure was 69.4 ± 11.1 mm Hg, significantly higher than the preoperative pressure of 45.9 ± 12.8 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). At postoperative x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging defecography, the mean fixed and dynamic perineal descents were significantly lower than the preoperative descents (p = 0.02 for fixed perineal descent and p = 0.0004 for dynamic perineal descent). Of the 4 patients (33.3%) with preoperative pathological dynamic perineal descent, only 1 showed a persistent pathological dynamic perineal descent. No early or late complication was observed. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by its small size and short follow-up time. CONCLUSIONS Transverse perineal support appears to be a promising, safe, and effective procedure in the treatment of obstructed defecation syndrome associated with pathological perineal descent (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A225).","Renzi, Adolfo; Brillantino, Antonio; Di Sarno, Giandomenico; d'Aniello, Francesco; Bianco, Pasquale; Iacobellis, Francesca; Reginelli, Alfonso; Grassi, Roberto",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27145314/,44
73787,A novel fixation procedure to eliminate covered self-expanding metal stent migration.,2012,"PURPOSE Rapid onset of severe hypertriglyceridemia was quickly recognized in critical COVID-19 patients. Associated causes have been due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis (HLH) syndrome, medication-induced, or acute liver failure. Statins, omega-3 polyunsaturated acids, niacin, and fibrates are common oral lipid lowering therapy options in patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia. The severity of hypertriglyceridemia in COVID-19 patients with triglyceride values reaching greater than 1,000 mg/dL put them at a heightened risk of pancreatitis and therefore an essential need to acutely lower their levels. We present a case series of 5 patients who achieved rapid triglyceride lowering through continuous insulin infusion therapy. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 48 critical COVID-19 patients who were admitted from March 22 to April 15, 2020 was conducted. Inclusion criteria consisted of mechanical ventilation and continuous insulin infusion to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting with 5 eligible patients in this case report. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION In addition to standard oral lipid lowering therapies, continuous insulin infusion successfully treated severe hypertriglyceridemia in critically ill COVID-19 patients. None of the patients experienced pancreatitis or hypoglycemia necessitating cessation of insulin. Further studies are needed to show the optimum dose and duration of insulin infusion as monotherapy and in combination with oral therapies.","Thomas, Caitlin M; Vicent, Martie; Moore, Shawn; Ali, Fahd; Wooten, Leslie; Louzon, Patricia R",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211010473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882724/,44

Through positional cloning of the previously described quantitative trait locus (QTL) Rf1 in congenic and advanced intercrossed rats, we identified the Ig lambda light chain locus as a locus that regulates the production of RF in rats. The congenic rats produce RF-Ig lambda and have significant higher levels of RF-IgG and RF-IgM in serum, while the DA rat has an impaired RF production and does not produces RF-Ig lambda. Thus, we could investigate the role of RF in pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) as well as ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation. We show that there was no difference in the development and severity of PIA between congenic and parental DA rats, suggesting that RF using lambda light chains have no impact on PIA. However, the RF producing congenic rats developed a more severe airway inflammation as indicated in the significantly increased number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as total IgE in serum. In addition, RF congenic rats had a significantly enhanced immune response toward OVA due to increased OVA-Igk but not OVA-Igl antibodies, suggesting a possible involvement of RF in the regulation of the humoral immune response.","Rintisch, Carola; Ameri, Jacqueline; Olofsson, Peter; Luthman, Holger; Holmdahl, Rikard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0803956105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18779593/,44

The development of this science depends on whether the public accept its application; therefore, predicting their intention to adopt it is important for its successful implementation. OBJECTIVE This study aims to analyse Malaysian stakeholders' intentions to adopt nutrigenomics, and determines the factors that influence their intentions. METHODS A survey was conducted based on the responses of 421 adults (aged 18 years and older) and comprising two stakeholder groups: healthcare providers (n = 221) and patients (n = 200) who were located in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The SPSS software was used to analyse the descriptive statistics of intention to adopt nutrigenomics and the SmartPLS software was used to determine the predicting factors affecting their decisions to adopt nutrigenomics. RESULTS The results show that the stakeholders perceived the benefits of nutrigenomics as outweighing its risks, suggesting that the perceived benefits represent the most important direct predictor of the intention to adopt nutrigenomics. The perceived risks of nutrigenomics, trust in key players, engagement with medical genetics and religiosity also predict the intention to adopt nutrigenomics. Additionally, the perceived benefits of nutrigenomics served as a mediator for four factors: perceived risks of nutrigenomics, engagement with medical genetics, trust in key players and religiosity, whilst the perceived risks were a mediator for engagement with medical genetics. CONCLUSION The findings of this study suggest that the intentions of Malaysian stakeholders to adopt nutrigenomics are a complex decision-making process where all the previously mentioned factors interact. Although the results showed that the stakeholders in Malaysia were highly positive towards nutrigenomics, they were also cautious about adopting it.","Mustapa, Muhammad Adzran Che; Amin, Latifah; Frewer, Lynn J",Genes & nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-020-00676-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962632/,44

Waterborne pathogens were detected in 96% of samples collected at three Lake Michigan beaches in summer, 2010. Samples were quantified for 22 pathogens in four microbial categories (human viruses, bovine viruses, protozoa, and pathogenic bacteria). All beaches had detections of human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria indicating influence of multiple contamination sources at these beaches. Occurrence ranged from 40 to 87% for human viruses, 65-87% for pathogenic bacteria, and 13-35% for bovine viruses. Enterovirus, adenovirus A, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, bovine polyomavirus, and bovine rotavirus A were present most frequently. Variables selected in multiple regression models used to explore environmental factors that influence pathogens included wave direction, cloud cover, currents, and water temperature. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment was done for C. jejuni, Salmonella spp., and enteroviruses to estimate risk of infection and illness. Median infection risks for one-time swimming events were approximately 2 × 10(-5), 8 × 10(-6), and 3 × 10(-7) [corrected] for C. jejuni, Salmonella spp., and enteroviruses, respectively. Results highlight the importance of investigating multiple pathogens within multiple categories to avoid underestimating the prevalence and risk of waterborne pathogens.","Corsi, Steven R; Borchardt, Mark A; Carvin, Rebecca B; Burch, Tucker R; Spencer, Susan K; Lutz, Michelle A; McDermott, Colleen M; Busse, Kimberly M; Kleinheinz, Gregory T; Feng, Xiaoping; Zhu, Jun",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b04372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26720156/,44

75076,Peptide and protein nanoparticle conjugates: versatile platforms for biomedical applications.,2018,"Treatment options for hydrocephalus include endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Some ambiguity remains regarding indications, safety, and efficacy for these procedures in different clinical scenarios. The objective of the present study was to pool the available evidence to compare outcomes among patients with hydrocephalus undergoing ETV versus VPS. A systematic search of the literature was conducted via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through 11/29/2018 to identify studies evaluating failure and complication rates, following ETV or VPS. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random effects. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochrane Q test and the I2 value. Heterogeneity sources were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Twenty-three studies (five randomized control trials (RCTs) and 18 observational studies) were meta-analyzed. Comparing ETV to VPS, failure rate was not statistically significantly different with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.48, 95%CI (0.85, 2.59) for RCTs and 1.17 (0.89, 1.53) for cohort studies; P-interaction: 0.44. Complication rates were not statistically significantly different between ETV and VPS in RCTs (RR: 1.34, 95%CI: 0.50, 3.59) but were statistically significant for prospective cohort studies (RR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.78); P-interaction: 0.07. Length of hospital stay was no different, when comparing ETV and VPS. These results remained unchanged when stratifying by intervention type and when regressing on age when possible. No significant differences in failure rate were observed between ETV and VPS. ETV was found to have lower complication rates than VPS in prospective cohort studies but not in RCTs. Further research is needed to identify the specific patient populations who may be better suited for one intervention versus another.","Pande, Apurva; Lamba, Nayan; Mammi, Marco; Gebrehiwet, Paulos; Trenary, Alyssa; Doucette, Joanne; Papatheodorou, Stefania; Bunevicius, Adomas; Smith, Timothy R; Mekary, Rania A",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-020-01320-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32476100/,44
75691,Evolution of behavioural resistance in host-pathogen systems.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but potentially fatal disorder caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency. Prompt identification/exclusion of TTP can thus be facilitated by rapid ADAMTS13 testing. The most commonly utilised (ELISA-based) assay takes several hours to perform and so does not generally permit rapid testing. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the utility of a new automated test for ADAMTS13 activity, the HemosIL AcuStar ADAMTS13 Activity assay, based on chemiluminescence and able to be performed on an ACL AcuStar instrument within 33 minutes. PATIENTS/METHODS This multicentre (n=8) assessment included testing of over 700 test samples, with similar numbers of prospective (n=348) and retrospective (n=385) samples. The main comparator was the Technozym ADAMTS13 Activity ELISA. We also assessed comparative performance for detection of ADAMTS13 inhibitors using a Bethesda assay. RESULTS Overall, the chemiluminescent assay yielded similar results to the comparator ELISA, albeit with slight negative bias. ADAMTS13 inhibitor detection was also comparable, albeit with slight positive bias with the AcuStar assay. Assay precision was similar with both assays, and we also verified assay normal reference ranges. CONCLUSIONS The HemosIL AcuStar ADAMTS13 Activity assay provided results rapidly, which were largely comparable with the Technozym ADAMTS13 Activity ELISA assay, albeit lower on average. Conversely, inhibitor levels tended to be identified at a higher level on average. Thus, the HemosIL AcuStar ADAMTS13 Activity assay provides a fast and accurate means to quantitate plasma levels of ADAMTS13 for TTP/ADAMTS13 identification/exclusion, and potentially also for other applications.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Mohammed, Soma; Chapman, Kent; Swanepoel, Priscilla; Zebeljan, Diane; Sefhore, Opelo; Malan, Erica; Clifford, Joanne; Yuen, Agnes; Donikian, Dea; Kondo, Mayuko; Duncan, Elizabeth; Abraham, Sunil; Beggs, Joanne; Chatrapati, Ritesh; Perel, Joanne; Coleman, Robyn; Klose, Nathan; Hsu, Danny; Motum, Penelope; Wee Tan, Chee; Brighton, Timothy; Pasalic, Leonardo",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124748/,44

However, in clinical practice, lack of training in or nonadherence to measurement recommendations, lack of patient preparation, unsuitable environments where blood pressure is measured, and inaccurate and inappropriate equipment are widespread and commonly lead to inaccurate blood pressure readings. This has led to calls to require regular training and certification for people assessing blood pressure. Hence, the Pan American Health Organization in collaboration with Resolve to Save Lives, the World Hypertension League, Lancet Commission on Hypertension Group, and Hypertension Canada has developed a free brief training and certification course in blood pressure measurement. The course is available at www. The release of the online certification course is timed to help support World Hypertension Day. This year World Hypertension Day has been delayed to October 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In mice, infection with Toxoplasma gondii leads to a Th1-polarized parasite-specific effector T cell response in the brain. Similarly, Tregs in the CNS during T. gondii infection are Th1 polarized, as exemplified by their T-bet, CXCR3, and IFN-γ expression. Unlike effector CD4+ T cells, an MHC class II tetramer reagent specific for T. gondii did not recognize Tregs isolated from the CNS. Likewise, TCR sequencing revealed minimal overlap in TCR sequence between effector T cells and Tregs in the CNS. Whereas effector T cells are found in the brain parenchyma where parasites are present, Tregs were restricted to the meninges and perivascular spaces. The use of intravital imaging revealed that activated CD4+ T cells within the meninges were highly migratory, whereas Tregs moved more slowly and were found in close association with CD11c+ cells. To test whether the behavior of Tregs in the meninges is influenced by interactions with CD11c+ cells, mice were treated with anti-LFA-1 Abs to reduce the number of CD11c+ cells in this space. The anti-LFA-1 treatment led to fewer contacts between Tregs and the remaining CD11c+ cells and increased the speed of Treg migration. These data suggest that Tregs are anatomically restricted within the CNS, and their interaction with CD11c+ populations regulates their local behavior during T. gondii infection.","O'Brien, Carleigh A; Overall, Christopher; Konradt, Christoph; O'Hara Hall, Aisling C; Hayes, Nikolas W; Wagage, Sagie; John, Beena; Christian, David A; Hunter, Christopher A; Harris, Tajie H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1601581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389591/,44

BACKGROUND Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is one of the major causes of viral respiratory infections and can affect people at any age, especially infants and young children. METHODS Four sets of specific primers targeting conserved areas of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of HPIV1-4, were designed and tested with type-related plasmid controls. Specificity and sensitivity of mPCR were tested. One-step mRT-PCR was set up using a viral panel containing 10 respiratory viruses, including HPIVs. One hundred nasopharyngeal samples of respiratory infection patients were tested using the set One-step mRT-PCR. RESULTS The specificity of set mPCR for HPIV1-4 using plasmid positive controls was proved and reaction sensitivity was measured. The specificity of set mRT-PCR was confirmed and 4 and 5 out of 100 clinical samples were HPIV1 and HPIV2 positive, respectively. CONCLUSION The developed one-step mRT-PCR in this study is an effective and specific assay for clinical diagnosis of HPIV1 to 4 (Tab. 1, Fig. 6, Ref. 28).","GhelichKhan, M; Hosseini, S M; Khansarinejad, B; Fotouhi, F",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2017_145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29322811/,44

80096,Apocalypse now?,2012,"Cutaneous thermal injury caused by direct contact with objects heated solely by sun exposure is rare. We undertook to investigate factors that may influence the temperature of sun-exposed objects at the ground level. Two clinical cases of burns caused by contact with sun-exposed objects are described. Surface temperatures on a citywide scale were determined from satellite thermal images. Ground level surface temperatures of a variety of objects were measured using an infrared thermometer. The satellite thermal image demonstrated local surface temperature differences (of more than 10.6 degrees C variation) and the temperature at the places of study (8.5-9.5 degrees C above background). Infrared thermometer readings demonstrated that the surface temperature of a sun-exposed black car could be as high as 75.0 degrees C (range, 71-78 degrees C) compared with 44.6 degrees C (42.2-47.3 degrees C) for a white car, and shading significantly reduced the surface temperatures of exposed objects (10.4-48.1%). The risk of injury is related to the effects of city planning on urban temperatures, of material color, composition, and shade on the ground level temperatures, and to the rise in global temperatures because of greenhouse-induced warming. The combined effect means that in a modern subtropical city such as Hong Kong, a substantial percentage of the urban area may have summertime surface temperatures that are high enough to constitute a health hazard. We recommend that this potential cause of harm to health be taken into account during urban planning.","Chiu, Tor; Wong, Pauline; Lam, Stephanie; Burd, Andrew; Nichol, Janet",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0b013e3181ac0282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506490/,44

The aim was to investigate perceived stress, depression, perceived social support, habits, and behavior changes in pwMS through COVID19 in comparison to control people. METHODS A web-based survey was posted on SMsocialnetwork.com to investigate perceived stress (using Perceived Stress Scale), depression (with PHQ-2), and perceived social support (using Social Provision Scale-10 item) in pwMS and control group through COVID 19 pandemic. A secondary group of people with migraine has been investigated. RESULTS 1286 answers from 612 pwMS and 674 control people were included in the final analysis. The answers from 318 people with migraine have been included for a secondary analysis. A higher proportion of pwMS were depressed (43.1% vs 23.1%; p<0.001), had high level of perceived stress (58% vs 39.8%; p<0.001) and felt significantly less social support (median 33 vs 35; Q1-Q3 28-36 vs 32-37; p<0.001).) compared to the control group. A higher percentage of people with migraine were depressed (50% vs 43%, p=0.04) compared to pwMS.

This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: (1) Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatment; (2) Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illness; (3) Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals. In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy. We believe that this triage system could be applied in other surgical oncology fields during a pandemic.","Olshinka, N; Mottard, S",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.6907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704139/,44

We aimed to study the potential role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted an observational, prospective pilot study, including consecutive subjects admitted to an intermediate care unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS is a 12-zone examination method for lung parenchyma assessment. LUS was performed with a portable convex transducer, scores from 0 to 36 points. Clinical and demographic data were collected at LUS evaluation. Survival analysis was performed using a composite outcome including ICU admission or death. Subjects were followed for 30 d from LUS assessment. RESULTS Of 36 subjects included, 69.4% were male, and mean age was 60.19 ± 12.75 y. A cutoff LUS ≥ 24 points showed 100% sensitivity, 69.2% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for predicting worse prognosis. The composite outcome was present in 10 subjects (55.6%) with LUS ≥ 24 points, but not in the group with lower LUS scores (P < .001). Subjects with LUS ≥ 24 points had a higher risk of ICU admission or death (hazard ratio 9.97 [95% CI 2.75-36.14], P < .001). Significant correlations were observed between LUS and SpO2 /FIO2 , serum D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS LUS ≥ 24 points can help identify patients with COVID-19 who are likely to require ICU admission or to die during follow-up.

This study estimated and compared COPD mortality and hospital morbidity rates and trends in these rates over time across countries and regions of Asia-Pacific. METHODS Data consistent with standard definitions of COPD (ICD-9/ICD-10) for the period 1991-2004 were obtained from national health statistics agencies. For countries/regions with complete national mortality and hospitalization data (Australia, Pacific Canada (British Columbia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan), annual age-standardized mortality and hospitalization rates were calculated for men and women aged >or= 40 years. Negative binomial regression modelling was used to estimate rate ratios for country/region, gender and age differences and general trends over time. RESULTS Mortality rates per 10,000 population ranged 6.4-9.2 in men, 2.1-3.5 in women and 3.7-5.3 overall in 2003. Corresponding ranges for morbidity were 32.6-334.7, 21.2-129 and 28.1-207.3 per 10 000. Trend analysis of data since 1997 produced annual percentage changes in mortality versus hospitalization of -4.4% versus -0.7% in Australia, -3.6% versus 7.5% in Pacific Canada (British Columbia), -7.15% versus -5.6% in Hong Kong and -2.9% versus -4.2% in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS In Asia-Pacific, overall mortality and morbidity rates are high and trends in mortality and morbidity vary between countries/regions.

83534,Fibrocollagen-covered prosthesis for a noncircumferential segmental tracheal replacement.,2010,"BACKGROUND Trocar entry points have been identified as a significant source of pain after laparoscopic surgery. This is particularly true of the larger 12-mm ports that require deep fascial closure to avoid port-site herniation. We investigated whether using radially expanding trocars not requiring fascial closure compared to conventional cutting trocars for the 12-mm port in transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repairs had any effect on postoperative analgesic requirements and return to work or normal activity. METHODS The number of days analgesia was required postoperatively and the number of days taken to return to normal activity was recorded for 143 consecutive patients who underwent TAPP hernia repair by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Exactly the same operative technique was used in these patients with the exception of the 12-mm port site entry. In group 1 (104 patients), a conventional cutting trocar was used requiring deep fascial closure. In group 2 (39 patients), a radially expanding trocar was used and the fascial defect was not closed. RESULTS Analgesia was required for an average of 10.5 days in group 1 and 2.4 days in group 2 (P < 0.001). The average time to return to work or to normal activity was 23.4 days in group 1 and 15.6 days in group 2 (P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the patients' age, sex, or operating time. CONCLUSION Using the laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair as a standardised operation, changing from 12-mm fascial port closure to a technique that uses port dilation (not requiring a potentially ""tight"" deeper fascial closure) in a similar group of patients shows that there is a significant reduction in postoperative analgesic requirement and an earlier return to productive work or normal lifestyle. Perhaps dilating ports should replace those larger 10-, 12-, and 15-mm ports that require deeper sutures in all laparoscopic surgical operations.","Mordecai, Simon C; Warren, Oliver W N; Warren, Stephen J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1963-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993944/,44
83870,Quantitative characterization of extracellular vesicle uptake and content delivery within mammalian cells.,2021-03-25,"PURPOSE With a shift to single-use products in interventional radiology (IR) centres for sterility and cost reasons, it is prudent to consider the burden of packaging and employ efforts to assess and reduce waste, as well as promote recycling wherever possible. This study aimed to quantify the amount of waste in IR packaging and what proportion is recyclable. MATERIALS AND METHODS A range of IR products were weighed using mass scales. Products were assessed for total weight, overall waste, and potentially recyclable waste. Waste was defined as any packaging which was not considered vital to the product to perform its duty and thus was for packaging or shipping purposes. Products were pooled into one of the following categories: catheters and sheaths, wires, needles, devices, coils, and packs/ancillary. RESULTS Seventy-two different products were collected from 26 manufacturers to represent a range of items. The weight of all products was 12,466 g (median 51, range 2-1600), and weight of waste was 6830.7 g (median 34, range 1.1-732). The weight of recyclable waste was 5202.2 g (median 11.5, range 0-701). There were median 2 waste packages per item (range 1-5). The proportion of waste of the overall weight was 54.8% and of this, 76% of all waste was potentially recyclable. CONCLUSION There is a significant burden of waste in manufactured IR products, and while a high proportion is recyclable, we encourage manufacturers of IR products and devices to consider alternative means of transport and packaging of products which will reduce the overall waste burden.

84238,Cyclophilin A inhibits RSV replication by binding to RSV-N through its PPIase activity.,2021-05-19,"Pollution with microplastics has become an environmental concern worldwide. Yet, little information is available on the distribution of microplastics in lakes. Lake Ziway is one of the largest lakes in Ethiopia and is known for its fishing and drinking water supply. This study aims to examine the distribution of plastic particles, of all sizes (micro- and small macro-plastics) in four of the major fish species of the lake and in its shoreline sediment. The gastrointestinal tracts analysis showed that 35% of the sampled fishes ingested plastic particles. The median number of particles per fish was 4 (range 1-26). Benthic (Clarias gariepinus) and benthopelagic (Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius) fish species were found to contain a significantly higher number of plastic particles in comparison to the planktivorous fish species (Oreochromis niloticus). More fishes ingested plastic particles in the wet compared to the dry season. The maximum plastic size (40 mm fibre) was found in C. carpio. Estimated median mass of plastic particles in fish was 0.07 (0.0002-385.2) mg/kg_ww. Fish and sediment samples close to known potential sources of plastic particles had a higher plastic ingestion frequency (52% of the fish) and higher plastic concentration compared to the other parts of the lake. The median count and mass of plastic particles measured in sediment of the lake were 30,000 (400-124,000) particles/m3 and 764 (0.05-36,233) mg/kg_dw, respectively, the upper limits of which exceed known effect thresholds. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that polypropylene, polyethylene and alkyd-varnish were the dominant polymers in fishes and in sediment. The plastic particles size distributions were Log-linear and were identical for plastic particles found in fish and in sediment, suggesting strong benthic-pelagic coupling of plastic particles transfer.","Merga, Lemessa B; Redondo-Hasselerharm, Paula E; Van den Brink, Paul J; Koelmans, Albert A",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886999/,44
84433,Bi-phasic dose response in the preclinical and clinical developments of sigma-1 receptor ligands for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.,2020-10-17,"INTRODUCTION There is still controversy regarding the ideal technique to close the appendicular stump in laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficiency of the use of an endoloop (EL) and endostapler (ES) in complicated and uncomplicated acute appendicitis. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing LA from February 2013 to December 2019. Acute uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were analysed separately, establishing two groups according to the stump closure technique: EL or ES. Seven hundred-nine patients were included (535 uncomplicated and 174 complicated). In uncomplicated appendicitis, an EL was used in 447 of the patients (83.55%) and an ES was used in 88 patients (16.45%). In complicated appendicitis, an EL was used in 85 patients (48.85%) and an ES was used in 89 patients (51.15%). An analysis of effectiveness and a cost analysis of each technique were performed. RESULTS In uncomplicated appendicitis, we found no differences with respect to global complications, although there were significant differences in the total mean hospital stay (EL group 1.55 (SD 1.48) days; ES group 2.21 (SD 1.69) days; p = 0.046). This meant a savings of 514.12€ per patient using the EL p < 0.001). In complicated appendicitis, the reoperations classified as Clavien-Dindo IIIB in the EL group (6.4%) were greater than in the ES group (0%) (p = 0.012), although the rate of postoperative abscesses (p = 0.788) and the mean volume of abscesses (p = 0.891) were similar. CONCLUSION The systematic use of an EL could reduce costs in uncomplicated appendicitis, while in complicated cases, both options are valid. Prospective studies with a greater number of patients are needed to observe differences in postoperative complications.","Durán Muñoz-Cruzado, Virginia; Anguiano-Diaz, Gregorio; Tallón Aguilar, Luis; Tinoco González, José; Sánchez Arteaga, Alejandro; Aparicio Sánchez, Daniel; Pareja Ciuró, Felipe; Padillo Ruiz, Javier",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-02050-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409584/,44
84616,Nidovirus-Associated Proliferative Pneumonia in the Green Tree Python (Morelia viridis).,2017,"This research encompasses a systematic scoping review of literature and research pertaining to the open studio approach to art therapy, which originated with the work of artists in psychiatric hospitals in the 1940's. As art therapy became a profession, it sought recognition by adopting theories from other therapeutic disciplines. Today, however, there is an increase in the prevalence of studio practice that emphasizes art as the core of the therapeutic work; moreover, contemporary art therapy approaches even venture beyond the traditional definition of the profession to the realm of social action. Consequently, open studio practice has become more widespread and is currently implemented in many different contexts among a wide range of populations. The purpose of this research was to accurately map out world literature and research on the open studio approach to art therapy as well as identify relevant publications and main themes. Therefore, the systematic scoping review was not restricted to specific periods, languages, settings, or populations. Publications were identified through a rigorous, replicable, and extensive search of international literature in data bases and hand searches in art therapy journals; in addition, special efforts were made to locate unpublished research and literature. Data was charted using a tool developed by the researchers, based on the review questions. Results indicate that most of the literature relating to the open studio approach dates from the 1990's: only a few earlier publications were found. Over the last decade, the literature has grown in volume in comparison to previous decades, reflecting an increasing prevalence of the open studio approach. This growing mass of publications reflects an historic development in the field of art therapy. This research also identifies core principles as well as a wide range of variations on the open studio model, in addition to unique characteristics that vary according to context and therapeutic approach. It explores open studio practice within different settings and populations and pinpoints gaps of knowledge that can indicate the need for further research.","Finkel, Daniela; Bat Or, Michal",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192852/,44

The conventional answer, repeated on the heels of the SARS epidemic, is that they do. In this paper, I argue that the arguments in support of such a duty are wanting in significant respects, and that the language of duty is simply not adequate to an understanding of all the moral dimensions of professional responses to the care of risky patients. Instead, we should speak the language of virtues and ideals if we want to do justice to the complexity of such harrowing circumstances.","Tomlinson, T",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.022038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511620/,44

Transanal mesorectal excision was introduced as a complement to conventional surgery to overcome its technical difficulties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early surgical results following the introduction of this novel technique at our Unit. Between January and May 2016, 12 patients diagnosed with mid-low rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled into this study and evaluated with regards demography, histopathology, peri-operative data and postoperative complications. The tumor was located in the middle rectum in 6 patients (50%), in the lower rectum in 6 patients (50%). Mean operative time was 356.5 ± 76.2 min (range 240-494). Eleven out 12 patients (91.6%) had less than 200 mL of intraoperative blood loss. Mean hospital stay was 10.9 ± 4.6 days (range 5-19). No mortality was recorded. Intraoperative complications were recorded in 1, while early post-operative complications (< 30 days) were observed in 5 patients (41.6%). Histopathology showed in all cases an intact mesorectum. Mean number of lymphnodes harvested was 13.6 ± 6.6 (range 4-29). Distal and circumferential margin was, respectively, of 20.8 ± 14.2 mm (range 2-45 mm) and 16.1 ± 7.6 mm (range 3-30 mm). The comparative analysis showed significant differences concerning mean operative time (p = 0.0473) and estimated blood loss (p = 0.0367). This study confirms this technique is safe and feasible, but more evidence to support its use over conventional laparoscopic surgery is needed.","De Rosa, Michele; Rondelli, Fabio; Boni, Marcello; Ermili, Fabio; Bugiantella, Walter; Mariani, Lorenzo; Ceccarelli, Graziano; Giuliani, Antonio",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-018-0602-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30406934/,44

86341,Molecular basis for substrate recognition and catalysis by a marine bacterial laminarinase.,2020-09-11,"Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (A2ALDLT) is an accepted mode of treatment for end-stage liver disease. Right-lobe grafts have usually been preferred in view of the higher graft volume, which lowers the risk of a small-for-size syndrome. However, donor left hepatectomy is associated with less morbidity than when it is compared to right hepatectomy. Laparoscopic donor hepatectomy (LDH) has been considered almost exclusively in pediatric transplantation. The results of laparoscopic left-liver graft procurement for calculated small-for-size A2ALDLT in four donors are presented. The graft-to-recipient body weight ratio was <0.8 in all recipients. The mean portal vein flow and the pressure and hepatic artery flows were measured at 190 ± 56 mL/min/100 g, 13 ± 1.4 mm/Hg and 109 ± 19 mL/min, respectively. No early postoperative donor complications were recorded. One graft was lost due to intrahepatic abscesses. Asymptomatic stenosis of a right posterior duct was treated with a Roux-en-Y loop 4 months later in one donor. We show that LDH of the full-left lobe is feasible. LDH is a very demanding operation, potentially decreasing donor morbidity. Standardization of this procedure, making it accessible to the growing number of experienced laparoscopic liver surgeons, could help renewing the interest for A2ALDLT in the Western world.","Troisi, R I; Wojcicki, M; Tomassini, F; Houtmeyers, P; Vanlander, A; Berrevoet, F; Smeets, P; Van Vlierberghe, H; Rogiers, X",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.12362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914734/,44

We aimed to evaluate whether home-based infliximab infusions could offer a useful and safe alternative for the management of CD patients. METHODS Adult CD patients receiving infliximab maintenance treatment at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam were invited to receive their infusions at home for the duration of 1 year. Patients had to be in clinical remission and should have had no adverse events during previous infusions. Patient satisfaction and experience were studied. Costs were analyzed and compared with hospital-based infliximab infusions. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients were invited, of whom 13 (45%) wanted to participate. Of the participants, 54% were female, and the median age was 33 years. In total, 59 infliximab infusions were administered at home at a median dose of 360 mg. The median rating of patient satisfaction was 8 on a scale from 1 to 10 for both home and hospital treatment settings. An important observation was that patients' willingness to participate would have been 70% if the possibility of receiving infusions at home outside office hours had been offered. Costs of infliximab infusions at home were €229 per infusion compared with €284 at the infusion clinic (excluding drug costs). CONCLUSION Home-based infliximab infusions were associated with a cost saving of €55 per infusion. Most participants were satisfied and would recommend home-based infusions to others. Infliximab treatment at home might be recommended as routine care for CD patients.","Kuin, Sabine; Stolte, Suzan B; van den Brink, Gijs R; Ponsioen, Cyriel Y; Fockens, Paul; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000000530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26566062/,44

Indications include refractory Cushing's disease (CD) following failed pituitary surgery, and occult or unresectable ectopic ACTH-producing neoplasms (EA). METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective review (1995-2017) of patients undergoing BA for CD or EA. Demographics, laboratory findings, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were analyzed. RESULTS Of 137 patients, 83 (61%) had CD and 54 (39%) had EA; 87% of CD patients were female versus 46% of EA patients (p < 0.0001). Mean age at diagnosis was 40 ± 15 years for CD and 49 ± 18 years for EA (p = 0.004). Preoperative serum cortisol concentrations were higher in the EA cohort (63 ± 40 μg/dL) versus the CD cohort (33 ± 19 μg/dL) [p < 0.001], with no significant differences in serum ACTH. Time from diagnosis until adrenalectomy was 54 ± 69 months for CD versus 4 ± 13 for EA (p = 0.002). Most patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS; 86% CD vs. 75% EA; p = 0.19). There was no difference between the rates of conversion to an open approach, intraoperative blood loss, or operative time between groups, and no difference between complications in CD versus EA (p = 1.0). Five-year survival was significantly shorter among the EA cohort (30% for EA vs. 80% for CD; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Patients with EA presented with higher serum cortisol levels compared with patients with CD. EA patients were more likely to require intraoperative transfusion and postoperative intensive care. BA in patients with CD and EA can be performed safely in an MIS fashion, with similar morbidity; however, survival at 5 years was significantly less in the EA cohort.","Szabo Yamashita, Thomas; Sada, Alaa; Bancos, Irina; Young, William F; Dy, Benzon M; Farley, David R; Lyden, Melanie L; Thompson, Geoffrey B; McKenzie, Travis J",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08451-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388739/,44

For this reason the compression anastomosis (NiTi) system was developed, with the aim of reducing these complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted, from 1 June 2012 to 30 August 2014, on total of 14 patients operated on the Humanitas Hospital Medical Group Coyoacán, the ASMED, and Clínica Médica Sur. The subjects were predominantly male 65%, a mean age of 58 years, with range 30-79 years. RESULTS A total of 14 patients were included. The indication for surgery was complicated diverticular disease Hinchey II-III (36%), and the procedures performed were: 6 (43%) left hemicolectomy with primary end to end compression anastomosis, 2 (14%) major complications (dehiscence wall and anastomosis), 1 (7%) minor complication (infection of the soft tissues). There was a mean 98ml (range 20-300ml) of intraoperative bleeding, with start of oral feeding on the second day, a mean hospital stay of 4 days (range 2-10), one patient with ileo-rectal anastomosis dehiscence presented on the 4th post-operative day, and performing anastomosis with stapling device and loop ileostomy. Stenosis developed in 7% during follow-up and was resolved with a new anastomosis stapler. CONCLUSIONS The NiTi device is an additional alternative for colorectal anastomosis, mainly in low anastomosis, obtaining good results in this study without major complications.","González-Contreras, Quintín Héctor; de Jesús-Mosso, Mónica; Bahena-Aponte, Jesús Alberto; Aldana-Martínez, Omar; Pineda-Solís, Karen; Mejia-Arcadia, Sari Narsil",Cirugia y cirujanos,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.circir.2016.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036672/,44

The objective of this article was to evaluate if non-surgical or surgical interventions are best for acute management of ocular and/or peri-ocular burns. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis compared 272 surgical to 535 non-surgical interventions within 1 month of patients suffering burn-related injuries to 465 eyes, 253 eyelids, 90 eyelashes, and 0 eyebrows and evaluated associated outcomes and complications. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically and independently searched. Patient and clinical characteristics, surgical and medical interventions, outcomes, and complications were recorded. Results Eight of the 14,927 studies queried for this study were eligible for the systematic review and meta-analysis, with results from 33 of the possible 58 outcomes and complications using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines. Surgery was associated with standard mean differences (SMD) 0.44 greater visual acuity on follow-up, SMD 1.63 mm shorter epithelial defect diameters on follow-up, SMD 1.55 mm greater changes in epithelial diameters from baseline, SMD 1.17 mm2 smaller epithelial defect areas on follow-up, SMD 1.37 mm2 greater changes in epithelial defect areas from baseline, risk ratios (RR) 1.22 greater numbers of healed epithelial defects, RR 11.17 more keratitis infections, and a 2.2 greater reduction in limbal ischemia compared to no surgical intervention. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis found that compared to non-surgical interventions, acute surgical interventions for ocular, eyelid, and/or eyelash burns were found to have greater visual acuity on follow-up, shorter epithelial defect diameters on follow-up, greater changes in epithelial diameters from baseline, smaller epithelial defect areas on follow-up, greater changes in epithelial defect areas from baseline, greater numbers of healed epithelial defects, more keratitis infections, and a greater reduction in limbal ischemia, possibility preventing the need of a future limbal stem cell transplantation.","Klifto, Kevin M; Elhelali, Ala; Gurno, Caresse F; Seal, Stella M; Asif, Mohammed; Hultman, C Scott",Burns & trauma,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41038-019-0161-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497611/,44

We demonstrate here that HCV infection induces autophagy, as judged by accumulation of lipidated LC3-II, and that this induction occurs rapidly after infection, preceding the stimulation of the UPR, which occurs only at later stages, after the viral envelope glycoproteins have been expressed to high levels. Furthermore, both genotype 1b and 2a subgenomic replicons expressing nonstructural (NS3-5B) proteins and JFH-1 virus lacking the envelope glycoproteins potently induced autophagy in the absence of detectable UPR. This ability was also shared by a subgenomic replicon derived from the related GB virus B (GBV-B). We also show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of the key UPR inducer, Ire1, has no effect on HCV genome replication or the induction of autophagy, further demonstrating that the UPR is not required for these processes. Lastly, we demonstrate that the HCV replicase does not colocalize with autophagosomes, suggesting that the induction of autophagy is not required to generate the membrane platform for HCV RNA replication.","Mohl, Bjorn-Patrick; Tedbury, Philip R; Griffin, Stephen; Harris, Mark",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01667-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22837205/,44

A review of recent literature was undertaken, with information collected from peer-reviewed journal articles, guidelines from professional societies, government health departments and instructions from equipment manufacturers. This information was used to provide an update on current infection control best practice. The guidelines are presented in two sections: standard precautions and transmission-based precautions. The standard (routine) precautions section covers: hand hygiene; personal protective equipment; safe handling and disposal of sharps; routine environmental cleaning; reprocessing of reusable equipment, instruments and contact lenses; respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette; aseptic and clean technique; and waste management. The transmission-based precautions section covers considerations for optometry staff and/or patients when standard precautions alone may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of an infectious agent; particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, a comprehensive list of disinfection or sterilisation techniques to use on reusable devices, instruments or equipment in optometric practice is provided in an Appendix.","Hart, Kerryn M; Stapleton, Fiona; Carnt, Nicole; Arundel, Luke; Lian, Ka-Yee",Clinical & experimental optometry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08164622.2021.1887704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769228/,44
91001,Antimicrobial activity of silver loaded MnO2 nanomaterials with different crystal phases against Escherichia coli.,2016,"BACKGROUND The type of fluid and volume regimen given intraoperatively both can impact patient outcome after major surgery. This two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled, double-blind, bi-center superiority study tested the hypothesis that when using closed-loop assisted goal-directed fluid therapy, balanced colloids are associated with fewer postoperative complications compared to balanced crystalloids in patients having major elective abdominal surgery. METHODS One hundred and sixty patients were enrolled in the protocol. All patients had maintenance-balanced crystalloid administration of 3 ml · kg · h. A closed-loop system delivered additional 100-ml fluid boluses (patients were randomized to receive either a balanced-crystalloid or colloid solution) according to a predefined goal-directed strategy, using a stroke volume and stroke volume variation monitor. All patients were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the Post-Operative Morbidity Survey score, a nine-domain scale, at day 2 postsurgery. Secondary outcomes included all postoperative complications. RESULTS Patients randomized in the colloid group had a lower Post-Operative Morbidity Survey score (median [interquartile range] of 2 [1 to 3] vs. 3 [1 to 4], difference -1 [95% CI, -1 to 0]; P < 0.001) and a lower incidence of postoperative complications. Total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively and net fluid balance were significantly lower in the colloid group. CONCLUSIONS Under our study conditions, a colloid-based goal-directed fluid therapy was associated with fewer postoperative complications than a crystalloid one. This beneficial effect may be related to a lower intraoperative fluid balance when a balanced colloid was used. However, given the study design, the mechanism for the difference cannot be determined with certainty.","Joosten, Alexandre; Delaporte, Amelie; Ickx, Brigitte; Touihri, Karim; Stany, Ida; Barvais, Luc; Van Obbergh, Luc; Loi, Patricia; Rinehart, Joseph; Cannesson, Maxime; Van der Linden, Philippe",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068831/,44
91082,Diagnostic exercise: High mortality in a flock of chukar partridge chicks (Alectoris chukar) in California.,2015,"INTRODUCTION New transumbilical laparoendoscopic procedures are an emerging field in urologic surgery. We introduced the concept of single-incision triangulated umbilical surgery (SITUS) in 2009. SITUS technique uses straight optics and instruments in a triangulated fashion via three trocars placed through an umbilical incision resulting in a familiar laparoscopic environment. Aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of SITUS in simple and radical nephrectomy in daily routine. MATERIALS AND METHODS From October 2009 to July 2010, in 3 patients with cirrhotic kidneys a simple and in 12 patients a radical nephrectomy was performed in SITUS technique. The umbilical fold was incised at three-fourth of its circumference; in the patient with radical nephrectomy, additionally small ""c""-shaped skin flaps were removed. After achieving a pneumoperitoneum by Verres technique, a 5-mm camera port and then a cranial 5 mm and a caudal 11 mm working trocar were placed with at a distance of 5-10 cm with the aid of two Langenbeck hooks, thus allowing triangulation except in the radical nephrectomy patients, where an 11-mm caudal trocar (Endopath, Ethicon, Hamburg, GER) was used. Using long conventional laparoscopic instruments, En-Seal pressure coagulator and dissector (Erbe, Tuebingen, Germany), Hem-O-Lock clips (Weck, Teleflex, USA), and a 30° 5-mm optic (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, GER), the interventions were executed like conventional laparoscopic transperitoneal procedures. RESULTS OR time was mean 127 min [120, 153] for cirrhotic kidney nephrectomy group and mean 137 min [91, 185] in the radical nephrectomy group. Mean hemoglobin drop was 1.5 g/dl [1.2, 1.7] in benign cases and 2.4 [1.1, 4.9] in radial nephrectomies. All except one diabetic patient with wound infection had an uneventful follow-up without postoperative complications. The patients were discharged at postoperative day 5 [3, 29]. CONCLUSION SITUS technique for simple and radical nephrectomy is an attractive alternative to conventional laparoscopy and single-port surgery. It combines the common principles of traditional laparoscopy (straight instruments and triangulation) with single-port surgery (cosmesis and minimally invasiveness) resulting in adequate or time and short learning curve.","Nagele, Udo; Walcher, Ute; Herrmann, Thomas R W",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-011-0670-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21461722/,44

Even though entry routes of P. salmonis in fish are not fully clear yet, the skin seems to be the main portal in some salmonid species. Despite the importance of fish mucous skin barrier in fighting waterborne pathogens, the interaction between salmonid skin mucus and the bacterium is unknown. This study seeks to determine the in vitro changes in the growth of two Chilean P. salmonis strains (LF-89-like and EM-90-like genotypes) and the type strain LF-89T under exposures to skin mucus from Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus mykiss, as well as changes in the cytotoxic effect of P. salmonis on the SHK-1 cells following exposures. The results suggest that the growth of three P. salmonis strains was not significantly negatively affected under exposures to skin mucus (adjusted at 100 μg total protein ml-1 ) of O. mykiss (69 ± 18 U lysozyme ml-1 ) and S. salar (48 ± 33 U lysozyme ml-1 ) over time. However, the cytotoxic effect of P. salmonis, pre-exposed to salmonid skin mucus, on the SHK-1 cell line was reliably identified only towards the end of the incubation period, suggesting that the mucus had a delaying effect on the cytotoxic response of the cell line to the bacterium. These results represent a baseline knowledge to open new avenues of research intended to understand how P. salmonis faces the fish mucous skin barrier.","Levipan, Héctor A; Avendaño-Herrera, Ruben",Journal of fish diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006764/,44

However, recent literature disputes this contention. The aim of this document is to clarify that these proteins characterize inflammation rather than describe nutrition status or protein-energy malnutrition. Both critical illness and chronic illness are characterized by inflammation and, as such, hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis occurs, resulting in lower serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin. In addition, the redistribution of serum proteins occurs because of an increase in capillary permeability. There is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, however, not between malnutrition and visceral-protein levels. These proteins correlate well with patients' risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein-energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

Data on PCC efficacy lack consistency in this setting. This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of PCC for anticoagulation reversal in the context of urgent neurosurgery. Articles from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were screened according to the PRISMA checklist. Adult patients receiving anticoagulation reversal with PCC for emergency neurosurgical procedures were included. When available, patients who received FFP were included as a comparison group. Pooled estimates of observational studies were calculated for efficacy and safety outcomes via random-effects modeling. Initial search returned 4505 articles, of which 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Anticoagulants used included warfarin (83%), rivaroxaban (6.8%), phenprocoumon (6.1%), apixaban (2.2%), and dabigatran (1.5%). The mean International Normalized Ratio (INR) prePCC administration ranged from 2.3 to 11.7, while postPCC administration from 1.1 to 1.4. All-cause mortality at 30 days was 27% (95%CI 21, 34%; I2 = 44.6%; p-heterogeneity = 0.03) and incidence of thromboembolic events was 6.00% among patients treated with PCC (95%CI 4.00, 10.0%; I2 = 0%; p-heterogeneity = 0.83). Results comparing PCC and FFP demonstrated no statistically significant differences in INR reversal, mortality, or incidence of thromboembolic events. This metaanalysis demonstrated adequate safety and efficacy for PCC in the reversal of anticoagulation for urgent neurosurgical procedures. There was no significant difference between PCC and FFP, though further trials would be useful in demonstrating the safety and efficacy of PCC in this setting.","Faulkner, Harrison; Chakankar, Shubham; Mammi, Marco; Lo, Jack Yu Tung; Doucette, Joanne; Al-Otaibi, Nawaf; Abboud, Judi; Le, Andrew; Mekary, Rania A; Bunevicius, Adomas",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-020-01406-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33009989/,44

The structure of the obtained compounds was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis and COSY and HMQC for the representative molecules. The photophysical (UV-Vis, PL) and biological properties of all of the prepared compounds were studied. It was found that the amine with the n-hexyl group in EtOH had the highest PL quantum yield (Ф = 85%) compared to the others. Moreover, the chelating properties of the azomethines with the n-hexyl group (1a, 1b, 1c) were tested against various cations (Al3+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+ and Zn2+) in an acetonitrile, acetone and PBS/AC mixture. Compounds that contained the electron withdrawing groups (-Br, -I) had the ability to chelate most of the studied cations, while the unsubstituted derivative chelated only the trivalent cations such as Al3+, Cr3+ and Fe3+ in acetonitrile. The effect of the environment on the keto-enol tautomeric equilibrium was also demonstrated, especially in the case of the derivative with a bromine atom.

Nonetheless, these masks endanger the viability of facial tissues even after a few hours because of the sustained tissue deformations and extreme microclimate conditions. The risk of developing such device-related pressure ulcers/injuries can be reduced through suitable cushioning materials at the mask-skin interface, to alleviate localised contact forces. Here, we determined the facial tissue loading state under an oral-nasal mask while using hydrogel-based dressing cuts (Paul Hartmann AG, Heidenheim, Germany) for prophylaxis, which is a new concept in prevention of device-related injuries. For this purpose, we measured the compressive mask-skin contact forces at the nasal bridge, cheeks, and chin with vs without these dressing cuts and fed these data to a finite element, adult head model. Model variants were developed to compare strain energy densities and effective stresses in skin and through the facial tissue depth, with vs without the dressing cuts. We found that the dry (new) dressing cuts reduced tissue exposures to loads (above the median loading level) by at least 30% at the nasal bridge and by up to 99% at the cheeks, across the tissue depth. These dressing cuts were further able to maintain at least 65% and 89% of their protective capacity under moisture at the nasal bridge and cheeks, respectively. The hydrogel-based dressings demonstrated protective efficacy at all the tested facial sites but performed the best at the nasal bridge and cheeks, which are at the greatest injury risk.","Grigatti, Angela; Gefen, Amit",International wound journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.13701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623741/,44

A common hypothesis put forth to explain these findings suggests that certain working time arrangements lead to negative patient consequences due to the adverse impact they have on employee health. The purpose of this study is to use systematic reviews to investigate whether employee health explains the relationship between working time arrangements and patient safety. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed including published reviews and original studies from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cinahl and Web of Science investigating working time arrangements for healthcare personnel, employee health and patient safety. In addition, we screened reference lists of identified reviews. Two reviewers independently identified relevant publications according to inclusion criteria, extracted findings and assessed quality. RESULTS Six thousand nine hundred thirty papers were identified, of which 52 studies met our criteria. Articles were categorized into five groups according to how they approached the research question: 1) independent analyses of relationship between working time arrangements and employee health, and of working time arrangements and patient safety (5 studies); 2) relationship between working time arrangements on both employee health and patient safety (21 studies); 3) working time arrangements and employee health as two explanatory variables for patient safety (8 studies); 4) combinations of the above analyses (7 studies); 5) other relevant studies (5 studies). Studies that find that working time is detrimental to employee health, generally also find detrimental results for patient safety. This is particularly shown through increases in errors by health personnel. When controlling for employee health, the relationship between working time arrangements and patient safety is reduced, but still significant. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that employee health partially (but not completely) mediates the relationship between working time arrangements and patient safety. However, there is a lack of studies directly investigating employee health as a mediator between working time arrangements and patient safety. Future studies should address this research gap.","Bernstrøm, Vilde H; Alves, Daniele Evelin; Ellingsen, Dag; Ingelsrud, Mari Holm",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-3993-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917819/,44

Long-term experiments are needed to assess potential benefits. The feasibility of a 24-hour experiment in a complex large animal trauma model remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS Anesthetized swine were subjected to controlled hemorrhage, blunt thoracic trauma, and tibial fractures. Animals were then randomized (N = 3/group) to control (No balloon support), 90 minutes of complete supraceliac REBOA, or 10 minutes of supraceliac REBOA followed by 80 minutes of EVAC. One hundred ten minutes after injury, animals were resuscitated with shed blood, the REBOA catheter was removed. Automated critical care under general anesthesia was maintained for 24 hours. RESULTS Animals in the control and EVAC groups survived to the end of the experiment. Animals in the REBOA group survived for 120, 130, and 660 minutes, respectively. Animals in the EVAC group displayed similar mean arterial pressure and plasma lactate concentration as the control group by the end of the experiment. Histologic analysis suggested myocardial injury in the REBOA group when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of intermediate-term experiments in a complex swine model of polytrauma with 90 minutes of REBOA. EVAC may be associated with improved survival at 24 hours when compared with complete REBOA. EVAC resulted in normalized physiology after 24 hours, suggesting that prolonged partial occlusion is possible.

97000,Lentiviral Vector-mediated Gene Therapy of Hepatocytes Ex Vivo for Autologous Transplantation in Swine.,2018,"BACKGROUND Researchers have long recognized that stigma is a global, multi-level phenomenon requiring intervention approaches that target multiple levels including individual, interpersonal, community, and structural levels. While existing interventions have produced modest reductions in stigma, their full reach and impact remain limited by a nearly exclusive focus targeting only one level of analysis. METHODS We conducted the first systematic review of original research on multi-level stigma-reduction interventions. We used the following eligibility criteria for inclusion: (1) peer-reviewed, (2) contained original research, (3) published prior to initiation of search on November 30, 2017, (4) evaluated interventions that operated on more than one level, and (5) examined stigma as an outcome. We stratified and analyzed articles by several domains, including whether the research was conducted in a low-, middle-, or high-income country. RESULTS Twenty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles included a range of countries (low, middle, and high income), stigmatized conditions/populations (e.g., HIV, mental health, leprosy), intervention targets (e.g., people living with a stigmatized condition, health care workers, family, and community members), and stigma reduction strategies (e.g., contact, social marketing, counseling, faith, problem solving), with most using education-based approaches. A total of 12 (50%) articles examined community-level interventions alongside interpersonal and/or intrapersonal levels, but only 1 (4%) combined a structural-level intervention with another level. Of the 24 studies, only 6 (25%) were randomized controlled trials. While most studies (17 of 24) reported statistically significant declines in at least one measure of stigma, fewer than half reported measures of practical significance (i.e., effect size); those that were reported varied widely in magnitude and were typically in the small-to-moderate range. CONCLUSIONS While there has been progress over the past decade in the development and evaluation of multi-level stigma interventions, much work remains to strengthen and expand this approach. We highlight several opportunities for new research and program development.","Rao, Deepa; Elshafei, Ahmed; Nguyen, Minh; Hatzenbuehler, Mark L; Frey, Sarah; Go, Vivian F",BMC medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-018-1244-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770756/,44
97431,New Insights into the Biology of the Emerging Tembusu Virus.,2021-08-10,"INTRODUCTION Transmission of COVID-19 through close contact and droplets is well established, but the influence of aerosol and surface contamination remains to be determined. Literature is scarce and inconsistent about the viable virus particles free-distance from infected patients, as well as about different swabbing methods for surface contamination evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most sensitive method for the assessment of surface contamination, classify the likelihood of environmental contamination in risk zones and compare the environmental contamination between oxygenation and ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHODS Swabs from potentially contaminated surfaces in a COVID-19 ward, with patients treated with different types of oxygen and ventilatory support, were collected. Three types of swabs were compared in order to evaluate the most sensitive collection method. For risk zone categorization, areas were divided according to the distance from the patient. RESULTS Of the 63 swabs collected, 17 (27%) tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The highest positivity rate was observed with the sterile premoistened swab with saline (n = 8; 38%), but without statistically significant differences. The highest number of positive samples were collected from the high-risk zones, specifically those located one meter from the patient (n = 13; 48%), with statistically significant differences. Only the rooms of patients supported with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula had evidence of bedroom contamination, with 45% and 27% of swab positivity, with statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION Our findings favour the premoistened swab without transport medium for surface contamination assessment, even though without statistical differences. A statistically significant trend supporting the division in risk zones, according to the distance from the patient, was also identified. The higher positivity rate from the non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula bedrooms suggests a significant association between ventilatory strategies and surface contamination, probably due to higher particle dispersion. CONCLUSION Our findings support the use of the sterile premoistened swab without preservation medium, the classification of risk areas considering the distance from the patient, and the variability of RNA dispersion between oxygenation and ventilatory support.","Mendes, Marta; Andrade Oliveira, Ana; Pires, Olga; Branca, Fernando; Beirão, Maria; Santa-Cruz, André; Carvalho, Alexandre; Alves, Joana",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.16215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014160/,44

METHODS The Alzheimer's Association and representatives from more than 30 countries-with technical guidance from the World Health Organization-have formed an international consortium to study the short-and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias. This consortium will link teams from around the world covering more than 22 million COVID-19 cases to enroll two groups of individuals including people with disease, to be evaluated for follow-up evaluations at 6, 9, and 18 months, and people who are already enrolled in existing international research studies to add additional measures and markers of their underlying biology. CONCLUSIONS The increasing evidence and understanding of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the CNS raises key questions on the impact for risk of later life cognitive decline, AD, and other dementia. This program of studies aims to better understand the long-term consequences that may impact the brain, cognition, and functioning-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias.","de Erausquin, Gabriel A; Snyder, Heather; Carrillo, María; Hosseini, Akram A; Brugha, Traolach S; Seshadri, Sudha",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399270/,44

We summarize the experience of a multidisciplinary team with volunteer professionals from different specialties who carried out support for healthcare professionals in nursing homes. This team was implemented from both Primary and Specialty Care managements. Its work paradigm was proposed by our home hospitalization team, which included direct care of the most complex patients and general counselling on isolation, hygiene and preventive measures within the nursing homes. Thanks to this support, the elderly population placed there, with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19, received adequate care from an interdisciplinary team, which led part of the pressure to be released from their professional workers, and many family members were aware that there was no neglect of the elderly.

We prospectively identified children admitted to three general PICUs, with the goal of identifying risk factors for mortality. DESIGN Prospective multicenter observational study. SETTING Three general PICUs, two in São Paulo and one in Curitiba, Brazil. PATIENTS Children aged between 1 month and 15 years, consecutively admitted between August 2008 and July 2010, with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome that developed at least 12 hours after invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We used logistic regression models to explore the relationship between death and independent variables. Of 3,046 patients admitted to the three PICUs, 1,658 patients underwent mechanical ventilation, and 84 fulfilled the acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Nearly 60% were boys, and the median age was 31 months. Pressure control/assist control was the initial mode of mechanical ventilation in 86% of cases, and the median durations of mechanical ventilation and PICU stay were 12 and 15 days, respectively. None of the eight patients with acute lung injury died, whereas 33 of 76 of the remaining patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome died, for an overall mortality rate of 39.3% (95% CI, 28.8-50.6%). In different multivariate logistic regression model, the number of organ dysfunctions at admission, peak inspiratory pressure, airway pressure gradient on day 1, and the mean airway pressure gradient over the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION Mortality is high in pediatric acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mechanical ventilation-associated risk factors for death among such patients are potential targets for intervention.","Panico, Flávia F; Troster, Eduardo J; Oliveira, Cindy S; Faria, Aline; Lucena, Michelle; João, Paulo R D; Saad, Everardo D; Foronda, Flávia A K; Delgado, Artur F; de Carvalho, Werther Brunow",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26181296/,44
99588,New insights into the role of RNase L in innate immunity.,2011,"Uterine myomas are the most common type of benign tumor in women of reproductive age and are commonly associated with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms. Uterine fibroids have been also linked to infertility and pregnancy loss. Women wishing to preserve or restore their fertility are best treated by myomectomy. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy is one of the latest technological applications of minimally invasive surgery. Limited data exist regarding the feasibility of robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy (RALM) in terms of pregnancy and surgical outcomes, and more studies are needed. The goal of this study is to assess reproductive outcomes following RALM in a private practice setting. The study was performed in the form of a retrospective chart review. Female patients 22-44 years old diagnosed with intramural myoma were eligible for inclusion. Presence of a myoma was a necessary but not necessarily the presenting symptom. All patients underwent RALM between January 2006 and May 2009 under the care of one surgeon at two clinical sites. Patients were selected postsurgically via chart review based on inclusion parameters outlined above. Median values for pregnancy rate, number of myomas, diameter of largest myoma, surgery duration, and blood loss were calculated and used for subsequent statistical analysis. Clinically useful markers for pregnancy outcomes evaluation following RALM were identified. Thirty patients were enrolled, of whom 16 were interested in conception due to infertility. A pregnancy rate of 75 % was recorded. Among those who conceived, eight patients (67 %) reported natural conception within 6 months of unprotected intercourse, while four patients (33 %) utilized assisted reproductive technologies to conceive. One patient (8 %) miscarried. Two patients (17 %) experienced premature delivery, at 28 and 32 weeks, respectively. All deliveries were performed via Cesarean section. No surgical complications were reported following RALM. There were no cases of scar dehiscence or rupture. The median number of myomas in those who delivered was estimated at 1.0 compared with 3.5 in those unable to conceive (p < 0.05). In addition, median age was 34 compared with 42.5 years, respectively (p < 0.05). This retrospective study assessed pregnancy outcomes following RALM. Our pregnancy rate of 75 % combined with a low incidence of complications contributes to the limited pool of data available on this topic, and supports the need for a multicenter trial to further evaluate effectiveness and safety of RALM in terms of pregnancy outcomes.","Tusheva, Olga A; Gyang, Anthony; Patel, Sejal D",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-012-0354-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000894/,44

We have evaluated the correlation between environmental pollution determinants and the COVID-19 outbreak in California by using the secondary published data from the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Pollution Agency (EPA). We employed Spearman and Kendall correlation tests to analyze the association of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO2, NO2, Pb, VOC, and CO with COVID-19 cases in California. Our findings indicate that environmental pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO have a significant correlation with the COVID-19 epidemic in California. Overall, our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote changes in environmental policies as pollution source control can reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollutants.","Bashir, Muhammad Farhan; Ma, Ben Jiang; Bilal,; Komal, Bushra; Bashir, Muhammad Adnan; Farooq, Taimoor Hassan; Iqbal, Najaf; Bashir, Madiha",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470647/,44

Study design: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a neonatal intensive care unit in Taipei, Taiwan. One hundred intubated neonates were enrolled. The estimated intubation depth was defined as being mid-tracheal concordant if it placed the endotracheal tip between the upper border of the first and the lower border of the second thoracic vertebra. A linear regression model was used to analyze the relationships between mid-tracheal depth and body weight (BW), NTL and gestational age (GA), and to revise the NRP intubation tables using our results. Results: Overall, 56% of the neonates were born at a GA ≤ 28 weeks and 48% had a BW ≤ 1,000 g. The overall mid-tracheal concordance rates for TF, NTL + 1 cm, NRP-GA, and NRP-BW estimations were 51.0, 57.0, 15.0, and 14.0%, and in the infants with a BW ≤ 1,000 g 56.3, 56.3, 8.3, and 8.3%, respectively. Our revisions of the NRP intubation tables based on the anthropometric measurements of our participants improved the efficacy of BW, GA, and NTL estimations to 63, 44, and 61%, respectively. Conclusion: TF and NTL + 1 cm were more reliable than NRP intubation tables in predicting the neonatal mid-tracheal length in neonates of all BW and GA. Considering morphological differences secondary to ethnicity, we recommend using these tailored recommendations during neonatal resuscitation in Asian neonates.","Peng, Chun-Chih; Chang, Hung-Yang; Tiong, Ngiik-Ping; Chang, Jui-Hsing; Hsu, Chyong-Hsin; Jim, Wai-Tim; Lin, Chia-Ying; Chen, Chia-Hui; Ko, Mary Hsin-Ju",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754563/,44
101597,Finding Druggable Sites in Proteins Using TACTICS.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND Recurrence of hiatal hernia after anti-reflux surgery is common, with past studies reporting recurrence rates of 10-15%. Most patients experience relief from GERD symptoms following initial repair; however, those suffering from recurrence can have symptoms severe enough to warrant another operation. Although the standard of care is to revise the fundoplication or convert to magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) in addition to redo cruroplasty, it stands to reason that with an intact fundoplication, a repeat cruroplasty is all that is necessary to alleviate the patients' symptoms. In other words, only fix that which is broken. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with symptomatic hiatal hernia recurrence who underwent reoperation between January 2011 and September 2018 was conducted. Patients who received revisional cruroplasty alone were compared with cruroplasty plus some other revision (fundoplication revision, or takedown and MSA placement). Demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected. RESULTS There were 73 patients identified. Median time to recurrence after the first procedure was 3.7 (1.9-8.2) years. Thirty-two percent of the patients had GERD symptoms for more than 10 years. Twenty-six patients underwent cruroplasty only. Forty-seven patients underwent cruroplasty plus fundoplication revision. There were no significant differences in operative times (2.4 h cruroplasty alone, 2.8 h full revision, p = 0.75) or postoperative complications between the two groups. Patients had a mean follow-up time of 1.64 years. Of the 73 patients, 8 had subsequent hiatal hernia recurrence. The recurrence rate for patients with cruroplasty alone was 11%, and the recurrence rate for the full revision group was 12% (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION Leaving an intact fundoplication alone at the time of revisional surgery did not adversely affect surgical outcomes. This data suggests a role for hernia-only repair for recurrent hiatal hernias.","Nguyen, Robert; Dunn, Colin P; Putnam, Luke; Won, Paul; Patel, Tanu; Brito, Stephanie; Bildzukewicz, Nikolai A; Lipham, John C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07897-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839876/,44

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) to conventional multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MPLC). We compared intra-operative complications, operative time, postoperative complications, pain score, readmission rate and conversion to open amongst both groups. METHODS A retrospective review of data of patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between May 2009 and November 2011 was performed. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RESULTS A total of 184 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 76 patients from MPLC were excluded from comparison based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 62 patients in MPLC and 45 patients in the SILC group were compared. The two groups were similar with respect to patients' demographics and American Society of Anaesthesiology grades. The median operative time for SILC was 75 min (range 42-120) compared to 60 min (range 26-117) in MPLC (p = 0.02). There was no conversion to open procedure. One patient in SILC group was converted to MPLC and two patients required a second port insertion. Postoperative pain-score and length of hospital stay were comparable in both groups. One patient in each group had minor bleeding from gall bladder bed controlled with diathermy. CONCLUSION SILC is a safe and feasible approach in selected patients. There was no difference in complication rate amongst the two approaches with a longer operative time in the SILC approach.","Karim, Muhammad Ali; Ahmed, Jamil; Mansour, Moustafa; Ali, Abdulmajid",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22664893/,44

RESULTS A total of 446 Mohs defect repairs were analyzed. Average patient age was 61.54 ± 14.81 years. The average defect size was 17.55 ± 10.48 mm. Overall complications were fairly uncommon and required intervention in only 18.74%; other than postoperative corticosteroid injections, additional procedures were necessary in only 6.95% of patients. Female sex; Fitzpatrick skin type 3; upper lip and nasal defects; glabellar, superiorly based nasolabial, bilobed, and rhombic flaps; and dermal suture extrusion were associated with increased complications. The most common complications seen were scar erythema and flap pincushioning. The most common revision techniques performed/recommended were selective laser photothermolysis (3.59%) and scar excision (3.59%). CONCLUSION Repair of Mohs defects uncommonly requires adjunctive/revision techniques to reach satisfactory appearance.

However, some patients additionally present with neurological symptoms. Recent studies also show a broad range of neuroimaging features. The purpose of this study was to perform a snapshot analysis to approximate the frequency and types of neuroimaging findings on CT and MRI scans in a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in a level I COVID-19 center, both in general and in critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed brain CT and MRI scans of 34 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at our level I COVID-19 center between March 15 and April 24 with regard to pathological neuroimaging findings. In addition, clinical parameters such as neurological symptoms, comorbidities, and type of ventilation therapy were also documented. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Pathological findings were detected in 38.2 % of patients in the study cohort. Based on the weekly institutional SARS-CoV-2 report of all positively tested patients in our clinic at the time of data collection, neuroimaging findings could be found in 6 % of all patients (34/565). The most common findings were microbleeds (20.6 %) and signs of hypoxic brain injury (11.8 %). Furthermore, cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, typical and atypical cerebral hematomas, ischemic strokes, and generalized brain edema were documented. All neuroimaging findings occurred in patients who were either intubated or treated by ECMO. CONCLUSION Based on the analysis of this large cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, pathological neuroimaging findings seem to be relatively rare in general but do occur in a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 disease needing intubation or ECMO. KEY POINTS · Neuroimaging findings appear to be relatively rare in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.. · Pathological findings occur mainly in critically ill COVID-19 patients.. · Frequent findings include hemorrhagic, ischemic and hypoxic changes.. · Critically ill COVID-19 patients should receive neuroimaging with a low threshold..

106497,Exploration of the Epidemiological and Emotional Impact of Quarantine and Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND We present here the first reported cases of patients undergoing gastric bypass with a hybrid technique that involves a new concept of percutaneous instruments and provides the advantages of minimally invasive single-port surgery while maintaining the triangulation, safety, and timing of operative procedures. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study of eight patients selected for gastric bypass between December 2011 and January 2012 and treated by a technique that combined single SSL port and percutaneous surgical set PPS. We performed hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy in all cases. We analyzed preliminary results at 1 month and focused on the feasibility of the technique, duration of surgery, perioperative complications, and cosmetic results. The Ethics Committee of our institution approved this study and we obtained the informed consent of each patient. RESULTS We completed the procedure successfully in all patients. No conversions to laparotomy or classic laparoscopy were required. The average time of surgery was 112 min (85-155). Length of hospital stay was 4 days (3-5). One patient was re-admitted on the seventh postoperative day for gastrointestinal bleeding from the gastrojejunostomy suture and treated by endoscopic clipping. Residual scars were less than 2 cm for the single midline port and 2 mm for the percutaneous instruments. CONCLUSIONS This new technique combines the advantages of single-port surgery with the safety of conventional laparoscopy by using percutaneous instruments and leaves minimal scarring. It is likely that the use of percutaneous instrumentation will become widespread in all areas of laparoscopic surgery.","Kotzampassakis, Nikos; Machairas, Nikolaos; Clanet, Mathieu; Cornet, Pierre; Dandrifosse, Anne-Catherine",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0793-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23224508/,44

However, there is little evidence about how new mothers in Canada access and use online resources. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine how first-time mothers accessed information and support both online and off-line during the first six months postpartum and how their experiences were constructed through social and institutional discourses. METHODS A qualitative feminist poststructuralist approach was used to analyze an online discussion board with first-time mothers in Nova Scotia. RESULTS Mothers who used the online discussion board experienced a sense of community with other mothers where empathy and encouragement were integral to the ways in which information and support were shared. ""Weak ties"" (with strangers) were important and led to the following themes: (a) empathy, encouragement, and information; (b) socialization; (c) blurring the boundaries of online and off-line networks; and (d) Developing community. CONCLUSIONS These online forums offer insight for health professionals looking to improve mothers' care postpartum and point to a need to foster spaces for new mothers to talk to each other.","Aston, Megan; Price, Sheri; Hunter, Andrea; Sim, Meaghan; Etowa, Josephine; Monaghan, Joelle; Paynter, Martha",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,https://doi.org/10.1177/0844562120940554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757828/,44

Using a large series of experimental aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device, the objectives of this study were to 1) assess interobserver agreement for the evaluation of wall apposition on posttreatment DSA and evaluate its association with aneurysm occlusion, and 2) measure the relationship between wall apposition assessed with histology and aneurysm occlusion rate after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Saccular aneurysms were created in 41 rabbits and treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. DSA was performed just after the deployment of the device and at follow-up. Three investigators independently graded wall apposition on posttreatment DSA as good or poor. A histopathologist blinded to the angiographic results graded the wall apposition on histologic samples. We examined the correlation between angiographic occlusion and wall apposition with histology and angiography. RESULTS Wall apposition evaluated on histology was strongly associated with saccular aneurysm occlusion. Sensitivity and specificity of wall apposition to predict complete occlusion at follow-up were 76.9% and 84.0%, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 81.6%. In this experimental study, DSA was suboptimal to assess flow-diverter apposition, with moderate interobserver agreement and low accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Good wall apposition is strongly associated with complete occlusion after flow-diverter therapy. In this study, DSA was suboptimal for assessing wall apposition of flow-diverter stents. These findings suggest that improved tools for assessing flow diverter-stent wall apposition are highly relevant.","Rouchaud, A; Ramana, C; Brinjikji, W; Ding, Y-H; Dai, D; Gunderson, T; Cebral, J; Kallmes, D F; Kadirvel, R",AJNR.

OBJECTIVE To assess whether patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID present higher risk of worse outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING Rapid systematic review conducted in the medical school of the Federal University of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, L·OVE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for studies evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID. Two authors selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence, following the Cochrane recommendations. RESULTS We identified 1,498 references, from which one cohort study was included. This compared patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD) who all had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Those with RD seemed to have higher chances of hospitalization and mortality, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups: hospitalization: odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.29; mortality rate: OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 7.11 (very low certainty of evidence). Patients with RD were three times more likely to require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), than those without RD: OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 10.26 (for both outcomes; very low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID seem to present higher chances of requiring admission to ICUs, with IMV.

108301,Snatching from the host.,2020-07-20,"PURPOSE Approximately 20% to 30% of suspicious small renal tumors are benign. A significant proportion of malignant tumors are low grade and potentially indolent. We evaluated whether preoperative patient and tumor characteristics are associated with adverse pathological features. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 886 patients underwent robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, as done by 1 of 5 high volume surgeons. Demographic and clinical data were compared between patients with benign/malignant disease, clear cell/nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma and high/low grade tumors. Tumor complexity was quantified by R.E.N.A.L. (radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness of tumor to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, hilar and location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score and described as low--4 to 6, intermediate--7 to 9 or high--10 or greater. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between tumor and patient characteristics, and high grade renal cell carcinoma. Subanalyses were done for patients with renal tumors 4 cm or less. RESULTS High grade renal cell carcinoma was larger and more likely to develop in men. Patients with malignant tumors and with clear cell histology were more likely to have intermediate or high complexity tumors. Increasing tumor complexity independently predicted malignancy, high grade malignancy and clear cell histology on multivariate regression analysis (each p <0.05). Male gender was independently associated with malignancy and high grade renal cell carcinoma. When considering tumors 4 cm or less, tumor complexity predicted malignancy but not tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS High R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score and male gender are associated with an increased risk of malignancy and high grade malignancy in tumors treated with partial nephrectomy.","Mullins, Jeffrey K; Kaouk, Jihad H; Bhayani, Sam; Rogers, Craig G; Stifelman, Michael D; Pierorazio, Phillip M; Tanagho, Youssef S; Hillyer, Shahab P; Kaczmarek, Bartosz F; Chiu, Yichun; Allaf, Mohamad E",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2012.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23083863/,44

This paper investigates the experiences of a sudden change of policy in the form of an age restriction that trumped the contemporary active aging ideal. A web-based qualitative survey was conducted in April 2020. Through manual coding of a total of 851 responses, six different ways of relating to the age-based recommendations were identified. The results show that age is not an unproblematic governing principle. Instead, in addition to protecting a vulnerable group, the age-based recommendation meant deprivation of previously assigned individual responsibility and, consequently, autonomy. It is shown how respondents handled this tension through varying degrees of compliance and resistance. Findings highlight the importance of continuously tracking the long-term consequences of age-based policy to avoid negative self-image and poorer health among older adults.","Nilsson, Gabriella; Ekstam, Lisa; Axmon, Anna; Andersson, Janicke",Journal of aging & social policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2021.1925042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010122/,44

However, it is unclear whether the additional procedures influence overall clinical outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our posttrapeziectomy suture suspensionplasty technique, performed using the abductor pollicis longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons, in patients with advanced thumb CMC arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 36 thumbs of 35 patients with advanced thumb CMC arthritis treated with combined operative excision of trapezium followed by a suture suspensionplasty using flexor carpi radialis and abductor pollicis longus tendons. We used a minimal volar approach to create a sling construct with a nonabsorbable suture material, which could support the thumb metacarpal base without pin fixation or tendon transfer. For radiographic evaluation, we used the ratio of the radial metacarpal subluxation to metacarpal articular width, estimated from the bilateral stress-view radiographic images of the thumb, and calculated the trapezial space ratio by dividing the trapezial space height by the proximal phalangeal length. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores, along with evaluation of the improvement in both postoperative range of motion and strength recovery. RESULTS The mean duration of follow-up was 26 months (range, 18-60 months). The average visual analog scale and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores decreased from 5.9 to 0.4 and from 51.6 to 27.0, respectively. The range of motion during palmar abduction and opposition of the metacarpophalangeal joint improved with an increase in mean value from 49.1 degrees to 54.1 degrees, and from 7.8 to 9.3 Kapandji score, respectively. The grip and key pinch strengths showed no significant changes from mean preoperative values of 13.3 kg and 3.8 kg to 13.2 kg and 3.2 kg, respectively, as measured at the 18-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our suture suspensionplasty technique has several advantages including minimal invasive approach, short operative time, cost-effectiveness, and early mobilization.

Herein, we represented potential antibody based treatments especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that may exert a potential role in treatment as well as developing vaccination strategies against COVID-19. AREAS COVERED We used PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov search strategies for relevant papers. We demonstrated some agents with potentially favorable efficacy as well as favorable safety. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID19. However, development of different strategies such as SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines and antibody therapy are urgently required beside other effective therapies such as plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies. We encourage giving more attention to antibody based treatments as an immediate strategy. Although, there has not been any approved specific vaccine until now, developing vaccination strategies may have a protective effect against COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION An antiviral mAbs could be a safe and high-quality therapeutic intervention which is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Additionally, the high sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS/MERS viruses, could shed light on developing to design a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Payandeh, Zahra; Mohammad Khani, Niloufar; Nabbi, Mohsen; Khalili, Saeed; Rajabibazl, Masoumeh; Houjaghani, Zahra; Dadkhah, Masoomeh",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1863144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307883/,44
113040,Improved microtitre plate production of single chain Fv fragments in Escherichia coli.,2009,"Recently, we found that divalent calcium has no detectable effect on the assembly of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ (MtbFtsZ), whereas it strongly promoted the assembly of Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). While looking for potential calcium binding residues in EcFtsZ, we found a mutation (E93R) that strongly promoted the assembly of EcFtsZ. The mutation increased the stability and bundling of the FtsZ protofilaments and produced a dominating effect on the assembly of the wild type FtsZ (WT-FtsZ). Although E93R-FtsZ was found to bind to GTP similarly to the WT-FtsZ, it displayed lower GTPase activity than the WT-FtsZ. E93R-FtsZ complemented for its wild type counterpart as observed by a complementation test using JKD7-1/pKD3 cells. However, the bacterial cells became elongated upon overexpression of the mutant allele. We modeled the structure of E93R-FtsZ using the structures of MtbFtsZ/Methanococcus jannaschi FtsZ (MjFtsZ) dimers as templates. The MtbFtsZ-based structure suggests that the Arg(93)-Glu(138) salt bridge provides the additional stability, whereas the effect of mutation appears to be indirect (allosteric) if the EcFtsZ dimer is similar to that of MjFtsZ. The data presented in this study suggest that an increase in the stability of the FtsZ protofilaments is detrimental for the bacterial cytokinesis.","Jaiswal, Richa; Patel, Ronak Y; Asthana, Jayant; Jindal, Bhavya; Balaji, Petety V; Panda, Dulal",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.138719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667825/,44

Given that lefamulin is primarily metabolized by CYP450 Phase-1 reactions, this study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of IV lefamulin in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment as compared with matched healthy subjects. DESIGN Open-label, Phase 1 clinical pharmacokinetic study SETTING: Research Study Center PATIENTS: Twenty-seven subjects; comprised of 11 individuals with normal hepatic function and eight each with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were included, as classified by Child-Pugh scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULT Subjects were administered a single dose of IV lefamulin 150 mg over 1 hour. Plasma was collected for 48 hours and analyzed for lefamulin and its major metabolite, BC-8041, concentrations in addition to assessing lefamulin plasma protein binding. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared using least square geometric mean ratios. Lefamulin was well tolerated in all hepatic function groups. Statistical analyses revealed reductions in Cmax and increases in renal clearance for Moderate and Severe groups, as well as, increased volume of distribution for the Severe group. Lefamulin plasma AUC mean (SD) was similar across groups at 7615 (1554), 8233 (2286), and 8938 (1640) h·ng/mL for Normal, Moderate, and Severe groups, respectively, despite decreased clearance observed primarily during terminal elimination phases. Decreased plasma protein binding was seen in hepatically-impaired versus normal subjects. CONCLUSION Lefamulin was generally well tolerated. Differences in lefamulin and BC-8041 pharmacokinetics were small, relative to the overall variability, and any changes appear to be compensated by increases in renal clearance and decreased protein binding.","Wicha, Wolfgang W; Marbury, Thomas C; Dowell, James A; Crandon, Jared L; Leister, Cathie; Ermer, James; Gelone, Steven P",Pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811377/,44
113690,Transendoscopic Ventriculocordectomy Using Monopolar Electrosurgical Instrumentation for Conjunctive Treatment of Laryngeal Hemiplegia in Horses: 24 Cases (2017-2019).,2021,"INTRODUCTION Cardiac surgery is associated with significant morbidity and longer length-of-stay (LOS) than most other surgeries. Regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the patient's forehead monitors cerebral oxygenation during surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Its purpose is to detect and manage periods of cerebral hypoxia which may otherwise go undetected, thereby reducing morbidity. But outcomes have been inconsistent, and not all cardiac departments have adopted this non-invasive, simple-to-use technology. We aimed to study the efficacy of our use of rSO2 by recording seven outcomes for each patient according to their preoperative rSO2, the mean intraoperative rSO2, and four ischemic thresholds during surgery. METHOD This is a retrospective audit of cardiac surgical patients in whom a protocol was used to maintain rSO2 above the preoperative value and studied seven major morbidity outcomes. Cerebral oximetry data were recorded for each patient and analyzed for six variables: preoperative baseline rSO2, mean intraoperative rSO2, and four ischemic thresholds defined as an area under the curve (AUC) in minutes% below the baseline rSO2,minus 10% below the baseline, minus 20% the below baselineand minus 50% below baseline. Outcomes examined were: delirium, stroke, postoperative rise in creatinine of 50 mmol, absolute creatinine of 200 mmol, need for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), hospital LOS and inpatient mortality. RESULTS Complete data were available for 166 patients. Lower mean preoperative rSO2 was associated with stroke (p=0.031), mild and severe renal dysfunction (p=0.045 and p=0.036), death-in-hospital (p=0.027) and prolonged hospital LOS (p=0.005). Lower mean intraoperative rSO2 during surgery was associated with the outcomes of renal dysfunction, mild (p=0.027), moderate (p=0.003) or severe (p=0.002), death-in-hospital (p=0.003) and prolonged hospital LOS (p=0.015). Of the four ischemic thresholds defined, only new RRT occurring at minus 20% and minus 50% below baseline was significant. CONCLUSION Lower preoperative rSO2 and mean intraoperative rSO2 were associated with poor outcomes, notably leading to a significant increase in hospital LOS.

The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 includes the entry into the target cells, replicase translation, replicating and transcribing genomes, translating structural proteins, assembling and releasing new virions. Entering host cells is a crucial stage in the early life cycle of the virus, and blocking this stage can effectively prevent virus infection. SARS enters the target cells mediated by the interaction between the viral S protein and the target cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the cleavage effect of type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) on the S protein. Therefore, the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 are important targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Herein, we provide a concise report/information on drugs with potential therapeutic value targeting virus-ACE2 or virus-TMPRSS2 interactions, to provide a reference for the design and discovery of potential entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.","Lin, Hao; Cherukupalli, Srinivasulu; Feng, Da; Gao, Shenghua; Kang, Dongwei; Zhan, Peng; Liu, Xinyong",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210420103021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881969/,44

Viral infections may also induce autophagic response. Here we show that hepatitis B virus (HBV), a pathogen that chronically infects approximately 350 million people globally, can enhance autophagic response in cell cultures, mouse liver, and during natural infection. This enhancement of the autophagic response is not coupled by an increase of autophagic protein degradation and is dependent on the viral X protein, which binds to and enhances the enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III, an enzyme critical for the initiation of autophagy. Further analysis indicates that autophagy enhances HBV DNA replication, with minimal involvement of late autophagic vacuoles in this process. Our studies thus demonstrate that a DNA virus can use autophagy to enhance its own replication and indicate the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of HBV patients.","Sir, Donna; Tian, Yongjun; Chen, Wen-ling; Ann, David K; Yen, Tien-Sze Benedict; Ou, Jing-Hsiung James",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911373107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20142477/,44
114641,Effects of air temperature and relative humidity on coronavirus survival on surfaces.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Venus cannulation is one of the main nursing actions. For the safety of patients and nurses, this skill is important to be performed in a proper and responsible way. Thus, the need for adequate education on this skill is essential. STUDY OBJECTIVE Comparison between the 4-stage (demonstration, deconstruction, comprehension, performance) learning method and the simplified 2-stage method (deconstruction, performance) on venous cannulation. METHODS The study took place from November 2011 to March 2012. In total, 117 students of the Nursing Department of Technological Educational Institute of Athens were randomized into two education groups of the 2- (Group A) and 4- (Group B) stage method respectively. Students of both groups were assessed during training and 45days later for skill retention. For the assessment of all students, a check list with the steps required to venous cannulation was used. The time to complete the process was also assessed. RESULTS Group A included 54 students and Group B 50 students. During initial training, the average time to complete the process without any errors was lower for Group A compared to Group B (1.77±0.12min vs. 2.33±0.13min, p=0.006). Regarding the appropriate steps for venous cannulation, Group A made fewer errors compared to Group B (0.95±0.95 vs. 1.38±1.10, p=0.021). In addition, Group A omitted more steps than Group B (0.29±0.06 vs. 0.11±0.05, p=0.042). During skill retention assessment, no significant difference was observed in the number of incorrect steps or in the number of omitted steps between groups. CONCLUSION According to our findings, the 4-stage method, is associated with less omitted steps, while the 2-stage method, is associated with less time required to complete the procedure and less errors during performance, at initial stages. However, skill retention does not seem to be associated with the type of the educational methodology.","Bitsika, Eleni; Karlis, George; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Georgiou, Marios; Kontodima, Panagiota; Vardaki, Zambia; Xanthos, Theodoros",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2013.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623278/,44

While phytochemicals have been proposed as one pain management solution, knowledge of their utility is limited. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the biomedical literature for the use of phytochemicals for management of cancer therapy pain in human subjects. Of an initial database search of 1,603 abstracts, 32 full-text articles were eligible for further assessment. Only 7 of these articles met all inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The average relative risk of phytochemical versus control was 1.03 [95% CI 0.59 to 2.06]. In other words (although not statistically significant), patients treated with phytochemicals were slightly more likely than patients treated with control to obtain successful management of pain in cancer therapy. We identified a lack of quality research literature on this subject and thus were unable to demonstrate a clear therapeutic benefit for either general or specific use of phytochemicals in the management of cancer pain. This lack of data is especially apparent for psychotropic phytochemicals, such as the Cannabis plant (marijuana).

120150,Repair of G1 induced DNA double-strand breaks in S-G2/M by alternative NHEJ.,2020-10-16,"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembled structures derived from viral antigens that mimic the native architecture of viruses but lack the viral genome. VLPs have emerged as a premier vaccine platform due to their advantages in safety, immunogenicity, and manufacturing. The particulate nature and high-density presentation of viral structure proteins on their surface also render VLPs as attractive carriers for displaying foreign epitopes. Consequently, several VLP-based vaccines have been licensed for human use and achieved significant clinical and economical success. The major challenge, however, is to develop novel production platforms that can deliver VLP-based vaccines while significantly reducing production times and costs. Therefore, this review focuses on the essential role of plants as a novel, speedy and economical production platform for VLP-based vaccines. The advantages of plant expression systems are discussed in light of their distinctive posttranslational modifications, cost-effectiveness, production speed, and scalability. Recent achievements in the expression and assembly of VLPs and their chimeric derivatives in plant systems as well as their immunogenicity in animal models are presented. Results of human clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of plant-derived VLPs are also detailed. Moreover, the promising implications of the recent creation of ""humanized"" glycosylation plant lines as well as the very recent approval of the first plant-made biologics by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for plant production and commercialization of VLP-based vaccines are discussed. It is speculated that the combined potential of plant expression systems and VLP technology will lead to the emergence of successful vaccines and novel applications of VLPs in the near future.","Chen, Qiang; Lai, Huafang",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.22218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995837/,44

The EULAR standardised operating procedures were followed. A task force of rheumatologists, health professionals and patients, representing 17 European countries updated the recommendations, based on a systematic literature review and expert consensus. Higher level of evidence and new insights into nursing care for patients with CIA were added to the recommendation. Level of agreement was obtained by email voting. The search identified 2609 records, of which 51 (41 papers, 10 abstracts), mostly on rheumatoid arthritis, were included. Based on consensus, the task force formulated three overarching principles and eight recommendations. One recommendation remained unchanged, six were reworded, two were merged and one was reformulated as an overarching principle. Two additional overarching principles were formulated. The overarching principles emphasise the nurse's role as part of a healthcare team, describe the importance of providing evidence-based care and endorse shared decision-making in the nursing consultation with the patient. The recommendations cover the contribution of rheumatology nursing in needs-based patient education, satisfaction with care, timely access to care, disease management, efficiency of care, psychosocial support and the promotion of self-management. The level of agreement among task force members was high (mean 9.7, range 9.6-10.0).

We assessed the prevalence of likely COVID-19 and its risk factors in patients followed-up after BS. METHODS We surveyed 738 patients who underwent BS and were followed-up at our university medical centre. A retrospective comparison of characteristics at baseline, one- year post BS and at the time of lockdown was performed between patients with a COVID-19 likely event (CL) based on a combination of reported symptoms vs. those for whom it was unlikely (CU). RESULTS CL occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients among whom 4 (6.4%) had severe form requiring hospitalization and 1 (1.6%) died. The CL group had a higher proportion of persistent type 2 diabetes (T2D) at last follow-up (36.2% vs. 20.3%, p=0.01). BMI at the time of lockdown was lower in the CL group (30.2 ± 5.1 vs. 32.8 ± 6.5 kg/m2 ; p<0.01) with higher percent weight loss since BS in the CL group. Severe forms of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization were associated with persistent T2D at last follow-up visit.

This level of exposure is higher than the estimated global average of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (9.8%). This systematic literature review aims to identify demographic, health and psycho-social variables associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy which may lead to FASD. METHODS Using PRISMA principles, this systematic literature review reports on psycho-social factors which increase the risk of alcohol consumption during pregnancy thereby increasing the risk of FASD. RESULTS Fourteen studies were accepted into this review. Studies were conducted across several countries and included a total of 386,067 cases. Seven studies were case-controlled and seven were cross-sectional design. Multiple studies identified the significance of prior mental illness, anxiety, depression, exposure to abuse and/or domestic violence and alcohol consumption behaviours of partners and family members as strong predictors of risky alcohol consumption during pregnancy and therefore associated risk of FASD.

Ten male participants were exposed to either LED, OLED (1000 lx), or dim (< 10 lx) light for 4 h before sleep in a metabolic chamber. Following OLED exposure, energy expenditure and core body temperature during sleep were significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Fat oxidation during sleep was significantly reduced (p = 0.001) after the exposure to LED compared with OLED. Following exposure to OLED, fat oxidation positively correlated with the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels, suggesting that the role of melatonin in lipolysis differs depending on the light.

Preoperative identification of patients with high risk of recurrent disease might enable individualized treatment based on patients' risk profile. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of metabolic parameters derived from the pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT as imaging biomarkers for recurrent disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS Included in this retrospective study were all consecutive patients with CLM treated with percutaneous or open thermal ablation therapy who had a pre-treatment baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT available. Multivariable cox regression for survival analysis was performed using different models for the metabolic parameters (SULpeak, SULmean, SULmax, partial volume corrected SULmean (cSULmean), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)) corrected for tumour and procedure characteristics. The study endpoints were defined as local tumour progression free survival (LTP-FS), new intrahepatic recurrence free survival (NHR-FS) and extrahepatic recurrence free survival (EHR-FS). Clinical and imaging follow-up data was used as the reference standard. RESULTS Fifty-four patients with 90 lesions were selected. Univariable cox regression analysis resulted in eight models. Multivariable analysis revealed that after adjusting for lesion size and the approach of the procedure, none of the metabolic parameters were associated with LTP-FS or EHR-FS. Percutaneous approach was significantly associated with a shorter LTP-FS. It was demonstrated that lower values of SULpeak, SULmax, SULmean , and cSULmean are associated with a significant better NHR-FS, independent of the lesion size and number and prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION We found no association between the metabolic parameters on pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT and the LTP-FS. However, low values of the metabolic parameters were significantly associated with improved NHR-FS. The clinical implication of these findings might be the identification of high-risk patients who might benefit most from adjuvant or combined treatment strategies.","Samim, M; Prevoo, W; de Wit-van der Veen, B J; Kuhlmann, K F; Ruers, T; van Hillegersberg, R; van den Bosch, M A A J; Verkooijen, H M; Lam, M G E H; Stokkel, M P M",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-017-3637-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180965/,44

METHODS This prospective, cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 25 amblyopic patients and 25 healthy controls. All patients and controls underwent OCTA and OCT imagining. Macular vessel densities of the Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP) and Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP) and retinal thickness were measured by OCTA and ganglion cell layer (GCL) by OCT. RESULTS SCP density at the fovea and parafovea was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes than in fellow eyes and control group. DCP density at the fovea was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes than fellow eyes and control group. Mean GCL thickness on OCT was 0.73 ± 0.07 μm in amblyopic eyes, 0.75 ± 0.06 μm in fellow eyes and 0.77 ± 0.06 μm in the control group.

123369,Accelerating the cell cycle.,2020-07-28,"UNLABELLED Modulating the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza, caused by a virus whose pathogenesis is determined in part by the reaction it elicits within the host. Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus in several animal models has been reported, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. Therefore, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/01/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003), and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) influenza viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and pdm09H1N1 early in infection but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism and coagulation signaling genes. This three-pronged transcriptomic signature was observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza virus strains. Finally, we used host transcriptomic profiling to computationally predict drugs that reverse the host response to H7N9 infection, and we identified six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE Emerging avian influenza viruses are of global concern because the human population is immunologically naive to them. Current influenza drugs target viral molecules, but the high mutation rate of influenza viruses eventually leads to the development of antiviral resistance. As the host evolves far more slowly than the virus, and influenza pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response, targeting the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza. Here we characterize the host transcriptomic response to emerging H7N9 influenza virus and compare it with the responses to H7N7, H5N1, and pdm09H1N1. All three avian viruses were pathogenic in mice and elicited a transcriptomic signature that also occurs in response to the legendary 1918 influenza virus. Our work identifies host responses that could be targeted to treat severe H7N9 influenza and identifies six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed as H7N9 influenza therapeutics.","Morrison, Juliet; Josset, Laurence; Tchitchek, Nicolas; Chang, Jean; Belser, Jessica A; Swayne, David E; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J; Tumpey, Terrence M; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00570-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991006/,44

Early detection and intervention is essential for effective management of the pathogen. We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for P. infestans and compared this assay to conventional PCR, real-time LAMP, and droplet digital PCR for detection of P. infestans. The LAMP assay was specific for P. infestans on potato and tomato and did not amplify other potato- or tomato-infecting Phytophthora species or other fungal and bacterial pathogens that infect potato and tomato. The detection threshold for SYBR Green LAMP and real-time LAMP read with hydroxynaphthol blue and Eva Green was 1 pg/µl. In contrast, detection by conventional PCR was 10 pg/µl. Droplet digital PCR had the lowest detection threshold (100 fg/µl). We adapted the LAMP assay using SYBR Green and a mobile reader (mReader) for use in the field. Detection limits were 584 fg/µl for SYBR Green LAMP read on the mReader, which was more sensitive than visualization with the human eye. The mobile platform records geospatial coordinates and data from positive pathogen detections can be directly uploaded to a cloud database. Data can then be integrated into disease surveillance networks.

DESIGN A 21-day diary study was conducted between late March and late April 2020 in Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12). Every evening, participants indicated their exposure to COVID-19-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their COVID-19-related worries. RESULTS Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more COVID-19-related worries on days with higher exposure to COVID-19-related media. Dynamical structural equation models provided evidence for a reciprocal cycle across days: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of worries. CONCLUSION These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle whereby consuming crisis-related media and worrying reciprocally influence each other across days, possibly amplifying adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike on mental and physical health.","Schmidt, Andrea; Brose, Annette; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmiedek, Florian; Witthöft, Michael; Neubauer, Andreas B",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1912345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886394/,44

Little is known about temporal trends of phthalate exposure in pregnant women in the U.S. We quantified 16 metabolites of 8 phthalates and di(isononyl) cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH) in 656 urine samples collected from 192 California pregnant women in 2007-2013 during their 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy who participated in the MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs) study. We used multiple regression to estimate least square geometric means of phthalate biomarker concentrations and annual percent changes over the study period. Biomarker concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and three phthalates with known toxicity and adverse health effects (i.e., butyl benzyl phthalate [BBzP], dibutyl phthalate [DBP], di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [DEHP]) decreased while those of di-isobutyl phthalate [DiBP], di-isononyl phthalate [DiNP], and di-n-octyl phthalate [DOP] increased in California pregnant women during our study period. To understand broad social forces that may influence temporal trends and geographic variations in phthalate exposure across countries, we compared our phthalate biomarker concentrations with those of other populations. We observed a factor of 2 differences in exposure across countries for some phthalate biomarkers and between pregnant and non-pregnant women for DEP.","Shin, Hyeong-Moo; Dhar, Upasana; Calafat, Antonia; Nguyen, Vy; Schmidt, Rebecca J; Hertz-Picciotto, Irva",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c03857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940456/,44

However, to date there has been no national study of medication dispensing errors in Jordan. Objective The study aimed to investigate the incidence, nature, severity, causes and predictors of medication dispensing errors. Setting The study was conducted in randomly selected community pharmacies across Jordan. Method A mixed method approach was taken, incorporating prospective disguised observation of dispensing errors and interviews with pharmacists regarding the causes of errors. A multidisciplinary committee evaluated the severity of errors. Proportionate random sampling was used to include 350 pharmacies from across all regions of Jordan. SPSS (Version 24) was used for data analysis. Main outcome measure Incidence, nature, severity, causes and predictors of medication dispensing errors. Results The overall rate of medication dispensing errors was 24.6% (n = 37,009/150,442), of which 11.5% (n = 17,352/150,442) were prescription related errors and 13.1% (n = 19,657/150,442) pharmacist counselling errors. The most common type of prescription-related errors were wrong quantity (37.9%, n = 6584/17,352), whereas the most common pharmacist counselling error was wrong drug (41.9%, n = 8241/19,657). The majority of errors were caused by poor handwriting (30.7%, n = 75,651/37,009), followed by high workload (17.3%, n = 22,964/37,009). More than half of errors (52.6%) were moderate in severity, followed by minor errors (38.8%), and 8.6% of errors were rated as serious. Predictors of medication dispensing errors were: Sundays (OR 2.7; 95% CI 2.15-3.94; p = 0.02), grade A pharmacies (dispensing ≥ 60 prescriptions a day (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.89-4.78; p = 0.04)), and prescriptions containing ≥ 4 medication orders (OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.9-6.4; p = 0.001). Conclusion Medication dispensing errors are common in Jordan and our findings can be generalised and considered as a reference to launch training programmes on safe medication dispensing and independent prescribing for pharmacists.","Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Lewis, Penny J; Hamadi, Salim",International journal of clinical pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-020-01126-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803560/,44

126299,Evolutionary developmental biology and sustainability: A biology of resilience.,2021-01-05,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic to tropical areas in Asia and the Western Pacific. It can cause fatal encephalitis, although most infected individuals are asymptomatic. JEV is mainly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, but can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. To manage the potential risk of transfusion transmission, pathogen inactivation (PI) technologies, such as THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets systems, have been developed. We examined the efficacy of these two PI systems to inactivate JEV. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Japanese encephalitis virus-spiked plasma units were treated using the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system (visible light doses, 20, 40, 60, and 120 [standard] J/cm2) in the presence of methylene blue at approximately 0.8 μmol/L and spiked platelet concentrates (PCs) were treated using the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system (UVC doses, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 [standard] J/cm2). Samples were taken before the first and after each illumination dose and tested for infectivity using an immunoplaque assay. RESULTS Treatment of plasma with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system resulted in an average of 6.59 log reduction in JEV infectivity at one-sixth of the standard visible light dose (20 J/cm2). For PCs, treatment with the THERAFLEX UV-Platelet system resulted in an average of 7.02 log reduction in JEV infectivity at the standard UVC dose (0.20 J/cm2). CONCLUSIONS The THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets systems effectively inactivated JEV in plasma or PCs, and thus these PI technologies could be an effective option to reduce the risk of JEV transfusion transmission.","Rustanti, Lina; Hobson-Peters, Jody; Colmant, Agathe M G; Hall, Roy A; Young, Paul R; Reichenberg, Stefan; Tolksdorf, Frank; Sumian, Chryslain; Gravemann, Ute; Seltsam, Axel; Marks, Denese C; Faddy, Helen Z M",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830340/,44

In this setting, topotecan demonstrated modest activity with significant toxicity. Paclitaxel was also active. This study was designed to evaluate activity and safety of nab-paclitaxel in relapsed SCLC. METHODS In this multicentre prospective Phase 2 trial, patients with refractory or sensitive SCLC progressed to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/smq on days 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks up to six cycles, progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective tumour response. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Of the 68 patients treated, partial response was 8% in the refractory cohort and 14% in the sensitive cohort. Most common toxicities of any grade were fatigue (54%), anaemia (38%), neutropenia (29%), leukopenia (26%) and diarrhoea (21%). Median PFS was similar in both refractory (1.8 months) and sensitive cohorts (1.9 months), while median OS was longer in sensitive one (6.6 versus 3.6 months).

However, its photonic applications are restricted to visible and partial near-infrared spectral range owing to its fundamental optical bandgap (1.12 eV). With recent advances in strain engineering, material properties, including optical bandgap, can be tailored considerably. This paper reports the strain-induced shrinkage in the Si bandgap, providing photosensing well beyond its fundamental absorption limit in Si nanomembrane (NM) photodetectors (PDs). The Si-NM PD pixels were mechanically stretched (biaxially) by a maximum strain of ~3.5% through pneumatic pressure-induced bulging, enhancing photoresponsivity and extending the Si absorption limit up to 1550 nm, which is the essential wavelength range of the lidar sensors for obstacle detection in self-driving vehicles. The development of deformable three-dimensional optoelectronics via gas pressure-induced bulging also facilitated the realization of unique device designs with concave and convex hemispherical architectures, which mimics the electronic prototypes of biological eyes.","Katiyar, Ajit K; Thai, Kean You; Yun, Won Seok; Lee, JaeDong; Ahn, Jong-Hyun",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb0576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832687/,44

Subsequently, other humanized anti-TNFs were developed and marketed, followed by antibodies to new targets including integrins (vedolizumab) and interleukin (IL) 12/23 (ustekinumab). All these so-called biologicals were shown in registrational trials to induce remission superior to placebo but consistently were effective in only a minority of patients. Even though in most trials only the responders were selected to continue on the respective medication for maintenance, many experienced a secondary loss of response and only a minority of usually <25% of the initial cohort achieved long term (1 year) remission. In ""real life studies"" the outcome was somewhat better, probably due to proper selection of patients and open, mostly retrospective study designs. A clear benefit of biologicals is apparent in otherwise treatment refractory patients, in extraintestinal manifestations and in CD with fistulizing complications. Biologicals achieve mucosal healing (MH) more often than corticosteroids or thiopurines and MH is associated with improved prognosis. However, this does not justify escalating treatment until MH is reached since controlled trials proving this point of ""treat to target"" are lacking both in UC and CD. Surgical rates have decreased with increasing use of biologicals, but disease progression has not been proven to improve. With the exception of opportunistic infections serious adverse events are rare. In conclusion, biologicals have changed the scene considerably and expanded our armamentarium but there is also a marketing hype fostering expectations without evidence.

The aim of this Phase 1b study (N=54) was to explore safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Org 26576 in depressed patients. Part I (N=24) evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal titration schedule in a multiple rising dose paradigm (range 100 mg BID to 600 mg BID); Part II (N=30) utilized a parallel groups design (100 mg BID, 400 mg BID, placebo) to examine all endpoints over a 28-day dosing period. Based on the number of moderate intensity adverse events reported at the 600 mg BID dose level, the MTD established in Part I was 450 mg BID. Symptomatic improvement as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale was numerically greater in the Org 26576 groups than in the placebo group in both study parts. In Part II, the 400 mg BID dose was associated with improvements in executive functioning and speed of processing cognitive tests. Org 26576 was also associated with growth hormone increases and cortisol decreases at the end of treatment but did not influence prolactin or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. The quantitative electroencephalogram index Antidepressant Treatment Response at Week 1 was able to significantly predict symptomatic response at endpoint in the active treatment group, as was early improvement in social acuity. Overall, Org 26576 demonstrated good tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in depressed patients, and pharmacodynamic endpoints suggested that it may show promise in future well-controlled, adequately powered proof of concept trials.","Nations, Kari R; Dogterom, Peter; Bursi, Roberta; Schipper, Jacques; Greenwald, Scott; Zraket, David; Gertsik, Lev; Johnstone, Jack; Lee, Allen; Pande, Yogesh; Ruigt, Ge; Ereshefsky, Larry",Journal of psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881112458728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22954616/,44

METHODS Patients who underwent LIHR from 2009 to 2011 using a bioabsorbable plug and synthetic mesh patch were reviewed retrospectively. Short-term follow-up information was obtained within 30 days of surgery, whereas long-term follow-up was obtained in 2014. Quality of life was assessed using the Carolinas Comfort Scale. RESULTS Forty-four patients (43 male), including 6 (13.6%) with recurrent disease, underwent 52 LIHR with a bioabsorbable plug. Mean age and body mass index were 60.9 ± 10.5 years and 27.9 ± 4.7 kg/m, respectively. Among 39 (88.6%) patients available for short-term follow-up, early postoperative complications were seen in 10 (25.6%) patients, all of which resolved spontaneously. Mean long-term follow-up duration was 41.6 ± 4.1 months, among 30 (68.2%) patients (40 hernia repairs). There were 2 (5%) hernia recurrences, with 1 requiring a reoperation 12 months after initial repair. Only 2 (6.7%) patients reported moderate or bothersome chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS Bioabsorbable plug combined with a synthetic mesh is safe and effective for use during LIHR.

129700,Molecular cloning and metabolomic characterization of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene from Baphicacanthus cusia.,2019-11-09,"BACKGROUND The pathogenesis of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) involves accumulation of P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) in the placenta, contributing to poor pregnancy outcomes. Parasite accumulation is primarily mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Magnitude of IgG to pRBCs has been associated with reduced risk of MiP in some studies, but associations have been inconsistent. Further, antibody effector mechanisms are poorly understood, and the role of antibody complement interactions is unknown. METHODS Studying a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women (n=302) from a malaria-endemic province in Papua New Guinea (PNG), we measured the ability of antibodies to fix and activate complement using placental binding pRBCs and PfEMP1 recombinant domains. We determined antibody-mediated complement inhibition of pRBC binding to the placental receptor, chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), and associations with protection against placental parasitemia. RESULTS Some women acquired antibodies that effectively promoted complement fixation on placental-binding pRBCs. Complement fixation correlated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, which dominated the response. There was, however, limited evidence for membrane attack complex activity or pRBC lysis or killing. Importantly, a higher magnitude of complement fixing antibodies was prospectively associated with reduced odds of placental infection at delivery. Using genetically modified P. falciparum and recombinant PfEMP1 domains, we found that complement-fixing antibodies primarily targeted a specific variant of PfEMP1 (known as VAR2CSA). Furthermore, complement enhanced the ability of antibodies to inhibit pRBC binding to CSA, which was primarily mediated by complement C1q protein. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide new insights into mechanisms mediating immunity to MiP and reveal potential new strategies for developing malaria vaccines that harness antibody-complement interactions.","Opi, D Herbert; Boyle, Michelle J; McLean, Alistair R D; Reiling, Linda; Chan, Jo-Anne; Stanisic, Danielle I; Ura, Alice; Mueller, Ivo; Fowkes, Freya J I; Rogerson, Stephen J; Beeson, James G",BMC medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02061-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425801/,44

This study aimed to investigate the use of normal myometrium as an internal reference for endometrial and cervical cancer during multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MCE-MRI) and to explore whether this information regarding tumor enhancement relative to the myometrium could be used to discriminate between endometrial and cervical cancer. METHODS MRI images, before and after contrast enhancement, were analyzed in newly diagnosed cervical (n = 18) and endometrial cancer (n = 19) patients. Signal intensities (SIs) from tumor tissue and non-neoplastic myometrium were measured using imaging software. RESULTS The relative signal for cervical cancer was approximately 30% higher than that of endometrial cancer after contrast administration. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for SI, relative signal enhancement, and tumor to myometrium contrast ratio (as used to discriminate between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer) was 0.7807, 0.7456 and 0.7895, respectively. There was no difference in SI of the normal myometrium between endometrial and cervical cancer patients prior to and after contrast administration. Using non-tumorous myometrium as an internal reference, the tumor to myometrium contrast ratio was significantly higher in tumor tissue from cervical cancer compared with that from endometrial cancer at 25 s post contrast enhancement (p = 0.0016), with an optimal sensitivity of 72.22% and specificity of 84.21%. CONCLUSION With SI normalized to baseline or normal myometrium, tumor tissue from cervical cancer patients showed significant hyperintensity compared with that of tumor tissue from endometrial cancer patients after contrast enhancement, yielding acceptable performance. The use of the myometrium as an internal reference may provide an alternative method to analyze MCE-MRI data.","Lin, Chia-Ni; Liao, Yu-San; Chen, Wen-Chang; Wang, Yue-Sheng; Lee, Li-Wen",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27326456/,44
131013,Towards Understanding the Reactivity and Optical Properties of Organosilicon Sulfide Clusters.,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND Medicaid patients tend to have poor access to care and suffer from more obesity and obesity-related co-morbidities compared to their privately insured counterparts. The impact of Medicaid status on outcomes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence outcomes following LSG in the adult Medicaid population of Louisiana with particular focus on adherence to bariatric aftercare attendance and access to care. METHODS A retrospective review of 63 Medicaid patients undergoing LSG was performed. Demographic data, access to care, weight, co-morbidities morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Changes in weight and obesity-related co-morbidities were analyzed for patients with ≥12 months of follow-up. Regression analyses were used for estimating the relationships among variables. RESULTS The majority of patients were female and non-Caucasian. The mean age was 38.6 years. Morbidity was 16% and mortality was 0%. The average distance traveled to clinic was 71.9 miles. Within the first year only 10% of the patients attended all post-operative clinic visits. A multiple logistic model showed that the only predictor of clinic attendance was increased age. At a mean follow-up of 17.7 months, the mean percent excess body weight loss was 47.2%. Greater pre-surgical weight was the only variable associated with suboptimal weight loss. Improvement or resolution of all major co-morbidities was seen in 65% of patients. CONCLUSION Medicaid patients had a poor attendance at bariatric surgery follow up appointments. Since long-term follow-up is critical, we needed to develop strategies that will optimize follow-up in this patient population.","Bellows, Charles F; Gauthier, Jason M; Webber, Larry S",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25489220/,44

Collection of the RW samples was made on a monthly basis during the period (1989-2006). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) values calculated for the different parameters at all stations show VWM values of 6.84 and 96 μS/cm for pH and EC, respectively. The ionic trend of the VWM concentrations (μeq/L) in the RW samples of entire dataset follows the descending order: Ca2+ ≥ HCO3- > SO42- > Mg2+ > Cl- > Na+ > NO3- > K+ > NH4+. The lowest pH and EC values were found for the southern mountainous stations, while the highest were reported for the interior inland stations, depending on the amount of carbonate dust present in the atmosphere. The major part of the RW salinity (> 70%) was due to Ca2+, HCO3- and SO42- concentrations. The highest concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were found for the Tartous coastal station, where the Na+/Cl- ratio (0.84 ± 0.16) was remarkably very close to that of the Mediterranean Sea (MS) value (0.86), implying thus the sea spray effect. The highest NO3- concentrations (≈ 8-9 mg/L), with relatively high SO42-/NO3- ratios (> 2 ± 1), were found for the major cities (Damascus, Homs and Aleppo), implying hence the influence of intensive traffics and urban pollutions. The pH parameter was moderately linked with Ca2+ and HCO3- (R2 ≈ 0.36), while EC was correlated with all ions, except NH4+. This later ion was weakly correlated with NO3- (R2 ≈ 0.23). Strong correlations were found between Ca2+ and SO42- (R2 ≈ 0.80) and between Cl- and Na+ (R2 ≈ 0.95). Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions were the most responsible for neutralizing the RW acidity. The role of K+ and NH4+ as acidity neutralizers was small. By using the principal component analysis (PCA), five major factors, explaining ≈ 87% of the total variance, were suggested for the possible sources affecting the chemical composition of RW in this country. The factors are (1) crustal natural materials, (2) sea salts, (3) fossil fuel combustion, (4) rural activity, and (5) biomass burning.","Kattan, Zuhair",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08257-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418089/,44

Electrotransfer of oligonucleotides was studied in vitro, showing a direct transfer of negatively charged siRNA across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. In vivo, the feasibility of siRNA electrotransfer was demonstrated in different studies and tissues. While effective, electrotransfer of siRNA into 3D tissues still needs to be understood. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of siRNA electrotransfer and assessed its effect in 3D spheroids made of HCT116-GFP cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results indicate that siRNA uptake was not uniform across 3D multicellular spheroids. The electrophoretic migration of nucleic acids upon delivery of unipolar electric field pulses could explain the asymmetry of siRNA uptake. Moreover, a gradient was observed from external layers toward the center, leading to siRNA silencing of GFP positive cells located in the outer rim. While siRNA delivery experiments on spheroids may differ from intratumoral injections, the levels of transfection in spheroids are comparable to levels observed in published studies in vivo. Taken together, our results provide fundamental information about siRNA 3D distribution during electrotransfer, indicating that multicellular spheroids remain a relevant alternative to animal experimentation.","Pelofy, Sandrine; Bousquet, Hugo; Gibot, Laure; Rols, Marie-Pierre; Golzio, Muriel",Bioelectrochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118554/,44

Costs associated with diagnosing and treating these conditions for individual states' Medicaid participants are unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost of screening and treatment for three common STIs for state Medicaid program budgets in Maryland and South Carolina. METHODS A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using Medicaid administrative claims data over a two-year period. Claims were included based on the presence of one of the three study conditions in either diagnosis or procedure codes. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize the participant population and expenditures for services provided. RESULTS Total Medicaid expenditures for STI care in state fiscal years 2016 and 2017 averaged $43.5 million and $22.3 million for each year in Maryland and South Carolina, respectively. Maryland had a greater proportion of costs associated with outpatient hospital and laboratory settings. Costs for care provided in the emergency department were highest in South Carolina.

However, there are no studies comparing the short-term outcomes between LDPPHRt and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). The present study aimed to evaluate the differences in the intraoperative data, postoperative data, short-term complications, and 90-day mortality rates between LDPPHRt and LPD in the management of pancreatic-head benign or low-grade malignant tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2016 and December 2019, 15 LDPPHRt and 39 LPD procedures were performed. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were retrospectively analyzed and compared. RESULTS All of the patients received laparoscopic procedures successfully and without conversion. There were no differences in the patients' age, body mass index, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, preoperative examination results, preoperative initial symptoms, comorbidities, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative stay, short-term complications, 30-day readmission rates, or 90-day mortality rates. More female patients underwent LDPPHRt than LPD (73.3% vs. 38.5%; P=0.033), and no patients in the LDPPHRt group had previously undergone abdominal surgery (0% vs. 20.1%; P=0.049). The operative time was shorter in the LDPPHRt group than in the LPD group (295±42 vs. 357±87 min; P=0.011). The lesion diameter did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (2.93±1.18 vs. 2.53±1.12 cm; P=0.252). The lesion resection margins were all histopathologically negative. The distribution of pathological diagnosis was comparable in both groups. The LDPPHRt group had 4 cases of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (26.7%), 1 case of solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPN) (6.7%), 2 cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (PNET) (13.3%), 2 cases of serous cystic adenoma (SCA) (13.3%), 4 cases of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) (26.7%), and 2 cases of chronic pancreatitis (13.3%). The LPD group had 21 cases of IPMN (53.8%), 2 cases of SPN (5.1%), 7 cases of PNET (17.9%), 3 cases of SCA (7.7%), 2 cases of MCN (5.1%), and 4 cases of chronic pancreatitis (10.3%).

AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate the surgical, oncological and survival outcomes in all patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for low rectal cancer. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for low rectal cancers were included in the study. Clinical, pathological and follow-up data were recorded over a 4-year period. The mean follow-up was 25 months RESULTS A total of 53 patients were included in the study, 30 of whom were males. The mean age was 64.14 years (range, 34-86 years). The mean hospital stay was 8.2 days (range, 4-42 days). Fifty were completed laparoscopically and three were converted to an open procedure. Thirty-eight were anterior resections and 15 were abdominoperineal resections. Twenty-four patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The total mesorectal excision was optimal in 51 (98%) cases. There were no anastomotic sequelae and no surgical mortality. There was no local recurrence detected. The overall survival (mean follow-up, 25 months) was 93.5%. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic resection for low rectal cancers permits optimum oncological control.

With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care.

However, to evaluate movements of animals using δ(2)H measurements of tissues, it is necessary to establish the turnover time of (2)H in the tissues and the extent of isotopic discrimination from different environmental (2)H sources to those tissues. We investigated the turnover of (2)H in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) blood by manipulating both environmental water δ(2)H and diet δ(2)H over a four-month period. The half-life of deuterium in lake sturgeon blood was 37.9 days after an increase in the environmental water δ(2)H of +714 ‰. However, no clear turnover in blood (2)H occurred over the same period in a separate trial following a change of -63.8 ‰ or +94.2 ‰ in diet.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the longitudinal association between HGS and risk of depressive symptoms. METHODS PubMed, PSYCINFO and EMBASE databases were searched for eligible publications up to April 2020. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects model. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel plot. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of eligible studies. RESULTS The present meta-analysis included 8 cohort studies with 30,727 participants. Overall, higher HGS was related to a decreased risk of depressive symptoms: the pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.65-0.85] with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60.5%, P = 0.013). HGS was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in males (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94), but not in females.

With VHL, about 10% of the patients exhibit PNETs by age 40 years. Metastatic potential is high if the tumors have grown to >3 cm in diameter. Optimal surgical treatment is still a challenge. METHODS We report three cases, all women, ages 22, 30, and 39 years, respectively, who had known VHL, confirmed by classic organ manifestations and germline mutations of the VHL gene. All were diagnosed, in an asymptomatic stage, with solid tumors of the pancreatic tail or tail/corpus area measuring 2.9-5.6 cm diameter. All accepted the offer of laparoscopic organ-sparing removal of the tumors. RESULTS In all three cases, the tumor was entirely removed. In two cases, resection of the spleen was also necessary as dissection of the tumor from the major splenic vessels was impossible. Operating time was 215-365 min, and blood loss was 200-700 ml. Histolopathology revealed benign PNETs in two cases, but the third patient had regional lymph node metastases. There were no complications, and the hospital stay was 4-7 days. CONCLUSIONS Organ-sparing laparoscopic surgery is an important option for treating VHL-associated PNETs of the pancreatic tail.","von Dücker, Laura; Walz, Martin K; Voss, Christian; Arnold, Georg; Eng, Charis; Neumann, Hartmut P H",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0878-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21181474/,44
136888,Examining cultural structures and functions in biology.,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND Unintended intraoperative awareness, which occurs when general anesthesia is not achieved or maintained, affects up to 1% of patients at high risk for this complication. We tested the hypothesis that a protocol incorporating the electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is superior to a protocol incorporating standard monitoring of end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration (ETAC) for the prevention of awareness. METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blinded trial at three medical centers. We randomly assigned 6041 patients at high risk for awareness to BIS-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the BIS value was <40 or >60, on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the suppression of detectable brain electrical activity and 100 indicating the awake state) or ETAC-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the ETAC was <0.7 or >1.3 minimum alveolar concentration). In addition to audible alerts, the protocols included structured education and checklists. Superiority of the BIS protocol was assessed with the use of a one-sided Fisher's exact test. RESULTS A total of 7 of 2861 patients (0.24%) in the BIS group, as compared with 2 of 2852 (0.07%) in the ETAC group, who were interviewed postoperatively had definite intraoperative awareness (a difference of 0.17 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.38; P=0.98). Thus, the superiority of the BIS protocol was not demonstrated. A total of 19 cases of definite or possible intraoperative awareness (0.66%) occurred in the BIS group, as compared with 8 (0.28%) in the ETAC group (a difference of 0.38 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.74; P=0.99), with the superiority of the BIS protocol again not demonstrated. There was no difference between the groups with respect to the amount of anesthesia administered or the rate of major postoperative adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The superiority of the BIS protocol was not established; contrary to expectations, fewer patients in the ETAC group than in the BIS group experienced awareness.

136899,Feasibility and nutritional impact of laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer in the upper stomach.,2014,"BACKGROUND Esophagectomy for submucosal (T1b) esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is performed in order to optimize patient outcomes given the risk of concurrent lymph node metastases (LNM). However, not seldom, comorbidity precludes these patients from surgery. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the course of follow-up after treatment in submucosal EAC patients undergoing surgery versus conservative therapy and to evaluate the incidence of metastatic disease. METHODS Between 2001 and 2012, all patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopic resection for EAC in two centers were reviewed. Only patients with histopathologically proven submucosal tumor invasion were included. Submucosal EACs were divided into tumors that were removed radically (R0) and irradically (R1). Subsequently, in the R0 group, EACs were classified as either low risk (LR; submucosal invasion <500 nm, G1-G2, no LVI) or high risk (HR; deep submucosal invasion >500 nm, G3-G4 and/or LVI). Metastatic disease was defined as LNM in surgical resection specimen and/or evidence of malignant disease during follow-up (FU). RESULTS Sixty-nine patients with a submucosal EAC were included [23 R1-resections and 46 R0-resection (14 R0-LR and 32 R0-HR)]. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical treatment (1 R0-LR, 12 R0-HR and 13 R1). None of the 14 R0-LR patients developed metastatic disease after a median FU of 60 months. In the R0-HR group and R1 group, metastatic disease was diagnosed in 16 and 30 % of patients, respectively. Surgical patients tended to have a better overall survival than non-surgical patients (p = 0.09). Tumor-related deaths, however, were 12 % in both groups. CONCLUSIONS In LR submucosal EAC, the risk of metastatic disease appears to be very low. In deep submucosal EAC (either R0- or R1-resection), the rate of metastatic disease is lower than reported in earlier surgical series. Given the reasonable disease-free survival and high background mortality, conservative management of these patients seems to be a valid alternative for surgery in selected cases.","Schölvinck, Dirk; Künzli, Hannah; Meijer, Sybren; Seldenrijk, Kees; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark; Bergman, Jacques; Weusten, Bas",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5071-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27357927/,44

137585,Selective inhibition of STAT3 signaling using monobodies targeting the coiled-coil and N-terminal domains.,2020-08-17,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of concurrent hearing and deafness genetic screening and follow up of newborns. METHODS In total 33 911 babies born to 5 designated hospitals in Nanshan District of Shenzhen city from October 2017 to December 2019 were included. All subjects underwent concurrent hearing and deafness genetic screening covering 21 variants of 4 genes including GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12SrRNA. For those with positive results, Sanger sequencing was carried out for confirmation. RESULTS 93.32% subjects passed the first-round hearing screening, and 87.01% passed the recheck testing. The overall detection rate was 4.18%. The detection rates for GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12srRNA variants were 1.98%, 1.58%, 0.37% and 0.25%, respectively. 126 and 84 subjects were found with high risk for delayed-onset and drug-induced hearing loss, respectively. In addition, 4 and 5 subjects were found to harbor homozygous/compound heterozygous variants of the GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes, respectively. Concurrent screening showed that subjects (with heterozygous variants) who did not passed the two round hearing test were as follows: GJB2 with 6.75% in the first round and 2.61% in the second round testing, SLC26A4 (3.3%/1.2%), GJB3 (0.72%/0.14%) and 12SrRNA (0.36%/Nil), respectively. Moreover, the No-pass rate in the subjects with homozygous or compound variants in single gene, heterozygous variant in single gene, heterozygous variant in multiple genes, and homozygous variant in GJB3 gene were significantly higher than the subjects with negative results of genetic screening. CONCLUSION Concurrent newborn genetic screening can enhance the effectiveness of hearing screening and enable earlier identification and intervention for children with hearing impairment. Follow-up can improve the diagnostic rate for children who are positive for the concurrent screening. Nevertheless, genetic and hearing screening cannot replace the diagnostic testing. It is necessary to conduct comprehensive analysis for the results of genetic and hearing screening and radiological examinations. Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing are critical for ascertain the diagnosis.","Lei, Jie; Han, Luhao; Deng, Xi; Long, Min; Xiao, Yanwei; Lin, Xiaowen; Zhang, Jing",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20200322-00189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423254/,44
137666,The protective effect of rosmarinic acid on myotube formation during myoblast differentiation under heat stress.,2020-09-08,"The chiral building block (R)-(+)-2,2'-diamino-1,1'-binaphthyl, (R)-BINAM, which is often used as backbone in privileged enantioselective catalysts, was converted to a series of N-substituted proligands R1-H2 (R = CH2tBu, C(H)Ph2, PPh2, dibenzosuberane, 8-quinoline). After double deprotonation with strong Mg or Ca bases, a series of alkaline earth (Ae) metal catalysts R1-Ae·(THF)n was obtained. Crystal structures of these C2-symmetric catalysts have been analyzed by quadrant models which show that the ligands with C(H)Ph2, dibenzosuberane and 8-quinoline substituents should give the best steric discrimination for the enantioselective intramolecular alkene hydroamination (IAH) of the aminoalkenes H2C[double bond, length as m-dash]CHCH2CR'2CH2NH2 (CR'2 = CPh2, CCy or CMe2). The dianionic R12- ligand in R1-Ae·(THF)n functions as reagent that deprotonates the aminoalkene substrate, while the monoanionic (R1-H)- ligand formed in this reaction functions as a chiral spectator ligand that controls the enantioselectivity of the ring closure reaction. Depending on the substituent R in the BINAM ligand, full cyclization of aminoalkenes to chiral pyrrolidine products as fast as 5 minutes was observed. Product analysis furnished enantioselectivities up to 57% ee, which marks the highest enantioselectivity reported for Ca catalyzed IAH. Higher selectivities are impeded by double protonation of the R12- ligand leading to complete loss of chiral information in the catalytically active species.","Stegner, Philipp C; Eyselein, Jonathan; Ballmann, Gerd M; Langer, Jens; Schmidt, Jochen; Harder, Sjoerd",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1dt00173f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594995/,44
138051,No Development of Imipenem Resistance in Pneumonia Caused by Escherichia coli.,2015,"Sixteen isolates of gram-positive, coccoid bacteria were obtained from clinical cases of diverse conditions in cattle and identified as Streptococcus suis using 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing and other bacterial identification methods. None of the isolates could be assigned to any of the known S. suis capsular types. Virulence-associated gene profiling that targeted muramidase-released protein, extracellular protein factor, suilysin, 89-kb pathogenicity island, and arginine deiminase ( arcA) genes were negative except for 1 isolate that was arcA positive. The arcA-positive isolate caused severe widespread lesions, including multiorgan suppurative and hemorrhagic inflammation in the meninges, lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and serosae of heart and intestines. The other isolates were primarily associated with meningitis, bronchopneumonia, and multifocal acute necrotizing hepatitis. The isolates differed from each other by 4-6 fragments when examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicating they are possibly related. The isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and tiamulin. Resistance was noted to sulfadimethoxine (93%), oxytetracycline (86%), chlortetracycline (86%), neomycin (67%), tilmicosin (47%), clindamycin (47%), enrofloxacin (33%), gentamicin (13%), florfenicol (7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (7%), and spectinomycin (53%). Multi-drug resistance (defined as resistance to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial classes) was detected in 67% of the isolates. The pathology observations provide evidence that S. suis may be an important pathogen of bovine calves. S. suis is an agent that clinical bacteriology laboratories should consider when dealing with cases involving cattle.","Okwumabua, Ogi; Peterson, Hanna; Hsu, Hui-Min; Bochsler, Phil; Behr, Melissa","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638717690014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166707/,44
138270,Torsion of a Subserosal Myoma Managed by Gasless Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Myomectomy with In-Bag Manual Extraction.,2016,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak has affected almost all hospital departments, including transfusion services. However, the demand for transfusions in a general hospital designated to deal with COVID-19 patients has not been analysed before. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate blood transfusion practices from 15 March to 14 April 2020 at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor (Madrid, Spain). During this month, with few exceptions, the hospital became a 'COVID-19' centre. In addition, transfusion rates during this time frame and the same period over the last 4 years were compared. RESULTS From 15 March to 14 April 2020, only 254 blood components were transfused, resulting in a 49·3% reduction over the previous year. Interestingly, in critically ill patients, the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion/bed ratio significantly decreased during this period (0·92) compared to the same ratio over the past 4 years (2·70) (P = 0·02). Of note, 106 blood components (95 RBC; 11 platelet concentrates) were transfused to only 36 out of 1348 COVID-19 patients (2·7%). The main reason for RBC transfusion in COVID-19 patients was a previous underlying disease (44%) followed by bleeding (25%) and inflammatory anaemia (25%). CONCLUSION This is the first study to report a decrease in blood transfusions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital and especially in the intensive care unit. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 does not generally induce transfusion requiring anaemia, being the main causes for transfusion in these patients underlying conditions or bleeding.","Marín-Mori, Karen; González-Gascón Y Marín, Isabel; Foncillas-García, María-Ángeles; Muñoz-Novas, Carolina; Infante, María; Churruca-Sarasqueta, Juan; Landete-Hernández, Elena; Bueno-García, Begoña; Duffort-Falco, Mercedes; Hernández-Rivas, José-Ángel",Vox sanguinis,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135226/,44

Structure determination of small biological complexes using single-particle cryo-EM.,2020-06-26,"OBJECTIVE Fast-absorbing polyglactin 910 is commonly used to suture skin and vaginal incisions. In vitro studies have shown similar tensile strength properties between Velosorb™ Fast and Vicryl™ Rapide (Al-Qattan MM. J Hand Surg Br Eur. 2005;30(1):90-91). This randomized study compared Velosorb™ Fast (Covidien) with Vicryl™ Rapide (Ethicon) in a rabbit model of intradermic suture and episiotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This randomized prospective study was performed on 20 New Zealand rabbits, in which we realized a mediolateral perineo-vaginal incision and two vertical skin incisions of about 8 cm on the abdominal wall. The sutures were randomized between Velosorb™ Fast (Covidien) and Vicryl™ Rapide (Ethicon), and each rabbit was treated with the same suture on both vaginal incision and left abdominal incision, while the right abdominal incision was closed with an alternate suture. A macroscopic examination was performed on days 5 and 11. On day 11, animals were sacrificed for histological (Badylak quantitative score) and electron microscopic examinations. Differences were considered significant at p < .05. RESULTS All of the rabbits survived and were included in the final results. Fifty-one sutures were visible by histologic analysis (27 in the Velosorb™ Fast group and 24 in the Vicryl™ Rapide group). The power of the study was ≥80%. There was no significant difference between the two groups based on the total histologic Badylak score analysis or the Badylak sub-score analysis. CONCLUSIONS Velosorb™ Fast seems to be as efficient as Vicryl™ Rapide for use in perineal and skin closure.","Vieille, P; Huberlant, S; Bastide, S; Bayon, Y; de Tayrac, R",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2014.981324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25437773/,44

The aim was to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of the mobile phones, identify bacterial isolates, assess their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and define the efficiency of using disinfectant. METHODOLOGY This study included 233 dental students from Near East University, Faculty of Dentistry. Swab samples taken from mobile phones before and after disinfection were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood medium and eosin methylene blue medium and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24-48 hours. Mold-growing mix cultures were sub-cultured on the sabouraud dextrose medium and allowed to grow at room temperature. Conventional microbiological techniques and VITEK 2 automated identification system were used for bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were verified by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique according to the European Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Committee criteria. Mold colonies were identified macroscopic and microscopically according to their phenotypic properties using lacto-phenol cotton blue stain. RESULTS Microbial contamination of mobile phones was 81% (120.953 cfu/ml) in swab samples taken without using alcohol-based wipes however, microbial contamination in swab samples taken after one-time disinfection was determined to be 21% (201 cfu/ml). The most common microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative Staphylococci (69%) and Aspergillus niger (13%). All of the isolated bacteria were susceptible to all antibiotics used. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the first data on the rate of microbial contamination on mobile phones in Northern Cyprus and the efficiency of the use of alcohol to disinfect the mobile phones.","Sadeeq, Tara; Arikan, Ayse; Sanlidag, Tamer; Guler, Emrah; Suer, Kaya",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242189/,44

140353,Role of lipids in virus replication.,2011,"Female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) is a common cause of infertility in India but its diagnosis remains elusive due to paucibacillary nature of disease. Traditional methods of diagnosis include demonstration of acid fast bacilli on endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma on the biopsy or positive gene Xpert on the biopsy, but they are positive in small percentage of cases only missing diagnosis in many cases. Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) alone is not taken for diagnosis due to high false positivity. Diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy can detect many cases by direct demonstration of TB lesions. Composite reference standard is a useful method to diagnose FGTB. This review discusses various diagnostic modalities including endometrial or peritoneal biopsy to detect acid fast bacilli on microscopic or culture or epithelioid granuloma, role of PCR, role of radiological imaging (hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI and PET-CT scan) and role of endoscopic techniques (laparoscopy and hysteroscopy) in diagnosis of FGTB including role of composite reference standard. The International and National studies highlight the role of composite reference standard and its components like demonstration of AFB on microscopy or culture of endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma or gene Xpert or PCR or latest tests like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) test and other newer molecular methods like Xpert Ultra for diagnosis of FGTB. It also detects role of endoscopy in FGTB and role of diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis of FGTB. Treatment is with four primary drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) for two months followed by three drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol) daily orally for 4 months for drug sensitive FGTB. Shorter Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen is given for Rifampicin resistant (RR)/MDR confined to only FGTB while longer all oral regimen is given for RR/MDR with or without additional drug resistance, HIV seropositives with FGTB or involvement of other sites or pulmonary TB (PTB) along with FGTB. Composite reference standard which combines various diagnostic modalities is a useful strategy to diagnose FGTB.","Sharma, Jai Bhagwan; Sharma, Eshani; Sharma, Sangeeta; Singh, Janmeeta; Chopra, Namita",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308655/,44

Detailed information on serious injuries, injury mechanisms and consequences are needed. The aim of this study was to describe and compare by injury mechanism the demographics, injuries, injury severity, and treatment of seriously injured road traffic trauma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed data on severe traffic injury trauma patients aged ≥16 years of the Helsinki Trauma Registry (HTR) covering the years 2009-2018. The variables analysed were basic patient demographics, injury mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes, injured body regions, patient Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) values, NISS groups (NISS 16-24 and NISS ≥25), AIS 3+ injuries, trauma bay and 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) at ICU and in hospital, surgeries performed, pre-injury classification, and intention of injury. RESULTS A total of 1 063 traffic injury patients were analysed; 38.6% were motor vehicle occupants, 28.5% motorcyclists or moped drivers, 17.2% bicyclists, and 15.7% pedestrians. The mean age of patients was 44.3 years (SD 20.2). Median ISS score was 22 and median NISS score was 27. Both scores were highest in pedestrians. Among all patients, total hospital LOS was 12 517 days (median 9) and total ICU LOS was 6 311 days (median 5). The most common AIS 3+ injuries according to ISS body regions were chest injuries (60%) and head or neck injuries (43.7%). Chest injuries occurred more frequently in motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants, whereas head or neck injuries were most common among bicyclists and pedestrians. CONCLUSIONS Severely injured pedestrians and bicyclists were older and they had higher mortality than motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants. According to NISS, the overall severity was highest among pedestrians followed by bicyclists. However, the both median ICU LOS and hospital LOS were highest for pedestrians but lowest for bicyclists. The most common AIS 3+ injuries were chest and head or neck injuries.

Six hundred and thirty-one participants completed an online survey (M = 39.2 years, SD = 10.5, Range = 18.0-70.0 years; Female: 63.4%). Most participants (59.1%) reported that they had not travelled in a rideshare vehicle with their youngest child (M = 7.2 years, SD = 5.2, Range = 0.0-17.0 years; Male: 54.2%). Participants who reported that they have travelled with their youngest child in a rideshare vehicle tended to: be younger, identify as male, have completed an Undergraduate or Postgraduate degree, reside in the Australian Capital Territory, earning a higher yearly household income, and were involved in an at-fault crash in the past two years. In addition, these participants were: less likely to have a 'younger' youngest child, less likely to 'always' wear a seatbelt while travelling in their private motor vehicle, and also less likely to 'always' restrain their child in an appropriate restraint while travelling in their private motor vehicle. Prohibitive reasons for not travelling in a rideshare vehicle included: cost (29.3%), concerns over driver safety (27.5%), concerns over travelling with children in a rideshare service (24.8%), or inconvenience (24.3%). Participants who reported that they had travelled in a rideshare vehicle with their youngest child reported lower rates of appropriate restraint use within the rideshare vehicle (57.3%) than when travelling in their private motor vehicle (85.6%). Reasons associated with inappropriate restraint use within the rideshare vehicle included: unavailability of a child restraint (39.6%), travelling a short distance (33.0%), were not required to use one in this situation (33.0%), or the parent did not have a restraint with them (26.4%). Given the increasing popularity of rideshare services in Australia, and globally, the urgent adaption of rideshare-specific policy, legislation, education, and design in relation to child restraint requirements is needed to ensure the safety of child occupants.","Koppel, Sjaan; Peiris, Sujanie; Aburumman, Mohammed; Wong, Chernyse W R; Owens, Justin M; Womack, Katie N",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501521/,44
141705,Structures and exoribonuclease activity fonctions in arenavirus and coronavirus.,2013-10-01,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid-origin cells which have immunosuppressive activities in several conditions, such as cancer and inflammation. Recent research has also associated MDSCs with numerous obstetrical and gynecological diseases. During pregnancy, MDSCs accumulate to ensure maternal-fetal immune tolerance, whereas they are decreased in patients who suffer from early miscarriage or preeclampsia. While the etiology of endometriosis is still unknown, abnormal accumulation of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid, alongside an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in these patients, which is central to the cellular immune regulations by MDSCs. Additionally, the regulation of MDSCs observed in tumors is also applicable to gynecologic neoplasms, including ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. More recently, emerging evidence has shown that there are high levels of MDSCs in premature ovarian failure (POF) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this review, the generation and mechanisms of MDSCs are summarized. In particular the modulation of these cells in immune-related obstetrical and gynecological diseases is discussed, including potential treatment options targeting MDSCs.","Zheng, Zi-Meng; Yang, Hui-Li; Lai, Zhen-Zhen; Wang, Cheng-Jie; Yang, Shao-Liang; Li, Ming-Qing; Shao, Jun",American journal of reproductive immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418253/,44

Despite these recommendations, the individual decision to adhere and wear a mask may not be a simple decision. In this article, we examine the decision to wear a mask from a social-ecological perspective. Through critical analysis of societal, interpersonal and community, and intrapersonal influences, it is clear that the decision to wear a mask is multifaceted and influenced by constructs including public health recommendations and government mandates, racism and cultural norms, geography, household income, age, and personal attitudes. Understanding the multifactorial influences on mask wearing during COVID-19 is crucial for informing the creation and distribution of inclusive public health messaging regarding mask wearing now in the midst of an unprecedented health crisis, and in future unforeseen public health emergencies.","Casola, Allison R; Kunes, Brianna; Cunningham, Amy; Motley, Robert J",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920983922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527852/,44

143753,Segmentectomy for lung cancer.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Covid19 has necessitated new methods of conducting outpatient consultations. At our institute, patient-facing paediatric ENT appointments were replaced with telemedical consultations. METHOD We performed a prospective analysis of the outcomes following telephone consultations with parents and describe our experience of remote consulting during a pandemic, and the possibilities for future applications of telemedicine in paediatric ENT. RESULTS 215 patients were appropriately referred to the paediatric ENT clinic, 65% of these patients were deemed suitable for remote telephone consultation. Following a telephone call, 50% did not need further ENT clinic management, most commonly due to being listed for surgery (20%) or discharged (18%). The treating consultant assessed 81% of phone consultations as being effective. When given the choice, patients reported that 29% would choose a telephone consultation whilst 43% preferred a face to face consultation. CONCLUSION Our experience has shown that there are areas of paediatric ENT that can be streamlined effectively by substituting face to face consultations with telephone consultations. However, prospective evaluation of these remote contacts suggest that telephone consultations are not a panacea and cannot be indiscriminately applied to all. Instead, the strategies to take forwards into a post Covid19 practice are vetting of referrals, individualised treatment plans, and giving patients a choice.","Sharma, Shradha; Daniel, Mat",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022557/,44

This study aims to assess the anticancer activity of the methanolic extract of A. absinthium (MEAA) against human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cell line. The cytotoxic effects of MEAA on HCT-116 cells was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. The expression levels of BAX and BCL-2 in HCT-116 cell line were examined by qRT-PCR. Annexin V/PI-flow cytometry technique was used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. MMP was predicted by Rhodamine 123 staining, and caspase 3 activity was analyzed by ELISA. Western blot method was performed to detect the expression level of BAX, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 proteins. The MTT test revealed MEAA reduced the viability of HCT-116 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of BAX increased, but those of BCL-2 decreased in MEAA-treated cells. MEAA also prompted cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. After adding MEAA, the protein level and activity of caspase 3 and MMP destruction significantly increased.

145611,Corrigendum.,2018,"BACKGROUND The optimal means of pre-operative risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To examine the accuracy of AF thromboembolic risk models (the CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 scores) for predicting 30-day stroke and/or all-cause mortality after non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative AF, and to compare these risk scores with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). PATIENTS/METHODS A multicentre (8 countries, 2007-2011) prospective cohort study of patients ≥ 45 years of age undergoing inpatient non-cardiac surgery, who were followed until 30 days after surgery. We calculated c-statistics for each risk prediction model and net reclassification improvements (NRIs) compared with the RCRI. RESULTS The 961 patients with preoperative AF were at higher risk of any cardiovascular event in the 30 days postoperatively compared with the 13 001 patients without AF: 26.6% vs. 9.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.88. All thromboembolic risk scores predicted postoperative death just as well as the RCRI (with c-indices between 0.67 and 0.72). Compared with the RCRI (which had a c-index of 0.64 for 30-day stroke/death), the CHADS2 (c-index, 0.67; NRI, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02-0.61) significantly improved postoperative stroke/mortality risk prediction, largely due to improved discrimination of patients who did not subsequently have an event. CONCLUSIONS In AF patients, the three thromboembolic risk scores performed similarly to the RCRI in predicting death within 30 days and the CHADS2 score was the best predictor of postoperative stroke/death regardless of type of surgery.","McAlister, F A; Jacka, M; Graham, M; Youngson, E; Cembrowski, G; Bagshaw, S M; Pannu, N; Townsend, D R; Srinathan, S; Alonso-Coello, P; Devereaux, P J",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.13110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270168/,44

METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review. A peer reviewed search strategy was developed in consultation with a specialist librarian. Several databases were searched to identify relevant studies including: Embase (using the OVID platform); MEDLINE (using the OVID platform); Psych info (using the OVID platform); Ageline (using the EBSCO platform); and CINHAL (using the EBSCO platform). Articles were screened by three reviewers with conflicts resolved in consultation with authors. Data charting was completed by one reviewer, with a quality check performed by a second reviewer. Key themes were then derived from the included studies. RESULTS The search yielded 778 unique articles, of which 20 were included. Articles were grouped by themes: regulatory requirements, funding issues, and organizational issues. CONCLUSION The highly regulated environment of LTC poses significant challenges which can influence the quality of care of residents with depression. Despite existing evidence around prevalence and improved treatment regimens, regulation appears to have failed to capture the best practice and contemporary knowledge available.

147878,Competition between the Photothermal Effect and Emission in Potential Phototherapy Agents.,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND Metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with cancer. Myeloid skewing of hematopoietic cells is a prominent promoter of metastasis. However, the reservoir of these cells in the bone marrow (BM) compartment and their differentiation pattern from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have not been explored. METHODS We used a unique model system consisting of tumor cell clones with low metastatic potential or high metastatic potential (met-low and met-high, respectively) to investigate the fate of HSPC differentiation using murine melanoma and breast carcinoma. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed on HSPC obtained from the BM of met-low and met-high tumors. A proteomic screen of tumor-conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis was performed to analyze the potential cross talk between cancer cells and HSPCs. Adoptive transfer of tumor-educated HSPC subsets obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ tagged mice was then carried out to identify the contribution of committed HSPCs to tumor spread. Peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients with breast and lung cancer were analyzed for HSPC subsets. RESULTS Mice bearing met-high tumors exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of HSPCs in the BM in comparison with tumor-free mice or mice bearing met-low tumors. ScRNA-seq analysis of these HSPCs revealed that met-high tumors enriched the monocyte-dendritic progenitors (MDPs) but not granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). A proteomic screen of tumor- conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis revealed that the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-IL-6 receptor axis is highly active in HSPC-derived MDP cells. Consequently, loss of function and gain of function of IL-6 in tumor cells resulted in decreased and increased metastasis and corresponding MDP levels, respectively. Importantly, IL-6-educated MDPs induce metastasis within mice bearing met-low tumors-through further differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages and not dendritic cells. Consistently, MDP but not GMP levels in peripheral blood of breast and lung cancer patients are correlated with tumor aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals a new role for tumor-derived IL-6 in hijacking the HSPC differentiation program toward prometastatic MDPs that functionally differentiate into immunosuppressive monocytes to support the metastatic switch.","Magidey-Klein, Ksenia; Cooper, Tim J; Kveler, Ksenya; Normand, Rachelly; Zhang, Tongwu; Timaner, Michael; Raviv, Ziv; James, Brian P; Gazit, Roi; Ronai, Ze'ev A; Shen-Orr, Shai; Shaked, Yuval",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140316/,44
148850,Assembly of Biomolecular Gigastructures and Visualization with the Vulkan Graphics API.,2021-09-16,"Cleavage of the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is indispensable for virus replication. Most IAVs possess a monobasic HA cleavage site cleaved by trypsin-like proteases. Previously, the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 was shown to be essential for proteolytic activation of IAV HA subtypes H1, H2, H7 and H10 in mice. In contrast, additional proteases are involved in activation of certain H3 IAVs, indicating that HAs with monobasic cleavage site can differ in their sensitivity to host proteases. Here, we investigated the role of TMPRSS2 in proteolytic activation of avian HA subtypes H1 to H11 and H14 to H16 in human and mouse airway cell cultures. Using reassortant viruses carrying representative HAs, we analysed HA cleavage and multicycle replication in (i) lung cells of TMPRSS2-deficient mice and (ii) Calu-3 cells and primary human bronchial cells subjected to morpholino oligomer-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity. TMPRSS2 was found to be crucial for activation of H1 to H11, H14 and H15 in airway cells of human and mouse. Only H9 with an R-S-S-R cleavage site and H16 were proteolytically activated in the absence of TMPRSS2 activity, albeit with reduced efficiency. Moreover, a TMPRSS2-orthologous protease from duck supported activation of H1 to H11, H15 and H16 in MDCK cells. Together, our data demonstrate that in human and murine respiratory cells, TMPRSS2 is the major activating protease of almost all IAV HA subtypes with monobasic cleavage site. Furthermore, our results suggest that TMPRSS2 supports activation of IAV with monobasic cleavage site in ducks. Importance Human infections with avian influenza A viruses upon exposure to infected birds are frequently reported and have received attention as a potential pandemic threat. Cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is a prerequisite for membrane fusion and essential for virus infectivity. In this study, we identify the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 as the major activating protease of avian influenza virus HAs of subtypes H1 to H11, H14 and H15 in human and murine airway cells. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity may provide a useful approach for the treatment of human infections with avian influenza viruses that should be considered for pandemic preparedness as well. Additionally, we show that a TMPRSS2-orthologous protease from duck can activate avian influenza virus HAs with a monobasic cleavage site and thus represents a potential virus-activating protease in waterfowl, the primary reservoir for influenza A viruses.","Bestle, Dorothea; Limburg, Hannah; Kruhl, Diana; Harbig, Anne; Stein, David A; Moulton, Hong; Matrosovich, Mikhail; Abdelwhab, Elsayed M; Stech, Jürgen; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00906-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319155/,44

Persuasive evidence suggests a strong association between SNS overactivity and variety of disease states, including chronic renal failure, insulin resistance, congestive heart failure, sleep apnoea, ventricular arrhythmias and others. Although sympatholytic agents are available to target SNS overactivity pharmacologically, they are not widely used in clinical practice, leaving the SNS unopposed in many patients. The recent introduction of catheter-based renal denervation as an alternative approach to target the SNS therapeutically has been demonstrated to result in a clinically relevant blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension, presumably through its effects on both efferent and afferent renal nerve traffic. Available data on this interventional procedure demonstrate a favourable vascular and renal safety profile. Preliminary data obtained primarily from small and mostly uncontrolled studies in related disease states often characterized by overactivity of the SNS are promising, but require confirmation in appropriately designed clinical trials. In the present paper, we briefly review the physiology of the renal nerves and their role in hypertension and other relevant disease states, summarize the data currently available from clinical studies pertaining to the safety and efficacy of renal denervation in resistant hypertension, discuss potential future implications and the available data supporting such a role for renal denervation, and describe some of the newer devices currently under investigation to achieve improved blood pressure control via renal denervation.","Xu, Jianzhong; Hering, Dagmara; Sata, Yusuke; Walton, Antony; Krum, Henry; Esler, Murray D; Schlaich, Markus P",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20120581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24020446/,44

As the marine system is the final sink for MP, there is an urgent need to develop methods for the monitoring of synthetic particles in different marine compartments and sample matrices. Extensive evaluations are hindered by time and costs associated with to conventional MP spectroscopic analyses. The potential of near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) has been recently evaluated. However, NIR-HSI has been poorly studied so far, limitedly to the detection of large particles (>300 μm), and its capability for direct characterization of MP in real marine matrices has not been considered yet. In the present study, a rapid near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) method, coupled with a customised normalised difference image (NDI) strategy for data processing, is presented and used to detect MP down to 50 μm in environmental matrices. The proposed method is largely automated, without the need for extensive data processing, and enabled a successful identification of different polymers, both in surface water and mussel soft tissue samples, as well as on real field samples with environmentally occurring MP. NIR-HSI is applied directly on filters, without the need for particles pre-sorting or multiple sample purifications, avoiding time consuming procedures, airborne contaminations, particle degradation and loss. Thanks to the time and cost effectiveness, a large-scale implementation of this method would enable to extensively monitor the MP presence in natural environments for assessing the ecological risk related to MP contamination.","Piarulli, Stefania; Malegori, Cristina; Grasselli, Ferrante; Airoldi, Laura; Prati, Silvia; Mazzeo, Rocco; Sciutto, Giorgia; Oliveri, Paolo",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399269/,44

152088,Extensive gene remodeling in the viral world: new evidence for nongradual evolution in the mobilome network.,2014,"OBJECTIVES Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, can infect cats and has proven zoonotic risks for owners. Infected cats typically present with a history of outdoor lifestyle and hunting behaviour, and cutaneous granulomas are most commonly observed. The aim of this study is to describe an outbreak of tuberculous disease commencing with six young cats, living exclusively indoors in five different households across England, being presented to separate veterinarians across the UK with a variety of clinical signs. METHODS Investigations into the pyogranulomatous lesions, lymphadenopathy and/or pulmonary disease of these cases consistently identified infection with M bovis. Infection was confirmed by PCR, where possible, or was indicated with a positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), where material for PCR was unavailable. In-contact, cohabiting cats were screened by IGRA and follow-up testing was undertaken/advised where results were positive. A lifestyle investigation was undertaken to identify the source of infection. RESULTS Six clinically sick cats and seven in-contact cats were identified with evidence of M bovis infection. Five clinical cases were either too sick to treat or deteriorated despite therapy, giving a mortality rate of 83%. Lifestyle investigations revealed the common factors between clusters to be that affected cats had mycobacterial infections speciated to M bovis, were exclusively indoor cats and were fed a commercially available raw food product produced by a single manufacturer. The Food Standards Agency, Animal & Plant Health Agency, Public Health England and the food manufacturer concerned have been notified/informed.

152936,The Experts Speak: A New Feature in the JICR.,2021-05-01,"Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, together with JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3. JAKs are important signaling mediators of many proinflammatory cytokines and represent compelling pharmacological targets for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pan-acting small-molecule JAK inhibitors were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. However, their limited selectivity among JAK members have led to undesirable side effects, driving a search toward specific JAK inhibitors. Recently, TYK2 has emerged as a target of choice for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19 with an optimum balance between efficacy and safety, based on observations from human genetics studies and clinical outcomes of several agents targeting cytokine pathways for which TYK2 plays an essential role. In this article, we address selective targeting of TYK2 from the genetic sequence space through development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against TYK2 mRNA. Potent ASO candidates were identified from the screening of over 200 ASOs using locked nucleic acid gapmer design. The lead ASOs exhibited potent and selective knockdown of TYK2 mRNA and protein across a panel of model human cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, showing no reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of other JAK paralogs. In agreement with the depletion of TYK2 proteins, several TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling pathways, including IFN-α and IL-12, were inhibited upon ASO treatment. Our results established the TYK2 ASOs as investigational tool compound and potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19.","Tran, Nhan Van; Nguyen, Le Tuan Anh; Lim, Kah Wai; Phan, Anh Tuân",ImmunoHorizons,https://doi.org/10.4049/immunohorizons.2000108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542028/,44
153199,Concerns Regarding the Article Entitled 'Safe Handling of Containers of Expressed Human Milk in all Settings During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)'.,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND Seroma formation is the most common postoperative complication after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Recurrence and seroma formation may be difficult to distinguish. Many adjunctive techniques with which to reduce the incidence of seroma formation after laparoscopic inguinal repair have been described in the literature; however, the evidence for using intraoperative adjunctive techniques is limited. Therefore, the present systematic review was performed to evaluate the effects and limitations of adjunctive techniques used during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Major databases (PubMed, Embase, Springer, and Cochrane Library) were searched using the terms ""seroma,"" ""laparoscopic inguinal hernia"", ""TAPP"", ""TEP"", ""inguinal hernia"", ""tack"", ""barbed suture"", ""drainage"", ""Endoloop technique"", and ""fibrin sealant"". All studies involving adults undergoing laparoscopic/endoscopic inguinal hernioplasty with at least one intervention designed to reduce seroma formation were included. RESULTS Of the 965 studies identified, 8 met the inclusion criteria. Six adjunctive techniques were described in the literature. Transversalis fascia (TF) inversion with tacking: one prospective non-randomized controlled study revealed a lower incidence of postoperative seroma after TF inversion with tacking for direct inguinal hernias (4.17% vs. 14.29%, P < 0.05). Endoloop technique: one prospective study of 76 cases involving this technique revealed a low incidence of seroma formation (3.9% at 2 weeks) in direct hernias. Barbed suture closure of TF: one prospective study of 36 direct hernias reported only one clinical palpable seroma that resolved 1 month later. Surgical drains: three trials reported the results of drains, and the pooling results demonstrated significantly less seroma formation in patients with surgical drains (2.1 vs. 23.8%; odds ratio 0.12; 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.19; P < 0.0001). Fibrin sealant: one prospective clinical study of 40 patients with indirect inguinal hernias reported a lower volume (P < 0.001) and lower incidence (5% vs. 15%) of seroma formation in the fibrin group. Distal sac fixation technique: in one prospective study of six patients with large inguinoscrotal hernias, one patient developed a seroma on postoperative day 8. CONCLUSION Seroma formation is a natural process that cannot be completely prevented following laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty, especially in patients with direct and large indirect inguinal hernias. Some intraoperative adjunctive techniques are effective in reducing clinically palpable seroma formation in select patients. More randomized controlled trials are needed for further evaluation.","Li, J; Gong, W; Liu, Q",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-01903-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734117/,44
154054,COVID-19 Amid Rumors and Conspiracy Theories: The Interplay Between Local and Global Worlds.,2021,"UNLABELLED RS7 is an internalizing anti-Trop-2 pancarcinoma antibody capable of targeting most epithelial cancers. Because pretargeting strategies could improve the tumor localization of radionuclides, a new anti-Trop-2 × antihapten bispecific antibody for pretargeting, based on humanized RS7, was prepared and evaluated with a radiolabeled hapten-peptide in vitro and in vivo to determine whether its internalization properties would interfere with pretargeting. METHODS The anti-Trop-2 × antihapten bispecific antibody, TF12, was prepared using the modular dock-and-lock method. TF12 and humanized RS7 binding was assessed by cell binding assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in a variety of human carcinoma cell lines. The internalization of TF12 was evaluated in vitro using a fluorescent TF12 conjugate or hapten-peptide and (111)In-labeled TF12 and RS7. The biodistribution of TF12 and its use as a pretargeting agent with an (111)In-labeled hapten-peptide were assessed in several human epithelial cancer xenografts. Dose optimization was examined in 2 tumor models. RESULTS TF12 internalizes, but a substantial fraction remained accessible on the tumor surface. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed only a minor change in fluorescent signal when the tumor was probed with a fluorescent hapten-peptide over 4 h, and microscopy showed substantial membrane staining when reassessed at 24 h after TF12 exposure. Only 40.1% of (111)In-TF12 was internalized after 24 h. In vivo, excellent tumor localization of the (111)In-labeled peptide was observed in several tumor models. CONCLUSION TF12 was retained sufficiently on the cell surface in several epithelial cancers, thereby making it suitable for pretargeted imaging and therapy of various Trop-2-expressing carcinomas.","Sharkey, Robert M; van Rij, Catharina M; Karacay, Habibe; Rossi, Edmund A; Frielink, Cathelijne; Regino, Celeste; Cardillo, Thomas M; McBride, William J; Chang, Chien-Hsing; Boerman, Otto C; Goldenberg, David M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.104364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22952342/,44
154144,Pasteurella multocida and bovine respiratory disease.,2007,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular strategies provide unique opportunity to correlate angiographic measures of collateral circulation at the time of endovascular therapy. We conducted systematic analyses of collaterals at conventional angiography on recanalization, reperfusion, and clinical outcomes in the endovascular treatment arm of the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III trial. METHODS Prospective evaluation of angiographic collaterals was conducted via central review of subjects treated with endovascular therapy in IMS III (n=331). Collateral grade before endovascular therapy was assessed with the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology scale, blinded to all other data. Statistical analyses investigated the association between collaterals with baseline clinical variables, angiographic measures of recanalization, reperfusion and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Adequate views of collateral circulation to the ischemic territory were available in 276 of 331 (83%) subjects. Collateral grade was strongly related to both recanalization of the occluded arterial segment (P=0.0016) and downstream reperfusion (P<0.0001). Multivariable analyses confirmed that robust angiographic collateral grade was a significant predictor of good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score≤2) at 90 days (P=0.0353), adjusted for age, history of diabetes mellitus, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale strata, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. The relationship between collateral flow and clinical outcome may depend on the degree of reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS More robust collateral grade was associated with better recanalization, reperfusion, and subsequent better clinical outcomes. These data, from the largest endovascular trial to date, suggest that collaterals are an important consideration in future trial design. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

ACE2 has a highly conserved, one-to-one ortholog, called ace2, in zebrafish, which is an important model for human diseases. However, zebrafish ace2 expression profile has not yet been studied during early development, between genders, across different genotypes, or in disease. Moreover, a network-based meta-analysis for the extraction of functionally enriched pathways associated with differential ace2 expression is lacking in the literature. Herein, we first identified significant development-, tissue-, genotype- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression via meta-analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107); and the correlation analysis of ace2 meta-differential expression profile revealed distinct positively and negatively correlated local functionally enriched gene networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and pathological conditions related to development, tissue, gender, diet, infection, and inflammation using additional RNAseq datasets. Our findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in organ differentiation and pathologies observed in the intestines and liver.","Keskus, Ayse Gokce; Tombaz, Melike; Arici, Burcin Irem; Dincaslan, Fatma Betul; Nabi, Afshan; Shehwana, Huma; Konu, Ozlen",Genome,https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2021-0033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606733/,44

156152,Assembly of Viral Membrane Proteins.,2009,"Selenium (Se) is considered a beneficial element to higher plants based on its regulation of antioxidative system under abiotic or biotic stresses. However, the limit of beneficial and toxic physiological effects of Se is very narrow. In the present study, the antioxidant performance, nutritional composition, long-distance transport of Se, photosynthetic pigments, and growth of Coffea arabica genotypes in response to Se concentration in solution were evaluated. Five Coffea arabica genotypes (Obatã, IPR99, IAC125, IPR100 and Catucaí) were used, which were grown in the absence and presence of Se (0 and 1.0 mmol L-1) in nutrient solution. The application of 1 mmol L-1 Se promoted root browning in all genotypes. There were no visual symptoms of leaf toxicity, but there was a reduction in the concentration of phosphorus and sulfur in the shoots of plants exposed to high Se concentration. Except for genotype Obatã, the coffee seedlings presented strategies for regulating Se uptake by reducing long-distance transport of Se from roots to shoots. The concentrations of total chlorophyll, total pheophytin, and carotenoids were negatively affected in genotypes Obatã, IPR99, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se at 1 mmol L-1. H2O2 production was reduced in genotypes IPR99, IPR100, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se, resulting in lower activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These results suggest that antioxidant metabolism was effective in regulating oxidative stress in plants treated with Se. The increase in sucrose, and decrease in SOD, CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, as well as Se compartmentalization in the roots, were the main biochemical and physiological modulatory effects of coffee seedlings under stress conditions due to excess of Se.","Mateus, Matheus Pereira de Brito; Tavanti, Renan Francisco Rimoldi; Galindo, Fernando Shintate; Silva, Anne Caroline da Rocha; Gouveia, Geraldo Candido Cabral; Aparecido, Camila Fernandes Ferreira; Carr, Natalia Fernandes; Feitosa, Yara Barros; Santos, Elcio Ferreira; Lavres, José; Reis, André Rodrigues Dos",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888590/,44

For example, the ""CFR"" has been interchangeably called the case fatality ratio, case fatality rate, and case fatality risk, often without standard mathematical definitions. The most commonly used CFR is thecase fatality ratio, typically constructed using the estimated number of deaths to date divided by the estimated total number of confirmed infected cases to date. How does this CFR relate to an infected individual's probability of death? To explore such issues, we formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality measures to show that neither of these are directly represented by the case fatality ratio. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. Using data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality estimates and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose more systematic methods to determine mortality during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and uncertainties in the data such as undertesting and heterogeneous populations.","Böttcher, Lucas; Xia, Mingtao; Chou, Tom",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/ab9e59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554901/,44

Background Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in humans in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease subsequently spread rapidly, leading to a global pandemic.1 The predominant modes of transmission for COVID-19 are through direct or close contact with an infected person via respiratory droplets, or indirectly via contact with contaminated fomites.2 The median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5-6 days, ranging from 1 to 14 days.3,4 The infectious period remains uncertain; however, it is estimated to be from 48 hours before symptoms develop until two weeks after symptom onset.3,5 The predominant symptoms reported in COVID-19 cases are cough, sore throat, fatigue, runny nose and fever.6 The majority of cases recover from the disease without clinical intervention; however, approximately 20% of global cases result in more severe outcomes, such as shortness of breath and pneumonia, necessitating hospitalisation and the requirement of additional oxygen or ventilation.7,8 Severe or fatal outcomes are generally more common among elderly cases or those with comorbid conditions.8 A visual depiction of the severity spectrum of COVID-19, and of the data sources that we use in this report to measure aspects of severity, is provided in Figure 1.",,Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499798/,44

Autonomous robotic surgery-removing the surgeon's hands-promises enhanced efficacy, safety, and improved access to optimized surgical techniques. Surgeries involving soft tissue have not been performed autonomously because of technological limitations, including lack of vision systems that can distinguish and track the target tissues in dynamic surgical environments and lack of intelligent algorithms that can execute complex surgical tasks. We demonstrate in vivo supervised autonomous soft tissue surgery in an open surgical setting, enabled by a plenoptic three-dimensional and near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging system and an autonomous suturing algorithm. Inspired by the best human surgical practices, a computer program generates a plan to complete complex surgical tasks on deformable soft tissue, such as suturing and intestinal anastomosis. We compared metrics of anastomosis-including the consistency of suturing informed by the average suture spacing, the pressure at which the anastomosis leaked, the number of mistakes that required removing the needle from the tissue, completion time, and lumen reduction in intestinal anastomoses-between our supervised autonomous system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and clinically used RAS approaches. Despite dynamic scene changes and tissue movement during surgery, we demonstrate that the outcome of supervised autonomous procedures is superior to surgery performed by expert surgeons and RAS techniques in ex vivo porcine tissues and in living pigs.

The objective of the study was to establish an overview of the literature that has examined prosthetic and orthotic interventions with a view to inform policy development. METHODS Fourteen databases were searched from 1995-2015. Studies reporting primary research on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of prosthetic and orthotic interventions were examined. Metadata and information on study characteristics were extracted from the included studies. RESULTS The searches resulted in a total of 28,958 articles, a focus on studies with the words ""randomized"" OR ""randomized"" OR ""cost"" OR ""economic"" in their citation reduced this total to 2644. Research has predominantly been conducted in Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, UK and USA. A total of 346 randomized controlled trials were identified, with only four randomized controlled trials examining prosthetic interventions. The majority of research examined lower limb orthoses in the adult population and used a wide range of outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS While various international organizations have highlighted the value of providing prosthetic and orthotic services, both to the user and society as a whole, the availability of scientific research to inform policy is limited. Future structured evaluation of prosthetic and orthotic interventions/services is warranted to inform future policy developments. Implications for rehabilitation Research into prosthetic and orthotic interventions has grown substantially in the last 20 years, with most of this research conducted in a small number of countries and focusing on the use of lower limb orthotics in adult populations. Research to date has utilized an extensive range of outcome measures, the development of agreed standardized sets of outcomes would allow comparison and combination of results in future research. This study highlights the need for further research in this area, especially studies which examine the cost-effectiveness of prosthetic and orthotic provision.","Healy, Aoife; Farmer, Sybil; Eddison, Nicola; Allcock, Jonathan; Perry, Thomas; Pandyan, Anand; Chockalingam, Nachiappan",Disability and rehabilitation.

Financial rewards have been proposed to incentivise participation in programmes promoting PA or the achievement of PA-related goals. This review will assess (1) effects of financial incentives provided by employers to promote PA on programme adherence/compliance, PA and closely linked outcomes (eg, days of sick leave), (2) effects according to age, gender, implementation and study quality and (3) intervention costs and cost-effectiveness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search for relevant studies in eight academic databases, two grey literature resources, two trial registers and on five organisational websites (oldest record/content to present). We will include (cluster) randomised controlled studies with a financial incentive to promote PA as intervention (≥1 months), conducted among employees in HIC and reporting data on at least one primary outcome in stages of screening (title/abstract, full text). To assess study quality and potential bias, we will use the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). We will extract study data into prepiloted extraction sheets. Each task in screening, quality assessment and data extraction will be done by two authors independently. If a sufficient number of studies provide homogeneous data (ie, similar follow-up) for primary outcomes, meta-analyses will be carried out. We will report GRADE ratings to provide information on the certainty of the evidence.

METHODS A total of 51 patients, presented to hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were included in the study. The diagnosis of all patients included in the study was made according to the WHO interim guideline. The patients were divided into two subgroups as mild and severe course according to the severity of the disease. RESULTS Neurological symptoms were detected in 16 (31.37 %) patients. Muscle injury was detected in 10 (19.61 %) patients. The most common neurological symptom was headache (n: 9, 17.65 %). When the frequency of all neurological symptoms was compared in those with severe and mild disease, no significant differences were found between the groups. When the frequency of muscular involvement was compared in patients with severe and mild course, no significant differences were found between the groups. CONCLUSION The nervous system and skeletal muscle system may be among viral targets. Detection of some neurological findings may be valuable in predicting the course of the disease. Some laboratory values can allow predicting disease severity and neurological symptoms (Tab. 5, Ref. 23) Keywords: COVID-19, neurotropism, muscle injury, headache.","Altunisik, E; Sayiner, H S; Aksoz, S; Cil, E; Ozgenc, G",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2021_004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393319/,44

To combat loneliness and isolation among older adults residing in California, the Keck School of Medicine collaborated with other health profession schools at the University of Southern California (USC) to create the Age-Friendly Student Senior Connection (AFSSC). A total of 115 interprofessional graduate students were linked with older adults. Students engaged in 30 to 60 minute phone calls with older adults 2 to 5 times per week for 6 weeks. Student preparation included asynchronous video and web-based learning, weekly synchronous de-briefing sessions with a participating faculty member via Zoom, phone, and e-mail support from faculty, and information about resources for older adults. Faculty held weekly meetings throughout the pilot and developed new resources to respond to older adult needs, as reported by students.

164564,Corona XXXVII – speed of thought,2021,"Background: Infection is a remarkable cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Objectives: We aimed to determine the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in our patients with SLE and the factors affecting this course Methods: SLE patients (2012 SLICC criteria) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by a positive PCR test and/or typical findings of lung involvement in CT (computed tomography) imaging were included. Data regarding cumulative clinical and laboratory characteristics, histopathology results, autoantibody profiles, immunsuppressives and damage (SLICC damage index/SDI)) were retrieved from the existing database and revised. SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) was determined at the time of infection. Results: Sixteen SLE patients with COVID-19 infection were identified. Most (87.5%) of these patients were female. Seventy % (n=11) had lupus nephritis. Twenty-five % had thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. PCR was positive in 70% (n=11) of the patients. Pulmonary parenchymal findings compatible with COVID-19 were observed in 56% (n=9) of those patients. Regarding complaints upon admission, 50% (n=8) had fever, 44% (n=7) cough, 44% (n=7) dyspnea, 19% (n=3) myalgia, 12.5% (n=2) headache, 12.5% (n=2) nausea /vomiting, 6% (n=1) diarrhea, and 6 % (n=1) had anosmia. Eight patients were hospitalized. Six of these patients needed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. None needed a follow-up in the intensive care unit. The mean hospitalization duration was 14 ± 5 (8-25) days. Regarding disease activity at the time of infection, 9 had inactive disease with a SLEDAI-2K score of 0 whilst in 5 patients SLEDA-2K score was ≥4. The mean SLEDAI-2K score at the time of infection was 1.7 ± 2.3 (0-6). System/ organwise, 1 patient with chronic thrombocytopenia presented with a worsening platelet count accompanied by serologic activity. This patient was a non-adherent to treatment who had stopped taking mycophenolic acid months before COVID19. Three patients 2 of whom had proliferative nephritis experienced nephritic flares.1 patient who had a history of cutaneous lupus and was in remission presented with oral ulcer, leukopenia and hypocomplementemia during infection. Of 16 patients, 7 had system damage at the time of infection. The mean SDI score of the patients was 1.4±1.8. Comparison of patients with and without damage revealed no significant differences in disease activity, symptoms associated with COVID, in the need for hospitalization, hospitalization duration, and the requirement for oxygen therapy. However,CT findings compatible with COVID19, were more common in patients with damage (87% vs.33%,p=0.04) and their mean CRP levels were higher at diagnosis (65 ± 47 vs.22 ± 48 mg/l;p=0.032). All patients received similar treatment for COVID-19 except active patients who required high dose steroids (2 with active renal, 1 with thrombocytopenia and 1 with oral ulcer, leukopenia and hypocomplementemia).The patient with thrombocytopenia also received intravenous immunoglobulin and 1 with cutaneous active disease received tocilizumab as she developed macrophage activation syndrome. Six patients (37.5%) had received rituximab (RTX) in the last 6 months before COVID. No significant difference, in terms of hospitalization and need for oxygen therapy due to COVID19 was found between patients who had received RTX vs who had not. No hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in patients who received RTX despite lower levels of IgG (998 ± 184 vs 1481± 51 mg/dl, p=0.02) Conclusion: Although half of the patients in our series of COVID19 infected SLE patients required hospitalization, there were no mortalities. More patients with damage (none pulmonary) displayed CT findings compatible with COVID19 and further follow up will reveal whether they will suffer from fibrotic lung disease. Patients can experience disease flares during COVID. But it is also important to consider that some manifestations such as thrombocytopenia may also be a sign of severe infection. Immunosupressive agents may not have a negative impact on the course of infection.","Cetin, C.; Aliyeva, N.; Yaļinkaya, Y.; Gül, A.; Inanc, M.; Artim-Esen, B.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.368,44
164658,VeTra: a tool for trajectory inference based on RNA velocity,2021-04-29,"The control of the COVID-19 epidemics has been one of top global health priorities for the last eighteen months. To that end, more reliable and easy-to-use diagnostic tests are necessary. Young children are still not eligible to vaccination and it is important to find a way to easily test this key population regularly. With that in mind, we evaluated a new innovative easy two-step self-test named COVID-VIRO ALL IN developed by AAZ that uses a sampling nasal sponge instead of a classic nasal swab. Mirroring the previous study conducted on the first generation of COVID-VIRO antigenic self-test, we first performed a multicentre, prospective study on 124 adults and children, in a point-of-care setting. Sensitivity, specificity and overall acceptance of the COVID-VIRO ALL IN antigen self-test compared to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples were evaluated at 93.02%, 100% and 97,5%, respectively. We then performed a multicentre, prospective, usability study to evaluate the ease of use of COVID-VIRO ALL IN in real life on 68 laypersons, all adults. Globally, 99% of them considered the instructions material good, 98% executed the procedure well, and all of them interpreted the results correctly. The usability was then specifically investigated on 40 children and teenagers participants, comparing both COVID-VIRO first generation and the new COVID-VIRO ALL IN. All of them found COVID-VIRO ALL IN much easier to use and much more comfortable. For young children, the COVID-VIRO ALL IN self-test appears to be safer (less risk of trauma compare to nasal swabs and no liquid exposure) easier to use than classic COVID self-tests and giving immediate result which is not the case for RT-PCR done on saliva samples (currently done in routine for kids in French schools). It could be an adapted tool for future mass screening campaigns in schools or at home under adult supervision for kids from the age of 3.","prazuck, t.; Gravier, A.; Pires-Roteira, D.; Theillay, A.; Pallay, S.; Colin, M.; Serreau, R.; Hocqueloux, L.; Cassuto, N.

167539,Regulation of cGAS activity through RNA-mediated phase separation,2020-09-28,"Background and Purpose: Stroke represents one of the most important causes of morbidity (eighty million patients with disabling of ongoing effects of stroke at a given time, globally) and mortality (the second leading cause of death) worldwide. Innovative systems biology-based approach is likely to increase the understanding of the underpinning of acute stroke promise to enhance stroke prevention, acute treatment, and neurorehabilitation. Recent growing body of evidence with shared pathobiology with COVID-19 and the critically important role of inflammation in the context of stroke points to far-reaching consequences of acute stroke, just as in the case of COVID-19 ( post-acute event issues as well as long term issues ). So far, stroke typically defined by late-appearing disease manifestation by the range of stroke subtypes as defined by the WHO or American Stroke Association. This definition neglects the underlying pathobiological mechanisms such as low-grade chronic inflammation and already compromised vascular system. Diseases such as stroke is hardly a simple result of a single problem, but rather a complex cascade of pathobiological processes and interactions in a complex biochemical environment. The evidence of changes in innate immunity and adaptive immunity during the index event of acute stroke and recovery over next 3-12 months can be easily elicited with simple bedside blood tests such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with well over 300 published papers including several systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirming this. Global standard operating procedures (SOP) of stroke care dictated by the national and international stroke guidelines at present. It is imperative to explore the evidence of systems biology approach in current stroke guidelines. This is likely to be a key turning point in managing stroke across the continuum (prevention, management of acute event and rehabilitation). Methods: We systematically searched for guideline recommendation on the day-to-day use of peripheral inflammatory markers such as NLR published in the English language between January 1, 2005, and December 2020. Any other evidence of systems biology-based approach or recommendation was explored within the selected guidelines for this scoping review. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 4 authors to determine clinical scenarios explained/given, scientific evidence used, and recommendations presented in the context of systems biology. Results: The scoping review found 3,830 (3830) titles with 119 guidelines from 46 countries included for this review (Figure 1; PRISMA diagram). Stroke-related organizations wrote Sixty-five per cent of the guidelines while national ministries wrote a fewer number of guidelines. We were primarily interested in recommendations for acute management in AIS published in the English language. Fifteen eligible guidelines were identified from 15 different countries/regions. None of the guidelines recommended the routine use of peripheral markers of inflammation, such as NLR, among their acute assessment and management recommendations. None of the existing guidelines explored the systems biology approach to one of the most complex diseases affecting the human brain, stroke. Conclusions: This systematic review has identified a significant evidence-practice gap in all existing national stroke guidelines published in English medium as of October 2020. These guidelines included the only current living stroke guidelines, Stroke Guidelines from Australia with a real opportunity to modernize the living stroke guidelines with systems biology approach and provide 2020 vision towards better stroke care globally. Investigation of complex disease such as stroke is best served through a systems biology approach. One of the easiest places to start is simple blood tests such as total white cell count and NLR. Systems biology approach point us towards simple tools such immune-inflammatory index (SII), Sunshine Prognostic Score (SPS) which should pave the way for the stroke physician community address the challenges in systems biology approach in stroke care. These challenges include translating bench research to the bedside, managing big data ( continuous pulse, blood pressure, sleep, Oxygen saturation, progressive changes in NLR, SII, SPS, etc.). Working with an interdisciplinary team is also provide a distinct advantage.","Wijeratne, T.; Sales, C.; Karimi, L.; Jakovljevic, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251660v1?rss=1,44
167629,Chronic oxytocin-driven alternative splicing of CRFR2α induces anxiety,2020-08-19,"Oscar Schofield, a Rutgers University professor who is also a coprincipal investigator (PI) for the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, was on a research cruise off the West Antarctic peninsula in February 2020 when he first saw news of the increasingly rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. Field research in Antarctica always requires months of planning. Everyone has to go through a rigorous medical evaluation and researchers have to package up their equipment and ship it to designated ports for transport arranged by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The logistics are so complicated that Schofield says he is typically home from the field no more than 3 weeks before it is time to start planning the next season. But in March 2020, with the virus raging, Antarctic researchers knew they were in for more uncertainty and surprises than usual. Program officers at the NSF, which funds most US Antarctic research, were working with international partners to assess fieldwork prospects on the continent during the pandemic. Eventually, they created a three tiered system, says Karla Heidelberg, program director for the NSF's Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program in the Office of Polar Programs. While recognizing that sending no one would jeopardize the infrastructure at the various stations, she says that the NSF determined early on that the 2020 to 2021 summer season would be greatly scaled back. The LTER sites and other American research projects in Antarctica look at everything from penguins and seals to phytoplankton and nematodes to atmospheric conditions and glaciers. Polar regions are responding faster than other latitudes to global warming, so they are a focus of climate change research across many disciplines. Instead of close to 10 researchers, this year, just three students tagged seals and collected biometric data that will be used to estimate breeding and survival rates. The McMurdo LTER project did not get to send a single researcher. Despite the frustration and the uncertainty, researchers report that the overall scientific integrity of most studies remains intact, and the impacts are not devastating. Funding agencies and scientists expect they will again have delays and last-minute decisions for the 2021 to 2022 Antarctic summer field season. But Cannone sees one benefit the pandemic brought to Antarctic science.","Mayer, A.",BioScience,https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab031,44

An international standard for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been established to achieve comparability of such tests, allowing conversions to BAU/ml. This study aimed to investigate the comparability of antibody tests regarding the timing of blood collection after vaccination. Methods For this prospective observational study, antibody levels of 50 participants with homologous AZD1222 vaccination were evaluated at 3 and 11 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second dose using two commercial anti-Spike binding antibody assays (Roche and Abbott) and a surrogate neutralization assay (sVNT). Results The correlation between Roche and Abbott changed significantly depending on the time point studied. Although 3 weeks after the first dose, Abbott provided values three times higher than Roche, 11 weeks after the first dose, the values for Roche were twice as high as for Abbott, and 3 weeks after the second dose even 5-6 times higher. Conclusions The comparability of quantitative anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is highly dependent on the timing of blood collection after vaccination. Therefore, standardization of the timing of blood collection might be necessary for the comparability of different quantitative SARS-COV-2 antibody assays.","Perkmann, T.; Mucher, P.; Perkmann-Nagele, N.; Radakovics, A.; Repl, M.; Koller, T.; Schmetterer, K.

This technique can be considered for surface clearance of larger areas;hence, there is the need to investigate its effectiveness regarding the pandemic. There are many examples of the use of drones for disinfection to improve epidemic situations, but good practices, as well as factors influencing effectiveness, have not yet been identified. In the case of using drones for disinfection during a pandemic, the adapted use of agricultural drones is clear from reports. In this paper, the authors performed calculations with different values of flight speed (10 to 50 km/h), flight altitude (1 to 5 m), and flow rate (1 to 5 L/min) to determine the possible amount of disinfectant fluid per unit area. The results show that by changing the parameters, the amount of disinfectant per unit area can be given within quite wide limits (30–0.24 g/m2).

Methods: A prospective cohort study enrolled 30 lactating women who received an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine between January and April 2021. Women provided serial milk samples, which included milk expressed before vaccination, milk expressed across 2-3 weeks after the first dose, and milk expressed across 3 weeks after the second dose. Women also were asked to provide their blood, spotted on cards (dried blood spots; DBS) 19 days after the first dose and 21 days after the second dose. Stool samples from the breastfed infants were collected 21 days after mothers received their second dose. Pre-pandemic samples of milk, DBS cards, and infant stool from prior studies were also utilized. Milk and infant stool samples were tested by ELISA for receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG. Milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the spike and four variants of concern (VOCs): D614G, B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P.1 (gamma). Milk samples were also tested by electrochemiluminescence assay for levels of 10 cytokines. Results: Milk from COVID-19-immunized women neutralized the spike and four VOCs and this response is primarily IgG-driven. The immune response in milk also included significantly elevated levels of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}). The immune response to maternal vaccination was reflected in breastfed babies; anti-RBD IgG and anti-RBD IgA was detected in 33% and 30% of infant stool samples, respectively. Levels of anti-RBD antibodies in infant stool correlated with maternal vaccine side-effects. Conclusion: Humoral and cellular immune responses to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination are present in the breastmilk of most women.

We present a System Dynamics Model approach for simulating the patient reaction using two key control parameters (i) virulence, which can be “moderate” or “high” and (ii) patient precondition, which can be “healthy”, “not so healthy” or “serious preconditions”. In particular, we study the behaviour of Inflammatory (M1) Alveolar Macrophages, IL6 and Active Adaptive Immune system as indicators of the immune system response, together with the COVID viral load over time. The results show that it is possible to build an initial model of the system to explore the behaviour of the key attributes involved in the patient condition, virulence and response. The model suggests aspects that need further study so that it can then assist in choosing the correct immunomodulatory treatment, for instance the regime of application of an Interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor (tocilizumab) that corresponds to the projected immune status of the patients. We introduce machine learning techniques to corroborate aspects of the model and propose that a dynamic model and machine learning techniques could provide a decision support tool to ICU physicians.

Methods: We have made an effort in this paper to study the edible insect composition of Manas National Park, a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve, located in the In do-Burma biodiversity hotspot of Southern Asia. Edible insect variety was determined through a field reconnaissance while the nutrient composition (macronutrient and micronutrient) of each edible insect species was computed through biochemical analyses with a view to explore the possibility of promoting them as food/feed or as a base for nutritive products. We conducted nutrient profiling using the Nutrient Value Score (NVS) model and UK Ofcom nutrient profiling (NP) model. Results: Hymenoptera and Orthoptera were found to be the dominant orders with 4 species each, followed by Hemiptera with 3 species, Lepidoptera with 2 species, Mantodea, Blattodea and Coleoptera with 1 species each. The nutrient analysis shows that insects have a rich nutrient composition that is comparable with typical livestock.

The CD9 - EWI-F complex displays a tetrameric arrangement with two centrally positioned EWI-F molecules, dimerized through their ectodomains, and two CD9 molecules, one bound to each EWI-F single-pass transmembrane helix through CD9-helices h3 and h4. In the crystal structures, nanobodies 4C8 and 4E8 bind CD9 at the C and D loop, in agreement with 4C8 binding at the ends of the CD9 - EWI-F cryo-EM complex. Overall, the 4C8 - CD9 - EWI-F - EWI-F - CD9 - 4C8 complexes varied from nearly two-fold symmetric (i.e. with the two CD9 - 4C8 copies in nearly anti-parallel orientation) to ca. 50° bent arrangements. Since membrane helices h1 and h2 and the EC2 D-loop have been previously identified as sites for tetraspanin homo-dimerization, the observed linear but flexible arrangement of CD9 - EWI-F with potential CD9 - CD9 homo-dimerization at either end provides a new ‘concatenation model’ for forming short linear or circular assemblies, which may explain the occurrence of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.","Oosterheert, Wout; Xenaki, Katerina T.; Neviani, Viviana; Pos, Wouter; Doulkeridou, Sofia; Manshande, Jip; Pearce, Nicholas M.; Kroon-Batenburg, Loes M.

176693,Constitutive IFNα protein production in bats,2021-06-22,"Background: Taqman one-step real-time PCR (RT-PCR) has special importance due to its high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as viral infections. In the recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic kits based on this method are commonly used for molecular detection. One of the main systematic errors that misinterpret the results is using inaccurate internal control in RT-PCR diagnostic kits. Designing primers and probes that span exon-exon junction will avoid genomic DNA amplification and lead to obtaining high specific results. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the endogenous internal control of primers and probe for RNase P RNA to reduce false-negative results in respiratory samples. Methods: In this study, 30 samples of patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B were re-evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 using newly designed primers and probes for RNase P RNA (ultra-specific primers and probe). We also performed bioinformatics analysis on CDC-approved primers and probes of RNase P endogenous internal control. Results: In this analysis, we specified the location of these newly designed primers and probe on target mRNA and genomic DNA. Then, the Taqman one-step RT-PCR method was performed using both CDC-approved primers and probes along with our ultra-specific primers and probe for RNase P RNA. Based on bioinformatics analysis, the attachment sites of the CDC-approved primers and probe for endogenous internal control of RNase P are located on the first exon of this gene. In addition to identifying the target gene sequence, these primers and probe also non-specifically detect similar sequences on the genomic DNA. Conclusions: The present study showed that the use of specific primers and probes introduced by CDC for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus may cause false results due to non-specific binding to the genomic DNA. Therefore, choosing the right internal control for RNase P RNA can be useful in achieving very accurate results.","Choobin, H.; Asiyabi, S.; Hesamizadeh, K.; Bamdad, T.",Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.116533,44

Local, population-level, real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness is accumulating. We assessed vaccine effectiveness for community-dwelling New York City (NYC) residents using a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design, leveraging a period (January 12-March 9, 2021) when [≥]65-year-olds were vaccine-eligible but younger persons, excluding essential workers, were not. Methods: We constructed segmented, negative binomial regression models of age-specific COVID-19 hospitalization rates among 45-84-year-old NYC residents during a post-vaccination program implementation period (February 21-April 17, 2021), with a discontinuity at age 65 years. The relationship between age and hospitalization rates in an unvaccinated population was incorporated using a pre-implementation period (December 20, 2020-February 13, 2021). We calculated the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the interaction between implementation period (pre or post) and age-based eligibility (45-64 or 65-84 years). Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity and borough of residence. Similar analyses were conducted for COVID-19 deaths. Results: Hospitalization rates among 65-84-year-olds decreased from pre- to post-implementation periods (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97), controlling for trends among 45-64-year-olds. Accordingly, an estimated 721 (95% CI: 126-1,241) hospitalizations were averted. Residents just above the eligibility threshold (65-66-year-olds) had lower hospitalization rates than those below (63-64-year-olds). Racial/ethnic groups and boroughs with higher vaccine coverage generally experienced greater reductions in RR point estimates. Uncertainty was greater for the decrease in COVID-19 death rates (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.10). Conclusion: The vaccination program in NYC reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among the initially age-eligible [≥]65-year-old population by approximately 15%. The real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness makes it more imperative to improve vaccine access and uptake to reduce inequities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Greene, S.

180468,Index for Volume III,2007-12-31,"CD8+ T cell immune monitoring aims at measuring the numbers and functions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations engaged during immune responses, providing insights into the magnitude and quality of cell-mediated immunity operational in a test subject. The selection of peptides for ex vivo CD8+ T cell detection is critical, however, because for each restricting HLA class I molecule present in a human individual there is a multitude of potential epitopes within complex antigens, and HLA diversity between the test subjects predisposes CD8+ T cell responses to individualized epitope recognition profiles. We report here on a brute force CD8+ T cell epitope mapping approach for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pp65 antigen on ten HLA-A*02:01-matched HCMV infected human subjects. In this approach, in each test subject, every possible CD8+ T cell epitope was systematically tested; that is 553 individual peptides that walk the sequence of the HCMV pp65 protein in steps of single amino acids. Highly individualized CD8+ T cell response profiles with aleatory epitope recognition patterns were observed. We compared the actually detected epitope utilization in each individual with epitope prediction ranking for the shared HLA-A*02:01 allele, and for additional HLA class I alleles expressed by each individual. No correlation was found between epitopes’ ranking on the prediction scale and their actual immune dominance. The data suggest that accurate CD8+ T cell immune monitoring might depend on the agnostic reliance on mega peptide pools, or brute force mapping, rather than individualized epitope predictions.","Lehmann, Alexander; Zhang, Ting; Reche, Pedro A; Lehmann, Paul V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.371633,44
180674,What’s left in the tank? Identification of non-ascribed aquarium’s coral collections with DNA barcodes as part of an integrated diagnostic approach,2020-11-12,"BackgroundMinerva Biotechnologies has opened a Phase I 1st-in-human CAR T clinical trial, NCT-04020575, for metastatic breast cancers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. huMNC2-CAR44 targets the truncated extra cellular domain of MUC1* (muk 1 star), which is the transmembrane cleavage product that remains after MUC1 is cleaved and the tandem repeat domain is shed from the cancer cells. No therapeutic that targets MUC1* has ever been tested in humans. All previous, failed attempts to therapeutically target MUC1 have targeted the tandem repeat domains, which are cleaved and shed from the surface of cancer cells. MUC1 cleavage increases as tumor stage increases. Cleavage and shedding of the tandem repeat domain unmasks an ectopic binding site for onco-embryonic growth factor NME7AB. The antibody fragment that targets the CAR to the tumor competes with NME7AB for binding to this same ectopic site. MUC1* growth factor receptor is activated when onco-embryonic growth factor NME7AB dimerizes its truncated extra cellular domain.MethodsAutologous huMNC2-CAR44 T cells undergo a short 11-day manufacturing process, which includes an antigen stimulation step and preserves many of the cells in the naïve and central memory state. Patients are pre-treated with standard Cy-Flu lymphodepletion. Dose escalation phase is standard 3 × 3 with a starting dose 3.3 × 10e5 CAR T cells and going up to 1.0 × 10e7 cells. Patients are eligible if biopsy is greater than or equal to 30% reactive with MNC2 in a CLIA validated diagnostic assay.ResultsIn vitro, huMNC2-CAR44 T cells killed cancer cells, but not non-cancer cells even if they expressed MUC1 or a normal form of cleaved MUC1. In NSG mice (n&gt;300), huMNC2-CAR44 T cells eliminated MUC1* positive tumors from implanted breast cancer cells. A single CAR T cell injection eliminated tumors for 100 days;control animals had to be sacrificed at Day 20. Further, huMNC2-CAR44 T cell mediated killing increased as MUC1* density increased. In tissue micro array studies, huMNC2-scFv recognized 95% of breast cancers, across all subtypes, 83% ovarian, 78% pancreatic and 71% of lung cancers. huMNC2-scFv showed almost no binding to normal tissues and no staining of critical organs. Although patient recruitment has been slowed by COVID-19, preliminary results indicate CAR T cell expansion and possible efficacy.ConclusionsPreliminary results show that patients experienced robust CAR T cell expansion with CAR-positive T cells persisting at Day 60 post huMNC2-CAR44 T cell treatment.

Hypervariable region-1 (HVR-1) of E2 is a putative intrinsically disordered protein tail. Here, we demonstrate that HVR-1 has an autoinhibitory function that suppresses the activity of E1E2 on free virions; this is dependent on its conformational entropy. Crucially, to allow entry, this mechanism is turned off by host receptor interactions at the cell surface. Thus, HVR-1 is akin to a safety catch on E1E2 activity. Mutations that reduce conformational entropy in HVR-1, or genetic deletion of HVR-1, turn off the safety catch to generate hyper-reactive HCV that exhibits enhanced virus entry but is thermally unstable and acutely sensitive to neutralising antibodies. Therefore, the HVR-1 safety catch controls the efficiency of virus entry and maintains resistance to neutralising antibodies.","Stejskal, Lenka; Kalemera, Mphatso D.; Palor, Machaela; Walker, Lucas; Daviter, Tina; Lees, William D.; Moss, David S.; Kremyda-Vlachou, Myrto; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Rosenberg, William; Illingworth, Christopher J.

Some entities were closed, but the biggest market players were able to concentrate their efforts on interacting with visitors through social networks, public attention, frequent press mentions and discussions of influencers as synergies of communication policy tools. The purpose of the paper is to make proposals for improving the communication policy of cinema chains under new challenges. Based on a system analysis and indices of activity in social media of ten key Ukrainian cinema chains during the COVID-19 period, the main trends of their behavior and vision of development were determined. Changes were detected in the product strategy. To increase the effectiveness of communication policy, a focus should be on enhanced communications with consumers, especially through the implementation of a content-plan for publications on Facebook and Instagram, including facts from the lives of actors or filmmaking process, uniting followers around the filming theme, interacting, etc. Based on the above, the proposals are made to strengthen communication policy: activating posting frequency, generating more interesting content, and focusing on engaging with the followers. It turned out that such changes affect the key quality efficiency of social media marketing in two cinema chains. Such events rebuild the online community of moviegoers, which fosters loyalty and increases in visitors in the post-pandemic period. In this context, the implementation of online cinema in cooperation with distributors will contribute to formatting an online platform aimed at attracting a larger number of consumers, regardless of external circumstances. © Svitlana Melnychenko, Anatolii Mazaraki, Nadiya Vedmid, Alla Okhrimenko, Alona Shtanova, 2021.","Melnychenko, S.; Mazaraki, A.; Vedmid, N.; Okhrimenko, A.; Shtanova, A.",Innovative Marketing,https://doi.org/10.21511/im.17(2).2021.11,44

There is also a need to minimise the burden of data collection on staff, ensure information informs and supports person-centred care, and that this data is then of use to regulatory agencies, policy makers and researchers. We examined the data collected in six Care Homes in Lothian, Scotland. We extracted the meta-data collected, cross-referenced definitions and assessed the degree of current harmonisation between individual care homes and with data sets currently in use in Scotland and internationally. We interviewed the care home managers to identify data collection processes, views and experiences of current data availability, gaps, access and issues of capacity and capability in relation to data management and analytics. Our work has illustrated the scale of the data collected by care homes, the varied formats and heterogeneity of scope and definition. The inventory of 15 core data items that emerged, serves to expose in detail the foundations of care home data sets. The groundwork illuminated the heterogeneity in tools and assessments used to generate the data and the way in which the data is to be used, affects how it is specified and frequency of collection.

184473,Pathology of neonatal calf diarrhea induced by a coronavirus-like agent.,1973,"According to the Solow paradox, the impact of the computer age can be seen everywhere but in the productivity statistics. Despite much debate about productivity gains promised by technologies associated with the ‘fourth industrial revolution,’ these are largely yet to materialise. Paradoxically, not only has there been a global productivity growth slowdown but also a decline in research and development (R&D) productivity: a ‘burden of knowledge’ effect. Given the potentially catastrophic costs of research failure and the inability of the scientific discovery system to anticipate fully and find a solution to the coronavirus pandemic, the purpose of this paper is to apply a detailed conceptual review methodology to understand better the fundamental causes of the global productivity growth slowdown. Challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature, the original contribution of the paper is a theoretical analysis that suggests a root cause of the global production growth slowdown may be a burden of knowledge effect associated with innovation failure. A causal ordering of relevant causes is discussed, and hypotheses are derived. Implications are derived for research management, and for policy regarding how a decline in global productivity growth might be arrested by remedying the burden of knowledge effect.

In the pre-pandemic decade, there was a growing body of literature on media convergence in emerging markets confirming that this concept is growing in importance as a strategic path of conventional media transformation. Still, the research on the Russian conventional media transformation is scarce, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic risks on Russian print media and their business models have not been investigated so far. To fill the gap, we combined desk research, processing of published industry statistics, and data obtained by means of expert interviews. The results confirm that in the first decades of the 21st century Russian print media paid less attention to the opportunities of media convergence than Western ones. At the same time, those Russian conventional media that set ambitious goals for their future considered the adoption of the media convergence approach as crucial, even before the pandemic. The findings show the lack of systemic measures to improve the overall situation on the national media market that faces difficult times, and the need to take into account pandemic risks in the print media management activities.","Sheresheva, Marina Skakovskaya Lyudmila Bryzgalova Elena Antonov-Ovseenko Anton Shitikova Helen",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14080364,44

BACKGROUND: NLR and CRP are established markers that reflect systemic inflammatory, and these parameters alter in patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: A population of patients with COVID-19 referred to Loghman Hospital in Tehran was analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR and CRP levels, was collected. Pearson analysis was used to assess the independent relationship between the NLR with disease severity and CRP levels. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases comprised 14 (20%) patients with severe disease and 56 (80%) with non-severe infection. The mean values of WBC, NEU, LYM, and NLR of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients. Forty-six patients (65.7%) had NLR >1, and the remaining patients had NLR <1. Plasma CRP levels were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases, and this difference was significant. The results showed that NLR was positively correlated with CRP levels (R=0.23) and negatively correlated with WBC (R=-0.38). CRP (AUC = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and NLR (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.93) had very good accuracy in predicting the severity of COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicated that the integration of NLR and CRP may lead to improved predictions and is recommended as a valuable early marker to assess prognosis and evaluate the severity of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Mousavi-Nasab, Seyed Dawood; Mardani, Rajab; Nasr Azadani, Hosein; zali, Fatemeh; Ahmadi Vasmehjani, Abbas; Sabeti, Shahram; Alavi Darazam, Ilad; Ahmadi, Nayebali",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682970/,44

This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, on a typical day, 19.6% of children aged 2 years spent >or=2 hours watching television or videos.

In multivariable analysis, >or=2 hours of viewing time was positively associated with the presence of a television in the child's bedroom, non-Hispanic black maternal race/ethnicity, fewer than four outings with the child during the preceding week, and was negatively associated with obtaining child care in a child care center. In Oregon, these findings support the AAP recommendations that health professionals, parents, and caregivers recognize the extent of children's media consumption, and that televisions be removed from children's bedrooms. Other states should consider conducting similar surveys.",,MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20631672/,44

Ten-day-old specific pathogen free chickens were inoculated by eye-drop with M. gallisepticum, and a control uninfected group was inoculated with mycoplasma broth. Blood was collected weekly for 4 weeks from five birds in each group and whole blood lymphocyte transformation assayed against concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide. Blood samples were also collected at intervals for serological assays. Live body weight, clinical signs and lesions were monitored, and recovery of M. gallisepticum was attempted from choanal cleft of live birds and also from various sites at necropsy. In parallel to the aforementioned groups, another set of two groups of chicks treated with CsA was infected with M. gallisepticum S6 or mycoplasma broth. These groups were subjected to the same experimental procedures. In the immunocompetent chickens, M. gallisepticum caused temporary T-cell suppression at 2 weeks post-infection. Comparison of the clinical signs and macroscopic lesions produced in immunocompetent and CsA-treated chickens indicated that T cells may not play an active role in disease development. The percentage of birds with mycoplasma isolation and the load of mycoplasmas suggested that T cells may have some role in resisting mycoplasma colonization or in the elimination of the infection.","Ganapathy, K; Bradbury, J M",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14522705/,44

Utilizing telemedicine could markedly enhance group visit scalability and sustainability. However, there are limited data demonstrating telemedicine use for group visits. Objective To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of provider encounters conducted via telemedicine in group visits. Materials and Methods We conducted a 6-month diabetes group visit program and compared in-person (months 1-3) versus telemedicine (videoconferencing) (months 4-6) patient-provider encounters. Participants completed the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) at 6-months (primary outcome). To ensure telemedicine did not negatively affect clinical outcomes, we compared in-person versus telemedicine differences in HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and attendance. Results The TUQ revealed that participants (N=19) found telemedicine useful and easy to use (4.9/5.0, 4.4/5.0, respectively) and with excellent interface (4.3/5.0), interaction (4.6/5.0), reliability (4.2/5.0), and satisfaction (4.4/5.0). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between arms: HbA1c (in-person: -0.60%, telemedicine: -0.52%, p=0.86), blood pressure (systolic: p=0.475, diastolic: p=0.683), weight (p=0.982), BMI (p=0.981), attendance (in-person: 75.44%, telemedicine: 70.12%, p=0.551). Conclusion Provider telemedicine encounters in group visits are feasible and acceptable. This is a promising model to address provider limitations in group visits and increase access to care.

However, although there is considerable heterogeneity in the comorbidity profiles of these populations, not much is known about how prior comorbidities co-occur to form COVID-19 patient subgroups, and their implications for targeted care. Here we used bipartite networks to quantitatively and visually analyze heterogeneity in the comorbidity profiles of COVID-19 inpatients, based on electronic health records from 12 hospitals and 60 clinics in the greater Minneapolis region. This approach enabled the analysis and interpretation of heterogeneity at three levels of granularity (cohort, subgroup, and patient), each of which enabled clinicians to rapidly translate the results into the design of clinical interventions. We discuss future extensions of the multigranular heterogeneity framework, and conclude by exploring how the framework could be used to analyze other biomedical phenomena including symptom clusters and molecular phenotypes, with the goal of accelerating translation to targeted clinical care.","Bhavnani, Suresh K; Kummerfeld, Erich; Zhang, Weibin; Kuo, Yong-Fang; Garg, Nisha; Visweswaran, Shyam; Raji, Mukaila; Radhakrishnan, Ravi; Golvoko, Georgiy; Hatch, Sandra; Usher, Michael; Melton-Meaux, Genevieve; Tignanelli, Christopher",AMIA ...

190975,Toward the development of a plant-based vaccine against reovirus.,2009,"Underpads and layers of linens are frequently placed under patients who are incontinent, have other moisture-related issues, and/or are immobile and cannot reposition independently. Many of these patients are also at risk for pressure ulcers and placed on pressure-redistribution surfaces. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of linens and incontinence pads on interface pressure. Interface sacral pressures were measured (mm Hg) using a mannequinlike pelvic indenter that has pressure transducers integrated into the unit and is covered with a soft flesh-like elastomer. The indenter was loaded to simulate a median-weight male (80 kg/176 lb), and the testing was performed at head-of bed (HOB) angles of 0°, 30°, and 45°. Two different surfaces, a high performance low-air-loss support (LAL) surface and a standard foam support surface, were used and covered with a fitted sheet (FS) only or a combination of the FS and various incontinence pads and transfer sheets. Linen combinations typically used for relatively immobile patients (n = 4), moisture management (n = 4), and moisture management and immobility (n = 1) were tested, as was the heavy use of linens/pads (nine layers, n = 1). All combinations were tested 10 times at HOB angles of 0°, 30°, and 45°. The highest pressure observed was recorded (peak pressure). Ninety five percent (95%) confidence interval (CI) surrounding the mean of the 10 trials for each combination was calculated using the t-distribution; differences between means for all surface combinations were determined using one-way ANOVA with follow-up Fisher Hayter test. Results indicated that each incontinence pad, transfer sheet, or combination of linens significantly increased the mean peak sacral pressure when compared to a single FS on both the low-air-loss surface and the foam surface, regardless of the head-of-bed angle. The magnitude of peak sacral interface pressure increase for the LAL surface at 30° head-of-bed angle was 20% to 64% depending on the linen combination. At 30°, the foam surface showed increases 6% to 29% (P <0.0001) compared with a FS baseline. If linens were wet, peak interface sacral pressures were equivalent to or less than pressures measured on the same pads when measured dry. The presence of linens on both surface types adversely affected the pressure redistribution capabilities of the surfaces; added layers increased pressure proportionally. The effect on interface pressure from the linen layers was more pronounced on the LAL than the foam surface. The study results illustrate that significant increases in peak interface pressure occur in a laboratory setting when linen layers are added to pressure redistribution surfaces. Results also indicated wetting incontinence pads on a support surface did not significantly increase interface pressure. Although additional preclinical and clinical studies are needed to guide practice, excessive linen usage for patients on therapeutic support surfaces should be discouraged.","Williamson, Rachel; Lachenbruch, Charlie; Vangilder, Catherine",Ostomy/wound management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23749661/,44
191005,Molecular and cellular mechanisms of DNA vaccines.,2008,"Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, that arises from metabolic dysfunction and are often associated with obesity and inflammation. In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness; dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis. Recent studies conducted in the Maunakea lab at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa John A. Burns School of Medicine have helped elucidate the connections between diet, microbiome composition, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic regulation of immune function to better understand disease pathogenesis. Potentially, this research could point to ways to prevent pre-disease conditions through novel biomarker discovery using community-based approaches.","Rubas, Noelle C; Maunakea, Alika",Hawai'i journal of health & social welfare,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355196/,44
191218,Evolutionary biology and chemical geology: a timely marriage.,2004,"The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020, more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"". Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%.","Saeedizadeh, Narges; Minaee, Shervin; Kafieh, Rahele; Yazdani, Shakib; Sonka, Milan",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766387/,44
191491,"Intracellular development and mechanism of hemadsorption of a human coronavirus, OC43.",1972,"Molecular mechanisms of in vitro and in vivo virus neutralization by specific Ab remain largely undefined. Murine coronaviruses provide an excellent animal model for such studies. To determine the role of Ab bivalency and the contribution of its Fc portion in the neutralization of viral infectivity and passive protection of mice by an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective mAb (7-10A), F(ab')2 and Fab fragments were generated and their biologic properties were examined. The two fragments reacted in ELISA like the whole Ab against viral Ag or specific anti-idiotypic Abs. The affinity constants of the different Ab preparations were determined by surface plasmon resonance using immobilized anti-idiotypic Abs. The apparent affinity constant of the whole Ab molecule was 7.0 x 10(9) M-1 and was reduced 2-fold for F(ab')2 fragments and 14-fold for Fab molecules. Like whole Ab, both F(ab')2 and Fab fragments could neutralize virus in vitro and passively protect mice in vivo. However, the efficiency of in vivo neutralization by Fab fragments was reduced compared with the bivalent molecules, despite almost identical half-lives of both types of Ab fragments. These results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo virus neutralization mechanisms by this Ab are independent of Fc-mediated functions and bivalency, but are probably influenced by Ab avidity. Also, this is the first report of in vivo protection against a viral infection by Fab fragments of antiviral Ab.","Lamarre, A; Talbot, P J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7706736/,44

METHODS B cell epitopes in S2 subunit of SARS coronavirus spike protein was predicted using DNAStar software. The cDNA sequence encoding the B cell epitope peptide was constructed artificially by PCR and then cloned into the downstream of chaperone 10 gene in vector pET28a(+) to construct pET28-chap10-S2epi plasmid. The fusion protein, chap10-S2epi, was expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The rabbit was immunized by purified Chap10-S2epi for the preparation of antiserum, which was used to identify the mimic antigenicity of Chap10-S2epi to S2 protein by ELISA. RESULTS Chap10-S2epi fusion protein was successfully constructed and expressed in E.coli. The antiserum from the animal immunized by Chap10-S2epi recognized full length of SARS coronavirus S2 spike protein. CONCLUSION The predicted B cell epitope peptide of SARS coronavirus S2 spike protein can induce the antigenicity of S2 protein, which provides some fundamental data for developing engineering vaccine against SARS coronavirus infection.","Feng, Yu; Wan, Min; Wang, Xuan-jun; Zhang, Pei-yin; Yu, Yong-li; Wang, Li-ying",Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17286901/,44

Objective To evaluate whether the goals of the EV-D68 pilot were met and to determine the benefits of and lessons learned from a rapid-response surveillance system for emerging pathogens. Methods An evaluation survey was created and administered via a secure online link. All provinces and territories (PTs) and federal partners involved in the pilot were invited to complete one survey per jurisdiction (N=17). Proportions were calculated for responses to closed-ended questions and recurring themes were identified for open-ended questions. Results Fifty four percent (7/13) of PTs and 50% (2/4) of federal partners completed the survey. All four goals of the pilot were met to some degree. All respondents agreed that there were important benefits to rapid surveillance initiatives for emerging pathogens including the capacity to: better understand the epidemiological and clinical features as well as the public health risk of emerging pathogens (66.7%); inform public health action (66.7%); collaborate and avoid duplication of work (11.1%); test and develop jurisdictional capacity (11.1%); and inform future response efforts (11.1%). Receiving timely case summaries (preferably weekly) was identified as important for 88% of respondents. In terms of lessons learned, more than half of respondents (66.7%) indicated that current processes needed to be improved in order to facilitate rapid surveillance initiatives within and across jurisdictions including the need to develop data-sharing agreements and have pre-existing protocols. Important factors identified for a surveillance data reporting platform included: ease of functionality, data security, jurisdictional control, web-based and flexibility to meet changing surveillance needs. Conclusion Evaluation results from the EV-D68 surveillance pilot will assist with future rapid surveillance initiatives.

Of 25 monoclonal antibodies obtained, 10 were shown to be G1 specific and 15 were shown to be G2 specific by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. In double-staining experiments, some of the monoclonal antibodies gave similar distributions of fluorescence as compared with the staining obtained from polyclonal rabbit anti-G1-G2 antibodies. Others, however, preferentially stained either the glycoproteins in the Golgi complex or those at the cell surface. This may indicate that the glycoproteins underwent conformational changes during their transport. Uukuniemi virus infection resulted in the vacuolization of the membranes of Golgi complexes where the maturation of the virus was taking place. Double-staining experiments with monoclonal antibodies which preferentially stained the Golgi-associated viral glycoproteins and with anti-N polyclonal rabbit antiserum showed a correlation between the progressive vacuolization of the Golgi complex and the accumulation of viral nucleoprotein in the Golgi region, suggesting that a morphological alteration of the Golgi complex may be a prerequisite for intracellular maturation of the virus. Treatment of Uukuniemi virus-infected cells with tunicamycin, a drug which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, resulted in the accumulation of both glycoproteins at an intracellular location, apparently representing the endoplasmic reticulum. Double-staining experiments showed a parallel accumulation of nucleoprotein at these sites, indicating that local accumulation of glycoproteins is required for nucleoprotein binding to intracellular membranes.","Kuismanen, E; Bång, B; Hurme, M; Pettersson, R F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6374166/,44

Cells are isolated from donor livers, which are not allocated for organ transplantation and transplanted into the liver of a suitable recipient.

METHODS AND RESULTS Although about 50 cases of clinical hepatocyte transplantation have been documented, therapeutic benefit is doubtful, and the reasons for this are largely unknown. Minor quality of the transplanted cells isolated from marginal donor livers may be a major cause. Therefore, animal models have been established, which enable scientists to develop novel procedures of hepatocyte transplantation and to specifically study the mechanisms of hepatocyte integration in the host liver. Hopefully, results generated in animal models will set the basis for the design of novel procedures of hepatocyte transplantation individualized to the underlying disease in order to provide a growth advantage for donor over host cells.

This study was designed to combine safety and efficacy results from independent studies and to compare between high and low vancomycin trough levels in the treatment of MRSA-infected patients using meta-analysis. METHODS From 19 eligible studies, 9 studies were included in meta-analysis to compare clinical success between high and low vancomycin trough levels, while 10 and 11 studies met criteria for comparing trough levels and nephrotoxicity and trough levels and mortality, respectively. The PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, and hand searching were used to identify eligible studies dated up to March 2016. Of 2344 subjects with MRSA infection, 1036 were assigned to trough levels ≥15 mg/L and 1308 to trough levels <15 mg/L. RESULTS High vancomycin trough levels were found to be associated with risk of nephrotoxicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.14, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.23 and adjusted OR 3.33, 95 % CI 1.91-5.79). There was no evidence of difference between high and low vancomycin trough levels for mortality (OR; 1.09; 95 % CI 0.75-1.60) or clinical success (OR 1.07; 95 % CI 0.68-1.68). CONCLUSION In this study, high vancomycin trough levels were identified as an independent factor associated with risk of nephrotoxicity in MRSA-infected patients. Association between vancomycin trough levels and both adverse effects and clinical outcomes requires further study.","Tongsai, Sasima; Koomanachai, Pornpan",BMC research notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27686168/,44
198052,Dual infection of gnotobiotic calves with bovine strains of group A and porcine-like group C rotaviruses influences pathogenesis of the group C rotavirus.,1999,"BACKGROUND Suicidality is a widespread phenomenon with a dramatic burden worldwide. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic determined a relevant impact on mental health, due to the infection itself and its socio-economic consequences. The present study is aimed at analyzing the prevalence of suicidality during the Covid-19 pandemic among subjects requiring a psychiatric consultation in an emergency setting. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Socio-demographic and clinical information was collected at the emergency department of the General Hospital of Perugia from June 1st, 2020 to January 31st, 2021. Data was entered into an electronic datasheet and retrospectively analysed. Pearson's bivariate correlation was performed in order to assess significant associations between suicide-related variables and specific socio-demographic and clinical features (p<0.05). RESULTS Among 447 subjects included in the analysis, 109 (24.4%) showed suicidality-related phenomena, particularly suicide attempts (SA) (n=44, 9.8%), suicidal ideation (SI) (n=41, 9.2%), non suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (n=31, 6.9%), that in some cases co-occurred. A statistically significant association was detected between NSSI and living with marital family (p=0.024) and between suicidality-related phenomena and adjustment disorders (p=0.018). None of the examined subjects reported a previous positivity for Covid-19 and neither did their relatives. CONCLUSIONS The present study confirms the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on suicide-related phenomena. Consultation psychiatry fulfills a key role in the early detection and clinical management of these conditions, that require targeted intervention strategies.","Menculini, Giulia; Moretti, Patrizia; Pandolfi, Luigi Maria; Bianchi, Sara; Valentini, Eleonora; Gatto, Mattia; Amantini, Kety; Tortorella, Alfonso",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559796/,44

201721,Antibacterial Potential and Apoptosis Induction by Pigments from the Endophyte Burkholderia sp. WYAT7,2020,"INTRODUCTION Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) has gained increasing popularity. This study reports the results of the first patients operated using this technique at our department. METHODS All procedures were prospectively registered in a database. Patients were followed until death, two years after surgery or 1 January 2019. RESULTS A total of 150 procedures were performed (from 23 November 2015 to 27 February 2018). The median proced-ure time decreased from 350 minutes for the initial 75 pa-tients to 320 minutes for the final 75 patients (p < 0.05). Blood loss decreased from 200 ml to 100 ml (p < 0.05), respectively. The conversion rate for the abdominal procedure was 7% for the initial 75 patients and 8% for the final 75 patients (not significant (NS)). For the thoracic procedure, the corresponding figures were 11% and 7% (NS), respectively. Anastomotic leakage was seen in 17% (initial patients) and 11% (final patients) (NS); however, less than 20% of the leakages needed surgical treatment. The median length of post-operative stay was nine days for both groups. For all 150 patients, pulmonary complications were observed in 18% and cardiac complications in 11%. The 30-day mortality rate was 2% and the one-year survival rate was 86% (124 registered patients). CONCLUSIONS MIO was introduced at our department with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates and the short-term oncological result was not compromised. FUNDING none.

206894,A vision for actionable science in a pandemic,2020,"The extent of prescription and illicit drug abuse in geographically isolated rural and micropolitan communities in the intermountain western United States (US) has not been well tracked. The goal of this pilot study was to accurately measure drug dose consumption rates (DCR) between two select populations, normalize the data and compare the DCRs to similar communities. To learn about patterns of drug abuse between the two disparate communities, we used the emergent field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A rapid, quantitative and systematic process for the determination of multiple classes of prescribed and illicit drugs was applied to influent wastewater samples. Influent samples were collected over the course of three months (April to June 2019) at two wastewater treatment plants representing a small urban and a rural community. Collection of sewage influent included 24-h composite samples and the use of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), time-weighted samplers. Using the results from the composite sampling data, DCRs per 1000 population could be calculated from the concentration data and the use of excretion correction factors. The following 18 compounds: amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, methadone, EDDP, codeine, benzoylecgonine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, noroxycodone, ketamine, fluoxetine, tramadol, and ritalinic acid; represent a subset of the targeted analytes that were consistently measured at detectable concentration levels, and present at both sites. Following normalization of the drug measurements to influent flow rates and per capita, the small urban community demonstrated greater collective excretion rates (CER) than the rural community, with the exceptions of amphetamine and methamphetamine.","Bishop, Nicholas; Jones-Lepp, Tammy; Margetts, Miranda; Sykes, Jordan; Alvarez, David; Keil, Deborah E",Sci Total Environ,,44

A dysregulated immune response culminating in thromboinflammation has been described, but the pathomechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: We studied 41 adult COVID-19 patients with positive results on reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assays and 37 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Number and surface characteristics of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and citrullinated histone H3 levels were determined in plasma upon inclusion by flow cytometry and immunoassay. RESULTS: In total, 20 patients had severe and 21 nonsevere disease. The number of EV (median [25th, 75th percentile]) was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (658.8 [353.2, 876.6] vs. 435.5 [332.5, 585.3], geometric mean ratio [95% confidence intervals]: 2.6 [1.9, 3.6]; p < 0.001). Patients exhibited significantly higher numbers of EVs derived from platelets, endothelial cells, leukocytes, or neutrophils than controls. EVs from alveolar-macrophages and alveolar-epithelial cells were detectable in plasma and were significantly higher in patients. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1-positive EV levels were higher in patients, while no difference between tissue factor-positive and angiotensin-converting enzyme-positive EV was seen between both groups. Levels of EV did not differ between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Citrullinated histone H3 levels (ng/mL, median [25th, 75th percentile]) were higher in patients than in controls (1.42 [0.6, 3.4] vs. 0.31 [0.1, 0.6], geometric mean ratio: 4.44 [2.6, 7.7]; p < 0.001), and were significantly lower in patients with nonsevere disease compared with those with severe disease. CONCLUSION: EV and citrullinated histone H3 are associated with COVID-19 and could provide information regarding pathophysiology of the disease.","Traby, Ludwig; Kollars, Marietta; Kussmann, Manuel; Karer, Matthias; Sinkovec, Hana; Lobmeyr, Elisabeth; Hermann, Alexander; Staudinger, Thomas; Schellongowski, Peter; Rössler, Bernhard; Burgmann, Heinz; Kyrle, Paul A; Eichinger, Sabine",Thromb. haemost,,44
211317,Abstracts from USCAP 2021: Infectious Disease Pathology (757-770),2021,"Background: Access to rapid diagnosis is key to the control and management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory RT-PCR testing is the current standard of care but usually requires a centralised laboratory and significant infrastructure. We describe our diagnostic accuracy assessment of a novel, rapid point-of-care real time RT-PCR CovidNudge test, which requires no laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. Methods: Between April and May, 2020, we obtained two nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals in three hospitals in London and Oxford (UK). Samples were collected from three groups: self-referred health-care workers with suspected COVID-19; patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19; and hospital inpatient admissions with or without suspected COVID-19. For the CovidNudge test, nasopharyngeal swabs were inserted directly into a cartridge which contains all reagents and components required for RT-PCR reactions, including multiple technical replicates of seven SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (rdrp1, rdrp2, e-gene, n-gene, n1, n2 and n3) and human ribonuclease P (RNaseP) as sample adequacy control. Swab samples were tested in parallel using the CovidNudge platform, and with standard laboratory RT-PCR using swabs in viral transport medium for processing in a central laboratory. The primary analysis was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care CovidNudge test with laboratory-based testing. Findings: We obtained 386 paired samples: 280 (73%) from self-referred health-care workers, 15 (4%) from patients in the emergency department, and 91 (23%) hospital inpatient admissions. Of the 386 paired samples, 67 tested positive on the CovidNudge point-of-care platform and 71 with standard laboratory RT-PCR. The overall sensitivity of the point-of-care test compared with laboratory-based testing was 94% (95% CI 86-98) with an overall specificity of 100% (99-100). The sensitivity of the test varied by group (self-referred healthcare workers 93% [95% CI 84-98]; patients in the emergency department 100% [48-100]; and hospital inpatient admissions 100% [29-100]). Specificity was consistent between groups (self-referred health-care workers 100% [95% CI 98-100%]; patients in the emergency department 100% [69-100]; and hospital inpatient admissions 100% [96-100]). Point of care testing performance was similar during a period of high background prevalence of laboratory positive tests (25% [95% 20-31] in April, 2020) and low prevalence (3% [95% 1-9] in inpatient screening). Amplification of viral nucleocapsid (n1, n2, and n3) and envelope protein gene (e-gene) were most sensitive for detection of spiked SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Interpretation: The CovidNudge platform was a sensitive, specific, and rapid point of care test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. The device, which has been implemented in UK hospitals since May, 2020, could enable rapid decisions for clinical care and testing programmes.

225837,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,2021,"The COVID-19 epidemic is not only a medical issue but also a sophisticated social problem. We propose a network dynamics model of epidemic transmission introducing a heterogeneous control factor. The proposed model applied the classical susceptible- exposed-infectious-recovered model to the network based on effective distance and was modified by introducing a heterogeneous control factor with temporal and spatial characteristics. International aviation data were approximately used to estimate the flux fraction matrix, and the effective distance was calculated. Through parameter estimation and simulation, the theoretical values of the modified model fit well with practical values. By adjusting the parameters and observing the change of the results, we found that the modified model is more in line with the actual needs and has higher credibility in the comprehensive analysis. The assessment shows that the number of confirmed cases worldwide will reach about 20 million optimistically. In severe cases, the peak value will exceed 80 million, and the late stage of the epidemic shows a long tail shape, lasting more than one and a half years. The effective way to control the global epidemic is to strengthen international cooperation and to impose international travel restrictions and other measures.","Sheng, Huaxiong; Wu, Lin; Wu, Tingting; Peng, Bo",J. med. virol,,44

The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the rate ratio of severe COVID-19 associated with eligibility for the shielding programme in Scotland across the first and second waves of the epidemic and (2) the relation of severe COVID-19 to transmission-related factors in those in shielding and the general population. METHODS: In a matched case-control design, all 178,578 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland from 1 March 2020 to 18 February 2021 were matched for age, sex and primary care practice to 1,744,283 controls from the general population. This dataset (REACT-SCOT) was linked to the list of 212,702 individuals identified as eligible for shielding. Severe COVID-19 was defined as cases that entered critical care or were fatal. Rate ratios were estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: With those without risk conditions as reference category, the univariate rate ratio for severe COVID-19 was 3.21 (95% CI 3.01 to 3.41) in those with moderate risk conditions and 6.3 (95% CI 5.8 to 6.8) in those eligible for shielding. The highest rate was in solid organ transplant recipients: rate ratio 13.4 (95% CI 9.6 to 18.8). Risk of severe COVID-19 increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of school-age children in the household. Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with recent exposure to hospital (defined as 5 to 14 days before presentation date): rate ratio 12.3 (95% CI 11.5 to 13.2) overall. The population attributable risk fraction for recent exposure to hospital peaked at 50% in May 2020 and again at 65% in December 2020.

239752,In Situ Generation of Regularly Ordered 2D Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Films for Highly Sensitive Photoelectrochemical Bioanalysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with Covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use. METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed.

240777,Electronic Properties of Cyano Ionic Liquids: a Valence Band Photoemission Study,2020,"Defences to pathogens such as SarCoV2 in mammals involves interactions between immune functions and metabolic pathways to eradicate infection while preventing hyperinflammation. Amino acid metabolic pathways represent with other antimicrobial agent potential targets for therapeutic strategies. iNOS-mediated production of NO from Arg is involved in the innate inflammatory response to pathogens and NO overproduction can induce hyperinflammation. The two Arg-catabolising enzymes Arg1 and IDO1 reduce the hyperinflammation by an immunosuppressive effect via either Arg starvation (for Arg1) or via the immunoregulatory activity of the Arg-derived metabolites Kyn (for IDO1). In response to amino acid abundance mTOR activates the host protein translation and Coronaviruses use this machinery for their own protein synthesis and replication. In contrast GCN2, the sensor of amino acid starvation, activates pathways that restrict inflammation and viral replication. Gln depletion alters the immune response that become more suppressive, by favouring a regulatory T phenotype rather than a Th1 phenotype. Proliferating activated immune cells are highly dependent on Ser, activation and differentiation of T cells need enough Ser and dietary Ser restriction can inhibit their proliferation. Cys is strictly required for T-cell proliferation because they cannot convert Met to Cys. Restricting Met inhibits both viral RNA cap methylation and replication, and the proliferation of infected cells with an increased requirement for Met. Phe catabolism produces antimicrobial metabolites resulting in the inhibition of microbial growth and an immunosuppressive activity towards T lymphocytes.","Tomé, Daniel",Nutr Diabetes,,44

Methods: Pooled clinical data of consecutive adult stroke patients from 12 U.S. CSCs (1/1/2019- 5/31/2020) were queried. The rate of thrombolysis for non-transferred patients within the Target: Stroke goal of 60min was compared between patients admitted 3/1/2019-5/31/2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 3/1/2020-5/31/2020 (COVID-19). The time from arrival to imaging and treatment with thrombolysis or thrombectomy, as continuous variables, were also assessed. Results: Of the 7906 patients included, 1319 were admitted pre-COVID-19 and 933 were admitted during COVID-19, 15% of whom underwent intravenous thrombolysis. There was no difference in the rate of thrombolysis within 60min during COVID-19 (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.42-1.86, p=0.74), despite adjustment for variables associated with earlier treatment (adjusted OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.38-1.76, p=0.61). There was no significant overall delay to thrombolysis during the COVID-19 period vs. pe- COVID-19 (p=0.42), even after multivariable adjustment (p=0.63) or after comparison across months leading to COVID-19 (Figure). The only independent predictor of delayed treatment time between periods was the use of emergency medical services (adjusted β=-6.93, 95%CI -12.83 -1.04, p=0.03). There was no significant delay from hospital arrival to imaging in all patients, or imaging to skin puncture in patients who underwent thrombectomy. Conclusions: There was no independent effect of the COVID-19 period on delays in acute care with respect to thrombolysis or thrombectomy in this multicenter observational cohort. Further studies are warranted to externally validate these findings, and determine if site volume or center accreditation may mediate a collateral effect of the pandemic on stroke care paradigms.","Siegler, J.

246861,The evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within the coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has negatively affected the training of general surgery chief residents during the last trimester of their residency. Our goal was to evaluate the educational concerns of graduating general surgery chief residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey was distributed between March 31 and April 7, 2020 to all current general surgery chief residents from 6 academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Interviews were also conducted with attending surgeons from participating institutions. RESULTS: A total of 24 of 39 general surgery chief residents participated in our survey (61.5% response rate). General surgery chief residents were most concerned about the potential delay in the date of board examinations, followed by not feeling adequately prepared for the board examinations and a possible delay in the graduation date. Whereas not having enough cases to feel ready for fellowship or job and not achieving a sufficient number of cases to meet the requirements for graduation were only moderately concerning to chief residents, attending surgeons stressed a greater importance on the loss of the operative experience as nearly all (93.3%) of them suggested a personalized approach for additional general surgery training during fellowship or job onboarding. CONCLUSION: In addition to the dramatic impact on public health, the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has also caused unprecedented changes to surgical education. Therefore, creative interventions are needed to help general surgery chief residents successfully transition into the next phase of their surgical career.","Zheng, Jian; Hundeyin, Mautin; He, Katherine; Sachs, Teviah; Hess, Donald T; Whang, Edward; Kristo, Gentian",Surgery,,44

Knowledge of the host transcriptional response against this virus and how the pathways are activated or suppressed compared to other human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that caused outbreaks previously can help in the identification of potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses. Based on these findings, a drug repurposing analysis was performed to identify potential drug candidates for combating COVID-19.","Krishnamoorthy, Pandikannan; Raj, Athira S; Roy, Swagnik; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Kumar, Himanshu",Comput Biol Med,,44

A second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection is aggressively surging. The clinical worsening of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be strictly associated with comorbidities, which can be used to establish an intrinsic patient network whose molecular profile is pivotal for identifying and successfully treating populations at risk. Herein, we focus on the direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and virus-associated cancers, exploring the critical role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a mediator of this complex cross talk. IL-6 production is enhanced in diverse viral infections ranging from human papilloma virus (HPV) to hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and SARS-CoV-2 infection. High systemic levels of IL-6 are associated with viral persistence and poor clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2–infected patients. Blockade of IL-6/IL-6R, using specific molecules, is under investigation in active clinical trials for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2. Although the data are as yet inconclusive, they pave the way for selective targeting of crucial cytokine-activated aberrant signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection. © Innovative Healthcare Institute.","Venuti, A.; Donzelli, S.; Nisticò, P.; Blandino, G.; Ciliberto, G.",Journal of Immunotherapy and Precision Oncology,,44

262935,Virus At The Gates,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause serious illness in some people resulting in admission to intensive care units (ICU) and frequently, ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure. Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","Smith, Valerie; Devane, Declan; Nichol, Alistair; Roche, David",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,44

However, the use of PPE has not been universal mainly due to the perception of discomfort and associated stress and fatigue. This study was done to understand the pattern of PPE use by cancer surgeons during the pandemic and the associated discomfort, stress, and fatigue with its use. The survey, consisting of 29 questions, was circulated widely across the country by email and chat groups among cancer surgeons. The study was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2020/08/027050). We received a total of 342 evaluable responses that could be included for analysis. All the respondents used appropriate PPE in different combinations. N-95 mask and the face shield were the two components of the PPE that gave rise to a lot of discomforts. Fogging (of face shields) (p < 0.001,OR 3.61), dryness of mouth (p < 0.001,OR 3.35), and breathing difficulty/feeling of suffocation (p = 0.034,OR 1.68) contributed to the stress, whereas headache (p < 0.001,OR 11.34) and breathing difficulty/feeling of suffocation (p < 0.001,OR 4.24) contributed to the fatigue associated with PPE use the most. PPE was routinely used during cancer surgery in COVID-19 negative patients during the pandemic. However, most surgeons experienced different degrees of discomfort, especially with the N-95 masks and eye protection.

However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were included. Underweight was defined as a BMI <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2, and obesity as &#8805;28 kg/m2. RESULTS: Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","Cai, Qingxian; Chen, Fengjuan; Wang, Tao; Luo, Fang; Liu, Xiaohui; Wu, Qikai; He, Qing; Wang, Zhaoqin; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Chen, Jun; Xu, Lin",Diabetes Care,,44

271076,Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microsphere production based on quality by design: a review,2021,"Protein interaction with polymers layers is a keystone in designing bio-nano devices. Polyamidoamines (PAMAMs) are well-known polymers. Zero aromatic core dendrimers (ZAC) are molecules with no proven toxic effect in cultured cells. When coating nanodevices with enzymatic systems, active sites are disturbed by an interaction with the biosystem surface. Computational methods were used in order to simulate, characterize, and quantify protein-polymer interaction. Protein corona, i.e., surface proteins disposed on a viral membrane or nanodevice outer surface, are crucial in interactions with a potential pharmacological target or receptor. Corona symmetry has been observed in the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a protein alpha 1 antitrypsin's a crystallographic structure was chosen. Protein-mono dendrimer layer systems were generated using in silico methods in order to simulate their interaction. Interactions were quantified using topological and quantum mechanical strategies. Results showed that PAMAM and ZAC interact differently with alpha 1 antitrypsin. Energy and topological surfaces of protein vary accordingly with the dendrimer monolayer. Topological surfaces have a higher sensibility in describing the interactions.","Lungu, Claudiu N.; Füstös, Melinda E.; Grudzinski, Ireneusz P.; Olteanu, Gabriel; Putz, Mihai V.",Symmetry,,44

Methods: This study is a retrospective, multicenter analysis of general surgery emergency operations performed during the period from 1 March to 15th 2020 lockdown and in the same time period of 2019 in three medical centers providing emergency surgical care to the area Salzburg-North, Austria. Results: In total 165 emergency surgeries were performed in the study period of 2020 compared to 287 in 2019. This is a significant decrease of 122 (42.5%) emergency surgeries during the COVID-19 lockdown (pâ¯= 0.005). The length of hospital stay was reduced to 3 days in 2020 compared to 4 in 2019. Appendectomy remained the most performed emergency surgery for both periods; however the number of surgeries was reduced to less than a half, with 72 cases in 2019 and 33 cases in 2020 (pâ¯= 0.118). Emergency colon surgery observed the strongest decrease of 75% from 17 cases in 2019 to 4 in 2020. In addition, the emergency abdominal wall hernia, cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis, small surgeries and proctological emergencies recorded drops of 70%, 39%, 33% and 47% respectively. The strongest reduction in frequencies of emergency surgeries was reported from the designated COVID center in the examined region. Conclusions: Emergency general surgery is an essential service that continues to run under all circumstances. Our data show that COVID-19-related restrictions have resulted in a significant decrease in the utilization of acute surgical care.","Presl, Jaroslav; Varga, Martin; Mittermair, Christof; Mitterwallner, Stefan; Weitzendorfer, Michael; Gabersek, Ana; Borhanian, Kurosch; Heuberger, Andreas; Weiss, Helmut; Emmanuel, Klaus; von Rahden, Burkhard; Koch, Oliver Owen",Eur Surg,,44

275217,Predicting cryptic ligand binding sites based on normal modes guided conformational sampling,2020,"Rationale: Growing literature on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggests that obesity (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) is a strong risk factor for increasing disease severity, hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In such critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can serve as salvage therapy. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) COVID-19 ECMO registry reports that 49% of its patients were classified as obese as of 12/01/2020. However, the morbidity and mortality outcomes of this subgroup remains unclear. As such, this high-risk population merits further examination. Methods: We identified adult COVID-19 ARDS patients who were candidates for either veno-venous ECMO or veno-arterial ECMO between March 13, 2020 and August 31, 2020. The eligibility for ECMO was selected based on our institutional algorithm and the EOLIA Trial criteria (except for high BMI cutoff). Patients were divided into two groups, obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI &lt; 29.9 kg/m2). We compared the pre-cannulation characteristics including time elapsed between admission to ECMO, intubation to ECMO and respiratory indices. We then examined length on ECMO, ICU or hospital length of stay and disposition. Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze categorical and continuous data. Results: We identified a total of 41 patients, 33 (80.5%) were obese and 8 (19.5%) were non-obese [Table 1]. The average age of the obese and non-obese groups was 47.8 years and 55.5 years respectively. The median BMI was 39.85 kg/m2 (IQR: 35.63, 43.00) in the obese group and 29.05 kg/m2 (IQR: 25.35, 29.39) in the non-obese group (p &lt;0.00001). There was no difference in precannulation characteristics between the groups. In terms of timelines, the obese group was borderline significant with regards to more time elapsed between admission to ECMO (p = 0.058), however, no other significant changes were noted. The ICU length of stay was lower in the obese group with median runtime of 22 days versus 35.5 days (p = 0.029). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality (p = 0.43) or dispositions between the two groups. Conclusion: In our study, the obesity group did not have worse outcomes than the non-obese group. This should encourage consideration of ECMO in carefully selected obese patients with severe ARDS from COVID-19.","Padhye, A. A.; Gotur, D. B.; Tuazon, D. M.; Zainab, A.; Suarez, E.

This study included 9,455 confirmed cases during the observation period (March 08, 2020 to May 03, 2020). The peak spread of COVID-19 occurred at an average temperature of 26 °C. We find, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in Bangladesh can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19. However, it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic diminishes by summer since Bangladesh still have a high coronavirus transmission. Therefore, other public health interventions such as social distancing are still important for blocking the COVID-19 transmission.","Haque, Syed Emdadul; Rahman, Mosiur",Environ Sci Policy,,44

In particular, the healthcare system has been subject to an enormous pressure that has surpassed its ability in many instances. Additionally, the pandemic has called for a review of our daily medical practices, including our approach to colorectal cancer management where treatment puts patients at high risk of virus exposure. Given their higher median age, patients are at an increased risk for severe symptoms and complications in cases of infection, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Therefore, a review of the routine colorectal cancer practices is needed to minimize risk of exposure. Oncologists should weigh risk of exposure versus the patient's oncologic benefits when approaching management. In addition, treatment protocols should be modified to minimize hospital visits and admissions while maintaining the same treatment efficacy. In this review, we will focus on challenges that colorectal cancer patients face during the pandemic, while highlighting the priority in each case.

This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, risk perception, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate medical students in Egypt. This is a cross-sectional observational study using an anonymous online questionnaire. The survey was conducted through a link shared on social networking sites. Data were collected from 19 June 2020 to 26 June 2020. The medical students of Suez Canal University fulfilled the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were included by using convenience and snowball sampling technique (283 students). The total related knowledge score was 80.9%. The majority (83%) feel that coronavirus infection is a life-threatening illness. About 86.9% of the students perceived a COVID-19-infected person as a serious threat to society. However, three-quarters of the students (76.3%) perceived risk of infection with COVID-19 during ward rotations. About 92% of the students are practicing preventive behaviors. Female senior students have higher percentages in regard to related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors. Students who received education about Covid-19 and students perceived higher risk of infection were more adherent to preventive measures. There is a moderate correlation between related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors. Medical students have good knowledge, practice preventive behaviors, and perceive risk of being infected. The direction to raise knowledge and awareness will enhance practicing preventive behaviors to control the disease.","Soltan, Enayat M; El-Zoghby, Safaa M; Salama, Hend M",SN Compr Clin Med,,44

We would contend that anaesthesia informatics principles and innovations that have been widely applied in numerous diverse domains could be successfully applied in NORA environments, resulting in significant improvements in anaesthesia care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight key recent studies from the perioperative and informatics literature, placing each in the context of how it has, or how it may conceivably be applied to, improved NORA care. SUMMARY: There is significant opportunity for anaesthesiologists and clinical informaticians to collaborate and apply major advances in the perioperative informatics field to NORA environments, particularly given rapid recent changes in the field during the COVID-19 epidemic. Given the complexity of NORA patients and care delivered in NORA environments, applied clinical informatics has the potential to drastically improve care delivered.","Jelly, Christina A; Ende, Holly; Freundlich, Robert E",Curr. opin. anaesthesiol,,44

324286,Zoonotic implications of camel diseases in Iran,2020,"The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1st of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support. The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM). The founder and Editor in Chief for more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come. His commitment to the conservation of a high level of scientific excellence of the published papers is the legacy which we wish to maintain in the future publications.

We aimed to assess the associations of physical activity with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed data on 2,394 apparently healthy men with good baseline cognitive function from the prospective population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease study. We assessed habits of physical activity at baseline using a 12-month leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) questionnaire. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios adjusted for body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, history of type-2 diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption, history of coronary heart disease, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24.9 years (interquartile range: 18.3-26.9), 208 men developed dementia and 128 developed AD. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for dementia comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of physical activity were 0.97 (95% confidence intervals: 0.69-1.38) for total physical activity volume, 0.96 (0.69-1.34) for conditioning LTPA volume, and 1.13 (0.80-1.61) for total LTPA volume. Corresponding hazard ratios for AD were 1.19 (0.76-1.85), 0.98 (0.64-1.49), and 1.22 (0.77-1.93). Associations were consistent in analyses restricted to participants with &#8805;10 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged Caucasian men, various physical activity exposures were not associated with all-cause dementia or AD. Future studies should address biases due to reverse causation and regression dilution and should involve objective measures of physical activity.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Laukkanen, Jari A; Kauhanen, Jussi; Willeit, Peter",Eur J Clin Invest,,44

But we can neither afford to insist on a zero-risk response, nor can we pretend that the risk does not exist. What is needed are tools to rationally triage the risk. To this end, we propose a novel 'risk index', which is the intersection of two components of risk: 1) the risk of an individual becoming infected due to action 'X';and 2) the likely probability of death (or serious harm) if that individual develops CV19. The risk index allows risk to be compared across different scenarios, and may reveal that seemingly very different situations constitute similar degrees of risk. With risk measured in this way, one can then contrast different levels of risk against the social benefits of absorbing that risk, allowing actions to be sorted into those that are tolerable, debatable, or acceptable. While these concepts are presented in abstract based on approximate estimates of risk and influenced by our judgements about social desirability, the concept itself can be refined as more accurate approximations of risk and broadly accepted values of social desirability are derived empirically. In short, this is a tool intended to provide a useful empirical framework for rationale decision making about CV19.","Gill, C. J.; Galea, S.",,,44

This study compared the results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and a Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs a Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in thymine and adenine homopolymeric regions than the R9, at the expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than the RBK, and provided longer reads than the RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99 vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK preparation library provided longer DNA fragments which contributed to a better assembly of the SARS-CoV-2, despite an impaired detection of variants in a R10 flow cell. Nanopore sequencing could be used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. KEY POINTS: â¢ Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome is of great importance for the pandemic surveillance. â¢ Nanopore offers a low cost and accurate method to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genome. â¢ Ligation sequencing is preferred rather than the rapid kit using transposases.","González-Recio, Oscar; Gutiérrez-Rivas, Mónica; Peiró-Pastor, Ramón; Aguilera-Sepúlveda, Pilar; Cano-Gómez, Cristina; Jiménez-Clavero, Miguel Ángel; Fernández-Pinero, Jovita",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,44

Without effective international support, this setback will pose a critical threat to the achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

However, dermatology services need to be resumed in future and dermatologists especially in developing countries face a mammoth task of devising plans to tackle the upcoming surge of patients while still maintaining the precautions to avoid risk of infection to health care workers and our patients. Teledermatology practice is a viable alternative and there is need of starting functioning teledermatology centers at primary health care centers and training health care workers in telemedicine. Several steps like increasing the working hours of outpatient clinics, posting dermatologists and health staffs in shifts, encouraging online registration and payment, providing time slots to patients should be taken to prevent overcrowding at outpatient departments in hospitals of developing countries like India where the usual patient turnover during summers maybe around 600 to 800 per day. Once diagnosed by the dermatologist, a subsequent meticulous use of teledermatology can limit the number of follow-up visits. To avoid student gatherings, the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching schedule should be replaced by online or virtual teaching in form of webinars and video conferencing. Above all, intense upgradation of health care infrastructure, recruitment, training of new health care staffs on mass level and huge investment in health care sector is required in all the developing countries.","Kumar, Sheetanshu; Bishnoi, Anuradha; Vinay, Keshavamurthy",Dermatol Ther,,44

367980,Editorial: Emerging Swine Viruses,2020,"BACKGROUND: Through a combination of strong routine immunization (RI), strategic supplemental immunization activities (SIA) and robust surveillance, numerous countries have been able to approach or achieve measles elimination. The fragility of these achievements has been shown, however, by the resurgence of measles since 2016. We describe trends in routine measles vaccine coverage at national and district level, SIA performance and demographic changes in the three regions with the highest measles burden. FINDINGS: WHO-UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage show that global coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine has stabilized at 85% from 2015 to 19. In 2000, 17 countries in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions had measles vaccine coverage below 50%, and although all increased coverage by 2019, at a median of 60%, it remained far below levels needed for elimination. Geospatial estimates show many low coverage districts across Africa and much of the Eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asian regions. A large proportion of children unvaccinated for MCV live in conflict-affected areas with remote rural areas and some urban areas also at risk. Countries with low RI coverage use SIAs frequently, yet the ideal timing and target age range for SIAs vary within countries, and the impact of SIAs has often been mitigated by delays or disruptions. SIAs have not been sufficient to achieve or sustain measles elimination in the countries with weakest routine systems. Demographic changes also affect measles transmission, and their variation between and within countries should be incorporated into strategic planning. CONCLUSIONS: Rebuilding services after the COVID-19 pandemic provides a need and an opportunity to increase community engagement in planning and monitoring services. A broader suite of interventions is needed beyond SIAs. Improved methods for tracking coverage at the individual and community level are needed together with enhanced surveillance. Decision-making needs to be decentralized to develop locally-driven, sustainable strategies for measles control and elimination.","Cutts, F T; Ferrari, M J; Krause, L K; Tatem, A J; Mosser, J F",BMC Med,,44
368487,Hydration Structure and Dynamics of the Favipiravir Antiviral Drug: A Molecular Modelling Approach,2020,"Molecular detection of pathogenic nucleic acids from patient samples requires incubating biochemical reactions at specific temperatures to amplify DNA. This incubation is typically carried out with an electrical heater and a temperature controller. To reduce test cost, to eliminate the need for manufacturing incubators, which may require significant time, and to enable electricity-free operation, we use energetic compounds such as an Mg(Fe) alloy mixed with a phase-change material (PCM) that undergoes phase transformation at the desired incubation temperature. We dubbed this composite Energetic Phase Change Material (EPCM). When the EPCM is brought into contact with water, the magnesium alloy interacts with the water to produce heat. The EPCM heats up to its phase transition temperature. Any excess heat is absorbed as latent heat and the system is maintained at its desired incubation temperature, independent of ambient temperatures, long enough to facilitate enzymatic amplification.

379229,The influence of various optimization algorithms on nuclear power plant steam turbine exergy efficiency and destruction,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 ravages continuously worldwide, more information on the epidemiological characteristics and factors associated with the time intervals between critical events is needed to contain the pandemic and assess the effectiveness of interventions. METHODS: Individual information on confirmed cases from January 21 to March 2 was collected from provincial or municipal health commissions. We identified the difference between imported and local cases in the epidemiological characteristics. Two models were established to estimate the factors associated with the time interval from symptom onset to hospitalization (TOH) and length of hospital stay (LOS), respectively. RESULTS: Among 7042 cases, 3392 (48.17%) were local cases, and 3304 (46.92%) were imported cases. Since the first intervention was adopted in Hubei on January 23, the daily reported imported cases reached a peak on January 28 and gradually decreased since then. Imported cases were on average younger (41 vs. 48) and had more males (58.66% vs. 47.53%) than local cases. Furthermore, imported cases had more contacts with other confirmed cases (2.80 ± 2.33 vs. 2.17 ± 2.10), which were mainly within family members (2.26 ± 2.18 vs. 1.57 ± 2.06). The TOH and LOS were 2.67 ± 3.69 and 18.96 ± 7.63 days, respectively, and a longer TOH was observed in elderly living in the provincial capital cities that had a higher migration intensity with Hubei. CONCLUSIONS: Measures to restrict traffic can effectively reduce imported spread. However, household transmission is still not controlled, particularly for the infection of imported cases to elderly women. It is still essential to surveil and educate patients about early admission or isolation.","Zhou, Feng; You, Chong; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Qian, Kaihuan; Hou, Yan; Gao, Yanhui; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Int J Infect Dis,,44

382901,Better editors,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on both the physical and mental health of individuals worldwide. Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure among Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. METHODS: Between April 21 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as follows: <1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and &#8805;3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. RESULTS: Of the 4322 eligible participants, 4004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1481 (37.0%), 1644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for less than 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or 3 or more hours per day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76; P=.03), anxiety (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.46; P<.001), and insomnia (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.97; P=.001) than people exposed to information for less than 1 hour per day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1 to 2 hours per day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69; P=.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure of 3 or more hours per day and the severity of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19-related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Longitudinal studies investigating the long-term effects of COVID-19-related information exposure on mental health are warranted.","Mongkhon, Pajaree; Ruengorn, Chidchanok; Awiphan, Ratanaporn; Thavorn, Kednapa; Hutton, Brian; Wongpakaran, Nahathai; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Nochaiwong, Surapon",J Med Internet Res,,44

The relation of the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 to immunosuppressive treatment used in different gastrointestinal disorders is uncertain, resulting in debate with regard to suspending immunosuppressive therapy to improve infection outcome. Said suspension implies the inherent risk for graft rejection or autoimmune disease exacerbation that can potentially worsen the course of the infection.

387086,Coordination Geometrical Effect on Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer-Dependent Energy Transfer Processes of Luminescent Eu(III) Complexes,2021,"The first vaccines for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States were authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in December 2020. However, demand for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to exceed supply during the first months of the national COVID-19 vaccination program. On December 20, 2020, ACIP recommended that in Phase 1b, vaccine should be offered to persons aged 75 years and frontline essential workers, and that in Phase 1c, persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not recommended for vaccination in Phase 1b should be offered vaccine. These recommendations for phased allocation provide guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions while vaccine supply is limited. ACIP's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine allocation are interim and might be updated based on changes in conditions of FDA Emergency Use Authorization, FDA authorization for new COVID-19 vaccines, changes in vaccine supply, or changes in COVID-19 epidemiology. To inform policy options for ACIP, the COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, comprising experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, held 28 meetings to review data regarding vaccine candidates, COVID-19 surveillance, modeling of allocation scenarios, and vaccination program implementation issues. Approximately 49 million persons, including frontline essential workers and persons aged 75 years are recommended to receive vaccine in Phase 1b of the COVID-19 vaccination program. ACIP used CISA guidance to define frontline essential workers as the subset of essential workers likely at highest risk for work-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, because their work-related duties must be performed on-site and involve being in close proximity to the public or to coworkers. Although there is no national surveillance for COVID-19 among frontline or other essential workers, reports of high incidence and outbreaks within multiple critical infrastructure sectors illustrate the COVID-19 risk in these populations and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on workers who belong to racial and ethnic minority groups. The overall proportion of persons aged 75 years who live in a multigenerational household is 6%;the proportion among non-Hispanic White persons is 4%, and the proportion among racial or ethnic minority groups is higher (non-Hispanic Black persons, 10%;Hispanic or Latino persons, 18%;non-Hispanic persons of other races, 20%). In Phase 1c, vaccine should be offered to persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, and essential workers not previously included in Phase 1a or 1b. Allocation of COVID-19 vaccine to essential workers and persons at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease balances the vaccination program priorities of minimizing societal disruption and preventing morbidity and mortality. Allocation to persons aged 75 years is supported by their high risk for COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality and is anticipated to also reduce hospitalizations in this group, easing the burden on strained health care systems.","Dooling, K.; Marin, M.; Wallace, M.; McClung, N.; Chamberland, M.; Lee, G.

Treatment options for coronaviruses are limited. Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited. Our data provide evidence that clofazimine may have a role in the control of the current pandemic of COVID-19 and-possibly more importantly-in dealing with coronavirus diseases that may emerge in the future.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Xin; Meng, Xiangzhi; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Ye, Zi-Wei; Riva, Laura; Pache, Lars; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Lai, Pok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Matsunaga, Naoko; Pu, Yuan; Yuen, Chun-Kit; Cao, Jianli; Liang, Ronghui; Tang, Kaiming; Sheng, Li; Du, Yushen; Xu, Wan; Lau, Chit-Ying; Sit, Ko-Yung; Au, Wing-Kuk; Wang, Runming; Zhang, Yu-Yuan; Tang, Yan-Dong; Clausen, Thomas Mandel; Pihl, Jessica; Oh, Juntaek; Sze, Kong-Hung; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Kok, Kin-Hang; Wang, Dong; Cai, Xue-Hui; Esko, Jeffrey D; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Li, Ronald Adolphus; Chen, Honglin; Sun, Hongzhe; Jin, Dong-Yan; Sun, Ren; Chanda, Sumit K; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Nature,,44

Enormeous effords are undertaken to achieve high coverage of immunization in order to reach herd immunity to stop spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, based either on mRNA, viral vectors, or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus have been approved and are being applied worldwide. However, recently increased numbers of normally very rare types of thromboses associated with thrombocytopenia have been reported in particular in the context of the adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 from Astra Zeneca. While statistical prevalence of these side effects seem to correlate with this particular vaccine type, i.e. adenonoviral vector based vaccines, the exact molecular mechanisms are still not clear. The present review summarizes current data and hypotheses for molecular and cellular mechanisms into one integrated hypothesis indicating that coagulopathies, including thromboses, thrombocytopenia and other related side effects are correlated to an interplay of the two components in the vaccine, i.e. the spike antigen and the adenoviral vector, with the innate and immune system which under certain circumstances can imitate the picture of a limited COVID-19 pathological picture.","Kircheis, Ralf",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00089v1.pdf,44

Social and emotional loneliness and mental health were measured in May 2020, i.e., two months after the implementation of the measures, and earlier in October and November 2019. RESULTS: In this pandemic, not only loneliness of older people increased, but mental health remained roughly stable. The policy measures for physical distancing did not cause much social isolation but personal losses, worries about the pandemic, and a decline in trust in societal institutions were associated with increased mental health problems and especially emotional loneliness.

404168,Chemical Synthesis of the Antiviral Nucleotide Analogue ddhCTP,2021,"SARS CoV appeared in 2003 in China, transmitted from bats to humans via eating infected animals. It affected 8,096 humans with a death rate of 11% affecting 21 countries. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein of this virus gets attached with the ACE2 receptors present on human cells. MERS CoV was first reported in 2012 in Middle East, originated from bat and transmitted to humans through camels. MERS CoV has a fatality rate of 35% and last case reported was in 2017 making a total of 1,879 cases worldwide. DPP4 expressed on human cells is the main attaching site for RBD in S protein of MERS CoV. Folding of RBD plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Virus causing COVID-19 was named as SARS CoV-2 due its homology with SARS CoV that emerged in 2003. It has become a pandemic affecting nearly 200 countries in just 3 months' time with a death rate of 2-3% currently. The new virus is fast spreading, but it utilizes the same RBD and ACE2 receptors along with furin present in human cells. The lessons learned from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best social weapons to face and fight against this novel global threat.","Masood, Nosheen; Malik, Saima Shakil; Raja, Muhammad Naqqi; Mubarik, Sumaira; Yu, Chuanhua",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,44

In this view, several 4-t-butylbenzoyl uridine esters 4-15 with different aliphatic and aromatic groups were synthesized for antimicrobial, physicochemical and biological studies. In vitro antimicrobial tests against nine bacteria and three fungi along with prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) indicated promising antifungal functionality of these uridine esters compared to the antibacterial activities. In support of this observation their cytotoxicity and molecular docking studies have been performed against lanosterol 14&#945;-demethylase (CYP51A1) and Aspergillus flavus (1R51). Significant binding affinities were observed against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (7BQY) considering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as standard. ADMET predictions were investigated to evaluate their absorption, metabolism and toxic properties. Most of the uridine esters showed better results than that of the HCQ. Overall, the present study might be useful for the development of uridine-based novel MDR antimicrobial and COVID-19 drugs.","Matin, Mohammed Mahbubul; Uzzaman, Monir; Chowdhury, Shagir Ahammad; Bhuiyan, Md Mosharef Hossain",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,44

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the use of a scoring system for standardized triage of elective CV procedures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients scheduled for elective CV procedures that were prioritized ad hoc to be either performed or deferred when New Jersey state orders limited the performance of elective procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in both groups were scored using our proposed CV medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedure scorecard, designed to stratify procedures based on a composite measure of hospital resource utilization, risk of COVID-19 exposure, and time sensitivity. RESULTS: A total of 109 scheduled elective procedures were either deferred (n = 58) or performed (n = 51). The median and mean cumulative CV MeNTS scores for the group of performed cases were significantly lower than for the deferred group (26 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-31) vs. 33 (IQR 28-39), p < .001, and 26.4 (SE 0.34) vs. 32.9 (SE 0.35), p < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The CV MeNTS procedure score was able to stratify elective cases that were either performed or deferred using an ad hoc strategy. Our findings suggest that the CV MeNTS procedure scorecard may be useful for the fair triage of elective CV cases during the time when available capacity may be limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Waxman, Sergio; Garg, Aakash; Torre, Sabino; Wasty, Najam; Roelke, Marc; Cohen, Marc; Salemi, Arash",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,,44

420453,SMOG 2 and OpenSMOG: Extending the limits of structure-based models,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a global challenge since December 2019. Although most patients with COVID-19 exhibit mild clinical manifestations, in approximately 5% of these patients, the disease eventually progresses to severe lung injury or even multiorgan dysfunction. This situation represents various challenges to hepatology. In the context of liver injury in patients with COVID-19, several key problems need to be solved. For instance, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade liver, especially when ACE2 appears to be negligibly expressed on hepatocytes. In addition, the mechanisms underlying liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients are not fully understood, which are likely multifactorial and related to hyperinflammation, dysregulated immune responses, abnormal coagulation and drugs. Here, we systematically describe the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated liver injury and propose several hypotheses about its etiopathogenesis.","Li, Dongxiao; Ding, Xiangming; Xie, Meng; Tian, Dean; Xia, Limin",J Gastroenterol,,44

Gamification is very important because it helps students to represent their study contents and enrich their experiences of higher education when learning in-person is unavailable during the Covid-19 period. This study seeks to present an Android-based gamification app to evaluate the effect of using gamification and e-quizzes on college students' learning. We used the visual blocks language from the MIT App Inventor platform to develop an application, available at (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_mekomerofofo.projectGamification). The participants were students from level 2 who used digital lessons for learning MATLAB. The study included gamified learning and non-gamified learning, both integrated into lesson plans, to investigate the differences in learners' performance. Two types of quizzes were used for instruction: gamified e-quizzes and paper-based quizzes. The outcomes plainly showed that using the new gamified e-quiz was more effective than using paper-based quizzes. They are better for assessing the learning performance of the students in question, specifically in terms of formative assessment. It is very important for instructors to apply games as a modern and innovation-oriented tool through which students can be engaged in an attractive, competitive experience.","Areed, Marwa F; Amasha, Mohamed A; Abougalala, Rania A; Alkhalaf, Salem; Khairy, Dalia",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,44

425199,Pharmacological validation of targets regulating CD14 during macrophage differentiation,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent feature of COVID-19. Despite the growing evidence, current knowledge on the subject remains insufficient, so that data obtained with different tools, from multiple centers and in distinct scenarios are welcome. Yet, the predictive value of olfactory dysfunction in terms of the overall prognosis of COVID-19 is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the olfactory function of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the impact of the results on their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to a university tertiary hospital were recruited and divided into those with ARDS due to COVID-19, and those with ARDS of any other cause. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and the patients had their objective olfactory function evaluated by the Alcohol Sniff Test on admission and during hospital stay. The participants were then followed up until reaching an endpoint: hospital discharge, endotracheal intubation, transfer to the intensive care unit, or death. Patients with COVID-19 were also subgrouped and compared according to their olfactory thresholds and to their overall clinical outcomes. The obtained data was analyzed using R software. Level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included (of which 58 had COVID-19). 87.93% of the patients with COVID-19 had diminished olfactory dysfunction on admission. The mean length of hospital stay among patients with olfactory dysfunction was greater (7.84 vs 6.14 days) and nine individuals in this subgroup had poor overall outcomes. None of those with normal olfactory function developed critical COVID-19. The mean olfactory function was significantly worse among patients with COVID-19 and poor outcomes (3.97 vs 7.90 cm, P = .023). CONCLUSION: Objective olfactory dysfunction is frequent in ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with longitudinal poorer outcomes present worse olfactory thresholds on admission.","Mangia, Lucas Resende Lucinda; Soares, Marcelly Botelho; de Souza, Thiago Sasso Carmona; De Masi, Roberta David João; Scarabotto, Patrícia Cristina; Hamerschmidt, Rogério",Auris nasus larynx,,44
426644,Progress and outlook in studying the substrate specificities of PARPs and related enzymes,2020,"Objective: To investigate the effect of zinc finger protein A20 on lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in rabbits. Methods: Twenty-six 3-month-old New Zealand rabbits, 2.0-2.5 kg in weight, were used to establish the model of intervertebral disc degeneration at L 3, 4, L 4, 5, and L 5, 6 by transabdominal needle puncture. At 4 weeks after operation, the 24 rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups after successful modeling, which checked by MRI. The target intervertebral discs of each group were injected with zinc finger protein A20 overexpressed adenovirus (Ov-A20 group), empty carrier adenovirus (NC group), phosphate buffer saline (control group), and shRNA-A20 adenovirus (Sh-A20 group). The biological responses of animals in each group were comprehensive scored before 1 day of injection and after 1, 2, 3, and 6 days of injection. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection, the animals in each group were observed by MRI to obtain the exact T2 relaxation time (T2 signal value). After MRI examination, the animals were killed to take the degenerative intervertebral disc tissue; and the tissue was detected by Alcian blue staining to observed the intervertebral disc degeneration. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen â ¡, and aggrecan were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, nuclear factor &#954;B binding protein [P65, phosphate P65 (P-P65), collagen â ¡, aggrecan], inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß)], autophagy-related protein [LC3 (LC3â ¡/LC3â ) and P62] were detected by Western blot. Results: The comprehensive score of biological response in each group after injection was significantly lower than that before injection ( P<0.05). At 6 days after injection, the comprehensive score of biological response in the Sh-A20 group was significantly lower than that in other groups ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference among other groups ( P>0.05). The detection of MRI showed that the T2 signal value in the Ov-A20 group was the highest at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection ( P<0.05), and the T2 signal value in the Sh-A20 group was the lowest at 2 and 4 weeks after injection ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Alcian blue staining showed that the expression of aggrecan was the highest in Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group at 4 weeks ( P<0.05); the expression of aggrecan in Ov-A20 group was the highest at 8 weeks ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen â ¡, and aggrecan were the highest in Ov-A20 group and lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). Western blot showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen â ¡, aggrecan, and LC3 (LC3â ¡/LC3â ) proteins were the highest in the Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05), while the expressions of P-P65, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, and P62 proteins were the lowest in Ov-A20 group and the highest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of p65 protein between groups ( P>0.05). Conclusion: Zinc finger protein A20 can effectively regulate the process of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in rabbits by inhibiting inflammation.","Zhang, Ye; Xia, Huiqiang; Yi, Weiwei; Lan, Haiyang; Yang, Zhijie; Han, Fei; Tang, Pan; Liu, Bo",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,44
428028,"Wish you were here: Meetings, no meetings, meeting reports",2020,"Most COVID-19 infected individuals present with mild flu-like symptoms; however, 5-10% of cases suffer from life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory failure. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology of associated acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, coagulopathy and multiorgan failure is not known. SARS-CoV-2 is an envelope virus with S (spike), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelop) proteins. In a closely related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the transmembrane E protein exerts an important role in membrane-ionic transport through viroporins, deletion of which reduced levels of IL-1ß and a remarkably reduced lung edema compared to wild type. IL-1ß is generated by macrophages upon activation of intracellular NLRP3 (NOD-like, leucine rich repeat domains, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), part of the functional NLRP3 inflammasome complex that detects pathogenic microorganisms and stressors, while neutrophils are enhanced by increasing levels of IL-1ß. Expiring neutrophils undergo ""NETosis"", producing thread-like extracellular structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which protect against mild infections and microbes. However, uncontrolled NET production can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, multiple organ failure, and autoimmune disease. Herein, we present arguments underlying our hypothesis that IL-1ß and NETs, mediated via NLRP3 inflammasomes, form a feed-forward loop leading to the excessive alveolar and endothelial damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Considering such assertions, we propose potential drug candidates that could be used to alleviate such pathologies. Considering that recent efforts to ascertain effective treatments of COVID-19 in severe patients has been less than successful, investigating novel avenues of treating this virus are essential.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Kashir, Junaid",Med Hypotheses,,44
428185,The Protein Corona Conundrum: Exploring the Advantages and Drawbacks of its Presence around Amphiphilic Nanoparticles,2020,"BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the patients' perception of the dental practice during the COVID-19 outbreak, and whether the pandemic will affect the attendance of orthodontic patients at the dental practice. An online questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), was submitted to Italian dental patients with items about their perceived risks when going to the dentist, concerns about continuing orthodontic treatment, and the onset of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Data were analyzed with a chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1566 subjects completed the survey, including 486 who were under orthodontic treatment or who had a child in orthodontic treatment. A total of 866 participants (55.3%) thought the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection was higher in a dental practice; this perception was associated with gender (women more than man), age (over 60 years old) and high levels of distress (P<0.001). However, 894 patients (57.1%) felt comfortable going back to the dentist. Most of the orthodontic patients (84%) would continue their treatment. After the lockdown, there was a slight increase in the frequency of TMD pain (356 versus 334). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants believed that the dental practice is a place at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, even if they continue to go to the dentist. Gender, age, and the level of distress were associated with the increase in the fear of going to the dentist due to COVID-19. Because of the pandemic, 16% of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment would not return to the dental practice to continue their orthodontic treatment after the lockdown. The prevalence of TMD pain in the population increased due to the pandemic.","Martina, Stefano; Amato, Alessandra; Faccioni, Paolo; Iandolo, Alfredo; Amato, Massimo; Rongo, Roberto",Prog Orthod,,44

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the prevention of knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the residents of Ethiopia. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author's network with popular social media such as Facebook, Telegram, and email. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit participants. In doing so, we collected the responses of 341 participants successfully from April 15 to 22, 2020. The collected data were analyzed by STATA version 14 software and descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the knowledge and practices of the community towards the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The majority of respondents 80.5% were male. About 91.2% of the participants heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, out of 341 participants 90.0%, 93.8% of them knew that the COVID-19 pandemic was prevented by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing, respectively. This shows that the prevention knowledge of the participants towards the COVID-19 by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing was high. However, out of 341 participants only 61%,84% of them practiced social distance and frequent handwashing toward COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the participants knew the ways to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), but there was a great problem of changing this prevention knowledge to practices. This shows that there is an action gap between having prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 and implementing it into practices to tackle the spread of the COVID-19 among communities. Therefore, the concerned body should be focused on providing awareness and education for the community regarding the implementation of prevention knowledge to practices.","Bekele, Daniel; Tolossa, Tadesse; Tsegaye, Reta; Teshome, Wondesen",PLoS One,,44

The monitoring station at Hateruma Island observes the outflow of Chinese emissions during winter and spring. A systematic increase in the &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratio, governed by synoptic wind variability, well corroborated the increase in China's fossil-fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions during 1997-2019. However, the &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratios showed significant decreases of 29 ± 11 and 16 ± 11 mol mol-1 in February and March 2020, respectively, relative to the 2011-2019 average of 131 ± 11 mol mol-1. By projecting these observed &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratios on transport model simulations, we estimated reductions of 32 ± 12% and 19 ± 15% in the FFCO2 emissions in China for February and March 2020, respectively, compared to the expected emissions. Our data are consistent with the abrupt decrease in the economic activity in February, a slight recovery in March, and return to normal in April, which was calculated based on the COVID-19 lockdowns and mobility restriction datasets.","Tohjima, Yasunori; Patra, Prabir K; Niwa, Yosuke; Mukai, Hitoshi; Sasakawa, Motoki; Machida, Toshinobu",Sci Rep,,44

However, eyes with KPro can experience various complications, including the development of retroprosthetic membrane (RPM). RPMs reduce visual acuity in patients due to physical obstruction of the visual axis, but studies have shown that RPM can also lead to a variety of other consequences, from melting of the corneal carrier graft to precipitating retinal detachments. Histopathologic studies have shown that RPMs are composed of elements from both the recipient and donor. The presence of myofibroblasts in RPMs imparts them with contractile properties, which can contribute to their downstream complications, including angle closure, hypotony, and retinal detachment. At present, there are limited treatments to combat the growth of RPM. Future therapies could include anti-metabolites and targeted anti-inflammatory treatments, as well as device coatings or textured device surfaces that can hinder RPM proliferation.

453947,The nucleocapsid protein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses is an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery,2020,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors were widely used as off-label treatment options for COVID-19 but the safety data of these drugs among the COVID-19 population are largely lacking. Drug-induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro-arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID-19 population. METHODS: We included 446 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID-19 within a period of one month (March-April 2020). In addition to COVID-19-related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of &#8805;470 ms in postpubertal males, and &#8805;480 ms in postpubertal females. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person-days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro-QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ-only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc-prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11-24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66-11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ-PI combination group, having concomitant pro-QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53-9.73; p = 0.004). Four patients who had prolonged QTc intervals died but none were cardiac-related deaths. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to the disease itself. ECG monitoring should be continued for at least a week from the initiation of treatment.","Koh, Hui Moon; Chong, Pei Feng; Tan, Ju Nee; Chidambaram, Suresh Kumar; Chua, Hiu Jian",J Clin Pharm Ther,,44

Cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of 1,126 women aged 20-69 years living in São Leopoldo/RS. SB, demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral and health factors data were collected using a questionnaire administered by interviewers. The cut-off point for ESB was defined as the median. Associations were tested using Poisson regression with robust error variance. The medians and interquartile intervals (min/day) for leisure, occupation, and transport SB were 163.9(86.6-2710.5), 51.4(0-257.1), and 17.1(5.7-37.3), respectively. The likelihood of leisure SB increased with education level, was higher among women who were not employed, lived in household without children, and smokers. In other domains, there was an inverse association between age, being white, economic class, education level, and income and ESB. Direct association between living in a household with a car and excessive transport SB and women who were not employed were 30% less likely to engage in ESB in this domain. The predominant domain in Total SB was leisure. Associations differed across domains, indicating that domain-specific interventions should be implemented in addressing excessive SB.","Cafruni, Cristina Borges; Olinto, Maria Teresa Anselmo; Costa, Juvenal Soares Dias da; Bairros, Fernanda Souza de; Henn, Ruth Liane",Cien Saude Colet,,44

462682,A molecular pore spans the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle,2020,"BACKGROUND: Numerous barrier devices have recently been developed and rapidly deployed worldwide in an effort to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from exposure to COVID-19 during high-risk procedures. However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data was captured by high-speed flash photography and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed towards the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled towards the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the healthcare worker located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSION: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution and further validation studies are necessary.","Fried, Eric A; Zhou, George; Shah, Ronak; Shin, Da Wi; Shah, Anjan; Katz, Daniel; Burnett, Garrett W",,,44
462998,Four-step approach to efficiently develop capillary gel electrophoresis methods for viral vaccine protein analysis,2020,"This opinion piece highlights a lethal connection between novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and wildlife consumption in tourism. While NCP continues to make headlines in the mainstream media, little academic research has considered this illness, especially through the lens of food neophilic tourism. Yet this research stream requires attention, particularly because food is a key motivational factor behind tourists’ travel and destination choices. In the case of food neophilic tourism, visitors directly consume wildlife and other exotic cuisine. Unfortunately, this novelty-seeking behavior may pose health risks; wild and exotic animals can carry deadly viruses that have been found to trigger global health epidemics such as SARS, H1N1, bird flu, and NCP. Despite international government agencies’ legislative efforts to control wild and exotic animal consumption, demand from food neophilic tourists continues to increase. This paper initiates a dialogue urging tourism scholars to study food tourism and offers practical and theoretical insight to contextualize this perennial and pertinent phenomenon.","Ying, Tianyu; Wang, Kaiyun; Liu, Xinyi; Wen, Jun; Goh, Edmund",Tour.

An improved methodology based on mass spectrometry and a pilot monitoring programme,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To review the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke care-metrics and report data from a health system in Houston. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of the published literature reporting stroke admissions, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) cases, number of thrombolysis (tPA) and thrombectomy (MT) cases, and time metrics (door to needle, DTN; and door to groin time, DTG) during the pandemic compared to prepandemic period. Within our hospital system, between January-June 2019 and January-June 2020, we compared the proportion of stroke admissions and door to tPA and MT times. RESULTS: A total of 32,640 stroke admissions from 29 studies were assessed. Compared to prepandemic period, the mean ratio of stroke admissions during the pandemic was 70.78% [95% CI, 65.02%, 76.54%], ICH cases was 83.10% [95% CI, 71.01%, 95.17%], tPA cases was 81.74% [95% CI, 72.33%, 91.16%], and MT cases was 88.63% [95% CI, 74.12%, 103.13%], whereas DTN time was 104.48% [95% CI, 95.52%, 113.44%] and DTG was 104.30% [95% CI, 81.99%, 126.61%]. In Houston, a total of 4808 cases were assessed. There was an initial drop of ~30% in cases at the pandemic onset. Compared to 2019, there was a significant reduction in mild strokes (NIHSS 1-5) [N (%), 891 (43) vs 635 (40), P = 0.02]. There were similar mean (SD) (mins) DTN [44 (17) vs 42 (17), P = 0.14] but significantly prolonged DTG times [94 (15) vs 85 (20), P = 0.005] in 2020. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a global reduction in stroke admissions and treatment interventions and prolonged treatment time metrics.","Reddy, Sujan T; Satani, Nikunj; Beauchamp, Jennifer E S; Selvaraj, Sudhakar; Rajan, Suja S; Rahbar, Mohammad H; Tahanan, Amirali; Kim, Sori; Holder, Travis; Jiang, Xiaoqian; Chen, Luyao; Kamal, Haris; Indupuru, Hari Kishan R; Wu, Tzu-Ching; Savitz, Sean I",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,,44

Their role became more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the community pharmacists' preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and how efficiently they were prepared to contain and prevent the spread of infection. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Jordan through social media platforms. A scoring system was developed to measure their level of adherence to the preventive measures of the global infection. RESULTS: The total included responses were 800. Around 44% of the pharmacists reported spending less than 15 min/d reading about COVID-19 updates. Although more than half of them were reviewing official sites, 73% of them were also retrieving information through non-official channels. Additionally, almost 35% of them were directly contacting customers without physical barriers, 81% reported encountering infected customers, and 12% wore the same facial masks for more than a day. Moreover, 58% of the pharmacies reported the absence of door signs requesting infected customers to declare the infection, 43% of the pharmacies were not limiting the number of simultaneous customers, and 70% were not measuring customers' temperatures prior to entry. Collectively, the mean total score of applied protective measures was 10.12 ± 2.77 (out of 17). CONCLUSION: The level of preparedness of the community pharmacies in these three Middle Eastern countries was not adequate for facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities in these countries should closely monitor their adherence to the protective guidelines.","Itani, Rania; Karout, Samar; Khojah, Hani M J; Jaffal, Fatima; Abbas, Fatme; Awad, Reem; Karout, Lina; Abu-Farha, Rana K; Kassab, Mohamad B; Mukattash, Tareq L",Int J Clin Pract,,44

However, in the context of Bangladesh, no study has explored whether students from public and private universities have been affected differently. Therefore, the aim of the study is to focus on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and co-morbidity among both types of university students and identify their potential correlates. Methods The study used convenience sampling to collect data from 333 university students. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively along with co-morbidity. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to examine the association of variables. Results Among public university students, 59.16% had depression, 53.99% had anxiety and 46.95% had co-morbidity ranging from moderate to severe level. 30.83%, 33.33% and 24.17% of the private university students showed moderate to severe levels of depression, anxiety, and co-morbidity respectively. Overall, female students, students enrolled in third and fourth year, living in nuclear families, and students who spent less time with family reported having higher level of depression, anxiety, and co-morbidity. Limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we were unable to make causal inferences. Also, data collected through snowball-sampling were prone to selection bias. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic imposes a greater burden on mental health of students with different socioeconomic characteristics and university type. Therefore, psychological intervention designs should address these differences.","Mehareen, Jeenat Rahman Mahir A.; Dhira, Tahia Anan Sarker Abdur Razzaque",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,,44

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx&#8482; Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. METHODS: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively.

509850,Newsmakers,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demand upon critical care services for invasive mechanical ventilation. There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020. RESULTS: A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. CONCLUSION: In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment. ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.","Takhar, Arunjit; Walker, Abigail; Tricklebank, Stephen; Wyncoll, Duncan; Hart, Nicholas; Jacob, Tony; Arora, Asit; Skilbeck, Christopher; Simo, Ricard; Surda, Pavol",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,44
516183,The Effect of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Physician Assistant Educators,2020,"Travel can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 introduction. To reduce introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the state of Alaska implemented a program on June 6, 2020, for arriving air, sea, and road travelers that required either molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or a 14-day self-quarantine after arrival. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) used weekly standardized reports submitted by 10 participating Alaska airports to evaluate air traveler choices to undergo testing or self-quarantine, traveler test results, and airport personnel experiences while implementing the program. Among 386,435 air travelers who arrived in Alaska during June 6-November 14, 2020, a total of 184,438 (48%) chose to be tested within 72 hours before arrival, 111,370 (29%) chose to be tested on arrival, and 39,685 (10%) chose to self-quarantine without testing after arrival. An additional 15,112 persons received testing at airport testing sites; these were primarily travelers obtaining a second test 7-14 days after arrival, per state guidance. Of the 126,482 airport tests performed in Alaska, 951 (0.8%) results were positive, or one per 406 arriving travelers. Airport testing program administrators reported that clear communication, preparation, and organization were vital for operational success; challenges included managing travelers' expectations and ensuring that sufficient personnel and physical space were available to conduct testing. Expected mitigation measures such as vaccination, physical distancing, mask wearing, and avoidance of gatherings after arrival might also help limit postarrival transmission. Posttravel self-quarantine and testing programs might reduce travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and importation, even without enforcement. Traveler education and community and industry partnerships might help ensure success.","Ohlsen, Elizabeth C; Porter, Kimberly A; Mooring, Eric; Cutchins, Coleman; Zink, Anne; McLaughlin, Joseph",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,44

However, the reasons for the changes in mutation patterns are still unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of over 300 million peptides derived from 13,432 SARS-CoV-2 strains harboring 4,420 amino acid mutations to analyze the potential selective pressure of the host immune system and reveal the driver of mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The results showed that the nonstructural protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike were most susceptible to mutations. Furthermore, mutations in cross-reactive T-cell epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronavirus may help SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under long-term and large-scale community transmission. Additionally, through homology modeling and protein docking, mutations in Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells and escape antibody-mediated B-cell immunity. Our research provided insights into the potential mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 under natural selection, improved our understanding of the evolution of the virus, and established important guidance for potential vaccine design.","Zhang, Chengdong; Jin, Xuanxuan; Chen, Xianyang; Qiu, Li; Leng, Qibin; Qiu, Tianyi",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.599562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093454/,44

To date, no real- world data about the efficacy of NmAb has been reported from clinical practice. We assessed the impact of NmAb treatment given in the outpatient clinical practice setting on hospital utilization. METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify adult COVID-19 patients who received NmAbs [bamlanivimab (BAM) or casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2)] and historic COVID-19 controls. Post-index hospitalization rates were compared. RESULTS: 707 confirmed COVID-19 patients received NmAb and 1709 historic COVID-19 controls were included; 553 (78%) received BAM, 154 (22%) received REGN-COV2. Patients receiving NmAb infusion had significantly lower hospitalization rate (5.8% vs. 11.4%, p<0.0001); a shorter length of stay if hospitalized (mean 5.2 days vs. 7.4 days, p=0.02), and fewer ED visits within 30 days post-index (8.1% vs 12.3%, p=0.003) than controls. Hospitalization-free survival was significantly longer in NmAb patients compared to controls (p<0.0001). There was a trend towards a lower hospitalization rate among patients who received NmAb within 2-4 days after symptom onset. In multivariate analysis, having received a NmAb transfusion was independently associated with a lower risk of hospitalization after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI and referral source: adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.54 (0.38 – 0.79), p=0.0012. Overall mortality was not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: NmAb treatment reduced hospital utilization especially when received within a few days of symptom onset. Further study is needed to validate these findings.","Verderese, John Paul; Stepanova, Maria; Lam, Brian; Racila, Andrei; Kolacevski, Andrej; Allen, David; Hodson, Erin; Aslani-Amoli, Bahareh; Homeyer, Michael; Stanmyre, Sarah; Stevens, Helen; Garofalo, Stephanie; Henry, Linda; Venkatesan, Chapy; Gerber, Lynn H; Motew, Steve; Jones, J Stephen; Younossi, Zobair M",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166513/,44
594156,Novel adjuvants and vaccine delivery systems,1996-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in HIV diagnosis and treatment, adolescents and young adults 12-25 years old have high HIV incidence, poor engagement and retention in treatment, and low rates of adherence and virologic suppression when compared to their older counterparts. HIV has emerged as a chronic disease for which antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is critical for virologic suppression and long-term survival. Virologic suppression has been elusive for many youth with HIV (YHIV). Novel strategies designed to facilitate health care systems’ support for YHIV between medical visits are essential for improving ART adherence, virologic suppression, and long-term survival. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH2CHECK) to a standard of care (SOC) control group for improving ART adherence and subsequent viral suppression using a randomized trial design. The objectives are to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of TECH2CHECK as compared to SOC for management of HIV in the outpatient setting and to examine the sustainability of self-care behavior, adherence, and virologic suppression among youth following the intervention period. METHODS: We will recruit 120 adherence-challenged YHIV being followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and in Jacksonville. Eligible participants complete an audio, computer-assisted self-interview and are randomized to either TECH2CHECK intervention or the SOC (60 participants in each arm). The primary outcome of interest is virologic suppression (viral load <20 copies/mL) and improved treatment adherence. Participants in the intervention arm receive community health nursing visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 26 weeks. The intervention arm also receives SMS messaging comprising daily adherence and appointment reminders and positive reinforcement for medication adherence daily for 2 weeks, on alternate days for 2 weeks, thrice weekly for 1 month, weekly for 3 months, and every 2 weeks for the rest of the study duration. The control group receives appointment reminders and SOC per clinic protocol. Exploratory analysis will be conducted to determine differences in medication adherence and virologic suppression in the 2 arms and to assess cost-effectiveness and study feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS: In the first 23 months of the study (July 2018-April 2020), 56 (55%) of 102 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized. At present, participating youths are primarily African American (53/56, 95%), male (37/56, 66%), and ≥18 years old (53/56, 95%). Follow-up study visits, as required per the protocol, have been completed by 77% (43/56), 94% (45/48), 95% (37/39), 96% (24/25), and 100% (10/10) of participants at the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month follow-ups, respectively.

However, it remains a source of anxiety to patients and families. This research aimed to assess the impact of a newly developed educational simplified video about LP, in the parents’ native language, that is tailored to their social background and beliefs and to assess whether it can facilitate their consent for the procedure. METHODS: This prospective, interventional study was conducted at the outpatient pediatric clinics at a teaching hospital. The conventional arm used verbal explanation about LP. The second method utilized a standardized video, having the same information as the conventional arm, with streaming of graphic depictions. Parents’ knowledge and perceived LP risks were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Two hundred and one parents were enrolled, with no significant differences in the socio-demographic and baseline characteristics. Both verbal and video-based counseling were found to provide a statistically significant increase in knowledge scores, and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that knowledge gains for both groups were statistically significant (Verbal Explanation: W = 2693, n = 83, P < .001 and Video: W = 5538, n = 117, P < .001). However, the conventional verbal counseling resulted in more consistent gain of knowledge (SD = 14.5) as compared to the video group (SD = 18.94). The video group reported higher perceived risk (Mean 8.2, SD 3.59) than the verbal explanation group (Mean 7.12, SD 2.51). The less educated parents perceived LP procedure to be of significantly higher risk after watching the video (P < .001). It was found that 73.6% of persons with perceived intention to refuse LP changed their opinion after either of the counseling interventions, with significant opinion difference pre- and post-counseling intervention (P value .002). CONCLUSIONS: Video education in parents’ native language about LP is as effective as conventional verbal education for informed consent, with the additional advantage of reproducibility and more illustrations to give parents better insight. However, this video should be followed by direct interaction with parents to ensure their full understanding and address any further concerns.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Alsohime, Fahad; Alhasan, Khalid A.; Bashiri, Fahad A.; Salleeh, Hashim Bin; Hasan, Gamal M.; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Sabei, Narjes; Al-Wehaibi, Abdullah; Temsah, Omar; Somily, Ali M.; Al-Zamil, Fahad",Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084883/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpam.2020.11.003,44

The lungs are the main organ involved, and chest X-rays, whether obtained in conventional X-ray suites or with portable units, are the first-line imaging test because they are widely available and economical. Chest CT is more sensitive than plain chest X-rays, and CT studies make it possible to identify complications in addition to pulmonary involvement, as well as to suggestive alternative diagnoses.

Compared to differential equation-based system dynamical models of infectious disease transmission, individual-based epidemic models exhibit the advantage of providing a more detailed description of realities to capture heterogeneities across a population. However, the higher granularity and resolution of individual-based epidemic models comes with the cost of increased computational complexities, which result in difficulty in formulating individual-based epidemic models with mathematics. Furthermore, it requires great effort to understand and reproduce existing individual-based epidemic models presented by previous researchers. We proposed a mathematical formulation of heterogeneous individual-based epidemic models using matrices. Matrices and vectors were applied to represent individual attributes and behaviors. We derived analytical results from the matrix-based formulations of individual epidemic models, and then designed algorithms to force the computation of matrix-based individual epidemic models. Finally, we used a SARS epidemic control as a case study to verify the matrix-based formulation of heterogeneous individual-based epidemic models.","Duan, Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073465/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115716,44

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, primarily involves the respiratory system with viral pneumonia as a predominant manifestation. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has various cardiovascular manifestations which increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases and conventional cardiovascular risk factors are predisposed for COVID-19 with worse prognosis. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury are endothelial dysfunction, diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis and increased angiotensin II levels. Hyperinflammation in the myocardium can result in acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The high level of cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides in the early course of COVID-19 reflects an acute myocardial injury.

597945,Avian influenza H5N1: an update on molecular pathogenesis,2009-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality for Israel and the Palestinian territory. Given the extensive interaction between the two populations, vaccination in one population may indirectly benefit the other via reduced transmission. Due to the mobility and extensive contacts, Palestinians employed in Israel could be a prime target for vaccination. METHODS: To evaluate the epidemiological and the economic benefits conferred by vaccinating Palestinians employed in Israel, we developed a model of influenza transmission within and between Israel and the West Bank. We parameterized the contact patterns underlying transmission by conducting a survey among Palestinians employed in Israel, and integrating survey results with traffic patterns and socio-demographic data. RESULTS: Vaccinating 50% of Palestinian workers is predicted to reduce the annual influenza burden by 28,745 cases (95% CI: 15,031-50,717) and 37.7 deaths (95% CI: 19·9–65·5) for the Israeli population, and by 32,9900 cases (95% CI: 14,379-51,531) and 20.2 deaths (CI 95%: 9·8–31·5) for the Palestinian population. Further, we found that as the indirect protection was so substantial, funding such a vaccination campaign would be cost-saving from the Israeli Ministry of Health perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Offering influenza vaccination to Palestinians employed in Israel could efficiently reduce morbidity and mortality within both Israel and the Palestinian territory.

There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes. The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure. Methods The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review. Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status. Results An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs. Conclusions At a time of overwhelming and changing information and recommendations, an operative team checklist may provide some structure to healthcare workers undertaking AGP to reduce anxiety, maintain focus, prompt consideration of alternatives and potentially reduce risk.","Soma, Marlene; Jacobson, Ian; Brewer, Jessica; Blondin, Angela; Davidson, Gretel; Singham, Shamani",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110075; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620302184?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388083/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620302184,44
598447,"Influenza B, C and D Viruses",2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Early detection is the key to contain the ongoing pandemic. The current gold standard to detect SARS CoV2 is RT-PCR. However, it has a high false negative rate and long turnaround time. PURPOSE: In view of the high sensitivity of CT in detection of lower respiratory tract pathologies, a study of 2581 patients comparing RT-PCR status with CT findings was undertaken to see if it augments the diagnostic performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi centre prospective study of consecutive cases was conducted. All CT studies suggestive of COVID 19 pneumonia were collated and evaluated independently by three Radiologists to confirm the imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The RT-PCR values were retrospectively obtained, based on the RT-PCR values, CT studies were categorised into three subgroups, positive, negative and unknown. CT features from all three groups were compared to evaluate any communality or discordance. RESULTS: Out of the 2581 patients with positive CT findings for COVID pneumonia, 825 were females and 1,756 were males in a wide age group of 28-90 years. Predominant CT features observed in all the subgroups were Ground glass densities 94.8%, in mixed distribution (peripheral and central) (59.12%), posterior segments in 92% and multilobar involvement in 70.9%. The CT features across the three subgroups were statistically significant with a P value <0.001. CONCLUSION: There was a communality of CT findings regardless of RT-PCR status. In a pandemic setting ground glass densities in a subpleural, posterior and basal distribution are indicative of COVID 19. Thus CT chest in conjunction to RT PCR augments the diagnosis of COVID 19 pneumonia; utilization of CT chest may just be the missing link in closing this pandemic.","Kohli, Anirudh; Joshi, Anagha; Shah, Ankur; Jain, Richa D; Gorlawar, Abhishek; Dhapare, Amol; Desai, Jigar; Shetty, Aditya; Shah, Chirag; Ostwal, Prachi; Talraja, Anisha",Indian J Radiol Imaging,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijri.ijri_739_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814765/,44
598590,Physico-chemical properties of calf-diarrhea coronavirus,1977-06-30,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted great efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This research aims to scrutinize the outlook, awareness, and customs of Saudi undergraduate students regarding COVID-19. METHODS: The current cross-sectional study comprises 178 undergraduate students in the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences. The data were collected from online Google form questionnaires. The differences were picked out of the questionnaires, and the mean scores of the differences were duly assessed. The variables associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were evaluated; moreover, a comparative study was conducted on these variables in different faculty departments. ANOVA, Student’s t-test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the data on knowledge, attitude, and practice. RESULTS: Most of the undergraduate students were well acquainted with COVID-19. We obtained the mean knowledge score for COVID-19 to be 3.08 ± .82 (range: 1–5), indicating good knowledge. The attitude means the score was 3.02 ± .61 (range: 0–4), implying good positive attitudes. On assessing the mean score of practices, it was found 5 ± .47 (range: 0–7), pointing towards perfect practices. There were no significant differences between males and females regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward COVID-19 (p-value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Students of Applied Medical Sciences are knowledgeable about COVID-19. Health education programs should be focused on protection and safety from COVID-19 for Applied Medical Sciences students, especially Medical Rehabilitation Sciences and Radiology. Hand hygiene awareness programs must be conducted for undergraduate students. Infection control should be part of the undergraduate applied for medical sciences curriculum program.","Adam, Mohamed; Gameraddin, Moawia; Alelyani, Magbool; Zaman, Gaffar Sarwar; Musa, Alamin; Ahmad, Irshad; Alshahrani, Mohammad Y; Alsultan, Kamal; Gareeballah, Awadia",Adv Med Educ Pract,https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s314163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335069/,44

600344,Prevalence of Isospora suis and Eimeria spp. in suckling piglets and sows in Poland,2007-06-20,"Background and aims: The facilitating role of the school setting in SARS-CoV-2 infection spread is still debated and the potential of school closures to mitigate transmission unclear. In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Methods: Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools. Results: Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously positive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 125 of 275 classes. Among the classes with at least 50% and [≥]5 children tested, 0, 1-2 or >=3 seropositive children were present in in 90 (58%), 57 (37%) and 7 (5%) out of 154 classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer. Conclusions: Under a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Ulyte, A.; Radtke, T.; Abela, I.

602256,Build a Sustainable Vaccines Industry with Synthetic Biology,2021-01-08,"BACKGROUND: With the growing number of the aged population, the number of Parkinson’s disease (PD) affected people is also mounting. Unfortunately, due to insufficient resources and awareness in underdeveloped countries, proper and timely PD detection is highly challenged. Besides, all PD patients’ symptoms are neither the same nor they all become pronounced at the same stage of the illness. Therefore, this work aims to combine more than one symptom (rest tremor and voice degradation) by collecting data remotely using smartphones and detect PD with the help of a cloud-based machine learning system for telemonitoring the PD patients in the developing countries. METHOD: This proposed system receives rest tremor and vowel phonation data acquired by smartphones with built-in accelerometer and voice recorder sensors. The data are primarily collected from diagnosed PD patients and healthy people for building and optimizing machine learning models that exhibit higher performance. After that, data from newly suspected PD patients are collected, and the trained algorithms are evaluated to detect PD. Based on the majority-vote from those algorithms, PD-detected patients are connected with a nearby neurologist for consultation. Upon receiving patients’ feedback after being diagnosed by the neurologist, the system may update the model by retraining using the latest data. Also, the system requests the detected patients periodically to upload new data to track their disease progress. RESULT: The highest accuracy in PD detection using offline data was [Formula: see text] from voice data and [Formula: see text] from tremor data when used separately. In both cases, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) gave the highest accuracy over support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). The application of maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) feature selection method showed that by selecting different feature sets based on the patient’s gender, we could improve the detection accuracy. This study’s novelty is the application of ensemble averaging on the combined decisions generated from the analysis of voice and tremor data. The average accuracy of PD detection becomes [Formula: see text] when ensemble averaging was performed on majority-vote from kNN, SVM, and NB. CONCLUSION: The proposed system can detect PD using a cloud-based system for computation, data preserving, and regular monitoring of voice and tremor samples captured by smartphones. Thus, this system can be a solution for healthcare authorities to ensure the older population’s accessibility to a better medical diagnosis system in the developing countries, especially in the pandemic situation like COVID-19, when in-person monitoring is minimal.","Sajal, Md.

602911,Kinetics and mechanism of formation of nickel(II)porphyrin and its interaction with DNA in aqueous medium,2021-08-03,"1. Bats are reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, including Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses and Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. These viruses demonstrate predictable patterns in seasonality and age structure across multiple systems; previous work suggests that they may circulate in Madagascar’s endemic fruit bats, which are widely consumed as human food. 2. We aimed to (a) document the extent of henipa- and filovirus exposure among Malagasy fruit bats, (b) explore seasonality in seroprevalence and serostatus in these bat populations and (c) compare mechanistic hypotheses for possible transmission dynamics underlying these data. 3. To this end, we amassed and analysed a unique dataset documenting longitudinal serological henipa-and filovirus dynamics in three Madagascar fruit bat species. 4. We uncovered serological evidence of exposure to Hendra-/Nipah-related henipaviruses in Eidolon dupreanum, Pteropus rufus and Rousettus madagascariensis, to Cedar-related henipaviruses in E. dupreanum and R. madagascariensis and to Ebola-related filoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. We demonstrated significant seasonality in population-level seroprevalence and individual serostatus for multiple viruses across these species, linked to the female reproductive calendar. An age-structured subset of the data highlighted evidence of waning maternal antibodies in neonates, increasing seroprevalence in young and decreasing seroprevalence late in life. Comparison of mechanistic epidemiological models fit to these data offered support for transmission hypotheses permitting waning antibodies but retained immunity in adult-age bats. 5. Our findings suggest that bats may seasonally modulate mechanisms of pathogen control, with consequences for population-level transmission. Additionally, we narrow the field of candidate transmission hypotheses by which bats are presumed to host and transmit potentially zoonotic viruses globally.","Brook, Cara E.; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana C.; Broder, Christopher C.; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Héraud, Jean-Michel; Peel, Alison J.; Gibson, Louise; Wood, James L.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the pandemic on neurofibromatosis (NF) care and research. METHODS: Sixty-three United States NF clinics were surveyed to identify the impact of the pandemic on clinician role, patient volume, continuity of guideline-driven surveillance, research protocols, and use of (and satisfaction with) telehealth for the delivery of NF care. RESULTS: Fifty-two clinic directors or their representatives completed the survey (83% response rate). About 2/3 of the clinics reported a greater than 50% decrease in the number of available patient appointments, and modified clinical surveillance and research protocols. Fifty-one clinics (98%) newly instituted telehealth during the pandemic. Barriers to telehealth prior to the pandemic were insurance reimbursement concerns and lack of infrastructure. Since telehealth was initiated, high provider satisfaction was reported with ease of use. The most common area of concern was related to inability to perform a physical examination. CONCLUSION: Results show marked impacts on NF care and research since the beginning of the pandemic, with potential long-term changes related to the introduction (or adoption) of telehealth for clinical care.","Radtke, Heather B.; Klein-Tasman, Bonita P.; Merker, Vanessa L.; Knight, Pamela; Ullrich, Nicole J.; Jordan, Justin T.; Korf, Bruce; Plotkin, Scott R.",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33522938/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01711-w,44
604437,Hendra virus infection in a veterinarian,2006-11-20,"Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that affects the quality of life (QoL) of HD gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) and their partners. Although HD expertise centers have been emerging across Europe, there are still some important barriers to care provision for those affected by this rare disease, including transportation costs, geographic distance of centers, and availability/accessibility of these services in general. eHealth seems promising in overcoming these barriers, yet research on eHealth in HD is limited and fails to use telehealth services specifically designed to fit the perspectives and expectations of HDGECs and their families. In the European HD-eHelp study, we aim to capture the needs and wishes of HDGECs, partners of HDGECs, and health care providers (HCPs) in order to develop a multinational eHealth platform targeting QoL of both HDGECs and partners at home. Methods: We will employ a participatory user-centered design (UCD) approach, which focusses on an in-depth understanding of the end-users' needs and their contexts. Premanifest and manifest adult HDGECs (n = 76), partners of HDGECs (n = 76), and HCPs (n = 76) will be involved as end-users in all three phases of the research and design process: (1) Exploration and mapping of the end-users' needs, experiences and wishes; (2) Development of concepts in collaboration with end-users to ensure desirability; (3) Detailing of final prototype with quick review rounds by end-users to create a positive user-experience. This study will be conducted in the Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, and Ireland to develop and test a multilingual platform that is suitable in different healthcare systems and cultural contexts. Discussion: Following the principles of UCD, an innovative European eHealth platform will be developed that addresses the needs and wishes of HDGECs, partners and HCPs. This allows for high-quality, tailored care to be moved partially into the participants' home, thereby circumventing some barriers in current HD care provision. By actively involving end-users in all design decisions, the platform will be tailored to the end-users' unique requirements, which can be considered pivotal in eHealth services for a disease as complex and rare as HD.","van Lonkhuizen, Pearl J.

605097,"Influence of Colostrum and Vitamins A, D(3), and E on Early Intestinal Colonization of Neonatal Holstein Calves Infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis",2019-11-20,"The detection of viruses in water and other environmental samples constitutes special challenges. The standard method of detection of viral pathogens in environmental samples uses assays in mammalian cell culture. The infected cell cultures undergo observable morphological changes called cytopathogenic effects (CPEs) that are used for the detection of viruses. Even though many viruses are culturable in several cell lines and are thus detectable by the development of CPEs in cell culture, there are several viruses, like enteric waterborne adenoviruses types 40 and 41, which are difficult to culture and do not produce clear and consistent CPE. Other viruses, like waterborne caliciviruses, have not yet been successfully grown in cell cultures. Conventional cell culture assays for the detection of viruses in environmental samples have limited sensitivity and can be labor-intensive and timeconsuming. Two advances, the PCR and microarrays, have spurred the study of viruses and should be further applied to the field of environmental virology. The ability of both DNA viruses and RNA viruses to rapidly evolve means new and emerging viral pathogens will need to be addressed. Pathogen discovery and characterization, occurrence in the environment, exposure pathways, and health outcomes via environmental exposure need to be addressed. This will likely follow a new microbial risk framework that will require focused research on some important properties of viral disease transmission. The future will require models that examine community risks and provide explicit links between the models currently under development for environmental exposure and infectious disease.","Wong, Mark; Xagoraraki, Irene; Rose, Joan B.",Perspect Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287593/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17013-0; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170130; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170130,44
605521,Report of fatal mixed infection with Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis in neonatal calves,2017-01-01,"Coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging contagious infectious disease. It is pandemic and has affected more than 21 million people and resulted in more than 750,000 deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries; 14/08/20). Our research group initiated a study to ascertain the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of Jordanians toward COVID-19 prior to any initial case report in Jordan. This project was underway when the first Jordanian case was reported. We extended our study to identify how case reporting would alter public KAP towards COVID-19. This cross-sectional study randomly selected and recruited 2104 Jordanian adults. A four-section questionnaire was devised to address the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects and their KAP toward COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for the study population was 15.9 ± 2.2 (out of the 20 knowledge questions), with 60.9% of the participants having good knowledge about COVID-19. Participants’ practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19 were adequate in more than 60% of participants. Most participants had positive attitudes regarding their role in preventing COVID-19 and many of the participants’ attitudes and practices changed to more appropriate ones after reporting the first case of COVID-19 in Jordan. The percentage of participants who trust the government in confronting COVID-19 increased significantly (p value < 0.001). However, one alarming and unexpected finding was that the prevention practice score of participants working in the medical field was similar to those from the general population. This may necessitate stricter training and guidelines for this group who will be in the frontline in combating the disease. Impact of this study: The data generated from this study shows that when cases of disease were reported, the public’s attitudes and practices improved in many aspects, and that confidence in the government to contain the disease was boosted. We believe that this study is important in allowing other, international governments to develop an understanding of public KAP during pandemic disease outbreaks.","Elayeh, Eman; Aleidi, Shereen M.; Ya’acoub, Rawan; Haddadin, Randa N.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057382/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240780,44

Across all counties (n=2940), counties with more farmworkers, more residents living in poverty, higher density, and more residents over the age of 65 had significantly higher levels of mortality. In urban counties (n=114), only county density was significantly associated with mortality. In non-urban counties (n=2826), counties with more non-English speaking households and more farm workers had significantly higher levels of mortality, as did counties with higher levels of poverty and more residents over the age of 65. More uninsured residents was significantly associated with decreased reported COVID-19 mortality. Individuals who do not speak English, individuals engaged in farm work, and individuals living in poverty may be at heightened risk for COVID-19 mortality in non-urban counties.

Physicians were prioritized for early vaccination since they are at higher risk for contagion of the infection and they might affect the general populations’ uptake of the vaccine. This study aimed to examine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and the underpinnings of reluctance to uptake the vaccine among working physicians in Egypt. A cross-sectional study was conducted for 3 months, recruiting 1268 physicians using a snowballing random sampling technique. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was deployed to collect related data. Of participants, 24% expressed their acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, 39% would wait for further review, while 36.7% did not agree to get vaccinated. Findings revealed that 22% of them were vaccinated and the significant determinants of unacceptability included age, gender, higher educational attainments, prior infection, lack of direct patients’ contact, and working in rural health facilities (p < 0.05). The most common reasons beyond their reluctance were fear of the vaccines’ adverse effects and the short duration of its clinical trials (60% and 49.5%). Physicians had a low intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines particularly between females, senior staff, and those who had a low self-perceived risk for the infection. Integrated approaches should be designed to address concerns and factors associated with vaccine unacceptability to reduce vaccination reluctance between physicians, hence the general population.","Shehata, Walaa M.; Elshora, Ahmed A.; Abu-Elenin, Mira M.",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636006/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16574-8,44

We investigated whether IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection. We conducted quantification of infectious virus or viral RNA, immunofluorescent (IF) staining for the detection of PDCoV antigens, and TUNEL assay in IPEC-J2 cells inoculated with the strain OH-FD22-P8 grown in LLC-PK cells, and supplemented with 10 μg/ml of trypsin in the cell culture medium. Cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified by the 3rd viral passage in the IPEC-J2 cells. PDCoV antigen was detected in the cells showing CPE. By double IF and TUNEL staining, most PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals, indicating that PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not undergo apoptosis, but rather necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes in vivo. There was increased interleukin-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants at post-inoculation hour (PIH) 48–96, as evaluated by ELISA, concurrent with increased titers of PDCoV at PIH 24–72. The susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection supports their usefulness to characterize the interactions of enterocytes with PDCoV. We also demonstrated that IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) was enteropathogenic in 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs, and induced systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during the acute PDCoV infection.","Jung, Kwonil; Miyazaki, Ayako; Hu, Hui; Saif, Linda J.",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.05.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351830422X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351830422X,44

During the COVID‐19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns, access to early childhood education and care (ECEC) was disrupted. We investigate how this period affected the developmental advantages typically offered by ECEC. Using parent‐report data from 189 families living in the UK, we explore associations between time spent in ECEC by 8‐to‐36‐month‐olds, their socioeconomic background, and their growth in language and executive functions between Spring and Winter 2020.

Previous susceptible-infected models are extended to allow for a latent period between initial exposure to the pathogen and the patient becoming themselves infectious, and the possibility of decolonization. We allow for multiple facilities, such as acute care hospitals or long-term care facilities and nursing homes, and for multiple units or wards within a facility. Patient transfers between units and facilities are tracked and accounted for in the models so that direct importation of a colonized individual from one facility or unit to another might be inferred. We allow for constant transmission rates, rates that depend on the number of colonized individuals in a unit or facility, or rates that depend on the proportion of colonized individuals. Statistical analysis is done in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to obtain a sample of parameter values from their joint posterior distribution. Cross validation, deviance information criterion and widely applicable information criterion approaches to model choice fit very naturally into this framework and we have implemented all three. We illustrate our methods by considering model selection issues and parameter estimation for data on methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surveillance tests over 1 year at a Veterans Administration hospital comprising seven wards.","Thomas, Alun; Khader, Karim; Redd, Andrew; Leecaster, Molly; Zhang, Yue; Jones, Makoto; Greene, Tom; Samore, Matthew",Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA,https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqx010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040678/; https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article-pdf/35/Supplement_1/i29/25802099/dqx010.pdf,44

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using database that included: demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, medications and clinical outcomes of all patients hospitalized in Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between March 12, 2020 and December 1(st) 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 infected patients. RESULTS: In total,1,002 patients with COVID-19 infection with mean age of the cohort was 54 ± 16 years (65% (n = 650) male) were included, with an overall and intensive care unit (ICU) mortalities of 26% (n = 257) and 42% (n = 199/473), respectively. The prevalence of ICU admission was 47% (n = 473) and the need for mechanical ventilation was 41% (n = 413). The overall length of stay in the ICU was 13 (9 - 21) days. Adjusting for other factors in the model, the multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that in-hospital mortality in admitted COVID-19 patients was associated with old age (p < 0.001), heart diseases (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-3.03; p = 0.018), liver diseases (aOR, 4.48; 95% CI: 1.04-19.3; p = 0.044), those with higher ferritin levels (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.00; p = 0.006), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR, 3.20; 95% CI: 1.65-6.18; p = 0.001), sepsis (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI: 1.12-2.80; p = 0.022), and those that had ICU admission (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.12-4.38; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high and was associated with advanced age, heart diseases, liver disease, high ferritin, ARDS, sepsis and ICU admission.

As of 13 December, 2020, over 70,000,000 cases and 1,500,000 deaths have been reported over a period of several months; however, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been elucidated. To identify the novel risk genetic biomarker for COVID-19, we evaluated the correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the genetic polymorphisms of several potential COVID-19-related genes, including interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), interleukin 6 (IL6), leucine zipper transcription factor-like protein 1 (LZTFL1), and the ABO genes, in various ethnic groups. We obtained the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard and calculated the case fatality rate of each ethnic group. In addition, we obtained the allele distribution of the polymorphisms of the IFITM3, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL6, LZTFL1, and ABO genes from the 1000 Genomes Project and performed Log-linear regression analysis using SAS version 9.4. We found different COVID-19 case fatality rates in each ethnic group. Notably, we identified a strong correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the allele frequency of the rs6598045 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IFITM3 gene.

611793,A Mini-Review on the Epidemiology of Canine Parvovirus in China,2020-02-20,"BACKGROUND: To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of visual field fast (VFF), a free iPad-based noise-field perimeter, in detecting glaucomatous scotomas versus the clinical-standard Humphrey visual field (HVF) test. VFF confronts subjects with a screen of flickering stimulus, allowing the immediate perception of scotomas. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study of 66 glaucoma patients (66 eyes) and 30 healthy controls (30 eyes). All patients had no other visual field disorders. VFF was compared against HVF in terms of whole field and quadrants for the following: (1) correspondence in scotoma detection. (2) Agreement and correlation of the scotoma size (percentage of abnormal visual field area). (3) Test duration. Other domains tested included: (1) correlation of VFF scotoma area with the severity of visual field loss on HVF (mean deviation, MD; visual field index, VFI). (2) Repeatability of VFF. (3) Patient descriptors of scotomas. RESULTS: Using HVF pattern deviation plot as a reference, VFF detected 52/57 (91.2%) of glaucoma subjects with 1 false-positive (control) (kappa = 0.86). 146/184 (79.3%) of abnormal quadrants (visual field defect present) were localized and 23/157 (14.6%) healthy quadrants were falsely identified as abnormal (kappa = 0.61). VFF underestimated scotoma area as compared to HVF (21.0% versus 44.0%, p < 0.01) but correlated positively (r = 0.268, p = 0.044) with HVF area and negatively with VFI (r = −0.340, p = 0.01) and MD (r = −0.398, p < 0.01). Using HVF total deviation plot as reference, VFF’s glaucoma detection rate remained unchanged (kappa = 0.86) with similar quadrant detection (kappa = 0.68). However, a greater underestimation of scotoma area was observed (21.0% versus 85.4%, p < 0.01). VFF’s quantitative repeatability was excellent for whole field (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC: 0.96; p < 0.0001) and quadrants (ICC: 0.82–0.96; all p < 0.001). Qualitatively, 35/37 (94.6%) of subjects reported reduced luminance and flicker in scotomas, with similar morphologies on retests. VFF is faster than HVF SITA-Standard in glaucoma (3.60 ± 1.85 min versus 6.92 ± 1.12 min, p < 0.01) and control (1.12 ± 0.486 min versus 5.16 ± 0.727 min, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This early model of VFF accurately detected scotomas with high repeatability. However, its accuracy in localizing and quantifying the scotoma can be improved. Considering its portability and cost-effectiveness, VFF demonstrated potential as a general screening tool for moderate-to-severe glaucoma.","Ding, Jianbin; Tecson, Ivan C.; Ang, Bryan C.

Efforts to prevent transmission of the virus among humans remains a high priority. The current efforts to quarantine involve social distancing, monitoring and tracking the infected patients. However, the spread of the virus is too rapid to be contained only by manual and inefficient human contact tracing activities. To address this challenge, we have developed Connect, a blockchain empowered digital contact tracing platform that can leverage information on positive cases and notify people in their immediate proximity which would thereby reduce the rate at which the infection could spread. This would particularly be effective if sufficient people use the platform and benefit from the targeted recommendations. The recommendations would be made in a privacy-preserving fashion and contain the spread of the virus without the need for an extended period of potential lockdown. Connect is an identity wallet platform which will keep user digital identities and user activity trace data on a blockchain platform using Self-Sovereign Identity(SSI) proofs. User activities include the places he/she has travelled, the country of origin he/she came from, travel and dispatch updates from the airport etc. With these activity trace records, Connect platform can easily identify suspected patients who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus and take precautions before spreading it. By storing digital identities and activity trace records on blockchain-based SSI platform, Connect addresses the common issues in centralized cloud-based storage platforms (e.g. lack of data immutability, lack of traceability).","Bandara, Eranga; Liang, Xueping; Foytik, Peter; Shetty, Sachin; Hall, Crissie; Bowden, Daniel; Ranasinghe, Nalin; De Zoysa, Kasun",Inf Process Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102572; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645732100073X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727760/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030645732100073X,44

Design Cross-sectional study Setting Sub-acute unit of a Rehabilitation Institute. Participants 184 patients with COVID-19 (aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to a sub-acute unit to stabilize their condition and recover from acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 Interventions Not applicable Main Outcome Measure At admission patients underwent the SPPB test, represented by the sum of three functional tests: standing balance, 4-meter gait speed (4-MGS), and five-repetition sit-to-stand (5-STS) motion. Comparisons between two SPPB score groups were performed by an unpaired t-test; multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to detect predictors of the SPPB score considering several clinical parameters. Results Participants were 74±12 years old, 52% were male and with more than two comorbidities in 43% of cases. SPPB score was 3.02±3.87 denoting patients’ profound physical dysfunction. Normal physical function was detected in only 12% of patients, whereas low, intermediate and severe impairment was found in 65%, 13% and 10% respectively. Age, both invasive and non-invasive ventilation use, and the presence of previous disability were significant predictors of SPPB. Patients without any comorbidities (8%) also exhibited low function (SPPB: 5.67±1.12). Conclusions The majority of survivors after COVID-19 experienced ARF due to pneumonia and exhibited substantial physical dysfunction influenced by age, mechanical ventilation need and previous disability.

Now vaccinology faces more complex problems, such as waning antibody, immunosenescence, evasion of immunity by the pathogen, deviation of immunity by the microbiome, induction of inhibitory responses, and complexity of the antigens required for protection. Fortunately, vaccine development is now incorporating knowledge from immunology, structural biology, systems biology and synthetic chemistry to meet these challenges.

617915,Evaluation of eluents for the recovery of an enveloped virus from hands by whole-hand sampling,2015-03-19,"On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the spread of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, as a pandemic on the basis of “alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.” Hence, it is urgent and imperative to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 for as many global locations as possible. This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes.","Nakamura, Hiroki; Managi, Shunsuke",Transp Policy (Oxf),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X20303516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834679/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.06.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X20303516,44

The most common symptoms were fever (128, 63.1%), body ache (124, 61.8%), headache (113, 55.7%), dry cough (123, 60.6%), sore throat (97, 47.8%), body weakness (97, 47.8%), and fatigue (94, 46.3%). Comparing males and females, there was a significantly higher number of female nurses; in contrast, there was a higher number of male physicians, housekeepers, therapists/technicians, and other specialty HCWs. A significantly lower number of nurses, therapists/technicians were infected in the ≥40 years age group compared to <40 years. Furthermore, a significantly higher difference was observed among non-Saudi nurses compared to Saudi nurses. No mortality was documented among the included HCWs. Conclusions: In the largest tertiary cardiac center in KSA, most HCWs who contracted COVID-19 developed mild symptoms; nurses and those aged <40 years were most commonly infected, and most infections were acquired in the community. HCWs’ adherence to mitigation measures outside of the workplace is vital to curb the current pandemic and decrease nosocomial transmission risk.","Barry, Mazin; Robert, Asirvatham Alwin; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Abdul Bari, Syed; Akhtar, Muhammad Yasin; Al Nahdi, Faizah; Erlandez, Richilda; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Al Khushail, Abdullah; Al Hebaishi, Yahya",Med Sci (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/medsci9030049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209161/,44

In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence.

They lack toxicity on the human tumoral cell line HeLa, with an almost negligible cell uptake. The dodecapeptide showed a substantial microbicidal activity on Leishmania parasites at 50 µM but with a modest intracellular accumulation. Their previously published γ,γ-homologues, with a cyclobutane γ-amino acid, showed a well-defined secondary structure with an average inter-guanidinium distance of 8–10 Å, a higher leishmanicidal activity as well as a significant intracellular accumulation. The presence of a very rigid cyclobutane β-amino acid in the peptide backbone precludes the acquisition of a defined conformation suitable for their cell uptake ability.

622089,Why do RNA viruses recombine?,2011-07-04,"Background:A hypercoagulable state has been consistently reported in patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterized by elevated D-dimer, prolonged PT, and mild thrombocytopenia, though the mechanism is unclear. We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes depletion of the anticoagulant protein S and virus-mediated platelet activation. Based on early reports, we hypothesized that a similar process contributed to COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Aim:To probe platelet activation and coagulation factor activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods:Blood was collected from consenting patients with differing COVID-19 severity: outpatients (15), hospitalized inpatients (15), and healthy controls (8). Platelet-leukocyte aggregate (PLA) formation and monocyte profiling were measured by flow cytometry. Coagulation factors were assessed by enzymatic assays. PS, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), PC, cytokines, and anti-S-Protein (viral spike protein) IgG were measured by ELISAs. Results:Ninety percent of SARS-CoV-2+ out-patients and in-patients had circulating anti-S-Protein IgG, but plasma IL-6 and TNFα were only elevated in three in-patients, consistent with reports that systemic inflammation is relatively rare in this population. Immune response did not correlate with disease severity. Unlike in HIV1+/AIDS patients, total PS was not reduced in SARS-CoV-2+ patients. However, the anticoagulant pool of PS (“free PS”) was reduced in plasma samples from in-patients compared to controls (47.2%±23.3% vs. 100.8±42.6%, p=0057), while out-patients had an intermediate concentration (73.1%±28.9%). Specific loss of free PS is likely mediated by an increase in C4-binding protein (C4bp), which binds PS. In-patients also had a trend toward elevated plasma tissue factor (TF) compared to controls (79.5±121.4 fM vs. 37.8±39.7 fM, p = 0.32). Endothelial cells and monocytes can express TF under inflammatory conditions. We evaluated endothelial damage and dysfunction by measuring E-Selectin, which was unchanged in either in-patients or out-patients, and von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which was elevated in in-patients compared to controls (143±29.8 ng/mL vs. 56.2±41.9 ng/mL, p=0.0023). Plasma from in-patients also had elevated myeloperoxidase (524±187 ng/mL vs. 127±35 ng/mL, p=0.0026) and had a trend toward increased platelet-leukocyte aggregates (14.6±11.7% vs. 5.2±3.7%, p=0.24), indicating platelet and leukocyte stimulation. Unlike in the HIV1+/AIDS patients, no virus was detectable in any of the SARS-CoV-2+ patient plasmas. Consistent with a lack of direct platelet-virus interaction, plasma PF4 and platelet Akt phosphorylation were unchanged in the patient samples. We also observed a trend toward increased TF on TF+/CD64+/CD11b+ monocytes from in-patients compared to controls (MFI = 3244±2340 vs. 1741±382, p=0.18). Two inpatients were followed until they were SARS-CoV-2-negative. In both, PLAs, IL-6, vWF, and plasma TF remained elevated out to 28 days and PS remained reduced, suggesting that hemostatic dysregulation persists after SARS-CoV-2 is undetectable. Conclusions:We propose that localized inflammation in SARS-CoV-2+ patients results in a decrease in anticoagulant PS, through a shift of the free and C4bp-bound forms. At the same time, this inflammation causes stimulation of endothelial cells, which secrete procoagulant vWF, monocytes, which express TF and release it into plasma on microvesicles, and platelets, which form platelet-leukocyte aggregates. These changes may not return to baseline post-infection, suggesting that long-term monitoring of thrombotic risk may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2+ patients.

Results from a between-subject randomized survey experiment suggest that partisans are motivated to process factual information about COVID-19 through a partisan lens. However, priming parental identity can reduce partisan polarization over risk perceptions, policy support, and precautious behaviors. These findings demonstrate the need to incorporate relational identity into identity-based science communication research and offer a relational identity-based strategic communication solution to partisan gaps in responses to COVID-19.","Zeng, Chen",Sci Commun,https://doi.org/10.1177/10755470211036676,44
623539,Evolution of the Chinese guarantee network under financial crisis and stimulus program,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone and remdesivir have the potential to reduce COVID-related mortality or recovery time, but their cost-effectiveness in countries with limited intensive care resources is unknown. METHODS: We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. RESULTS: Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 408 [uncertainty range: 229-1891] deaths averted (assuming no efficacy [uncertainty range: 0-70%] of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $15 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of dexamethasone, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to non-ventilated and ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 689 [uncertainty range: 330-1118] deaths, resulting in $231 per death averted, relative to standard care. CONCLUSIONS: The use of remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care by reducing ICU days. Further efforts to improve recovery time with remdesivir and dexamethasone in ICU could save lives and costs in South Africa.","Jo, Youngji; Jamieson, Lise; Edoka, Ijeoma; Long, Lawrence; Silal, Sheetal; Pulliam, Juliet R C; Moultrie, Harry; Sanne, Ian; Meyer-Rath, Gesine; Nichols, Brooke E",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732750/,44

624458,New tools for the study and direct surveillance of viral pathogens in water,2008-05-26,"The pathological cascade of tissue damage in mild traumatic brain injury is set forth by a perturbation in ionic homeostasis. However, whether this class of injury can be detected in vivo and serve as a surrogate marker of clinical outcome is unknown. We employ sodium MRI to test the hypotheses that regional and global total sodium concentrations: (i) are higher in patients than in controls and (ii) correlate with clinical presentation and neuropsychological function. Given the novelty of sodium imaging in traumatic brain injury, effect sizes from (i), and correlation types and strength from (ii), were compared to those obtained using standard diffusion imaging metrics. Twenty-seven patients (20 female, age 35.9 ± 12.2 years) within 2 months after injury and 19 controls were scanned with proton and sodium MRI at 3 Tesla. Total sodium concentration, fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient were obtained with voxel averaging across 12 grey and white matter regions. Linear regression was used to obtain global grey and white matter total sodium concentrations. Patient outcome was assessed with global functioning, symptom profiles and neuropsychological function assessments. In the regional analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between patients and controls in apparent diffusion coefficient, while differences in sodium concentration and fractional anisotropy were found only in single regions. However, for each of the 12 regions, sodium concentration effect sizes were uni-directional, due to lower mean sodium concentration in patients compared to controls. Consequently, linear regression analysis found statistically significant lower global grey and white matter sodium concentrations in patients compared to controls. The strongest correlation with outcome was between global grey matter sodium concentration and the composite z-score from the neuropsychological testing. In conclusion, both sodium concentration and diffusion showed poor utility in differentiating patients from controls, and weak correlations with clinical presentation, when using a region-based approach. In contrast, sodium linear regression, capitalizing on partial volume correction and high sensitivity to global changes, revealed high effect sizes and associations with patient outcome. This suggests that well-recognized sodium imbalances in traumatic brain injury are (i) detectable non-invasively; (ii) non-focal; (iii) occur even when the antecedent injury is clinically mild. Finally, in contrast to our principle hypothesis, patients’ sodium concentrations were lower than controls, indicating that the biological effect of traumatic brain injury on the sodium homeostasis may differ from that in other neurological disorders.

PURPOSE: To summarize chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the early stage of COVID-19 infection and provide a piece of reliable imaging evidence for initial screening and diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, reticular pattern, and ground-glass mimic nodules in each patient’s chest CT image were recorded. RESULTS: We enrolled 14 patients, of which nine patients had the infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Five patients were highly suspected of infection. All cases had epidemiological evidence. GGO was a dominant imaging manifestation in the initial days of infection. GGO performance accounts for 40% in 1– 2 days, 90% in 3– 6 days, and 85% in 7– 10 days. With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT. Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1– 2 days, 40% in 3– 6 days, and 71% in 7– 10 days. The lesions are mostly near the pleura. The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed.

632607,Lipid-based delivery systems and intestinal lymphatic drug transport: A mechanistic update(),2008-03-17,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by a novel evolutionarily divergent RNA virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently spreaded around the world. Genomic analyses revealed that this zoonotic virus may be evolved naturally but not a purposefully manipulated laboratory construct. However, currently available data are not sufficient to precisely conclude the origin of this fearsome virus. Comprehensive annotations of the whole-genomes revealed hundreds of nucleotides, and amino acids mutations, substitutions and/or deletions at different positions of the ever changing SARS-CoV-2 genome. The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides. It leads to the predicted acquisition of 3-O-linked glycan around the cleavage site. Although real-time RT-PCR methods targeting specific gene(s) have widely been used to diagnose the COVID-19 patients, however, recently developed more convenient, cheap, rapid, and specific diagnostic tools targeting antigens or CRISPR-Cas-mediated method or a newly developed plug and play method should be available for the resource-poor developing countries. A large number of candidate drugs, vaccines and therapies have shown great promise in early trials, however, these candidates of preventive or therapeutic agents have to pass a long path of trials before being released for the practical application against COVID-19.

The emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in limitations of treatment resources. Furthermore, in recognition of the need to also reduce the exposure of patients and staff to potential infection with COVID-19, the ILROG task force has made recommendations for alternative radiation treatment schemes. The emphasis is on maintaining clinical efficacy and safety by increasing the dose per fraction while reducing the number of daily treatments. The guidance is informed by adhering to acceptable radiobiological parameters and clinical tolerability. The options for delaying or omitting RT in some hematological categories are also discussed.","Yahalom, Joachim; Dabaja, Bouthaina Shbib; Ricardi, Umberto; Ng, Andrea; Mikhaeel, N.

634126,The future in an RNA molecule: from mRNA vaccines to therapeutics - An interview with Drew Weissman,2021,"Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis represent three distinct types of regulated cell death forms, which play significant roles in response to viral and bacterial infections. Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host. This chapter discusses the current advances in the research of cell death signaling with regard to viral and bacterial infections and describes the network of the cell death initiating molecular mechanisms that selectively recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns.","Imre, Gergely",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644819301273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381176/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644819301273,44

Patients and methods The QoL of 68 RA patients was assessed using Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS-SF36) scale across the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components scores. The disease activity score (DAS28) was considered. Patients accepting to participate and having a mean of communication via social network, in particular WhatsApp were included. Results The mean age of the patients was 49.9±12.1 years (11-83 years) and were 65 females and 3 males. The mean DAS-28 at the start of the restriction measures was 3.4±1.5, the mean PCS and MCS were 71.1±20.3 and 67.1±16.02 respectively and became 4.7±2.04, 38.1±4.96 and 36.8±3.8 respectively. After 2 months, none of the RA patients presented with classic symptoms of COVID-19 infection. 8 patients were screened by Rapid Diagnostic Test and Reverse Transcription‐Polymerase Chain Reaction. Only 1 case was positive but asymptomatic. All patients had altered QoL according to MOS-SF36. Factors associated with this deterioration were stress related to SARS-CoV2 isolation (p=0.001), stress of having an activity flare-up (p=0.001), fear of being stigmatized (p=0.009). The economic factors were signficantly associated with temporary unemployment, decrease in monthly income, and drug discontinuation (p=0.001, p=0.002 and p=0.046 respectively). Conclusion The impact of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic is negative on the QoL of RA patients and many factors were contributing.","Zomalheto, Zavier; Assogba, Calixte; Dossou-yovo, Hilaire",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1110116420300818; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110116420300818?v=s5,44
634722,The promise and challenge of high-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire,2014-01-19,"PURPOSE: To assess clinician satisfaction with structured (SR) and conventional (CR) radiological reports for chest CT exams in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, objectively comparing both reporting strategies. METHOD: We retrospectively included 68 CTs (61 patients) with COVID-19. CRs were collected from the digital database while corresponding SRs were written by an expert radiologist, including a sign checklist, severity score index and final impressions. New CRs were prepared for a random subset (n = 10) of cases, to allow comparisons in reporting time and word count. CRs were analyzed to record severity score and final impressions inclusion. A random subset of 40 paired CRs and SRs was evaluated by two clinicians to assess, using a Likert scale, readability, comprehensiveness, comprehensibility, conciseness, clinical impact, and overall quality. RESULTS: Overall, 19/68 (28 %) and 9/68 (13 %) of CRs included final impressions and severity score, respectively. SR writing required significantly (p < 0.001) less time (mean = 308 s; SD ± 60 s) compared to CRs (mean = 458 s; SD ± 72 s). On the other hand, word count was not significantly different (p = 0.059, median = 100 and 106, range = 106–139 and 88–131 for SRs and CRs, respectively). Both clinicians expressed significantly (all p < 0.01) higher scores for SRs compared to CRs in all categories. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the use of chest CT SRs in COVID-19 patients to improve referring physician satisfaction, optimizing reporting time and provide a greater amount and quality of information within the report.","Stanzione, Arnaldo; Ponsiglione, Andrea; Cuocolo, Renato; Rumolo, Mariateresa; Santarsiere, Marika; Scotto, Riccardo; Viceconte, Giulio; Imbriaco, Massimo; Maurea, Simone; Camera, Luigi; Gentile, Ivan; Brunetti, Arturo",Eur J Radiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X21001017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677417/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109621; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X21001017?v=s5,44

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data retrospectively of 180 cases of COVID-19, from 15 January 2020 to 31 March 2020, from both the Wuhan Zhongnan and Beijing Ditan Hospitals, including 103 cases of mild and 77 cases of severe pneumonia. All patients had their first chest computed tomography scan within five days of symptom onset. The dandelion sign was defined by a focal ground glass opacity (GGO) with a central thickening of the airway wall, and the focal crazy paving sign was defined by a focal GGO with thickening of the interlobular septa. RESULTS: Consolidation presented in only 4.9% (5/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, which was significantly lower than that in severe pneumonia cases (70.1% 54/77), p < .001). Multifocal distribution and pure GGOs were observed more frequently in severe cases of pneumonia (p < .05). The dandelion sign was present in 86.4% (89/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, significantly more frequent than those with severe pneumonia (13.0% [10/77], p < .001). The focal crazy paving sign presented in 65.0% (67/103) of the mild pneumonia cases and was significantly more frequent than in severe cases (23.4% [18/77], p < .001). The hospital stay duration of the mild pneumonia group (13.6 ± 7.2 days) was significantly shorter than the severe pneumonia group (26.6 ± 11.7 days, p < .001) CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation, pure GGO and multifocal distribution on a CT scan were associated with severe COVID-19.

Although individuals with certain autoimmune/inflammatory disorders show increased susceptibility to viral infections, there is incomplete knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in these diseases.(3–7) We report that the autoimmune PTPN2 risk variant rs1893217 promotes expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and increases cellular entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Elevated ACE2 expression and viral entry were mediated by increased JAK-STAT signalling, and were reversed by the JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib.

637267,"Microbial enzymes catalyzing keratin degradation: Classification, structure, function",2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In April 2020, Massachusetts nursing homes (NHs) became a hotspot for COVID‐19 infections and associated deaths. In response, Governor Charles Baker allocated $130 million in additional funding for 2 months contingent on compliance with a new set of care criteria including mandatory testing of all residents and staff, and a 28‐point infection control checklist. We aimed to describe the Massachusetts effort and associated outcomes. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: A total of 360 Massachusetts NHs. PARTICIPANTS: The Massachusetts Senior Care Association and Hebrew SeniorLife rapidly organized a Central Command team, targeted 123 “special focus” facilities with infection control deficiencies for on‐site and virtual consultations, and offered all 360 facilities weekly webinars and answers to questions regarding infection control procedures. The facilities were also informed of resources for the acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPE), backup staff, and SARS‐CoV‐2 testing. MEASUREMENTS: We used two data sources: (1) four state audits of all NHs, and (2) weekly NH reports to the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis. Primary independent process measures were the checklist scores and adherence to each of its six core competencies. Primary outcomes were the average weekly rates of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in residents and staff. We used a hurdle mixed effects model adjusted for county COVID‐19 prevalence to estimate relationships between infection control process measures and rates of new infections or deaths. RESULTS: Both resident and staff infection rates started higher in special focus facilities, then rapidly declined to the same low level in both groups. Adherence to infection control processes, especially proper wearing of PPE and cohorting, was significantly associated with declines in weekly infection and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: This statewide effort could serve as a national model for other states to prevent the devastating effects of pandemics such as COVID‐19 in frail NH residents.","Lipsitz, Lewis A.; Lujan, Alida M.; Dufour, Alyssa; Abrahams, Gary; Magliozzi, Helen; Herndon, Laurie; Dar, Mohammad",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930389/,44

Given this objective, the specific curve that requires flattening is that of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. In this context, we evaluated the rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization in British Columbia (BC) and Ontario to see if either province shows evidence of flattening the relevant curve. From late March to mid-June 2020, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalization in BC has indeed shown evidence of flattening, whereas that in Ontario has increased linearly. The cumulative hospitalization rate in Ontario first surpassed that of BC on April 14. By June 18, the respective hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were 27.86 for Ontario and 9.96 for BC. In both provinces, the cumulative hospitalization rate has remained lower than that of comparator US states.

641147,A future for transgenic livestock,2003,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) has been the most effective and widely implemented diagnostic technology since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, fuzzy rRT-PCR readouts with high Ct values are frequently encountered, resulting in uncertainty in diagnosis. METHODS: A Specific Enhancer for PCR-amplified Nucleic Acid (SENA) was developed based on the Cas12a trans-cleavage activity, which is specifically triggered by the rRT-PCR amplicons of the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab (O) and N fragments. SENA was first characterized to determine its sensitivity and specificity, using a systematic titration experiment with pure SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, and was then verified in several hospitals, employing a couple of commercial rRT-PCR kits and testing various clinical specimens under different scenarios. FINDINGS: The ratio (10 min/5 min) of fluorescence change (FC) with mixed SENA reaction (mix-FCratio) was defined for quantitative analysis of target O and N genes, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) of mix-FCratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.2≤1.6≤2.1. Totally, 295 clinical specimens were analyzed, among which 21 uncertain rRT-PCR cases as well as 4 false negative and 2 false positive samples were characterized by SENA and further verified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The cut-off values for mix-FCratio were determined as 1.145 for positive and 1.068 for negative. INTERPRETATION: SENA increases both the sensitivity and the specificity of rRT-PCR, solving the uncertainty problem in COVID-19 diagnosis and thus providing a simple and low-cost companion diagnosis for combating the pandemic.

RESULTS: Before the screening campaign, the rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 23.3% among the residents and 12.1% among their home employees. Within a 72 h screening period, all employees not known to have the virus were screened by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Among the 241 screened employees, 32 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 carriers and non-carriers did not differ in term of gender, age or type of staff. Staff carrying SARS-CoV-2 were strictly asymptomatic in 75% of cases while during the days following or before the test, 25% presented mild symptoms of COVID-19. Considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, 66 out of 281 (23.5%) of the home employees had been carriers for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Screening for viral carriage of asymptomatic staff in nursing homes can avoid contact and transmission to frequently severely vulnerable residents.","Bayle, Catherine; Cantin, Delphine; Vidal, Jean-Sebastien; Sourdeau, Elise; Slama, Laurence; Dumesges, Nicolas; Trombert, Sabine; Ayllon, Sonia; Nguyen, Jean-Marie; Slama, Dorsaf; Medaghecha, Mohamed; Hanon, Olivier; Salmon, Dominique",Infect Dis Now,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521774/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991920000184; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2020.11.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991920000184,44
641694,"From National Biosecurity Measures to Territorial ASF Preparedness: The Case of Free-Range Pig Farming in Corsica, France",2021-07-28,"OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) how a rapid data collection using a convenience sample fares in estimating change in alcohol consumption when compared to more conventional data sources, and (2) how alcohol consumption changed in Finland and Norway during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three different types of data sources were used for the 2nd quarter of 2020 and 2019: sales statistics combined with data on unrecorded consumption; the rapid European Alcohol Use and COVID-19 (ESAC) survey (Finland: n = 3800, Norway: n = 17,092); and conventional population surveys (Finland: n = 2345, Norway: n1 = 1328, n2 = 2189, n3 = 25,708). Survey measures of change were retrospective self-reports. RESULTS: The statistics indicate that alcohol consumption decreased in Finland by 9%, while little change was observed in Norway. In all surveys, reporting a decrease in alcohol use was more common than reporting an increase (ratios 2-2.6 in Finland, 1.3-2 in Norway). Compared to conventional surveys, in the ESAC survey fewer respondents reported no change and past-year alcohol consumption was higher. CONCLUSION: The rapid survey using convenience sampling gave similar results on change in drinking as conventional surveys but higher past-year drinking, suggesting self-selection effects. Aspects of the pandemic driving alcohol consumption down were equally strong or stronger than those driving it up.","Mäkelä, Pia; Rossow, Ingeborg; Moan, Inger Synnøve; Bye, Elin K; Kilian, Carolin; Raitasalo, Kirsimarja; Allebeck, Peter",Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449127/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1892,44

The purpose of this study was to report real‐life safety data of the BNT162b2 COVID‐19 vaccine in a cohort of MS patients. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to 425 MS patients. Participants were asked general demographic and disease‐related questions and specific questions regarding the safety profile of the COVID‐19 vaccine. RESULTS: Of the 425 MS patients, 262 completed the questionnaire. The median (range) participant age was 42 (22–79) years, 199 participants were women (75.9%), and 66 participants (25.2%) had associated comorbidities. A total of 198 participants (75.6%) were treated with disease‐modifying therapies. In all, 239 participants (91.2% of the responders) had received the BNT162b2 COVID‐19 vaccine. Of these, 182 (76.1%) were aged <55 years, and 57 (23.9%) were aged >55 years. Adverse events were reported by 136 participants (56.9%; 52.5% of those aged <55 years and 40.3% of those aged >55 years; p = 0.1517) and 36 participants (15.1%) reported new or worsening neurological symptoms following the vaccination, the most frequent being sensory disturbances (21 participants, 58.3%). Most symptoms occurred within the first 24 h after vaccination and resolved within 3 days. A total of 28 participants (77.8%) did not require any medication to treat their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates an overall favorable safety profile of the BNT162b2 vaccine in people with MS. These data should be confirmed in further prospective, large‐scale studies.","Lotan, Itay; Wilf‐Yarkoni, Adi; Friedman, Yitzhak; Stiebel‐Kalish, Hadas; Steiner, Israel; Hellmann, Mark A.",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288285/,44

METHODS: Cross-sectional study within a large prospective, multicenter cohort of (ex-)breast cancer patients, i.e., UMBRELLA. All participants enrolled in the UMBRELLA cohort between October 2013 and April 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1051 (66.0%) participants completed the survey. During COVID-19, 284 (27.0%) participants reported clinically relevant increased levels of anxiety and/or depression, i.e., total HADS score ≥ 12. Participants with anxiety and/or depression reported statistically significant higher barriers to contact their general practitioner (47.5% vs. 25.0%, resp.) and breast cancer physicians (26.8% vs. 11.2%, resp.) compared to participants without these symptoms. In addition, a higher proportion of participants with anxiety and/or depression reported that their current treatment or (after)care was affected by COVID-19 compared to those without these symptoms (32.7% vs. 20.5%, resp.). Factors independently associated with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19 were pre-existent anxiety (OR 6.1, 95% CI 4.1–9.2) or depression (OR 6.0, 95% CI 3.5–10.2). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, (ex-)breast cancer patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression experience higher barriers to contact health care providers. Also, they more often report that their health care was affected by COVID-19. Risk factors for anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19 are pre-existent symptoms of anxiety or depression.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database linked to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. RESULTS: Among 10,237 patients (mean [SD] age, 45.0 [19.8] years; 60.1% female) who met the eligibility criteria for the study, 6,350 (62.0%) patients were asymptomatic, and 3,887(38.0%) patients were symptomatic. The mean and median age was similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Notably, we observed a U-shaped association between age group and the proportion of asymptomatic patients, with the nadir at 57.3% in the 40-49 age group. This U-shaped distribution was largely similar between men and women. The overall prevalence of asymptomatic individuals was higher, regardless of sex, residential area, income levels, and comorbid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In this national cohort of over 10,000 patients with COVID-19, more than 60% of all cases in South Korea reported no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

Unlike the automatic fare collection data that only records passenger’s entries and exits, the Wi-Fi probe data can capture more detailed passenger movements, such as riding a train or waiting on a platform. However, the estimation of spatio-temporal trajectories remains as a challenging task because a few unfavorable situations could result into deficient data. To address this problem, we first describe the Wi-Fi probe data and summarize their common defects. Then, the n-gram method is developed to infer missing spatio-temporal location information. Next, an estimation algorithm is designed to generate feasible spatio-temporal trajectories for each individual passenger by integrating multiple data sources, i.e., urban rail transit network topology, Wi-Fi probe data, train schedules, etc. This proposed method is tested on both simulated data in blind experiments and real-world data from a complex urban rail transit network. The results of case study show that 93% of passengers’ unique physical routes can be estimated. Then, for 80% of passengers, the number of feasible spatio-temporal trajectories can be reduced to one or two. Potential applications of the trajectory estimation approach are also identified.","Gu, Jinjing; Jiang, Zhibin; Sun, Yanshuo; Zhou, Min; Liao, Shenmeihui; Chen, Jingjing",Knowl Based Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100594/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705120306572; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705120306572?v=s5,44

PURPOSE: To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system in differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia on chest CT and assess radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. METHODS: 521 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from ten hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia on chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by two-layer fully-connected neural network to pool slices together. Our final cohort of 1,186 patients (132,583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance on separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. RESULTS: Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% CI: 90-98%), sensitivity 95% (95% CI: 83-100%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88-99%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC of 0.95 and Precision-Recall (PR) AUC of 0.90. On independent testing, our model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82-90%), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81-94%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80-90%) with ROC AUC of 0.90 and PR AUC of 0.87. Assisted by the models’ probabilities, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs. 85%, Δ=5, p<0.001), sensitivity (88% vs. 79%, Δ=9, p<0.001) and specificity (91% vs. 88%, Δ=3, p=0.001).

Here, we study cross-reactivity using a highly multiplexed peptide assay (PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of IgG reactivity across all human CoVs in both COVID-19 convalescent and negative donors. PepSeq resolves epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins that are commonly targeted in convalescent donors, including several sites also recognized in some uninfected controls. By comparing patterns of homologous reactivity between CoVs and using targeted antibody-depletion experiments, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies that cross-recognize pandemic and endemic CoV antigens at two Spike S2 subunit epitopes. We further show that these cross-reactive antibodies preferentially bind endemic homologs. Our findings highlight sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 response appears to be shaped by previous CoV exposures and which have the potential to raise broadly neutralizing responses.","Ladner, Jason T.; Henson, Sierra N.; Boyle, Annalee S.; Engelbrektson, Anna L.; Fink, Zane W.; Rahee, Fatima; D’ambrozio, Jonathan; Schaecher, Kurt E.; Stone, Mars; Dong, Wenjuan; Dadwal, Sanjeet; Yu, Jianhua; Caligiuri, Michael A.; Cieplak, Piotr; Bjørås, Magnar; Fenstad, Mona H.; Nordbø, Svein A.; Kainov, Denis E.; Muranaka, Norihito; Chee, Mark S.; Shiryaev, Sergey A.; Altin, John A.",Cell Rep Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666379120302445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495758/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100189; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120302445,44

To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, three plasmids (pRNAT-1, pRNAT-2, and pRNAT-3) expressing short hairpin RNAs were designed to target three different coding regions of the M gene of TGEV. The plasmids were constructed and transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cells, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited TGEV production. The analysis of cytopathic effects demonstrated that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 could protect PK-15 cells against pathological changes specifically and efficiently. Additionally, indirect immunofluorescence and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) assays showed that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 inhibited the multiplication of the virus at the protein level effectively. Quantitative real-time PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the three plasmids were reduced by 13, 68, and 70%, respectively.

Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50–69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected.

649141,Chapter 25 Arteriviridae and Roniviridae,2011-12-31,"Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level. For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.","Segal, Eran; Zhang, Feng; Lin, Xihong; King, Gary; Shalem, Ophir; Shilo, Smadar; Allen, William E.; Grad, Yonatan H.; Greene, Casey S.; Alquaddoomi, Faisal; Anders, Simon; Balicer, Ran; Bauman, Tal; Bonilla, Ximena; Booman, Gisel; Chan, Andrew T.; Ori Cohen, Ori; Coletti, Silvano; Davidson, Natalie; Dor, Yuval; Drew, David A.; Elemento, Olivier; Evans, Georgina; Ewels, Phil; Gale, Joshua; Gavrieli, Amir; Geiger, Benjamin; Hajirasouliha, Iman; Jerala, Roman; Kahles, Andre; Kallioniemi, Olli; Keshet, Ayya; Landua, Gregory; Meir, Tomer; Muller, Aline; Nguyen, Long H.; Oresic, Matej; Ovchinnikova, Svetlana; Peterson, Hedi; Rajagopal, Jay; Ratsch, Gunnar; Rossman, Hagai; Rung, Johan; Sboner, Andrea; Sigaras, Alexandros; Spector, Tim; Steinherz, Ron; Stevens, Irene; Vilo, Jaak; Wilmes, Paul",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051284,44

COVID-19 continues to spread globally, with case fatality and test positivity rates often linked to locally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, mutations in this virus, in particular those occurring in the spike protein (involved in the virus binding to the host epithelial cells) have potential implications in current vaccination efforts. In Rwanda, more than twenty thousand cases have been confirmed as of March 14th 2021, with a case fatality rate of 1.4% and test positivity rate of 2.3% while the recovery rate is at 91.9%. Rwanda started its genomic surveillance efforts, taking advantage of pre-existing research projects and partnerships, to ensure early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and to potentially contain the spread of variants of concern (VOC). As a result of this initiative, we here present 203 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences analyzed from strains circulating in the country from May 2020 to February 2021. In particular, we report a shift in variant distribution towards the newly emerging sub-lineage A.23.1 that is currently dominating. Furthermore, we report the detection of the first Rwandan cases of the VOCs, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, among incoming travelers tested at Kigali International Airport. We also discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 control measures established in the country to control the spread of the virus. To assess the importance of viral introductions from neighboring countries and local transmission, we exploit available individual travel history metadata to inform spatio-temporal phylogeographic inference, enabling us to take into account infections from unsampled locations during the time frame of interest. We uncover an important role of neighboring countries in seeding introductions into Rwanda, including those from which no genomic sequences are currently available or that no longer report positive cases. Our results point to the importance of systematically screening all incoming travelers, regardless of the origin of their travels as well as regional considerations for durable response to COVID-19.","Butera, Y.; Mukantwari, E.; Artesi, M.; Umuringa, J.

651850,Differential expression of sialic acid on porcine organs during the maturation process,2000-08-07,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) represent key immune effectors of the host response against chronic viruses, due to their cytotoxic response to virus-infected cells. In response to this selection pressure, viruses may accumulate escape mutations that evade CTL-mediated control. To study the emergence of CTL escape mutations, we employed the murine chronic infection model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We developed an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing pipeline to detect low frequency mutations in the viral genome and identified non-synonymous mutations in the immunodominant LCMV CTL epitope, GP33-41, in infected wildtype mice. Infected Rag2-deficient mice lacking CTLs did not contain such viral mutations. By using transgenic mice with T cell receptors specific to GP33-41, we characterized the emergence of viral mutations in this epitope under varying selection pressure. We investigated the two most abundant viral mutations by employing reverse genetically engineered viral mutants encoding the respective mutations. These experiments provided evidence that these mutations prevent activation and expansion of epitope-specific CD8 T cells. Our findings on the mutational dynamics of CTL escape mutations in a widely-studied viral infection model contributes to our understanding of how chronic viruses interact with their host and evade the immune response. This may guide the development of future treatments and vaccines against chronic infections.","Smyth, Mark; Khamina, Kseniya; Popa, Alexandra; Gudipati, Venugopal; Agerer, Benedikt; Lercher, Alexander; Kosack, Lindsay; Endler, Lukas; Baazim, Hatoon; Viczenczova, Csilla; Huppa, Johannes B.; Bergthaler, Andreas",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194424/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.638485,44
652051,Designing spatial and temporal control of vaccine responses,2021-09-28,"The urgent need for novel and effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has stimulated research worldwide. The Papain-like protease (PLpro), which is essential for viral replication, shares a similar active site structural architecture to other cysteine proteases. Here, we have used representatives of the Ovarian Tumor Domain deubiquitinase family OTUB1 and OTUB2 along with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 to validate and rationalize the binding of inhibitors from previous SARS-CoV candidate compounds. By forming a new chemical bond with the cysteine residue of the catalytic triad, covalent inhibitors irreversibly suppress the protein’s activity. Modeling covalent inhibitor binding requires detailed knowledge about the compounds’ reactivities and binding. Molecular Dynamics refinement simulations of top poses reveal detailed ligand-protein interactions and show their stability over time. The recently discovered selective OTUB2 covalent inhibitors were used to establish and validate the computational protocol. Structural parameters and ligand dynamics are in excellent agreement with the ligand-bound OTUB2 crystal structures. For SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, recent covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors were simulated and reveal that the ligand-protein interaction is very dynamic. The covalent and non-covalent docking plus subsequent MD refinement of known SARS-CoV inhibitors into DUBs and the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro point out a possible approach to target the PLpro cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2. The results show that such an approach gives insight into ligand-protein interactions, their dynamic character, and indicates a path for selective ligand design.","Sivakumar, Dakshinamurthy; Stein, Matthias",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11060802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071582/,44

We sought to determine serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in pediatric IBD patients. Design: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of all pediatric ([≤]21 years old) IBD patients in whom a SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody Assay was performed between April 2020 and May 2021 at our tertiary care center. This assay measures IgG antibody to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and was routinely collected at infusion and outpatient clinic visits. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, and the secondary outcome was titer level, with high titer defined as [≥]960 titer or >40 AU/mL. Clinical characteristics, including demographics, IBD location, behavior, activity, and therapy, SARS-CoV-2 exposures, COVID-19 testing and symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection status (WHO COVID-19: Case Definitions, 2020) and COVID-19 vaccination status and type, were gathered, and univariate analyses examined associations between clinical characteristics and outcome measures. Results: There were 340 pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing; 15% for confirmed or probable COVID-19, 2% for suspected COVID-19, 16% for asymptomatic exposure to a close contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 61% without any prior symptoms or exposures, and 6% for history of COVID-19 vaccination. Patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 infection had a 90% rate of seroconversion, with 76% of these patients on biologic therapy. Patients post-infection without seroconversion had a significantly longer interval between infection and antibody assay (P=0.03). Within those with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 43% had seroconversion, and there were no identified clinical characteristics associated with positive titer. All pediatric patients who received vaccination seroconverted, and all who received mRNA vaccinations, including one after a single dose, achieved high titer levels; 100% of those who received vaccination were on biologic or small molecule therapy, including one on combination therapy with ustekinumab and tofacitinib. Conclusion: Pediatric IBD patients have strong serologic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination despite high rates of immunomodulatory therapy.","Spencer, E.

The mechanism behind this observation remains unclear. We performed next generation sequencing from RNA extracted from blood samples of 8 male subjects collected before, during and after a 12-month stay at the Antarctic station Concordia. RNA-seq data analysis was done using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Data revealed the inactivation of key immune functions such as chemotaxis and leukocyte recruitment which persisted after return. Next to the activation of the stress response eIF2 pathway, interferon signaling was predicted inactivated due to a downregulation of 14 downstream genes involved in antiviral immunity. Among them, the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFITM2 and 3 as well as IFIT3 exhibited the strongest fold changes and IFIT3 remained downregulated even after return. Impairment of antiviral immunity in winter-over crew can be explained by the downregulation of a battery of ISGs.","Buchheim, Judith-Irina; Billaud, Jean-Noël; Feuerecker, Matthias; Strewe, Claudia; Dangoisse, Carole; Osterman, Andreas; Mehta, Satish; Crucian, Brian; Schelling, Gustav; Choukér, Alexander",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589891/,44

This review aims to highlight the disparities and impact on a group particularly vulnerable to disparities, women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. RECENT FINDINGS: Women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds remain underrepresented in major cardiovascular trials, limiting the generalizability of cardiovascular research to this population. Certain cardiovascular risk factors are more prevalent in women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, including traditional risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Female-specific risk factors including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia as well as non-traditional psychosocial risk factors like depressive and anxiety disorders, increased child care, and familial and home care responsibility have been shown to increase risk for cardiovascular disease events in women more so than in men, and disproportionately affect women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Despite this, minimal interventions to address differential risk have been proposed. Furthermore, disparities in treatment and outcomes that disadvantage minority women persist. The limited improvement in outcomes over time, especially among non-Hispanic Black women, is an area that requires further research and active interventions. SUMMARY: Understanding the lack of representation in cardiovascular trials, differential cardiovascular risk, and disparities in treatment and outcomes among women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds highlights opportunities for improving cardiovascular care among this particularly vulnerable population.","Balla, Sujana; Gomez, Sofia Elena; Rodriguez, Fatima",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-020-00869-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223802/,44

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs. Method: We use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the MosMedData, which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs. Results: PointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. Conclusion: The PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources. Key Points: Our approach to GGO analysis has four distinguishing features: 1. We combine an unsupervised computer vision approach with convex hull and convex points algorithms to segment and preserve the actual structure of the lung. 2. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to use PointNet++ architecture for 3D visualization, segmentation, classification, and pattern analysis of GGOs. 3. We make abnormality predictions using a deep network and Cox proportional hazards model using lung CT images of COVID-19 patients. 4. We quantify the shapes and sizes of GGOs using Minkowski tensors to understand the morphological variations of GGOs within the COVID-19 cohort.","Kalia, R. K.; Sharma, A.; Amin, S.

Traditionally, wider floras were reported to be used, such as Morus alba, Artemisia indica, Azadirachta indica, Calotropis gigantea, but only some of the potent compounds from some of the plants have been scientifically validated. Plant-derived natural products such as colchicine, zingerone, forsythiaside A, mangiferin, glycyrrhizin, curcumin, and many other compounds are found to have a promising effect on treating and managing respiratory inflammation. In this review, current clinically approved drugs along with the efficacy and side effects have been studied. The study also focuses on the traditional uses of medicinal plants on reducing respiratory complications and their bioactive phytoconstituents. The pharmacological evidence of lowering respiratory complications by plant-derived natural products has been critically studied with detailed mechanism and action.

Matériel et méthode : Un échantillon de 347 participants, âgés de 18 à 78 ans a répondu à un questionnaire diffusé sur Internet lors des dix derniers jours du confinement en France. L’échantillon se découpe en 227 métropolitains (M = 38,24 ; DS = 13,41 ; 13,2% d’hommes) et 120 Ultramarins réunionnais (M = 37,26 ; DS = 12,81 ; 31,7% d’hommes). Résultats: Les métropolitains, plus exposés, respectaient davantage le confinement et se sentaient plus à risque. Des scores élevés non significatifs de résilience et de qualité de vie contrastent dans l’échantillon réunionnais qui estimait par ailleurs la gravité ou la crainte similairement. Chez les métropolitains, le stress était expliqué par des variables liées à la COVID-19 (crainte, gravité, respect des mesures), la solitude et négativement par la résilience et la qualité de vie. Dans l’échantillon réunionnais, le stress était expliqué par la crainte et négativement par la résilience. Conclusions: Cette étude apporte des nouvelles données sur l’impact psychologique important de la pandémie du COVID-19 dans deux échantillons français ayant des caractéristiques différentes. Davantage de travaux pourraient mettre en avant les facteurs de protection de ces populations. Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic raised a lot of anxiety around the world. France is composed of several overseas territories with major cultural differences but also with a different exposure to the COVID-19. Reunion Island is the most populated overseas French department, but few researches have focused on this population. Therefore, the main objective was to explore and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (perceived stress, risk and fear of being infected, severity, lockdown respect, perceived stress, quality of life, quality of relationship, loneliness, resilience) during the lockdown among residents of metropolitan France and of Reunion Island. Material and methods: A sample of 347 participants, aged from 18 to 78 (M = 37.90; DS = 13.20) replied to a questionnaire posted online during the last ten days of the lockdown in France. The sample is divided into 227 metropolitans (M = 38.24 DS = 13.41; 13.2% of men) and 120 residents of Reunion Island (M = 37.26; DS = 12.81; 31.7% of men). Resilience, loneliness and perceived stress have been assessed using validating scales while specific items have been created to assess COVID-19 impacts. Results: The majority of the total sample has been little exposed to the COVID-19, but the estimated severity was high throughout the sample. Several significant differences have been observed between overseas and metropolitans. The latter, who were more exposed, were more respectful of lockdown measures and felt more concerned about being contaminated. They also had different professional activities (work at home, stop working) since the lockdown than did the overseas sample. Non-significant higher scores of resilience and quality of life during the lockdown contrast in the overseas sample, who estimated risk, fear and severity similarly. In correlational analyses, many relationships were significant only in one sample. For example, in metropolitans the higher the loneliness, the higher the severity. In the other sample, the higher the perceived stress, the higher the respect of lockdown measures, while more metropolitans felt lonely the more they respected these measures. Regressional analysis showed different predictive variables of the scores of perceived stress and fear of being contaminated. In metropolitans, stress was explained by COVID-19 related variables (fear, severity, respect), loneliness and negatively by resilience and quality of life while in the other sample it was explained by fear of being infected and negatively by resilience. Fear of being infected was explained by risk and stress in the overseas, but also by quality of life in the metropolitan sample. Conclusions: This study brings new data on the important psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on two French samples. Observed differences highlight a higher fear of being infected among the metropolitans who were generally more exposed. Overseas from La Réunion did not feel more spared by this risk, despite the limited number of cases since the appearance of the first case in March 11th and the end of the lockdown in May 11th. Despite exposure, our results could be explained by several cultural differences such as way of life or beliefs. Overseas life in Reunion Island might bring more resilience and less loneliness given the particular familial, social and religious functioning. Given the limits of this study and the lack of similar comparisons, more work could highlight the protective factors of these populations.","Laconi, Stéphanie; Ramaye, Dominique; Kalaitzaki, Argyroula",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001370062100018X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001370062100018X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541714/,44

In 2004, CDC’s Global Disease Detection (GDD) program within the Division of Global Health Protection in Kenya (DGHP-Kenya) initiated close collaboration with Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and developed a laboratory partnership called the Diagnostic and Laboratory Systems Program (DLSP). DLSP built onto previous efforts by malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) programs and supported the expansion of the diagnostic expertise and capacity in KEMRI and the Ministry of Health. First, DLSP developed laboratory capacity for surveillance of diarrheal, respiratory, zoonotic and febrile illnesses to understand the etiology burden of these common illnesses and support evidenced-based decisions on vaccine introductions and recommendations in Kenya. Second, we have evaluated and implemented new diagnostic technologies such as TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) to detect emerging or reemerging pathogens and have recently added a next generation sequencer (NGS). Third, DLSP provided rapid laboratory diagnostic support for outbreak investigation to Kenya and regional countries. Fourth, DLSP has been assisting the Kenya National Public Health laboratory-National Influenza Center and microbiology reference laboratory to obtain World Health Organization (WHO) certification and ISO15189 accreditation respectively. Fifth, we have supported biosafety and biosecurity curriculum development to help Kenyan laboratories safely and appropriately manage infectious pathogens. These achievements, highlight how in collaboration with existing CDC programs working on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the Global Health Security Agenda can have significantly improve public health in Kenya and the region.

Herein, we report the dynamics of antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and virus neutralization activity in 44 COVID-19 patients. RBD-specific IgG responses were detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. Using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibody titers were also detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. The magnitude of RBD-specific IgG binding titers correlated strongly with viral neutralization. In a clinical setting, the initial analysis of the dynamics of RBD-specific IgG titers was corroborated in a larger cohort of PCR-confirmed patients (n=231).

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and prospective survey study. SETTING: Intensive care units, large academic tertiary-care centre (USA). PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n=148) with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were eligible for inclusion. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Delirium was the primary outcome, assessed via validated chart review method. Secondary outcomes included measures related to delirium, such as delirium duration, antipsychotic use, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, inflammatory markers and final disposition. Neuroimaging data were also collected. Finally, a telephone survey was conducted between 1 and 2 months after discharge to determine neuropsychological function via the following tests: Family Confusion Assessment Method, Short Blessed Test, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognitive Abilities 4a and Patient-Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 108/148 (73%) patients, with median (IQR) duration lasting 10 (4–17) days. In the delirium cohort, 50% (54/108) of patients were African American and delirious patients were more likely to be female (76/108, 70%) (absolute standardised differences >0.30). Sedation regimens, inflammation, delirium prevention protocol deviations and hypoxic-ischaemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/108, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalisation, 4/17 (24%) later screened positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within 2 months after discharge. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist after discharge.","Ragheb, Jacqueline; McKinney, Amy; Zierau, Mackenzie; Brooks, Joseph; Hill-Caruthers, Maria; Iskander, Mina; Ahmed, Yusuf; Lobo, Remy; Mentz, Graciela; Vlisides, Phillip E",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535480/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050045,44

However, approaches to identify small molecules that target these newly discovered biological regulatory elements have been lacking. The application of new biochemical screening and design-based technologies, coupled with a resurgence of interest in phenotypic screening, has resulted in several compelling successes in targeting RNA. A number of recent advances suggest that achieving the longstanding goal of developing druglike, biologically active small molecules that target RNA is in fact possible. This review highlights advances and successes in approaches to targeting RNA with diverse small molecules, and the potential for these technologies to pave the way to new types of RNA-targeted therapeutics.","Connelly, Colleen M.; Moon, Michelle H.; Schneekloth, John S.",Cell Chemical Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451945616302525; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5064864?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945616302525; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2016.05.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593111/,44

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) for the first 18 secondary patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Bahia Blanca (Argentina). We ranked the fiability of the data depending upon certainty about the identification of the infector and the date of exposition to infector. The sample has some missing values. In the case of incubation, as 3 patients were infected by other household members, we only have 15 observations with an observed date of exposition. For the estimation of serial interval, one patient became ill from close contact with an asymptomatic infectious. Also, estimations of both the incubation period and the serial interval were carried using the full sample and a subsample with higher certainty about the transmissor and date of exposition. By the time the dataset was prepared all infectors were recovered so estimations do need to take into account right censoring. Results: The mean incubation period for symptomatic patients is 7.9 days (95% CI: 4.6, 11.1) considering the sample of 15 cases patients and 7.5 days (95% CI: 4.1, 10.9) if the sample is restricted to the most certain cases (n=12). The median is 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1, 9.2) and 5.8 (95% CI: 3.6, 9.3) respectively. Moreover, 97.5% of symptomatic cases will develop symptoms after 13.6 days from exposition (95% CI 10.7, 16.5). The point estimation for the mean serial interval is 6.8 days (95% CI: 4.0-9.6). Considering only the most certain pairs, the mean serial interval is estimated at 5.5 days (95% CI: 2.8, 8.1). The estimated median serial intervals were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.0, 8.1) and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.9) days respectively. Conclusions: Evidence from Bahia Blanca (Argentina) suggests that the median and mean serial interval of Covid-19 is shorter than the incubation period. This suggests that a pre-symptomatic transmission is not negligible. Comparisons with foreign estimates show that incubation period and serial interval could be longer in Bahia Blanca city than in other regions. That poses a signal of opportunity to attain more timely contact tracing and effective isolation.","Viego, V.; Geri, M.; Castiglia, J.; Jouglard, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134825; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.18.20134825v1?rss=1,44

662769,"Insights From Deep Sequencing of the HBV Genome—Unique, Tiny, and Misunderstood",2019-01-11,"BACKGROUND: During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an urgent need for accelerated review of COVID-19 research by Medical Research Ethics Committees (MRECs). In the Netherlands this led to the implementation of so-called ‘fast-track-review-procedures’ (FTRPs) to enable a swift start of urgent and relevant research. The objective of this study is to evaluate FTRPs of MRECs in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare them with the regular review procedures (RRPs). METHODS AND FINDINGS: An explanatory sequential mixed method study was conducted. Online questionnaires and four group interviews were conducted among MREC representatives and investigators of COVID-19 research. In addition, data from a national research registration system was requested. Main outcome measures are differences in timelines, quality of the review and satisfaction between FTRPs and RRPs. The total number of review days was shorter in FTRP (median 10.5) compared to RRPs (median 98.0). Review days attributable to the MRECs also declined in FTRPs (median 8.0 versus 50.0). This shortening can be explained by installing ad hoc (sub)committees, full priority given to COVID-19 research, regular research put on hold, online review meetings and administrative leniency. The shorter timelines did not affect the perceived quality of the review and ethical and legal aspects were not weighted differently. Both MREC representatives and investigators were generally satisfied with the review of COVID-19 research. Weaknesses identified were the lack of overview of COVID-19 research and central collaboration and coordination, the delay of review of regular research, and limited reachability of secretariats. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that accelerated review is feasible during emergency situations. We did not find evidence that review quality was compromised and both investigators and MRECs were content with the FTRP. To improve future medical ethical review during pandemic situations and beyond, distinguishing main and side issues, working digitally, and (inter)national collaboration and coordination are important.","IJkema, R.; Janssens, M.

We aimed to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of NOAF in a cohort of critically ill patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of COVID‐19. NOAF was defined as atrial fibrillation that was detected after diagnosis of COVID‐19 without a prior history. The primary outcome of the study was the effect of NOAF on mortality in critically ill COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: NOAF incidence was 14.9% (n = 37), and 78% of patients (n = 29) were men in NOAF positive group. Median age of the NOAF group was 79.0 (interquartile range, 71.5‐84.0).

666661,An effective docking strategy for virtual screening based on multi-objective optimization algorithm,2009-02-11,"STAT2 is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in antiviral immunity by mediating the activity of type I and III interferons (IFN-I and IFN-III). It also has a recently established function in the negative regulation of IFN-I signaling. Homozygous STAT2 deficiency is an ultra-rare inborn error of immunity which provides unique insight into the pathologic consequence of STAT2 dysfunction. We report here a novel genetic cause of homozygous STAT2 deficiency with several notable clinical features. The proband presented aged 12 months with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) closely followed by clinical varicella, both occurring within three weeks of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccinations. There was a history of life-threatening influenza A virus (IAV) disease 2 months previously. Genetic investigation uncovered homozygosity for a novel nonsense variant in STAT2 (c. 1999C>T, p. Arg667Ter) that abrogated STAT2 protein expression. Compatible with STAT2 deficiency, dermal fibroblasts from the child demonstrated a defect of interferon-stimulated gene expression and a failure to mount an antiviral state in response to treatment with IFN-I, a phenotype that was rescued by lentiviral complementation by wild type STAT2. This case significantly expands the phenotypic spectrum of STAT2 deficiency. The occurrence of life-threatening influenza, which has not previously been reported in this condition, adds STAT2 to the list of monogenetic causes of this phenotype and underscores the critical importance of IFN-I and IFN-III to influenza immunity. The development of probable vaccine-strain varicella is also a novel occurrence in STAT2 deficiency, implying a role for IFN-I/III immunity in control of attenuated varicella zoster virus in vivo and reinforcing the susceptibility to pathologic effects of live-attenuated viral vaccines in disorders of IFN-I immunity. Finally, the occurrence of HLH in this case reinforces emerging links to hyperinflammation in patients with STAT2 deficiency and other related defects of IFN-I signaling—highlighting an important avenue for further scientific enquiry.","Freij, Bishara J.; Hanrath, Aidan T.; Chen, Rui; Hambleton, Sophie; Duncan, Christopher J.

They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins.

To help inform mental health service planning in the pandemic recovery phase, we systematically determined the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in survivors of COVID-19. Methods: For this pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID CRD42021239750) we searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO to 20th February 2021, plus our own curated database. We included peer-reviewed studies reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms at post-acute or later time-points after COVID-19 infection, and in control groups where available. For each study a minimum of two authors extracted summary data. For each symptom we calculated a primary pooled prevalence using generalised linear mixed models. Heterogeneity was measured with I2. Subgroup analyses were conducted for COVID-19 hospitalisation, severity, and duration of follow-up. Results: From 2,844 unique titles we included 51 studies (n=18,917 patients). The mean duration of follow-up after COVID-19 was 77 days (range 14-182 days). Study quality was generally moderate. The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptom was sleep disturbance (pooled prevalence=27.4% [95%CI 21.4-34.4%]), followed by fatigue (24.4% [17.5-32.9%]), objective cognitive impairment (20.2% [10.3-35.7%]), anxiety (19.1%[13.3-26.8%]), and post-traumatic stress (15.7% [9.9-24.1%]). Only two studies reported symptoms in control groups, both reporting higher frequencies in Covid-19 survivors versus controls. Between-study heterogeneity was high (I2=79.6%-98.6%). There was little or no evidence of differential symptom prevalence based on hospitalisation status, severity, or follow-up duration. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and persistent after recovery from COVID-19. The literature on longer-term consequences is still maturing, but indicates a particularly high frequency of insomnia, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and anxiety disorders in the first six months after infection.","Badenoch, J.

It begins by documenting the industrial job losses over the last 50 years and their impact on unemployment, economic inactivity and welfare benefit claims, highlighting the diversion onto incapacity benefits triggered by job loss that remains a major feature of the towns. It then looks at the evidence on the present-day labor market in the towns, identifying job growth at a slower pace than in the cities and continuing weaknesses in terms of earnings, qualifications and occupational mix. These are the on-going problems the authors describe as the ‘long shadow of job loss’. The evidence also shows that despite years of job loss, industry remains a key component of the towns' economy and that the towns are increasingly connected to surrounding areas, including nearby cities, by strong commuting flows.","Beatty, Christina; Fothergill, Steve",Front Sociol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2020.00054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869461/,44

Stringent mechanisms are activated that regulate external injury, infection, and autoimmunity. The eye contains a variety of cells expressing vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs), and their receptors, located in the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process, and the retina. VNs are important activators of adenylate cyclase, deriving cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Impairment of VN function would arguably impede cAMP production and impede utilization of ATP. Thus VN autoimmunity may be an etiological factor in retinopathy involving perturbations of purinergic signaling. A sound blood supply is necessary for the existence and functional properties of the retina. This paper postulates that impairments in the endothelial barriers and the blood–retinal barrier, as well as certain inflammatory responses, may arise from disruption to VN function.

Early studies on bnAbs showed safety in humans, but short elimination half-lives and low potency and breadth. Since 2010, several new highly potent bnAbs have been assessed in clinical trials alone or in combination for HIV prevention. Published data indicate that these bnAbs are safe and have a half-life ranging from 15 to 71 days. Only intravenous VRC01 has advanced to an efficacy trial, with results expected in late 2020. If bnAbs are shown to be effective in preventing HIV infection, they could fast-track vaccine development as correlates of protection, and contribute as passive immunization to achieving the goal of epidemic control. The purpose of the current review is to describe the current status and provide a synopsis of the available data on bnAbs in clinical trials for HIV prevention.","Mahomed, Sharana; Garrett, Nigel; Baxter, Cheryl; Abdool Karim, Quarraisha; Abdool Karim, Salim S",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604408/,44
673542,Invasion thresholds and the evolution of nonequilibrium virulence,2008-01-09,"BACKGROUND. The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. METHODS. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. FINDINGS. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). INTERPRETATION. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

In early 2020, Corona Virus Disease 2019 broke out in Wuhan, China. From January 29, 2020, several sources of the air pollution almost all stopped working, including gasoline burning vehicles, dust producing building sites, coal-fired factories, etc. Five indicators of the atmospheric environmental quality were observed from December 19, 2019 to April 30, 2020 in nine cities and 1-h average concentrations, 24-h average concentrations and Air Quality Index were assessed. The 1-h average concentrations of the nitrogen dioxide, the ozone and the sulfur dioxide showed obvious difference though the closure did not change the sequence of the five pollutants’ concentrations in the air at diverse sampling moments. The changing of the 24-h average concentrations of the five pollutants indicated the amount of pollutants in the air were greatly affected by human activities. The nitrogen dioxide, the sulfur dioxide and the particulate matters decreased obviously in the closure. The air in the metropolis and the south-east cities were relatively clean and the pollutants’ concentrations decreased slightly during the closure period. The northern and the heavy industrial cities showed significant drop on air pollution indicators and the air quality of the two city groups could be greatly improved if some effective measures could be taken of environmental management and regional development.","Yao, H.; Lu, W.; Niu, G.; Zhang, Q.; Jiang, Q.; Liu, H.; Ni, T.",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03311-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868434/,44
675262,A serological survey of selected pathogens in wild boar (Sus scrofa) in northern Turkey,2013-06-18,"BACKGROUND: The role of type I IFNs in protecting against coronavirus (CoV) infections is not fully understood. While CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFNs in tissue culture, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type I IFN response in controlling MHV infection in animals. The protective effectors against MHV infection are, however, still unknown. RESULTS: In order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced in the brains of MHV-infected mice, we performed whole-genome expression profiling. Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed (≥ 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to infection, with IFN-γ as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/- 129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the additional type I IFN-dependent genes that we discovered may also be important for protection against MHV infection. CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of mice infected with MHV demonstrated the induction of a robust IFN response, which correlated with the viral load. Profiling of IFNAR-/- mice allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent and -dependent responses. Overall, this study broadens our present knowledge of the type I and II IFN-mediated effector responses during CoV infection in vivo.","Raaben, Matthijs; Groot Koerkamp, Marian JA; Rottier, Peter JM; de Haan, Cornelis AM",BMC Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19650917/,44
675438,Adapting educational experiences for the chemists of tomorrow,2021-02-17,"Abstract Background: Acute lower respiratory infections are major causes of hospitalization in children and are mainly caused by respiratory viruses. In the present study, we investigated the etiologic agents responsible for acute lower respiratory infections from the period November 1986 to October 1992 in order to determine the seasonal pattern and different characteristics of age distribution of respiratory infectious agents, mainly virus infections. Methods: A total of 1521 patients with lower respiratory infections was hospitalized in Saiseikai Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained for virus isolation and paired sera in the acute and convalescent phases were obtained for serological examination. Results: Etiological agents were identified in 668 of 1521 patients (43.9%) by serological antibody responses, virus isolation and/or detection of virus antigen: 240 (15.8%) with respiratory syncytial (RS) virus; 62 (4.1%) with influenza virus type A; 26 (1.7%) with influenza virus type B; 86 (5.7%) with adenovirus; 81 (5.3%) with parainfluenza virus; 32 (2.1%) with measles virus; 20 (1.3%) with enteroviruses or Herpes virus other than respiratory viruses; 75 (4.9%) with Mycoplasma pneumoniae; 10 (0.7%) with pertussis; and 36 (2.4%) with mixed infections. In the remaining 853 patients (56.1%), etiologic agents were not identified. Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was a main causative agent of respiratory infections in patients younger than 3 years of age. Influenza virus and M. pneumoniae were two main causative agents in patients with acute respiratory illness over 5 years of age. Parainfluenza virus type 3 was frequently observed in infants from 9 to 12 months of age. A distinct seasonal pattern of viral infections was consistently observed in each year during the study period; RS and influenza viruses were prevalent in winter, parainfluenza virus was prevalent in spring and M. pneumoniae was prevalent in summer and autumn. However, adenovirus infections were observed in all seasons. Serological responses were poor in patients younger than 1 year of age and they were mainly diagnosed by virus isolation or detection of virus antigen. Conclusions: Virological epidemiology provides useful information in daily clinical practice for the prediction of etiological agents based on patient age and the seasonal distribution of agents. We should examine virus isolation and the detection of virus antigen, along with serological examinations in patients with respiratory infections, especially in infants younger than 1 year of age because of poor serological responses.","Sonoda, SATOMI; Gotoh, YOSHINARI; Bann, FUMIHIKO; Nakayama, TETSUO",Pediatr Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10530065/,44
676500,"Flavivirus reverse genetic systems, construction techniques and applications: A historical perspective",2015-02-28,"Rapid SARS-COV-2 related serology testing can help identify and manage the spread of infection in decentralized testing environments but the limitation in performance of existing tests in blood has restricted implementation of testing at the point-of-care. Optimization of existing rapid tests in whole blood will require significant effort in the short-term and there is a need for solutions to help bridge the gap in performance between plasma and whole blood. We demonstrate here the implementation of the H.E.R.M.E.S platform, a portable plasma separation system that can enhance the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing, with a commercially available SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in a blinded study with 61 human samples. We compare the performance of the RDT in whole blood and separated plasma and highlight that plasma yields a 39% increase in positivity agreement with PCR in samples collected from patients with early infections. We further legitimize the increase in positivity agreement rate with the help of an independent evaluation by 10 previously untrained users. The H.E.R.M.E.S plasma separation system circumvents the need for assay optimization in whole blood and furthers the legitimacy of incorporating SARS-COV-2 serology RDTs at the point-of-care. The data highlighted in this work makes a compelling case for the incorporation of the H.E.R.M.E.S system in large scale efforts to perform SARS-COV-2 serology testing in decentralized testing environments.","Vemulapati, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.20199083; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20199083v1?rss=1,44

Thus, this sector requires a system for evaluation and performance improvement. This study aimed to develop quality indicators to measure PEC for RTIs. METHODS: Following the related literature review, 14 experts were interviewed through semi-structured interviews to identify Quality Measurement Indicators (QMIs). The extracted indicators were then categorized into three domains: structure, performance, and management. Finally, the identified QMIs were confirmed through two rounds of the Delphi technique. RESULTS: Using literature review 11 structural, 13 performance, and four managerial indicators (A total of 28 indicators) were identified. Also, four structural, four performance, and three managerial indicators (A total of 11indicators) were extracted from interviews with experts. Two indicators were excluded after two rounds of Delphi’s technics. Finally, 14 structural, 16 performance and, seven managerial indicators (A total of 37indicators) were finalized. CONCLUSION: Due to the importance and high proportion of RTIs compared to other types of injuries, this study set out to design and evaluate the QMIs of PEC delivered for RTIs.

However, the transmission routes of the virus remain unclear, and thus, the current recommended control strategies are not evidence based. In this study, we investigated the transmission routes of MERS‐CoV during the first nosocomial outbreak in the Republic of Korea in May 2015 using a multi‐agent modeling framework. We identified seven hypothesized transmission modes based on the three main transmission routes (long‐range airborne, close contact, and fomite). The infection risks for each hypothesis were estimated using the multi‐agent modeling framework. Least‐squares fitting was conducted to compare the distribution of the predicted infection risk in the various scenarios with that of the reported attack rates and to identify the hypotheses with the best fit. In the scenarios in which the index patient was a super‐spreader, our model simulations suggested that MERS‐CoV probably spread via the long‐range airborne route. However, it is possible that the index patient shed an average viral load comparable to the loads reported in the literature, and that transmission occurred via a combined long‐range airborne and close contact route.","Xiao, S.; Li, Y.; Sung, M.; Wei, J.; Yang, Z.",Indoor Air,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28960494/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12430,44

To inform public health practice, the COVID-19-associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) quantified associations between race/ethnicity, census tract socioeconomic indicators, and COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates. METHODS: Using data from COVID-NET population-based surveillance reported during March 1–April 30, 2020 along with socioeconomic and denominator data from the US Census Bureau, we calculated COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates by racial/ethnic and census tract-level socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: Among 16,000 COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 34.8% occurred among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 36.3% among non-Hispanic Black (Black) persons, and 18.2% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. Age-adjusted COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate were 151.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 147.1–156.1) in census tracts with >15.2%–83.2% of persons living below the federal poverty level (high-poverty census tracts) and 75.5 (95% CI: 72.9–78.1) in census tracts with 0%–4.9% of persons living below the federal poverty level (low-poverty census tracts). Among White, Black, and Hispanic persons living in high-poverty census tracts, age-adjusted hospitalization rates were 120.3 (95% CI: 112.3–128.2), 252.2 (95% CI: 241.4–263.0), and 341.1 (95% CI: 317.3–365.0), respectively, compared with 58.2 (95% CI: 55.4–61.1), 304.0 (95%: 282.4–325.6), and 540.3 (95% CI: 477.0–603.6), respectively, in low-poverty census tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were highest in high-poverty census tracts, but rates among Black and Hispanic persons were high regardless of poverty level. Public health practitioners must ensure mitigation measures and vaccination campaigns address needs of racial/ethnic minority groups and people living in high-poverty census tracts.","Wortham, Jonathan M.; Meador, Seth A.; Hadler, James L.; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; See, Isaac; Whitaker, Michael; O’Halloran, Alissa; Milucky, Jennifer; Chai, Shua J.; Reingold, Arthur; Alden, Nisha B.; Kawasaki, Breanna; Anderson, Evan J.; Openo, Kyle P.; Weigel, Andrew; Monroe, Maya L.; Ryan, Patricia A.; Kim, Sue; Reeg, Libby; Lynfield, Ruth; McMahon, Melissa; Sosin, Daniel M.; Eisenberg, Nancy; Rowe, Adam; Barney, Grant; Bennett, Nancy M.; Bushey, Sophrena; Billing, Laurie M.; Shiltz, Jess; Sutton, Melissa; West, Nicole; Talbot, H.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe pneumonia, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes resulting in poor outcomes. Among the various consequences of severe COVID-19, cardiovascular (CV) collapse appears the most serious and potentially lethal. On the other hand, pre-existent CV comorbidities are also associated with higher mortality. The most reliable hypothetical pathogenetic mechanism for CV complications and cardiac injury in severe COVID-19 patients appears to be a sustained endothelial dysfunction, caused by the interplay of inflammation and coagulation. In this review, we survey papers addressing issues related to severe COVID-19, characterized by enhanced lung microvascular loss, hypercytokinemia, hypoxemia and thrombosis. We discuss about how the virus-induced downregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, used to enter the host cell, could affect the renin-angiotensin system, attempting to clarify the doubts about the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin-II receptor blockers in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we point out how the delicate and physiological homeostatic function of the endothelium, which turns into a disastrous battlefield of the complex interaction between “cytokine and coagulative storms”, can be irreparably compromised and result in systemic inflammatory complications.","Del Turco, Serena; Vianello, Annamaria; Ragusa, Rosetta; Caselli, Chiara; Basta, Giuseppina",Thromb Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384820304886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871306/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384820304886?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.08.039,44

However, particularly in the case of delivery devices, the term “system”, which by definition implies a profound knowledge of each single part and their interactions, is not always fully justified when using the DDS term. Within this context, dry powder inhalers (DPIs), as systems to deliver drugs via inhalation to the lungs, require a deep understanding of the complex formulation–device–patient interplay. As of now and despite the progress made in particle engineering and devices design, DPIs’ clinical performance is limited by variable patients’ breathing patterns. To circumvent this pitfall, next-generation DPIs should ideally adapt to the different respiratory capacity of individuals across age, health conditions, and other related factors. In this context, the recent wave of digitalization in the health care and industrial sectors may drive DPI technology towards addressing a personalized device–formulation–patient liaison.

Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period. The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. RESULTS: Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. CONCLUSION: These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.","Lavenne-Collot, N.; Ailliot, P.; Badic, S.; Favé, A.; François, G.; Saint-André, S.; Thierry, A.; Bronsard, G.",Neuropsychiatr Enfance Adolesc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727757/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0222961721000477; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0222961721000477,44

686603,Production of Mycophenolic Acid by a Newly Isolated Indigenous Penicillium glabrum,2021-05-21,"SARS-CoV-2 has claimed 2,137,908 lives in more than a year. Some COVID-19 patients experience sudden and rapid deterioration with the onset of fatal cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which have increased interest in CSS’s mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy. Although the prototypic concept of CSS was first proposed 116 years ago, we have only begun to study and understand CSS for less than 30 years. Actually, diseases under CSS umbrella include familial/primary and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and cytokine storm (CS). Hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases that cause CSS are named malignancy-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (MAHS) and MAS, respectively. In-depth research on the pathogenesis of HLH/CSS has greatly increased the number of patients that were able to be definitively diagnosed with HLH/CSS. However, it should be emphasized that HLH/CSS diagnosis is difficult at the early stages due to the non-specific clinical signs and symptoms, which tends to result in missed and incorrect diagnoses. Therefore, clinicians should not only possess extensive clinical experience to ensure high sensitivity to the characteristics of HLH/CSS but must also be familiar with HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods. The paper concisely comment evolution of CSS classifications, cytokines associated with CSS, evolution of CSS diagnostic criteria and importance of the correct identification of hemophagocytes in diagnosing CSS, which is timely and may benefit clinicians familiar HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods. In addition, clinicians must also understand that there are some limitations to these diagnostic criteria.

688363,Retrovirus Evolution,2008-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory diseases are major health concerns in the pig production sector worldwide, contributing adversely to morbidity and mortality. Over the past years there was a rise in reported incidents of respiratory disease in pigs in Norway, despite population wide freedom from Aujeszky´s disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine respiratory corona virus and enzootic pneumonia. The main objective of this study was to investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in conventional Norwegian fattening pig herds. The study included 14 herds. In seven herds with reported outbreaks of acute respiratory disease, data on clinical signs was recorded and samples for laboratory examination were collected. Diagnostic protocols were compared by parallel analysis of clinically healthy pigs from seven non-outbreak herds. RESULTS: The most commonly reported clinical signs were sudden deaths and dyspnea. An average compartment morbidity of 60%, mortality of 4% and case fatality of 9% was recorded in the outbreak herds. Post-mortem examinations revealed acute lesions resembling porcine pleuropneumonia in all 28 pigs investigated from the outbreak herds and in 2 of the 24 (8%) pigs from the non-outbreak herds. Chronic lesions were recorded in another 2 pigs (8%) from the non-outbreak herds. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was isolated from lungs and/or pleura from all tested pigs (n = 28) in the outbreak herds, and from 2 out of 24 pigs (8%) in the non-outbreak herds, one pig with an acute and another pig with a chronic infection. No other significant bacterial findings were made. Seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies was detectable in all outbreak herds analyzed and in six out of seven non-outbreak herds, but the risk ratio for seroconversion of individual pigs was higher (risk ratio 2.3 [1.50- 3.43 95% CI; P < 0.001]) in the outbreak herds. All herds tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and negative for influenza A viruses on oral fluid RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The main etiological pathogen found during acute outbreaks of respiratory disease was A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8. All pigs from outbreak herds had typical lesions of acute porcine pleuropneumonia, and only A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was identified. Co-infections were not found to impact disease development.","Cohen, Liza Miriam; Grøntvedt, Carl Andreas; Klem, Thea B.; Gulliksen, Stine Margrethe; Ranheim, Birgit; Nielsen, Jens Peter; Valheim, Mette; Kielland, Camilla",Acta Vet Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580726/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-020-00529-z,44

Methods: Electronic database records of 400 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed and the initial levels of CRP, albumin, fibrinogen values were recorded. The ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations were evaluated on thorax CT. Hospital mortality and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer were determined as adverse outcomes. Results: It was determined that 345 patients (86.25%) were discharged while 31 patients (7.75%) were transferred to ICU in addition to 24 patients who died (6%). The rates of deaths and transfers to ICU were significantly increased in GPS 2 group compared to both GPS 0 and 1 groups. Additionally, increased FAR was observed in patients who died and transferred to ICU compared to the discharged patients. The FAR was significantly increased in patients with diffuse GGO. Logistic regression analysis indicated that FAR ≥144.59 and the presence of GPS 2 were independent predictors of the adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the GPS and FAR could possess a predictive value for adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Kuluöztürk, Mutlu; Deveci, Figen; Turgut, Teyfik; Öner, Önsel",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1923483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905286/,44

The total prevalence of PToV was 45% (9 out of 20 farms); it was the first detection of PToV in China, and also the study analyzed the phylogenetic relationships between the Chinese PToV and PToV reference strains as well as other representative toroviruses. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of genetic diversity among geographically separated PToV. Statistical analysis of the PToV positive rate as well as a survey for other enteric pathogens in diarrheic pigs suggests that PToV may play a role as a causative agent of severe diarrhea in piglets.","Zhou, Yuancheng; Chen, Lei; Zhu, Ling; Xu, Zhiwen",ScientificWorldJournal,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/984282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459455/,44
689831,Innate Immunology of Bovine Respiratory Disease,2010-07-01,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on patronage to unhealthy eating establishments in populations with obesity. METHODS: Anonymized movement data accounting for roughly 10% of devices in the United States at 138,989 unhealthy eating locations from December 1(st) 2019 through April 2020 and the percentage of adults with obesity, the poverty rate, and the food environment index in 65% of United States counties were collected and merged. A cluster corrected Poisson spline regression was performed predicting patronage by day, the percentage of adults with obesity in the establishment’s county, the county’s poverty rate, and its food environment index, as well as their interactions. RESULTS: Patronage to unhealthy eating establishments was higher where there was a higher percentage of the adult population with obesity. A similar pattern was observed for counties with a lower food environment index. These disparities appear to have increased as the COVID‐19 pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest unhealthy eating patterns during the COVID‐19 pandemic are higher in already at‐risk populations. Policy makers can use these findings to motivate interventions and programs aimed at increasing healthy food intake in at‐risk communities during crises.","Ashby, Nathaniel J.S.",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589788/; https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22940,44
